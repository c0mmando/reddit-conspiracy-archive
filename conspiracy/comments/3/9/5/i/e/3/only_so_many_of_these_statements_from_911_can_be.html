<p>&quot;When we got to about 50 ft from the South Tower, we heard the most eerie sound that you would ever hear. A high-pitched noise and a popping noise made everyone stop. We all looked up. At the point, it all let go. The way I see it, it had to be the rivets. The building let go, there was an explosion and the whole top leaned toward us and started coming down.
&quot;I stood there for a second in total awe, and then said, ‘What the F_____?’ I honestly thought it was Hollywood.&quot; - CEE News (02/13/02)</p>

<p>&quot;We were the first ones in the second tower after the plane struck. I was taking firefighters up in the elevator to the 24th floor to get in position to evacuate workers. On the last trip up a bomb went off. We think there was bombs set in the building. I had just asked another firefighter to stay with me, which was a good thing because we were trapped inside the elevator and he had the tools to get out.&quot; - People (09/12/01) [Wayback Machine]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I went outside to see what I could do, when I saw the second building of the World Trade Center, still unbeknown to me the first one had collapse.
Somewhere around the middle of the World Trade Center there was this orange and red flash coming out.  Initially it was just one flash.  Then this flash just kept popping all the way around the building and that building had started to explode.  The popping sound, and with each popping sound it was initially an orange and then red flash came out of the building and then it would just go all around the building on both sides as far as could see.  These popping sounds and the explosions were getting bigger, going both up and down and then all around the building.
I went inside and I told everybody that the other building or there was an explosion occurring up there and I said I think we have another major explosion.
So here these explosions are getting bigger and louder and bigger and louder and I told everybody if this building totally explodes, still unaware that the other building had collapsed, I&#39;m going in the water.&quot; - SF Gate (11/07/01)</p>

<p>Tom Elliott, Aon Corp.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Tom Elliott was at work in his office at the Aon Corp., an insurance brokerage firm, on the 103rd floor of the World Trade Center&#39;s other, south tower. Most Aon employees did not straggle in until 9 a.m., but he liked to arrive around 8:30 and have a quiet cup of coffee while he checked his e-mail.
He was just typing in a response when a bright flash of light startled him, and a rumble shook the structure. Flames appeared to be crawling up the outside of the building, along with dark smoke and debris, burning paper and ash.
Mr. Elliott could feel heat coming through the windows. As far as he knew, it was his building, not the other tower, that was aflame. Oddly, no alarms were going off. The building emergency system was broadcasting no warning.
Then, as they reached the 70th floor, they heard an announcement: The building was secure. No one needed to evacuate.
They had descended three more floors when United Airlines Flight 175 slammed into their own south tower like an arrow from a giant crossbow. It was 9:03 a.m.
Although its spectacularly televised impact was above Elliott, at first he and those around him thought an explosion had come from below. An incredible noise - he calls it an &quot;exploding sound&quot; - shook the building, and a tornado of hot air and smoke and ceiling tiles and bits of drywall came flying up the stairwell.
As they descended, a few other survivors stumbled into the corridor. A construction painter, his white T-shirt covered in blood, was helped downstairs by others. But the stairwell was still far from jammed with evacuees.
Elliott assumed his was one of the final groups descending. They saw only two firemen going up. They told them there had been an explosion near the 60th floor.&quot; - CS Monitor, A Changed World Part 1: The Attack (09/17/01)</p>

<p>Stephen Gregory, Commissioner, Bureau of Communications</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Q. Do you recall at any time, particularly when you were on West Street, any companies whose vehicles may have been parked near where you were?
A. No. I know I was with an officer from Ladder 146, a Lieutenant Evangelista, who ultimately called me up a couple of days later just to find out how I was. We both for whatever reason -- again, I don&#39;t know how valid this is with everything that was going on at that particular point in time, but for some reason I thought that when I looked in the direction of the Trade Center before it came down, before No. 2 came down, that I saw low-level flashes. In my conversation with Lieutenant Evangelista, never mentioning this to him, he questioned me and asked me if I saw low-level flashes in front of the building, and I agreed with him because I thought -- at that time I didn&#39;t know what it was. I mean, it could have been as a result of the building collapsing, things exploding, but I saw a flash flash flash and then it looked like the building came down.
Q. Was that on the lower level of the building or up where the fire was?
A. No, the lower level of the building. You know like when they demolish a building, how when they blow up a building, when it falls down? That&#39;s what I thought I saw. And I didn&#39;t broach the topic to him, but he asked me. He said I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m crazy, but I just wanted to ask you because you were standing right next to me. He said did you see anything by the building? And I said what do you mean by see anything? He said did you see any flashes? I said, yes, well, I thought it was just me. He said no, I saw them, too.
I don&#39;t know if that means anything. I mean, I equate it to the building cowing down and pushing things down, it could have been electrical explosions, it could have been whatever. But it&#39;s just strange that two people sort of say the same thing and neither one of us talked to each other about it. I mean, I don&#39;t know this guy from a hole in the wall. I was just standing next to him. I never met the man before in my life. He knew who was I guess by my name on my coat and he called me up, you know, how are you doing? How&#39;s everything? And, oh, by the way did you... It was just a little strange.
Q. On the television pictures it appeared as well, before the first collapse, that there was an explosion up on the upper floors.
A. I know about the explosion on the upper floors. This was like eye level. I didn&#39;t have to go like this. Because I was looking this way. I&#39;m not going to say it was on the first floor or the second floor, but somewhere in that area I saw to me what appeared to be flashes. I don&#39;t know how far down this was already. I mean, we had heard the noise but, you know, I don&#39;t know.&quot; - NY Times (08/12/05)</p>

<p>Teresa Veliz, facilities manager - Teresa Veliz, the facilities manager for a software development company, was on the 47th floor of the North Tower when Flight 11 hit. First, like many witnesses, she describes the building shaking twice:</p>

<p>&quot;I got off [the elevator], turned the corner and opened the door to the ladies&#39; room. I said good morning to a lady sitting at a mirror when the whole building shook. I thought it was an earthquake. Then I heard those banging noises on the other side of the wall. It sounded like someone had cut the elevator cables. It just fell and fell and fell.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I began to cry. &quot;Oh, my God, I just got off that elevator!&quot; I said. &quot;That could have been me.&quot; I prayed those other people had gotten off on the 48th floor before the elevator dropped. But I didn&#39;t have much time to be upset because the building shook again, this time even more violently. The lady at the mirror grabbed onto me and held on for dear life.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Veliz went down a staircase with a coworker to the concourse level. In the mall, they got onto an up-escalator as the South Tower collapsed, causing a rush of wind which knocked them down. In the pitch black, Veliz and her coworker followed someone carrying a flashlight:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The flashlight led us into Borders bookstore, up an escalator and out to Church Street. There were explosions going off everywhere. I was convinced that there were bombs planted all over the place and someone was sitting at a control panel pushing detonator buttons. I was afraid to go down Church Street toward Broadway, but I had to do it. I ended up on Vesey Street. There was another explosion. And another. I didn&#39;t know where to run.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/YmynBCH.jpg">The tilting of the south tower,</a> just before collapse.</p>

<p>According to Sir Isaac Newton’s law of the conservation of momentum, it should have kept tipping over, but it didn&#39;t, it fell through the path of greatest resistance. The top was tilting at approximately 20 degrees or so, how could it be exerting a uniform, symmetrical pressure on the floors below? it didn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nhsn9w9Vg">Watch a compilation of the collapse</a> what you are observing is approximately 30 upper floors begin to rotate as a block, to the south and east.They begin to topple over, not fall straight down.The torque due to gravity on this block is enormous, as is its angular momentum. But then  this block turned mostly to powder in mid-air! How can we understand this strange behavior, without explosives?</p>

<p>[Video evidence also shows that the lower sections of the Towers do not even begin to start collapsing until the upper sections are completely destroyed]([Imgur](<a href="http://i.imgur.com/Ag88tNY.jpg%5C)">http://i.imgur.com/Ag88tNY.jpg\)</a>) This is an impossibility if we are to believe the official reports </p>

<hr/>

<p>NIST&#39;s global collapse theory, in regards the complete collapse of two 110 story skyscrapers violates Newton&#39;s laws of motion.</p>

<p>It is scientifically impossible and completely illogical that these two buildings, which had an upper block exerting a force of only 36% of its static weight, could crush the larger, stronger, undamaged lower section of the building
to the ground, when the building, at any level, was designed to support several times the weight above
it,  while it maintains its downward acceleration. </p>

<p>The persistent acceleration of the top section of the building is
direct evidence that some other source of energy was used to remove the structure below it, </p>

<p>Videos show that the section of the building above the plane impact point was the first section to disintegrate</p>

<hr/>

<p>For the Twin Towers (WTC1/2), NIST examined only the period BEFORE the actual destructions began but nevertheless concluded that there was </p>

<blockquote>
<p>no corroborating evidence ... for controlled demolition using explosives - NIST NCSTAR 1 report, pages xxxvii and xxxviii</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This approach ignored the fact that most evidence of controlled demolition appears only after a demolition begins</p>

<hr/>

<p>NIST never attempted to explain the physical evidence of the building destructions such as what caused four ton
perimeter columns and other debris to be ejected horizontally in all directions from the “collapsing” Towers at speeds of up to 70 mph, or why column sections weighing many tons were stuck in buildings hundreds of meters  from the Towers as in the following pictures</p>

<hr/>

<p>NIST’s study...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>does not actually include the structural behavior of the tower after the conditions for collapse
initiation were reached and collapse became inevitable  - NIST NCSTAR 1 report, page 82, footnote 13</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NIST’s model did not proceed past the point where initiation of collapse was asserted to be imminent and therefore did not cover the actual collapse. The collapse was clearly the crucial portion of the investigation. This omission was in defiance of the stated objective to determine</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why and how WTC1 and WTC2 collapsed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NIST claims that a floor sagging downward pulled in exterior columns initiating the collapse. NIST provides no theory whereby a sagging floor or buckling columns on one side could lead to the observed completely vertical descent. There is no explanation for the crushing and pulverization of the undamaged, stronger, much larger portion of the building underneath at about two-thirds of free-fall acceleration, no explanation of how the upper portion disintegrated in midair and no explanation for the horizontal ejection of a large fraction of the building structure</p>

<p>NIST’s 10,000 pages of NCSTAR reports clearly lack the most essential theory needed to substantiate a gravity-
driven collapse. NIST’s WTC1/2 computer model also appear to be fabricated, and there is no way to judge the model without independent scrutiny. NIST’s failure to follow the NFPA code and test for explosives and omission of key evidence for controlled demolition is falsification since it concerns highly relevant data that was excluded. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams, so why was there molten metal at the WTC collapse sites?</p>

<p>NIST claims that WTC 1&amp;2 collapsed due to jet fueled fires (just normal offices fires for WTC7) which were not hot enough to produce molten steel or iron, but also claim that if there had been molten steel or iron in the debris afterwards, it would have been irrelevant to the cause of the collapses. The evidence of molten steel or iron cannot be called “irrelevant,” given the fact that the building fires, as NIST pointed out, cannot explain it.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf">Early in 2002, Barnett and two WPI colleagues published an analysis of a section of steel from one of the Twin Towers, along with sections from WTC 7, as an appendix to FEMA’s 2002 World Trade Center Building Performance Study</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html">Their discoveries were also reported in a WPI article entitled “The ‘Deep Mystery’ of Melted Steel,” which said:</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Steel – which has a melting point of 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit – may weaken and bend, but does not melt during an ordinary office fire. Yet metallurgical studies on WTC steel brought back to WPI reveal that a novel phenomenon – called a eutectic reaction – occurred at the surface, causing intergranular melting capable of turning a solid steel girder into Swiss cheese.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html">Stating that the New York Times called these findings “perhaps the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation,” the article added:</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>A one-inch column has been reduced to half-inch thickness. Its edges – which are curled like a paper scroll – have been thinned to almost razor sharpness. Gaping holes – some larger than a silver dollar – let light shine through a formerly solid steel flange. This Swiss cheese appearance shocked all of the fire-wise professors, who expected to see distortion and bending – but not holes.</p>

<p><strong>Testimony from Firefighters:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQyIN6OTMyY">New York Fire Department Captain Philip Ruvolo said: “You’d get down below and you’d see molten steel, molten steel, running down the channel rails, like you’re in a foundry, like lava.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fallenbrothers.com/community/showthread.php?2062-Recovery-worker-reflects-on-months-spent-at-Ground-Zero&amp;amp;p=2948">Joe O’Toole, a Bronx firefighter who worked on the rescue and cleanup efforts, reported that one beam lifted from deep below the surface months later, in February 2002, “was dripping from the molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_G21B2qiQM">New York firefighters recalled in the documentary film Collateral Damages, “heat so intense they encountered rivers of molten steel.”</a></li>

<p><strong>Testimony from Other Professionals:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjmHqES_lto&amp;amp;t=40s">Leslie Robertson, a member of the engineering firm that designed the World Trade Center, said 21 days after the attack: “When we were down at the B1 level, one of the firefighters said, ‘I think you’d be interested in this,’ and they pulled up a big block of concrete and there was a, like a little river of steel, flowing.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060909104247/http://www.seau.org/SEAUNews-2001-10.pdf">Ron Burger, a public health advisor at the National Center for Environmental Health who arrived at Ground Zero September 12, 2001, said: “Feeling the heat, seeing the molten steel, the layers upon layers of ash, like lava, it reminded me of Mt. St. Helen’s and the thousands who fled that disaster.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/Publications/Special/Welch.htm">In late fall 2001, Dr. Alison Geyh of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health reported: “Fires are still actively burning and the smoke is very intense. In some pockets now being uncovered, they are finding molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130730103131/http://911encyclopedia.com/wiki/index.php/Publication:20121014014812">Joe Allbaugh, the Director of FEMA, said in an October 2001 interview on CBS: “It’s just too hot for rescuers to get into [some] areas. So we do not know yet what’s in those areas, other than very hot, molten material.”</a></li>
<li>Dr. Keith Eaton reported in Structural Engineer: “They showed us many fascinating slides . . . ranging from molten metal which was still red hot weeks after the event, to 4-inch thick steel plates sheared and bent in the disaster.”</li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060818074723/http:/pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nydailynews/87451160.html?did=87451160&amp;amp;FMT=ABS&amp;amp;FMTS=FT&amp;amp;date=Nov+1,+2001&amp;amp;author=GREG+GITTRICH+DAILY+NEWS+STAFF+WRITER&amp;amp;pub=New+York+Daily+News&amp;amp;desc=FIRE+MAY+SMOLDER+FOR+MONTHS">Don Carson, a hazardous materials expert from the National Operating Engineers Union, said six weeks after 9/11: “There are pieces of steel being pulled out from as far as six stories underground that are still cherry red.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://imgur.com/CCqRzAo">OSHA respond to the underground fires and potential steam explosions</a><br/></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Underground fires burned at temperatures up to 2,000 degrees. As the
huge cranes pulled steel beams from the pile, safety experts worried about the
effects of the extreme heat on the crane rigging and the hazards of contact with the
hot steel. And they were concerned that applying water to cool the steel could cause
a steam explosion that would propel nearby objects with deadly force. Special
expertise was needed. <strong>OSHA called in Mohammad Ayub and Scott Jin, structural
engineers from its national office, to assess the situation. They recommended a
special handling procedure, including the use of specialized rigging and instruments.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://gcn.com/articles/2002/09/09/handheld-app-eased-recovery-tasks.aspx">Greg Fuchek, vice president of a company that supplied computer equipment used to identify human remains, reported that “sometimes when a worker would pull a steel beam from the wreckage, the end of the beam would be dripping molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/sasalum/newsltr/summer2002/k911.html">Sarah Atlas, of New Jersey’s Task Force One Urban Search and Rescue, arrived at Ground Zero on September 11 and reported that “fires burned and molten steel flowed in the pile of ruins still settling beneath her feet.”</a></li>
<li>Tom Arterburn, writing in Waste Age, reported that the New York Department of Sanitation removed “everything from molten steel beams to human remains</li>

<p>The fact that the rubble contained steel or iron that had been melted shows that the buildings were destroyed by something other than fire and airplane impact.</p>

<p>When all of this physical evidence is combined with the testimony about explosions from many types of professionals, the claim that the Twin Towers were brought down by nothing other than the airplane impacts and resulting fires is simply not credible</p>

<p>The controlled demolition theory is the only one that fits the evidence. Jet fuel doesn&#39;t weaken steel structures to the point of collapse. I feel like you haven&#39;t even entertained the evidence for controlled demolition.
