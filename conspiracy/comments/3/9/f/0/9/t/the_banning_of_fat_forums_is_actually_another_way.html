       Hiding all the fat subs is hiding all the damage that the toxic food is doing to our fellow humans! The site is pawning it off as if they are doing this to stop "fattism" or "thin privelage".  When "mods" or "censors" or TPTB are censoring the "fat subs" on reddit they are actually burying a bigger issue.
       <br/>
       <strong>
        The issue today is with the food supply!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <h2>
       which is now designed by scientists in labs, and by big-tobacco related actors. The food is being laden with GMOs, refined sugars, refined flour, heavy metal derivative dyes, and high fructose corn syrup.  A lot of the ingredients inhibit ghrelin hormone from reaching the brain telling the mind that the body has had enough food. Also a lot of these foods have been know to cause infertility and birth defects. It's very hard to lock in on huge public studies, because a lot of the scientists, and so-called higher learning institutions are threatened to lose funding if they publish anything.  All of these facts lead to one thing. Our modern so-called food supply is actually a form of soft kill eugenics to mold the populous into a globular round shape. It makes the population more tired, dependent on American "medicines" (which are the leading cause of death in the U.S) and it makes the citizens more docile. The more docile, and tired and reliant on their addictive food a population is, the less likely they will speak up or fight back. Heck, at the point of fatness, all their free time is either consumed with trying to lose the weight, or trying to get/make more food. In conclusion, all these points prove that the poisonous food situation we are in today is a method of control.
      </h2>
      <h2>
       <strong>
        The Solution:
       </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
       The solution to all this is to vote with your dollar.  Stop buying 98% of the "food" in your so-called grocery store. Start buying "whole" foods, non-gmo foods, and foods without preservatives. This is a start. Stop drinking soda (proven to cause cancer) and boycott any product that is made by a company that is also a major tobacco product producer. For instance Phillip and Morris tobacco makes all these foods
       <a href="http://archive.tobacco.org/Resources/00pmbrands.html">
        HERE
       </a>
       . The list is about 40 pages, but it's all food most of us eat everyday.
       <strong>
        Stop buying tobacco companies food, they are designing it like the tobacco products.
       </strong>
       It may seem like a monumental task, but once you stop eating these poisons you will feel better, lighter, and more clear headed, and if you stop feeding you kids this crap, they will behave more normal and it will increase their IQ. God bless and God speed... repost/share...
