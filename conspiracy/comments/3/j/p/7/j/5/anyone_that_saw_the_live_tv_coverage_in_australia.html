        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">28</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-09-05 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Darealstarman.html">Darealstarman</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am trying to talk to anyone who watched the live coverage in Australia on 9/11. I was watching SBS T.V and  the film about Ali, &quot;When we were kings&quot; was about to start, when we were interrupted by events going on in New York.  We were shown live pictures and just after the second plane stuck, we were shown a short clip of the second plane amongst the many other images shown live. It showed the second plane moments before impact and was only shown on T.V once. I have tried to find this footage everywhere and cannot find it anywhere. Not on the net, or documentary or anything available anywhere and I have searched hard and long and cannot find what I saw on live T.V. I actually joined Reddit to ask the people this question months ago and still no one has been able to confirm they saw it as well. So I guess my best bet is to ask the people of Australia. It was of the second plane approx 5 seconds before hitting the tower, taken from street level or on top of a small building and does NOT show the actual impact and was the best view of the plane by far that I have seen, showing all details of it and of excellent close up quality. So close that the entire plane is not on screen the whole time as the camera was zoomed in so close. It is only a couple of seconds of footage. The plane was flying from left to right of screen before being obscured by other buildings and it was as clear as watching a high definition football game. You could see the planes details very clearly and I mean as if you were standing next to it. This fact alone, is very suspicious to me and is the only proof I need that something is wrong. Why isn&#39;t this footage used on every show about 9/11? It is by far the best quality shot of the second plane. I am certain that this footage was not shown on American T.V, as it would have been saved and used. The other strange thing about it is that this footage was only shown once. I remember talking to a friend on the phone immediately after the second strike and described the footage I had just seen. I described the plane as a cargo style plane with a large, long, tube like structure running underneath the main body. It was a very strange looking add-on that you could not miss seeing and looked totally out of place. Until someone in Australia or elsewhere confirms they saw it too, I will remain the only person I know of that can say they saw it. Or remember seeing it. It is very frustrating to be in my shoes and have no-one to confirm this and to be honest, I am a little worried even mentioning it. I would appreciate any advise on how to get this ball rolling in exposing the cover up and the fact I have let this go for so long is not helping my cause. Any feedback welcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is what I can&#39;t believe. That it isn&#39;t everywhere but surely someone recorded the live events. I was watching SBS to start with but could have a flicked through a few others. I watched it in Newcastle city live. Not the morning news some 7 hours later. Is it possible that a TV station could have it erased from archives? I appreciate your confidence in me and I will take your advise on posting elsewhere. I made this post after responding to someone else who just posted an article about missing footage of 9/11 and am getting some good feedback on there but not the footage I saw yet. Also some people who have responded to me on that post are not showing in the comments. I have not been able to upvote/downvote them and they have made some good contributions to the post. Are they shadow banned or something?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m hopeful someone has recorded live TV in OZ and it may show up but yes, I have struggled with this idea that it has not been the main picture of that plane shown everywhere. Maybe someone has it and doesn&#39;t realise what exactly it means so I have made a post on <a href="/r/australia">/r/australia</a> for anyone who recorded live. Also strange that rolls of film were taken off people at Daley Plaza never to be returned but that&#39;s another story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If somebody has anything like that I&#39;d tell them to be pretty careful about admitting it, especially in such a public forum. There are ways to make light of such things, but an internet forum not seen by most probably isn&#39;t a good place to start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are probably right. My guess is that it was a film crew from outside of USA that captured it and beamed it back home and was used briefly on Oz TV. If it does get posted, I will rejoice in knowing I played my part in finding the truth. The time period was from between the first strike and up to half an hour or so after the second. I can clearly recall the image even now and described it to a friend on the phone shortly after the second impact. I talked at length about how strange the cylindrical object looked. There has to be others out there that saw this as well, and can remember it. This has haunted me for many years now and I personally don&#39;t fear the overlords because this is something that has meaning to me. Cheers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was initially watching SBS but could have switched to a few others so I&#39;m not sure what channel. It has to be somewhere, but how weird is it that it is not the on the net or on any documentary or film? Good suggestion but I&#39;m hoping someone recorded on their T.V.  Is it possible that the T.V station had this footage erased?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s possible, seeing as it was only aired once in a country not directly impacted, that no one recorded it.</p>

<p>To answer your second question, you might be able to find that out if you first ask the news station if they have archived footage from some arbitrary day before and after 9/11. If they have both and none from 9/11 it shows they memory hole&#39;d it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not Australian, but I was a freshman in high school and we were watching it live. We saw the second plane hit live also. I&#39;m pretty sure there is footage out there. I also remember it being footage from the top of a small building.</p>

<p>I distinctively remember it hitting live because my teacher thought the first may be an accident, but after the second hit, his attitude started preparing us for possible war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your effort but I&#39;m sure it is not on any documentary I have seen and I think I have watched them all. My hope is someone recording off their TV as it was happening live. It wasn&#39;t even included on the morning news in OZ some 7-8 hours later on the main news channel because someone just posted a recording from their T.V on another post where I just asked the question. The post that got me to make mine was titled &quot;Missing footage of 9/11&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you have a bit of a problem here. Most of the other channels stuck to one or two feeds from their US affiliates, so Seven broadcast NBC, ABC had BBC, I think Nine had ABC and Ten had CNN. Something like that. SBS, on the other hand, has at least six hours of foreign language news programmes on their daily schedule. I&#39;m not sure, but I would guess that that would have included al Jazeera. SBS also has contracts with PBS in the US and CBC in Canada. Your problem is, that of all the networks in Australia SBS is the one that has the most diverse pool of resources to draw on. They could easily have been running vision from a German station with local commentary. Then again, theyy could also have been using SKY.</p>
