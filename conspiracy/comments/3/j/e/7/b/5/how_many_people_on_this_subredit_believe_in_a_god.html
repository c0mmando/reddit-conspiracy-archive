       I'm constantly seeing people bash anyone when the idea of any type of god comes up. So does this mean that the majority of the people in this subredit have no ties or beliefs with any god? Im curious to know what you guys believe in, if anything at all.

       There could possibly be a creating force that organizes energy flow and structure  but I'm pretty sure that no church has ever correctly conceived of its  true nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Creating and supporting  an imaginary  supernatural friend without solid evidence and then referring  to that lack of evidence as 'faith'   seems like the  result of  shared mental weakness.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a natural reaction to powerlessness and  the inability to predict  or influence the future  and a wish to be more able to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Organized religion  has always been  a spectacularly negative influence on mankind overall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if it was not, religion is certainly used by the usual sociopathic leaders to defraud their followers of money and to corruptly abuse the power the religious construct gives them.

       I for one can't. To even attempt to define the divine attributes human concepts to it and therefore makes it no longer divine.

       Yeah. 0=1 also, and 1.999(repeating) also equals 2. Math is weird sometimes.

       Zero unfolds to one. One holds within it the duality of gender and becomes two. 0=2. I think it is a gnostic belief originally.

       I think there's a concerted effort to destroy peoples belief in a god or higher power. Holy texts have been distorted and/or totally misinterpreted throughout history. For example people today assume the figures/events written about in holy texts were real and happened verbatim.

      <p>
       They were most likely allegorical devices used to help explain complex concepts to people - like the inner workings of our brain/being/psyche. It's hard enough that there's numerology and other meanings hidden within the text - throw people thinking they were real people and real events into the mix and you can't begin to understand what's trying to be conveyed. Numbers, syllables, sounds, etc. used to be really important to people - for example the number 12 is used in almost every major religion as a divine number. Most people today don't know that or why it was even considered divine or it's significance when they say 12 disciples/Imam/stations of life/gods in Olympus/tribes of Israel/months in the year/segments in the sky.
      </p>

       Our governments control a large part of the education system from lower to higher education. Everything we hold to be true could all be a bunch of propaganda and lies. We have such certainty about certain "facts" taught to us in school but a lot of what is learned has to be taken on faith - just like religion. We just repeat what we're told and assume it's all correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not taught the Trivium (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivium">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivium
       </a>
       ) and Qaudrivium (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrivium">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrivium
       </a>
       ) in school anymore - because they wanted obedient factory workers that can't critically think for themselves. Understanding numbers, numbers in space, numbers in time, etc. all open your mind to understanding nature and the rules on which our reality are formed. It's order and/in chaos pushing and pulling each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you start to see those relationships to number/order/chaos all around us it's hard not to believe in some kind of intelligent being at least setting things in motion - if not a personal god that gets involved in your life.

       It's hard to believe in something that's not 'real', for me anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see enough evidence that I should believe in a 'god'. I have good morals and I believe that some people need religion/god in order to be told what to do/not to do and how to live their life, but I don't need that belief system. There's more evidence of ETs than there is of some 'Grand Creator'. (Yes there could be a link between 'god' and ETs)

       If there is a god, he would think that most of you churchies are assholes. Especially

       In the first case; we all have terminal illnesses, don't we?  In the second case emergency contraception is typical as part of rape kits administered when reporting the assault. The danger for allowing abortion after rape is the potential for increased false rape claims.
 Presumably if a rape is the reported genesis of the pregnancy, a report would be filed against the alleged perpetrator. I don't believe a woman should be forced to carry to term the child of a rapist. But as I said, emergency contraception is readily available.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would also be important to rigidly define rape. In the days of eye rape and fart rape and ex post facto revocation of consent, rape is nebulous. Generally if you're a bar whore who accepts seed after 3 LIITs you should be on birth control in the first place. You can't show up after a missed period and say 'I was raped' that just isn't good enough, for the reasons already explained.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of a minor child who was molested and conceived without consent, sure.

       It's really just a counter to the insanity of unabated freedom and unchecked debauchery. Furries and faggots don't build civilizations, they destroy them. Nobody has the balls to draw Muhammad but they'll cast rubber crucifix dildoes. Why? Because Islamists will fucking murder you and Christians will be like 'turn the other cheek'. Christians have gone soft, particularly with respect to holding conservative politicians to task and slaughtering heretics.

       I think religions divide in 2 groups: religions about ideas and religions about stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of the purpose which i may not know, the first type does actually talk about important things and tries to create a framework of beliefs that helps the individual and society to cooperate, to frame important or painful events in a way that minimizes ind/social enthropy, and to develop positive qualities in general.
Stories are present but are actually trying to help in explaining points. I believe those religions can be a very good thing to have expecially when society is a mess, and even without. See buddhism, it didn't need a god to be a religion. It was just a human spiritual guide who didn't talk at all about gods or aliens or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second type is more a falsification of the first and hides the purpose of religion. It dulls the minds and makes a clown out of the truth. It usually derives from misinterpretations of old religions ( like the bibles, where the messages got lost in the grand delusion and became her fighting stallions )
      </p>
      <p>
       This type also comprehends the most shallow and money-oriented like scientology. Church in its bastardization and dumbing down of the messages of the bible could be another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today we are made to hate religion for the toxic lies made by those who found a business in it rich. The subject though is human spirit and destiny at large and i think that a society that skip this point easily falls into materialism and degeneration. Condition to be classified "religion" has always been that glue ( an all-encompassing framework, wrong or right or even better, harmful or useful )
      </p>
      <p>
       I think secularism breeds trash culture. Values have been lost like Nietzsche said, but the new popular ones are mostly shallow and devoid of any spiritual value. Those can only be found in the greaters framework than the one presented actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read the Tao The ching or the teachings of buddha you will find no superstitions, just a hard try to make the big truths ( obviously there are limits and errors in their formulations, but there is substance ) out in the streets. ( Tao The Ching is probably the most down-to-earth book of all times in regards to the spirit. )
      </p>
      <p>
       Without the worshipping part it really comes down to big philosophy. Obviously big religions will never tell, because they only discuss the lies and so would been made the bad ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       God is another word for the metaphysic matrix that we can feel in our lives, just framed as a subject. Remove the subject though, and then it's just synonim for that.

       For me, God represents what ever started the Big Bang. That whole singularity. I do not believe in a deity, or life after death or any Heaven and Hell concepts. My faith is in Science and Technology. My Devils are those whose greed prevents us from using our resources to ensure every person can live and flourish in a peaceful, prosperous world.
