    <div class="md"><p>Ok, but whether or not that is true, it is a poor approach to take when discussing the topic. &quot;don&#39;t talk about that, it just exists to discredit&quot; does nothing to address the actual subject.

<p>If you want to convince someone that the flat earth model is incorrect, give them a logical argument against it like I did in that post.</p>

<p>Of course there is disinfo out there.  Massive amounts of it and varying levels of it.  The way to avoid being smeared by association is to point out that there is no association.  I don&#39;t consent to allow anyone to speak for me.  Whenever anyone makes a statement like &quot;conspiracy theorists say&quot; I point out that they are setting up for a strawman argument.  Discussion on topics can&#39;t be allowed to be shut down by the threat of association smearing since that makes the threat itself an effective disinfo tool.</p>

Because a user responded to your very comment with a very poorly disguised shill accusation.

<p>I&#39;ll go one by one here:</p>

<p>1 - There is no rule saying anyone has to believe conspiracy theories. Some people like to discuss things with they don&#39;t believe in with people who do. Head on over to r/christianity and look at all the &quot;A&quot; flair. Most people deal with opposing opinions maturely and with respect, rather than accusing of them of being sent to attack them. But you are clearly unable to display this maturity.</p>

<p>2 - I have never done this, nor have I seen the users you have accused of being a shill do this. I imagine your intellectual insecurity extends to downvote totals as well as commenters, and you&#39;ve decided that any downvotes you receive must be some concerted effort to stop you?</p>

<p>3 - What exactly is it you think &quot;we&quot; &quot;do&quot; here. All I see is a couple users who happen to disagree with you. Why can&#39;t you accept that?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Except you are attacking other users and accusing of them of committing actions you cannot prove. You have literally no evidence that isn&#39;t fueled by your own inability to cope with people having different opinions than you. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the score? Let me throw a guess out: The (Insert relevant boogeyman here [Monsanto, Big Pharma, Gov&#39;t]) comes onto this internet forum and hangs out downvoting the newest posts that challenge their position and employ commenters like me who are paid to comment a few times a week and challenge your opinion? </p>

<p>The problem is, you don&#39;t possess any evidence of this, aside from the knowledge that &quot;shills exist&quot;. So you generally just apply it to anyone who happens to disagree with you in a transparently insecure attempt to shield yourself from opposing opinions. I know this because I know I am not a shill, yet I watch you accuse me and users who share similar positions to me on this forum on a regular basis. </p>

<p>In the colloquial sense, yes. Not in the scientific sense. Personally, because I am a respectful adult, I don&#39;t accuse people of being something when I have no evidence to suggest this. It is clear the mods agree with this to some extent, as rule 10 exists. Then again, given how poorly it is enforced, maybe they don&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So there is evidence that I am a shill, but you have no means of find it or reveal it. How do you even know its true then? </p>

<p>Maybe I accuse you of being someone who has sex with livestock. I don&#39;t have any evidence of this, because people who fuck horses generally try to hide the fact they fuck horses. Does that really mean my statement has any merit? Of course not, it makes it an ad hominem attack designed only to attack your character. That is why there is a rule against it. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Oh, I&#39;m not sure. But I recognize that, and because I possess the maturity and self-awareness to understand that I cannot accuse someone of doing something when I have no proof of it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a matter of fact, on numerous occasions, documentation has been presented here to show that many agencies do precisely that! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet no proof exists that it happens on this forum (that I know of), nor do you have any evidence to claim that any one user here is guilty of doing this. Therefore, even though it is established that shills exist, you have no reason to claim someone is a shill simply because they disagree with you.</p>

<p>Must be fun to lack the self-awareness to be embarassed by your disregard for evidence, and to somehow have protection from the moderators who seem to like to ignore their own rules.</p>

<p>I think most people who show up in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are anti-censorship, because of bad experiences with painful truth being silenced. So why the hell are we trying to invoke censorship on each other? At best, it&#39;s the same shortsighted shit as the pilgrims leaving an intolerant system, not for true freedom, but to set up an intolerant system of their own. At worst, though, it could be a more orchestrated campaign to erode credibility for people with dangerous ideas.</p>

<p>Letting ideas stand for themselves, and not on the backs of their authors, is probably the only way to immunize yourself against such attacks on the community. Which is not to say that you shouldn&#39;t make up your own mind if someone is full of shit, and therefore a more generally unreliable source of information.

<p>I don&#39;t blame the mods for wanting to use a light hand. This sub in particular is rightfully hypersensitive to censorship, and perhaps ironically, that&#39;s exactly how a shill-accuser would perceive it if their comment was deleted. Of course, in this (particular) case, we know it&#39;s not actually the result of an evil cabal, it&#39;s just a reaction to destructive behavior.</p>

<p>I wish there was a good way to mod-label comments with a reprimand, without actually censoring them. Not only does that not play into censorship sensitivity, it also acts as a teaching experience, and a demonstration of the mods doing their job, rather than simply disappearing into the quiet. Short of that, though, a delete and a reply reprimand is probably as good as we&#39;re gonna get with current reddit architecture.</p>

<p>Ya, I agree they are in a tough spot. I wouldn&#39;t want to be in the position.

<p>Mind you, judging by the username of the guy in question, I think he&#39;d wear it like a badge of honor. </p>

<p>Well, I think at a certain point, you would need to take stronger action against those who lack the self-awareness to be embarassed by their actions. </p>

<p>But I think the key to the method we have come to is that it improves discourse over time as user turnover occurs. The more new users that see a certain behaviour not being tolerated, the better the future becomes for the sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You implied I was dishonest then responded by saying this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You couldn&#39;t be honest if someone paid you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t think it&#39;s obvious what your intent was? Seriously? </p>

<p>But sure, let&#39;s say I give you the benefit of the doubt. You were still advocating dishonest behaviour with this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You know how certain people used to be referred to as &quot;a friend of Dorothy&#39;s&quot; in polite company? Well, we in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> could simply use the expression &quot;a friend of Rockran&#39;s&quot; to bypass Rule 10.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are proposing that you use a poorly disguised euphemism to hide your accusations of shilling to evade being punished. So there, two levels of dishonesty no less! </p>

<p>Now, can you stop stalling and either explain why you think I am being dishonest as you accused me, or admit you made it up with no justification?</p>
