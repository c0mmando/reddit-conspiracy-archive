       As posted on
       <a href="http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/aerospace/2015-09-01/tcas-ads-b-unreliable-east-coast-during-september">
        Aviation International News
       </a>
       and the
       <a href="https://www.nbaa.org/ops/airspace/regional/20150901-tcas-adsb-unreliable-in-southeast-united-states-beginning-september-2.php">
        National Business Aviation Association
       </a>
       , the Department of Defense suddenly informed the Federal Aviation Administration that a military exercise will make the TCAS and ADS-B surveillance systems unreliable on the East Coast (and up to 200 nautical miles offshore) for the
       <em>
        whole month of September
       </em>
       from one am EDT September 2nd until midnight EDT on October 1st.
      </p>
      <p>
       The TCAS is otherwise known as the traffic collision avoidance system. It does exactly what it sounds like it does: it helps pilots avoid mid-air collisions. ADS-B stands for Automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast, which Wikipedia describes as “a cooperative surveillance technology in which an aircraft determines its position via satellite navigation and periodically broadcasts it, enabling it to be tracked.”
      </p>
      <p>
       For these things to suddenly be unreliable sounds like a very bad thing, although the FAA has said this poses no safety risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       The smart ass over at
       <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/airlines/faa-anti-collision-systems-used-by-aircraft-unreliable-due-to-military/2244054">
        The Tampa Bay Times
       </a>
       reported that this gives pilots a chance to use their own “fail-safe tool” to detect aircraft, namely their eyeballs:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The FAA’s notice Tuesday reminded pilots of a fail-safe tool they can always use to detect other aircraft — their eyeballs.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Pilots are advised to maintain an increased visual awareness,” the FAA said.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Oh really? Their eyeballs? Cool. I’m no pilot, but let’s see how well that works with so many planes in the sky out in stormy weather with low visibility or on a cloudy night. Sounds great.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here’s the full warning explained via NBAA:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Pilots are advised that the traffic alert and TCAS may fail to establish tracks on nearby aircraft and may fail to receive traffic alerts (TA) or resolution advisories (RA). Operators should be aware that tracks may first appear within close proximity to their aircraft, and may immediately go into TA/RA status.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pilots are advised to maintain an increased visual awareness in this area. If operators believe that an aircraft should have triggered an alert, the incident should be reported to air traffic control as soon as possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is due to a late notice Department of Defense exercise, and NBAA has voiced its concern to the FAA that these sort of significant impact tests need much more notice to operators in the NAS.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The Tampa Bay Times reported this will be a Navy exercise in coastal waters. Interesting, considering that as Intellihub reported only a few days ago, a former Navy special warfare vet who now works for a government contractor just put out a
       <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/solicitation-for-role-players-confirms-dod-training-in-boston-on-heels-of-jade-helm-15_092015">
        call for crisis actors on Craigslist
       </a>
       for work in the Boston area on multiple dates throughout September.
      </p>
      <p>
       Others have wondered if this drill and warning has something to do with the
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErpSgWw-pAM">
        huge energy pulse seen over the Atlantic ocean on the same day the warning was issued
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Could something like that be responsible for knocking out these surveillance systems?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even with all the concern over Jade Helm, at least we were given a heads up. This drill is not only expansive and last minute, there’s hardly any info out there on it. No one really seems to know the specifics on what exactly the Navy is doing out in the Atlantic this month.
      </p>
      <p>
       With so many other things already happening in September, what are we to make of this new development?

       I'm a pilot. I replied in detail the last time this misinformation and scaremongering piece was posted here. While obviously not a good thing is hardly a disaster. Basically this means pilots will fly as they've flown for many decades. Keep in mind, many aircraft are still not even equipped with ads-b nor tcas. This requirement is currently optional. For many pilots this literally makes absolutely zero difference.

       Countries overseas that only require, say,
       <em>
        60 hours
       </em>
       to operate a 777 scare me in this scenario. These airlines don't want the aircraft "hand-flown" EVER because of the tens of millions of dollars they save on JetA when the FMS does the heavy lifting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we agree that this is a suspicious (to say the least) NOTAM? Yeah, I flew just fine before TCAS and ADS-B. Still, an inexperienced pilot that suddenly finds themselves in IMC is gonna be in trouble if these systems are "unreliable" and they are used to depending on them heavily.

       Your comments easily indicate you are not a pilot. Your same comments were provided in the previous discussion and continue to be nonsense then, as now. Your comment entirely ignores the existence of IRF procedures and this equipment is not a requirement for IFR; intentional or otherwise. This equipment is a luxury. Period. The fact you don't understand any of this makes your comment nonsense and strongly implies you are not a pilot.

       I actually am, though only a PPL with a complex endorsement. I do not have an ATP or anything like that, am not instrument rated, and have an expired medical so I CANNOT fly right now. When I can I pull a 172 around and sometimes a Centurion, old and ratty.

       If you were a pilot you would know tcas and ads-b have nothing to do with hand flown nor IFR nor inadvertent IMC. Likewise your idiotic comment about low hours have absolutely nothing to do with the topic and is not a factor in the current discussion. Likewise, if true, your aircraft likely didn't have this equipment and you know it's entirely optional and not IFR relevant; thusly completely invalidating your assessment. You are very likely not a pilot. If you are a pilot, you are trolling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally your post is incoherent buzzwords. Nothing more. This is why is painfully obvious you have no idea what your talking about and why it's unlikely you are a pilot.

       You go immediately on the offensive, and I cannot understand why. Did the previous poster say anything factually inaccurate? As far as I can tell, you have done nothing to respond to the point that there are inexperienced foreign pilots who have never flown without these "luxury" systems and consequentially may not be fully prepared to do without them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, there is always the pleasing irony of you dismissing the "paranoid delusions" of this community in one breath, and then in the next concluding that another poster is lying about their credentials based on the some incredibility flimsy information.

       Yes, he said plenty factually inaccurate. Which is why his post strongly implies he's not a pilot. But I said that already. As his comments have nothing to do with the topic, it's rightfully ignored. He added that garbage to confuse those who don't understand how thing work in aviation. It's one if the major clues he's not a pilot because a pilot would not add completely unrelated details which have literally nothing to do with the topic. It exists strictly to mislead the ignorant. At best he's trolling.

       In the other thread it was theorized that it's to prevent real-time tracking of VIPs arriving for events. But I have no idea. The fact that you hang your hat on this is pretty odd...as if someone would know for sure.

       I'm actually a little confused that it's posted here in a semi-serious (just check the URL...lol!) manner. It's a public announcement for safety. That's the opposite of a conspiracy.

       Paranoid delusions are why so many make fun of this group and specifically people like you. If you want to disagree, feel free to do so with evidence. Everything I posted is factually accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're really saying is, anyone who disagrees with your paranoid delusional view of the world is a shill. If that helps you sleep, so be it. But I'm still correct.

       Are you guys even aware that GPS outages also periodically occur, and that's a much more serious issue. Outage of nonessential, luxury equipment is hardly end times. Nor need it be a conspiracy.

       Here's a little news flash for you:  Nobody here cares if anybody is making fun of us.  Go ahead.  Nobody here posts for the acceptance of people like you.  We don't give a damn about people like you.  Especially someone who doesn't seem to understand the concept of a discussion forum for the purpose of entertaining thoughts and theories.  So take your "paranoid delusions" bullshit somewhere else.

       This means you are your own enemy. People here constantly moan that no one listens and that many make fun of people here. Yet, when you run around screaming paranoid delusions you lose the right to legitimately complain that you have no credibility and that no one listens. You are ultimately self defeating and do a huge disservice to the larger community when there is a legitimate topic.

       Paranoid delusions in that you believe anyone with a factually accurate yet contrary view can only be a shill. You and others like you are literally what's wrong with conspiracy and why this place is widely viewed as a joke. I'm a long time poster here and you'll find my history is entirely consistent with that of a pilot. Also have other family which are also pilots and a brother who is a military pilot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pointing out, no one has provided any evidence that anything I've stated is incorrect and the only contrary comments are delusional like yours or incoherent buzzword phrasing like the guy claiming to be a pilot. This entire post is text book why few respect conspiracy here.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we have facts offered which entirely invalidate the conspiracy versus incoherent ramblings and paranoid delusions. So obviously ramblings and delusions are what people prefer here. Obviously that makes me a shill. When your counter position is so weak, it more than likely means you're wrong, not that you're debating a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       This entire thread is literally face palm worthy. It's a very sad state of affairs.

       They shutdown the entire system for an entire month,  due to a military drill,  and you think this is completely normal?  I have a very good friend that is an air traffic controller in this region,  who is completely freaked out about this. He confirmed this has never happened before, and is cause for concern.

       1.) Anybody can learn what you said with a couple of google searches.

      <p>
       2.) You have no way to prove your own credentials.

      <p>
       3.) You continue to reply.
      </p>
      <p>
       4.) You post on a conspiracy forum only to denounce conspiracies, and then simply get defensive when called out.
      </p>
      <p>
       5.) You still haven't said why the other person who said they are a pilot was incorrect. You completely continue to dodge that.
      </p>
      <p>
       6.) I never said you were a shill. It was a defense in regards to calling everyone with a viewpoint opposing your arrogant views paranoid and delusional. If you really wanted to teach people something, then you wouldn't be so defensive. So if you're not a shill, then you're just an arrogant prick.
