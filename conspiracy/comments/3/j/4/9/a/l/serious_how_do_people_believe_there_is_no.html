I get a headache looking at how inconsistent it is.  HOW do people who have no purchase in any conspiracy explain that?  I m not just asking rhetorically.

And, please note, these are not just military personnel, but include occupants of the nearby Sheraton Hotel, such as Deb Anlauf:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suddenly I saw this plane right outside my window. You felt like you could touch it; it was that close. It was just incredible. Then it shot straight across from where we are and flew right into the Pentagon. It was just this huge fireball that crashed into the wall </p>

But how many security cameras captured the first impact? I&#39;m not aware of any at all. So, expecting a plethora of footage from Washington seems unjustified. </p>

<p>The FBI are talking about 85 videos, but this is just the result of an initial search that includes (for example) all videos obtained by the Washington Field Office. If we move on from that then the numbers begin to fall dramatically.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>56 &quot;of these videotapes did not show either the Pentagon building, the Pentagon crash site, or the impact of Flight 77 into the Pentagon on September 11.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Of the remaining 29 videotapes, 16 &quot;did not show the Pentagon crash site and did not show the impact of Flight 77 into the Pentagon.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Of the 13 remaining tapes, 12 &quot;only showed the Pentagon after the impact of Flight 77.&quot;</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>That seems really odd my friend. Do you really believe that 99 cameras were present and there is only one shitty one pointed in it&#39;s direction?  What about the marriot hotel footage where they clearly state that had a camera pointed right at the Pentagon?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can think of a bunch of reasons, not least that security camera are set up to observe the relative vicinity, not gaze off into the distance and focus on a building several hundred yards away. I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve heard much about the Marriott footage mentioned, and Google isn&#39;t turning up much beyond dubious YouTube videos. </p>

<p>As mentioned, how many security cameras caught the first plane hitting the Twin Towers? None: the only two bits of footage I know of were both taken by people who were already shooting footage of something else and so were able to react to the plane, turn and focus on the building. And that&#39;s in downtown Manhattan, an environment likely much more densely packed with cameras. So the lack of Pentagon footage doesn&#39;t seem as suspicious to me as to some. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmmm. I don&#39;t know what to believe I guess I could believe this since it is true camera&#39;s are usually put up for them to look down on the property. </p>

<p>My mum knows a guy that was there that on thee other side of the Pentagon and he says that shit happened and who ever said it didn&#39;t is nuts. But then I could of seen so much more damaged caused. If this guy could pull this awesome maneuver off then I think he would of definitely hit the White House since he went right by it.</p>

My dad has cancer, and I guarantee, sitting at home in his fucking chair watching Fox News all day is only making things worse, at the very least.

    <div class="md"><p>I hadn&#39;t heard about the phone books - but I can&#39;t find any references to them either - do you have one?</p>

<p>I want to add that I have seen the aftermath of a fire in a building that was &quot;gutted&quot; - basically burned to the ground - and yet there was all sorts of paper stuff not burned at all (though water damaged of course).  It would have been hard to predict what was going to burn and what wasn&#39;t - tough things like &quot;metal chairs&quot; had the padding and paint burned right off them, and yet there were masses and wads of paper seemingly untouched by flame.</p>

<p>Overall, living in New York City at the time, a vast number of people saw that second plane, including a half a dozen friends of mine at least.  (I slept through the whole thing myself.)  It&#39;s impossible to believe that the second plane hitting the WTC wasn&#39;t a plane - hundreds of thousands of people saw it including my friends, there are numerous videos, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Regarding the Pentagon - no one I know was there, but there were an awful lot of witnesses to it.  Skeptical about claims that it wasn&#39;t a plane...</p>
