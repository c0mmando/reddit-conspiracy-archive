    <div class="md"><p>Following Monday’s historic stock market downturn, many politicians and so-called economic experts rushed to the microphones to explain why the market crashed and to propose &quot;solutions” to our economic woes. Not surprisingly, most of those commenting not only failed to give the right answers, they failed to ask the right questions.</p>

<p>Many blamed the crash on China’s recent currency devaluation. It is true that the crash was caused by a flawed monetary policy. However, the fault lies not with China’s central bank but with the US Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve’s inflationary policies distort the economy, creating bubbles, which in turn create a booming stock market and the illusion of widespread prosperity. Inevitably, the bubble bursts, the market crashes, and the economy sinks into a recession.</p>

<p>An increasing number of politicians have acknowledged the flaws in our monetary system. Unfortunately, some members of Congress think the solution is to force the Fed to follow a “rules-based” monetary policy. Forcing the Fed to “follow a rule” does not change the fact that giving a secretive central bank the power to set interest rates is a recipe for economic chaos. Interest rates are the price of money, and, like all prices, they should be set by the market, not by a central bank and certainly not by Congress.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to “fix” the Federal Reserve, Congress should start restoring a free-market monetary system. The first step is to pass the Audit the Fed legislation so the people can finally learn the full truth about the Fed. Congress should also pass legislation ensuring individuals can use alternative currencies free of government harassment.</p>

<p>When bubbles burst and recessions hit, Congress and the Federal Reserve should refrain from trying to “stimulate” the economy via increased spending, corporate bailouts, and inflation. The only way the economy will ever fully recover is if Congress and the Fed allow the recession to run its course.</p>

<p>Of course, Congress and the Fed are unlikely to “just stand there” if the economy further deteriorates. There have already been reports that the Fed will use last week’s crash as an excuse to once again delay raising interest rates. Increased spending and money creation may temporally boost the economy, but eventually they will lead to a collapse in the dollar’s value and an economic crisis more severe than the Great Depression.</p>

<p>Ironically, considering how popular China-bashing has become, China’s large purchase of US Treasury notes has helped the US postpone the day of reckoning. The main reason countries like China are eager to help finance our debt is the dollar’s world reserve currency status. However, there are signs that concerns over the US government’s fiscal irresponsibility and resentment of our foreign policy will cause another currency (or currencies) to replace the dollar as the world reserve currency. If this occurs, the US will face a major dollar crisis.</p>

<p>Congress will not adopt sensible economic policies until the people demand it. Unfortunately, while an ever-increasing number of Americans are embracing Austrian economics, too many Americans still believe they must sacrifice their liberties in order to obtain economic and personal security. This is why many are embracing a charismatic crony capitalist who is peddling a snake oil composed of protectionism, nationalism, and authoritarianism.</p>

<p>Eventually the United States will have to abandon the warfare state, the welfare state, and the fiat money system that fuels leviathan’s growth. Hopefully the change will happen because the ideas of liberty have triumphed, not because a major economic crisis leaves the government with no other choice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>QE is the reason our economy will fail in due time. It was an unprecedented financial and social experiment that basically relieved the too big to fail banks of their worthless MBS. The stock market boomed, but every other economic metric stayed stagnant (Wages, jobs, employment, overall wellbeing for the middle class). It was the least &quot;free-market&quot; thing we could have done and now we&#39;re going to pay for it (we as in the people. Big banks, investors and fortune 500 Co.&#39;s will be fine).</p>

<p>To make it worse - All the big central banks around the world followed our lead. The Fed can only do a handful of things to the economy, one of which is called open market orders or OMO&#39;s. These allowed the Fed to buy and sell U.S. Government securities in the open market. Where they got the power or idea to purchase dying, private, security bundles is beyond me. If someone knows, please inform me on when and how they were granted that authority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard a few times that QE was just a nice way to keep the markets propped up while people in the know exited at inflated prices... I guess time will tell, but it seems logical to me. Then again, anyone who is looking past a 5-10 year horizon can see the writing on the wall. Staying long in the market at these prices is crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, it&#39;s hard to say mainly because free market economics don&#39;t really apply anymore. Your better off guessing what the fed will do than guessing where the market is going &quot;naturally&quot;. Now is a great time to rebalance your portfolio. Get out of the past winners (equities) and start looking at the losers (commodities, metals) if you want to speculate, or just hold diverse currencies until the stock market corrects itself. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this is an &quot;end of the world&quot; scenario, but we have a lot of correcting to make up for since we didn&#39;t let it do its thing in 08.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In reality the FED or any institution strives for negative interest rates at this point in time to force people to spend real money rather than stashing it away. That the amount of real money hardly measures up to our virtual depth seems to be completely irrelevant. </p>

<p>What stops them from going negative on interest rates is simple as obvious. Physical, hard cash. If banks were to push for negative interest rates as long as cash still exists they&#39;d cause a bank run all by themselves, as after all, why would I store my money at somebody elses place if it does nothing but reduce itself.</p>

<p>We won&#39;t see any interest rate increase until markets crashed completely or cash will be banned so negative interest rates could be forced. Rather than thinking about how to fix our cancerous monetary and financial system everyone is merely interested in maintaining their power equilibrium and rather revives the dead horse as often as need be; as extreme as need be.</p>

<p>This is our unfortunate reality, completely detached from any moral, sane aspect of what needs to be done. </p>

<p>The fairly tale of free markets is nothing but that, a fairy tale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t help that China has a ton of our debt. We allow foreign countries to buy as much of our debt as they want, but when their economies turn and they start selling it, we bitch and moan about how China affects us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a really simplistic question, which you can&#39;t necessarily draw a comparison to in terms of China buying and selling US treasury bonds. All of which are designed to be purchased and then sold on the secondary market mind you. </p>

<p>Also, if that is the main source of criticism, then the FED has nothing to do with that aspect of debt purchasing. </p>

<p>All Treasury securities are under the jurisdiction of The Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the Fed does decide how much debt they want to put on the market with OMOs. We can&#39;t control who buys it, but the fed controls how much we put out to sell. If we don&#39;t want to be connected to every other country economically then don&#39;t sell so many T-notes</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What he means by that is that China was the spark to ignite the fire. It could have been any bad news, though.</p>

<p>And you can&#39;t escape interconnections when countries buy and sell to each other. When china suffers, we suffer because we do so much trading with them, hence why china was bad news.</p>
