<p>&quot;On Monday evening, DeKalb County, Ga., police officers were responding to a burglary call when they arrived at the wrong house. In a matter of minutes, the officers managed to shoot the unarmed homeowner, kill his dog and wound one of their own.</p>

<p>&quot;I hear Leah screaming, I see Chris walking out, &#39;They just shot me, they just shot me, and they killed my dog,&#39;&quot; neighbor Tama Colson told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Tuesday. &quot;So I got him to lay down, took my shirt off and rendered first aid. And Chris just kept saying, &#39;Why did they shoot me? Why did they shoot my dog?&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>According to the Journal-Constitution, around 7:30 p.m. Monday, Chris McKinley, his wife, Leah, and his 1-year-old daughter were watching the movie Serendipity when the family&#39;s dog, a female boxer, began barking. </p>

<p>McKinley got up to see what was upsetting the dog. What he didn&#39;t know was that, according to reports, police officers, who were supposed to be at the house at the end of the cul-de-sac in McKinley&#39;s neighborhood, had instead entered into a screened-in porch area of his propertyhrough &quot;a reportedly unlocked screen door,&quot; according to a Georgia Bureau of Investigation report.</p>

<p>McKinley walked into the area with his dog, and the officers reportedly opened fire. </p>

<p>&quot;He says, &#39;I opened the door to see what the dogs were barking at, and I see black uniforms and I hear pop-pop-pop-pop,&#39;&quot; Colson told the Journal-Constitution. </p>

<p>The 36-year-old man was shot in the leg and his dog was killed; also, one of the officers, identified as Travis Jones, was wounded by another of the officers in the shooting, the Journal-Constitution reports.&quot;</p>
