    <div class="md"><p>It would be better for America to be friends with Iran and dump Israel.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we have a Fifth Column of traitorous Jews working in the interests of a foreign regime, thus distorting US foreign policy.</p>

<p>Fortunately, thanks to the internet, this fact is becoming well known. Recently a hysterical Zionist wrote an article explaining that all the young &quot;ivy League graduates&quot; working for Obama have all read &quot;The Israel Lobby&quot; and already know how the game is played.</p>

<p>Things are looking up for Americans and Persians.</p>

<p>As for Israelis, eh, who cares? Not me. Fuck &#39;em.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is all planned. Make the deal, then Israel will setup Iran and that false flag will justify retaliation, bing bango we&#39;re at war. The scary part is that if the US/West get&#39;s into it to help Israel, China and Russia will get into it to help Iran (WW3).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If World War III is planned and is imminent; what do TPTB get out of it? Nuclear holocaust? I&#39;m not being sarcastic I actually am interested to hear someone else&#39;s idea; this question weights on me heavily. Is their goal to simply end everything in a nihilistic ritual? Or do they have bases underground? Or perhaps most sinister, do they intend on scaring us to DEATH with this so that other entities can feed on our fear? Questions that need answering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t buy into super powers using nukes in WW3. They have other weapons that can do as much damage, without the nuclear fallout. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Not necessarily end everything, but reset back to a different paradigm. It&#39;s inevitable that the world economies will dump fiat money and go back to silver and gold. The only problem is, they need less people in the world to do it. In a world that is using silver and gold, you will not have mega corporations worth billions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or do they have bases underground?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They do have massive underground bases, look up D.U.M.B&#39;s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or perhaps most sinister, do they intend on scaring us to DEATH with this so that other entities can feed on our fear?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, lol.</p>

<p>All-in-all, just my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your input. I agree with most of what you said, and I&#39;m aware of DUMBS, but not to the extent of them. I&#39;ve heard dozens, maybe hundreds. Potentially worldwide. You can&#39;t ignore the extraterrestrial question when it comes to that though. When you say &quot;reset to another paradigm&quot; and &quot;weapons without the fallout&quot; I&#39;m curious what you think will happen? Maybe a war between Israel and Iran or Pakistan and India that causes vast famine and natural disasters? This kind of thing is already happening and has always been happening; I believe we are being experimented on by...I&#39;ll say more &quot;aware&quot; rather than more &quot;powerful&quot; entities. Because human beings are powerful too. We&#39;re just blind to these happenings as a group. I just feel like it&#39;s a slippery slope when your like, &quot;let&#39;s kill only like 2 or 3 billion, not 4..5..6.. Billion&quot;; they could care less. The age of DISinformation, robotics, genetic engineering, cloning, sexual debauchery and perversion is here. Who do you think got them to prepare nuke-size weapons with no fallout...who would that help, considering the goal of wiping out humans but preserving the planet...fucking aliens. Haha but who knows man, our government could have invented the idea and phenomenon of aliens as a psyop; and are really just dumb enough and selfish enough to kill us all and wait till the radiation clears. Yay so much better! Haha </p>
