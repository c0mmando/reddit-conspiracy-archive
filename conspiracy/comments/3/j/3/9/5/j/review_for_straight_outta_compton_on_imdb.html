       This is the review by Dan1863Sickles.  There are other good reviews about the effect his film is having but I thought this was the best one.
      </p>
      <p>
       23 August 2015
      </p>

       <strong>
        Something fishy is Going on!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been writing reviews for IMDb for ten years, and I think something fishy is going on here. STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is getting very, very high reviews from the vast majority of IMDb reviewers -- but the nine and ten- star reviews are all getting pelted with "negative" marks, earning scores of "1 out of 15" likes.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's the problem? The problem is that this movie wasn't supposed to be a hit. The mass audience wasn't supposed to respond to the story of young black men facing oppression and coming out on top. The American people were not supposed to see the real truth about how their police treat minorities every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quick, let's bury the good reviews! Let's spawn a phony backlash! Let's discredit Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on the basis of things they did twenty years ago. Oh, and let's all get sentimental about Eazy E because he's dead, and young black men are okay once they're dead. The dead ones are no longer scary and threatening.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with this movie is that the people who made it actually dared to portray young, angry black men as heroic, not as criminals or predators. It's okay to glamorize white criminals, because Hollywood was built on that. From PUBLIC ENEMY to THE GODFATHER, white audiences have always loved to sentimentalize their own criminals. But you can't do that with black men who rap about crime, even when they aren't actually criminals themselves. When Cagney postures like a thug in some ancient piece of crap that's cool. But when black men do it today that's dangerous and irresponsible!
      </p>
      <p>
       There are very powerful elements in this country that are terribly frightened by this movie. They're frightened because this movie gets white audiences to see young black men as something other than dangerous criminals. The scenes of NWA being roughed up by police are a terrible threat to the powerful elements in our society, who stay in power only by keeping white people scared of black men. They can't tolerate the idea of black male victims, so they instantly start a media backlash portraying the victims as criminals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say this is a good movie, a powerful, exciting film that presents a side of American life that is almost never seen on the screen. I know I'm not going to get many likes for this review, but what the hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've got enough already.

       People still think the timing of these Hollywood productions is a coincidence? The media is desperate to have a race war or at least to have the black population rise up against the police. This is obvious. Then a perfect piece of provocative art coincides with the agenda and we now even have a manufactured conspiracy about censorship to pique interest.

       How can you have a biographical drama whilst leaving out significant periods of a person's life?
      </p>

       It's literally propaganda - By the very definition of the word.

       The attacks might be because of what crimes the true life characters committed that the movie left out, but I think what matters is how the director chose to portray these men and the fight against police brutality, for freedom of speech, and minority oppression is what is bothering some authoritarians.  I don't know though, maybe a lot of people just really hate the movie because of it's graphic nature, think it's overrated, and feel duped by the positive reviews.  It could be that publications are being careful in their reviews of this movie in order to avoid any claims of racism.

       I'm sure you are going to explain why you are asking but in 1989 I was 16.  I bought the album in 1991 after it caught on in my high school.

       Crack epidemic. The rise of inner city, street gang violence. The breaking down of the african american family unit.
      </p>

       The people this movie glorifies are the same that promoted and helped agitate these things, and made their fortunes out of the sufferings their people were going through at the time.

       Not sure if you have seen the movie or not, but the movie stayed centered almost exclusively around N.W.A. as a group.  It didn't really stray to far into the depths of any of their personal lives other than that which dealt directly with the storyline/history.  The Dr. Dre incident would fit perfectly if this were indeed a movie solely about Dr. Dre.  Otherwise we would have to go into everyones life and explore and turn this into a 4 hour movie at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as propaganda goes, if this movie is propaganda, then so are the memories most people have of many of their favorite artists.  Most people in the entertainment or music industry have done vile things that we chose to eschew in favor of our enjoyment of their craft.

       I wonder how this plays into the theory that the music industry had bought into private, for-profit prisons and saw gangster rap as the perfect tool to glamorize the kind of wanton criminality that would fill up said prisons?

       But they are criminals (or at least pretend to be). It's literally what they rap about. Have you not heard their music? They are/were degenerate thugs and it is/was made out to be cool. CULTURAL MARXISM.

       Wow that's a little bold to say....Are you their friend or related t them in anyway? I don't know how you know someone from what the news tells you or what you read on blogs but that's highly incorrect....

       The funny thing is whenever African Americans are portrayed in a horrible, horrible way they dont get an Oscar or what happens is they have to be shot, raped, or scared in some manner in order to win something (ie. Halle Berry in Monsters Ball, ie. Denzel Washington in Training Day). But movies like this that show resiliency and that people wont take BS anymore dont get "Critically Acclaimed" they get bashed by the media and people like you who dont know them at all. But movies that involve the Mob, Snipers, Characters that cause Mass Terror and Military War Crimes are praised and get Oscars and Golden Globes......But They're The Thugs.....SMH thats America for you

       I know this because of what comes out of their own mouths. These rappers were at the top of rap culture and if you don't think people, especially young ones, don't look up to these shit stains and internalize their lyrics, you're kidding yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       One less bitch: Dr. Dre:
...Because she knows I'm not to be fucked with
      </p>
      <p>
       She ain't crazy
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuckin' with Dre, she'll be pushin' up daisies
      </p>
      <p>
       She was the perfect ho, but wouldn't you know
      </p>
      <p>
       The bitch tried to gank me, so
      </p>
      <p>
       I had to kill her
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, straight hittin'
      </p>
      <p>
       Now listen up and lemme tell you how I did it
      </p>
      <p>
       Yo, I tied her to the bed, I was thinking the worst
      </p>
      <p>
       But yo, I had to let my niggas fuck her first yeah
      </p>
      <p>
       Loaded up the forty-fo', yo
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I straight smoked the ho
      </p>
      <p>
       Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure
      </p>
      <p>
       I was soft and she thank me
      </p>
      <p>
       Coughed to the boss and got tossed
      </p>
      <p>
       One less bitch you gotta worry about
      </p>
      <p>
       Eazy-E: No more questions:
...There's a store, but don't point
      </p>
      <p>
       Walk inside, case the joint
      </p>
      <p>
       One man behind the counter, another in the back
      </p>
      <p>
       Go out to the car and load the gat
      </p>
      <p>
       Grabbed the ski mask, here's the task
      </p>
      <p>
       Go in broke, come out with cash
      </p>
      <p>
       ([Female:] Were you slick?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, you gotta be cunnin
      </p>
      <p>
       Told Ice Cube to leave the car runnin
      </p>
      <p>
       Walked in, said: "This is a robbery"
      </p>
      <p>
       Didn't need the money, it's just a hobby
      </p>
      <p>
       Fill the bag, homeboy, don't lag
      </p>
      <p>
       I want money, beer, and a pack of zig-zags
      </p>
      <p>
       The man in the back had a camera
      </p>
      <p>
       so he came out to test his stamina
      </p>
      <p>
       against Eazy E, but he took one
      </p>
      <p>
       Fell to the floor, so I ran
      </p>
      <p>
       And here is a music video of Ice Cube breaking into a persons house with a gun and kidnapping them, because he isn't a "real nigga."

       Well First of all I'm African American not Black so please watch your tone with me. Yes I do listen to Rap music and every last bit of it since the age of 12....And I'm an IT Engineer with Certifications, graduated from Michigan State University with a bachelors in Marketing....I came from Detroit, MI one of the hardest city to grow up in ever and I think I'm pretty well off here lol.....I don't think you really know what its like growing as African American Male everyday, still abiding the law and being looked at as a criminal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone has free will and the ability to one not listen to it and two not listen to it. Don't blame the artist for the music the make. That's like saying I'm going to blame all RnB or Old School RnB artist for the kid I have lol....that doesn't make sense at all to generalize everyone and everything that you don't like or really just don't understand.....and I would rather people say they don't get it than just say they don't like because of this or that......And honestly if the lyrics your concerned about then what about Johnny Cash's Lyrics or even Ted Nuggent.....I mean we can go in circles and talk about this but I pose another point to you.....If you feel as though your children are gonna internalize the lyrics then BE A BETTER PARENT AND TURN THE SHIT OFF! That's rule #1 lol again Don't blame the Artist Blame BAD PARENTING

       They were and are criminals, they profit off of gang violence and the encouragement of the "black community" to support gangsterism and capitalism. I don't know what the hell you are on about, nothing they did was heroic at all. They made music, supported and funded by rich California Record Execs. They sold millions, made millions and spent millions. They encouraged and advertisef behaving like a psychopath to get ahead which is perfect for the end of the 80's era they emerged from. Nothing about their music is spiritually uplifting or intellectually stumulating. Dr Dre is a Capitalist jackass and Ice Cube is an elitist puppet. Eazy E is dead from hooking up with one too many groupies and the other guy us just irrelevant. I see nothing honorable about this film or these people featured in it. Anyone who looks up to gangster rappers as idols is a fucking moron who actively supports gang violence and capitalism.

       What is positive and heroic about NWA or this movie Straight outta Compton?
      </p>
      <p>
       They spawned an entire culture of thuggery and criminality whose effects are still being felt today.  Two generations have been lost to this horseshit now.  Blacks (13% of the population) commit 50% of all the murders and 56% of all the violent crimes in the US.  Before the gangsta-rap era the numbers were nothing like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we're witnessing here is life imitating art and it's been nothing but a net-negative for blacks and the black community.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing to praise about this film.  Other than the fact NWA made a shit ton of money and it's Jewish media mogul enablers made even more when they helped set up the 3-strikes laws and the for-profit-prison systems under president Bill Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       I put this film on even par with Menace to Society.  The positive character with a chance for success dies in the end while the shitberg criminals live to rob, steal and kill another day.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to praise this movie, go right ahead.  When you're older you'll be cringing that you once embraced this ridiculous bullshit and thought it was something righteous and beneficial to mankind.  It is not.
