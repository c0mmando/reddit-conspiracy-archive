       I've seen some really strong arguments using stars, - one being the question - why is the sky fixed above us? we are supposed to be careening through space on a spinning ball and yet we can identify the same constellations for centuries. why does the map of the stars "above" us not change much like the scenery out your car window as you drive a distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not know about northern and southern star maps. I do not know how they are known to differ. the theory is that - as a model - we would see the earth as a flat disc with antarctica as the outer rim. so if stars are different further out than farther in - seems there's no conflict to the theory unto itself  - however if you want to give any specifics on what you are referring to I could try to give a more specific answer

       I gotta say I do not agree with the car called earth thing. I've heard the explanation that the stars are just REALLY far away. this would be a good explanation if the stars were all on one even plane really far away from us. but they are also far away from each other. so given that fact - that all the stars are at huge varying distances from each other not just from us - it's a model of alignment that should fluctuate - actually quite dramatically, with any movement on our part.
      </p>
      <p>
       vanishing points are part of the model of flat earth. in this model the sun appears to set but is really going so far off in the distance that is only appears to set, following the rules of a vanishing point in natural vision. it would then make sense that austraia can't see our stars and we can't see theirs - since their sky is too far from us to see and vice versa.

       How is it possible for an object to appear to dip below the horizon, if it does not in fact dip below the horizon?

      <p>
       Objects can get further and further away, till they're a mere speck and no longer visible - But the  objects will never dip below the horizon in such a case.

       re: car called earth. - I just meant I don't agree with what you said following - that we are at a relative snails pace. calling a car earth unto itself is fine by me :) -- and the snails pace - for that too - yes - in comparison to some things,in the globe model, that's accurate, - what I really do not agree with is that we are moving too slow/far away to see stars move. it's like the universe is a crystal ball - filled with all those tiny dots/ imperfections, we could be the tiniest thing in there - but if we go swimming around, every thing is going to look different. the universe is big but we are IN the universe it is all around us, in the globe model. not looking at it as a flat plane from a distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       the dipping below the horizon is actually the easiest to demonstrate. go outside and look at a flat street. stand in the middle but don't let anything hit you. -- look straight - as far as you can see, what you will eventually see, if you can get to a clear open road - is the sky and the road meeting. as if they are converging. though of course you know they are not, this is a vanishing point. all illustrators and classical painters know about it. you can read about it endlessly in art books. the dipping below is an optical illusion all objects in the distance give. but it happens in a hallway just as much as on the ocean. actual distance is not what governs the phenomena - but your eyesight.

       You're still underestimating the size of space.

      <p>
       The diameter of our solar system is 9 billion km's.
      </p>
      <p>
       The closest star from the solar system is Proixima Centauri - 4.2 light-years away - That's 37.8 trillion km's away.
      </p>
      <p>
       That means you could place our solar system, end on end, 4,200 times before reaching the nearest star - The NEAREST star...
      </p>

       And you expect things to move around like sighting a cactus and mountains?

       Except the converging of train tracks never dip over the horizon, in such an example.

       how far do the stars spread out from each other? are they on a relatively flat plane? or are some as far away from each other as we are from them? if it's the former - ok. but if it's the latter, then we need to see movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       what's on the ground like trAintracks go up in our vision. and what's in the sky goes down. to converge.
      </p>
      <p>
       the one point you make I DO agree with is that sun does not appear to shrink in size and in fact it seems to me that it often appears bigger as it sets. i do not know explanation for this phenomenon with either model - globe  or flat - but it interests me  a lot.

       that's because - I'm assuming the cactus and mountain and very near each other in comparison to your car. which is why I'm asking are all the stars about equal distance from us. for the distance away to make movement unnoticeable. there needs to be no relatively significant distance between cactus and mountain. but if you are talking about a trifecta of extreme distances, where cactus, mountain and car are all dispursed like points on a huge equidistannt triangle - then you keep seeing movement in alignment - until comparatively speaking - to you the cactus and mountain are right next to each other.

       Simple experiment: Go outside and look at a cloud far in the distance. Does it look like it's moving? I'm looking at one right now and it appears stationary. But I know it's moving, because a cloud is just water droplets suspended in air.

       It's an optical illusion, something to do with how our brains place more importance to large objects on the horizon if I recall correctly. You can actually test this by turning your back on the setting sun and then bending over and looking at it through your legs. The sun will look normal sized. (And if you're lucky you may catch a glimpse of Uranus!)

       but it's all relative right? what matters in relative distance. here's what I mean - say there is a star out there that is x miles away from us. and x is like way way way farther than my chemical laced brain can imagine. BUT. there's another star , and that star is x miles away from the first star, on a relatively straight line - making star #2 2x miles away from us. -- sooo far ,I know. but - it's all relative. so if earth moves even one 'earth size" distance to the left - star #1 may appear to be in exact same place from our view. but star number two is going to move one earth size distance to the right - in comparison to star #1 - from our vantage. it's all relative, space can be as big as it wants to be, we should still see new star alignment as we move.

       Perspective (or "vanishing points") has nothing to do with the sunset.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sun doesn't change in apparent size as it rises or sets (as we would expect to see as a matter of perspective). This is because the sun is relatively enourmous and far away compared to the rotation of the Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The perspective phenomenon that we call a vanishing point can he resolved with optical enhancement. In other words, by using a telescope or other similar device you can furthur increase the range at which you can see things before the merge due to perspective. You cannot see the sun after it sets no matter how strong a telescope you use. Because the Earth is round.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vanishing point is a place in you field of vision where parallel lines appear to converge. Where the apparent scale of things and the relative distance between them become so small that they seem to "vanish" into one another. The sun doesnt seem to get smaller and smaller until it visually merges with trees and buildings in the distance. The bottom half dissapears first as it sinks below the horizon. This is completely different from any version of perspective vanishing point you can find.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Earth is round, pal.

       your point about not being able to use a telescope to see the sun over the horizon is interesting and a good point! that is evidence to the contrary of flat earth. not enough to get me off the idea - but I'm going to do what I can to see if i can find an explanation for that contradiction. or if there really is none. thanks.

       i think - because the sun is essentially light - more so than a solid object - as we experience it visually - it may function differently to our eyes than say a bird or plane. even street lamps do weird things in our vision at a distance - kind of spreading out and creating horizontal lines of light.
      </p>
      <p>
       you make very good points. though I think there may be ways to counter your points - I just don't really know what they are right now.

       The sun isn't essentially a light. It's a physical object in the sky that emmits radiation, some of which is light. We can examine the emission spectrum of the sun to determine the elements it is made of. You can do this too. It doesn't "spread out", and neither do lamps. That is just a glare.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moving on the the argument you have about not being able to see the relative movement in the stars due to the movement of our planet. We can see that. It's called stellar parallax and we can use it to calculate how far away a star is. It's just that the distances are so magnificently huge that the change can be just barely measurable. The closest star to Sol, Proxima Centauri, has a parallax that is
       <strong>
        less than 1 arcsecond
       </strong>
       . You aren't going to notice that without measuring instruments over a significant period of time.

       "as we experience it visually" re the sun. even a lamp is an object - but it's the light emitting from it that we are viewing. and light translates in our vision different than objects (though of course we only see objects via light too) anyway - I suspect it may be the atmosphere altering our view as sun sets - like a lens of more layers of diffusion etc, then we get just looking up.
      </p>
      <p>
       interesting about stellar parallax. what this makes me think tho -- is if this is the case - that star alignment does vary but only very slightly. it means all the stars are relatively the same distance from us.  and those that vary are only very slight further away or closer, relatively speaking.  if there are stars that are twice as far away from us as others - we should see them move. if they almost don't move at all - they have to be all about equidistant from us,  intriguing.

       You severely underestimate the scale of the objects in question. The distance from one side of our orbit to the other would be the most extreme variation in measurements, and this distance is nothing compared to the distance to the stars. We don't see an appreciable movement in stellar parallax for the same reason you don't see an appreciable difference in parallax on the water tower 2 miles away by take a single step to your left.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously. Draw a point on a piece of paper. That is a star. Now draw a straight line from that dot to someplace else on the piece of paper. Now trace another line on top of the first line to the same place. Those two lines a essentially the same line right? Well this is pretty much what would happen if you traced a straight line from a star to the Earth on one side of it's orbit and then a half year later drew another straight line from the star to the Earth on the opposite side of it's orbit. The distances are so astronomical that the measurement of the star with the
       <strong>
        most
       </strong>
       parallax is less than one arcsecond. For scale, imagine a pie cut into
       <strong>
        1.2 million
       </strong>
       slices. The measurement is less than
       <strong>
        one
       </strong>
       of those slices.

       i do understand what you are saying, if our movement is tiny in relation to the space between stars, we should get no/almost no visible change in how stars appear.
      </p>
      <p>
       because relatively speaking we are holding still. when all distance is considered.
      </p>

       even over centuries - constellations stay the same because we have still only traveled nil in comparison to everything.

       ok. it works as an explanation.

      <p>
       but I just want to point out - what this is is a lot of explaining to explain the same circumstances of - a flat earth model. both would explain the stars not moving, and the latter more simply. I know "simply" does not make it accurate. but it's a model that works. the stars lack of movement lend toward a flat earth model.
      </p>

       No it's not. It's what we observe about living on a spheroid in the vastness of space. These aren't explanations to justify a round Earth. They are observations of the phenomena that a round Earth creates.

       Wrong. Small obects will shrink, but on a flat earth you would be able to continue seeing them through binoculars. This doesnt happen. Things absolutely dip below the horizon and you can see it happen. You arent suddenly blind beyond a certain distance.

       Then what does the sun dipping below the horizon mean? It dissapears below the horizon without an appreciable change in shape or size. It's not a glare or lens flare that causes it to do this. What, specifically, are you seeing when the sun sets that indicates the Earth may not be round?

       when you look a short distance or a long distance - from the vantage of a low level or a high peek - horizon line is always eye level. horizon line should be lower at further distance or from higher vantage point if the earth is a ball.
      </p>
      <p>
       and you can't say  - it's just too big to see, the math is hard math, there should be 8 inches of fall off for every one mile, looking three miles in distance there should be visible drop off, looking six, there should be a visible increase in drop off,  but this never occurs at any distance
      </p>
      <p>
       a city scape should appear lower, the bottom inches obscured by the arc of the earth itself between you and it - when looking from a far distance, example after example proves - this is never true, it may appear overall smaller - but never just lower,

       it's what is accessible to your vision. to exaggerate the idea of what your vision should be on a globe - if you climb to the top of a hill and look straight out you should see none of the hill - only sky beyond. or if it's a VERY big hill. (like half a globe earth) you will see less hill and more sky the closer you get to the peak. but we never see less land. ever. this should occur if the earth is curving 8 inches every mile - - you should be able to see more fall off the more elevated you stand. and therefore see the horizon line appear to lower.

       This is all so odd and untrue that I'm having trouble making sense of what you are trying to say. The higher you get the more you can see because you are increasing the angle at which you can view the earth. Why would you see less land the higher to got?

       Of course you do. When you are standing at sea level you can only see roughly three miles out before the Earth's curve takes it out of sight. The higher you get the further you can see, until eventually you can behold basically 50% of the sphere all at once. The closer your eyes are to the earth, the nearer the horizon is to you.

       You do. The higher you are, the further away the horizon and the more you can see. You dispute this to be true?

       The horizon doesn't rise or fall. The horizon is the angular difference between your eyes and the tangent of the earth. When your eyes are only a few meters off the ground (standing) you can only see about 3 miles in any direction. When you climb a water tower the horizon gets further away from you and you can see further. Eventually you would be so far away from the earth that you would be able to see virtually 50% of the entire sphere.
      </p>

       Try to find a cylindrical building like a grain silo or something. The bigger around the better. Now get really close, like put your head up against it and have a friend walk from where you are around the building until you can't see them anymore. Tell them to stop there. Now back away from the building. You will notice that you can see more and more of the building and eventually you will see your friend as well. If the building was flat then you would never lose sight of your friend.

       ok- I'll go with the grain silo thing. tho I've only seen them in movies being a city dweller! my reference point is movie witness right now. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       as my friend circles the grain silo - and I stay up against it fixed in one place - my friend is going to be completely visible - then partially visible - then completely hidden from my view. when she is partly visible - she does not appear uniformly smaller - as she would if she were running directly away from me and out of sight  - instead she would be obscured, the half of her closest to the silo would at one point be blocked from my view (let's say her left side) while I still see her right "outer" half. this is how objects "disappear" around a round ball. tube, etc. and i'll agree it appears to be what the sun does, tho I'm not sure that's actually what's happening, but lets forget the sun for a moment, and just think other stuff on land, when objects are further away fro you do you lose sight of their half that is closest to the ground first? when somebody is walking directly away from you is there a time you only see them from waist up? no, they shrink uniformly and get tinier and tinier in your vision. unless she is climbing over a hill - then she will be obscured starting at her legs first, but if she's walking away on a flat plane this does not happen. there are two different ways of going out of view - getting obscured - and "shrinking" due to our line of sight, you could do both at the same time if you are walking away on a big hill. but they are two different ways of vanishing.  the circling the silo "effect" is not how landscapes receed. we do not lose the bottom half first. as we back away. they shrink/condense uniformly.
      </p>
      <p>
       as for horizon I guess that's what I mean - the horizon never rises to obscure. or lowers to reveal for that matter.

       Yes you do lose sight of things boottom first. The only difference is that the earth is so large that a thing needs to be quite far away before it falls below the horizon. A person will shrink to a spec before they go below the horizon, but on a flat earth you could look at them through a telescope and never see them dip below the horizon. This isnt what happens. You could watch you friend through a scope and they will eventually dip under the horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cities and buildings do it too. You can watch a ship disappear hull first as it sails away from the shore.
      </p>
      <p>
       The horizon doesnt rise or fall, nor do we expect it to. It is always a visual reference point that your mind uses for orientation and anywhere you see the earth and the sky you will also see the horizon. It does move closer and farther away though, based on your distance from the surface of the earth. The higher you are, the more earth you can see the farther away the horizon is. What we observe with everything we see, like with the sun, indicates a round earth. You cant take evidence, acknowledge that it supports a round earth and then dismiss it out of hand.

      <p>
       if the stars move independently - that is an indication that we are in a relative fixed position while some stars move slightly.  there should be more collective, overall observable movement of stars - if their movement really indicates our movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       also - is it not weird that stars appear to rise and set - all as one. like wallpaper above us. seems if there is this incredible depth to space  - - as the sky appeared to rise and set above us - some stars should appear to drag more than others as we rotate through the night because of all the depth. - the whole sky should appear different with each minute/hour throughout the night. constilations should condense or expand - not just float with even measurements as if they are fixed on a flat plane.

       I don't think you understand the scales at play here. The moon is 239000 miles away from the Earth. We can agree that it moves, but you can't really perceive it with the naked eye. Barnard's Star, the one with the highest proper motion, is over 150 million times further away. Space is so big, Proper motion isn't something you notice from night to night. It's the sort of thing that you measure in

       I understand angles and perspective, I understand that the factor of leverage can be applied to visual perspective. that a shift at the right angle should make a different in perspective no matter how far away the other objects are.

       laws of physics and gravity - may be two different things, according to the theory. namely that the true laws of physics need not be described with gravity as is it defined. gravity explains why the ball earth model works. however it's an explanation justifying a theory. if you devise a different theory that needs less explanation - .. that's what they claim to be doing with the flat earth model and I gotta say they are making me think.
      </p>
      <p>
       we can not actually create the "force" of gravity in any earthly experiment. (what goes up must come down - yes) but not the gravity that keeps objects moving/suspended in space and in constant tension with each other. this is an invented concept and something we take on faith but can not recreate naturally. we can only illustrate in drawing or in models where "space" is a solid shaped to show what "space" is doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       rules of density and temperature - however are forces we can recreate and would explain the way a flat earth functions.
      </p>
      <p>
       one of the things that gave me chills and led me to just be open to it -- was an illustration of weather patterns. if you look at a  map of earth as a flat model - where north pole in center and arctic is the outer rim. for one - the real size of Africa finally makes sense. - but second (among many things) weather patterns makes sense. it's like a big pot that's being stirred, all motion leads to other motion. it is suddenly so much less mysterious where storms come from etc.

       that is the opposite of gravity, that is cenrtiphical(i can't spell) force.

      <p>
       the water is thrown away from you as you spin. the bucket counters the force by holding it in. if gravity was at play there you would not need the bucket the water would just happiliy spin around you as you spun in the middle and it would never need anything to keep it from flying off.

       temp and density create all the rules for what falls and rises. - or really shifts places. an apple  never just falls to the ground - it shifts places with less dense air. hot air rises above cool air - because heat makes it temporarily mimick less density.

       So dense things sink and less-dense rise. Why? Gravity!
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, your apple analogy doesn't make sense, as air is less dense above it than below, which means it should "fall" up. Even if you think the density of air above and below are equal, why does the apple begin moving in the first place?

       gravity is really two different theories. one being the rule of density - which is apparent in our natural world. and is why objects fall to ground. I take zero issue with that one,

       but the other rule of gravity is that of objects being able to extend force on others so that they orbit - never wavering from the path and never falling away or crashing in. it is this latter rule that can not be replicated in any experiment,

       I guess that's the crux of what got me enraptured in the flat earth theory, orbiting - as explained by the rule of gravity - might be science fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is nothing in our natural world that proves anything is orbiting anything, it is a way to explain the movements of celestial bodies and our pattern of being able to see them pass over us - it's a model that works -- but how and why - if you really think about "orbiting" - why does absolutely nothing in nature that we can witness in it's whole - function this way?
      </p>
      <p>
       a hummingbird over a flower - fireflies around a light - best similarities - but of course they are not orbiting - it is an entirely different thing. nothing orbits.

       can you see a satellite in space? can you record it's movement? everything about orbiting - we are told - but we can not demonstrate for ourselves.

       I agree with the falling down part of gravity. I just don't agree with the orbiting thing. and i do not think one explains the other.

       projectile motion is not orbiting. that's force played out and expiring. orbit is continual motion without new force applied, really it contradicts all real world physics where all energy is quantifiable and finite.

       You're underestimating the distances involved.

        . in this model the sun appears to set but is really going so far off in the distance that is only appears to set

       How is it possible for an object to appear to dip below the horizon, if it does not in fact dip below the horizon?
      </p>
      <p>
       Objects can get further and further away, till they're a mere speck and no longer visible - But the  objects will never dip below the horizon in such a case.

       how far do the stars spread out from each other? are they on a relatively flat plane? or are some as far away from each other as we are from them? if it's the former - ok. but if it's the latter, then we need to see movement.

       what's on the ground like trAintracks go up in our vision. and what's in the sky goes down. to converge.
      </p>
      <p>
       the one point you make I DO agree with is that sun does not appear to shrink in size and in fact it seems to me that it often appears bigger as it sets. i do not know explanation for this phenomenon with either model - globe  or flat - but it interests me  a lot.

       Perspective (or "vanishing points") has nothing to do with the sunset.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sun doesn't change in apparent size as it rises or sets (as we would expect to see as a matter of perspective). This is because the sun is relatively enourmous and far away compared to the rotation of the Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The perspective phenomenon that we call a vanishing point can he resolved with optical enhancement. In other words, by using a telescope or other similar device you can furthur increase the range at which you can see things before the merge due to perspective. You cannot see the sun after it sets no matter how strong a telescope you use. Because the Earth is round.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vanishing point is a place in you field of vision where parallel lines appear to converge. Where the apparent scale of things and the relative distance between them become so small that they seem to "vanish" into one another. The sun doesnt seem to get smaller and smaller until it visually merges with trees and buildings in the distance. The bottom half dissapears first as it sinks below the horizon. This is completely different from any version of perspective vanishing point you can find.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Earth is round, pal.

       Hey guess what? THat thing you say we should see?
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Barnard2005.gif">
        We do see it!

       Just because you're not paying close enough attention to notice doesn't mean it's not happening.
