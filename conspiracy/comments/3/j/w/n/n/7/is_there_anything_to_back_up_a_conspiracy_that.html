    <div class="md"><p>Civilian arms ownership today is different than it was between 1914-1945. The military had access to heavy weaponry whereas most civilians were more likely to own pistols or semi-automatic weapons; the threat of an uprising would have been quelled relatively easily by military forces.</p>

<p>But America wouldn&#39;t have even entered WWI if it were not for the sinking of the Lusitania and the Zimmerman telegram. WWI and WWII should be referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Thirty_Years%27_War">Second Thirty Years War</a> because like the first Thirty Years War, it was waged to reorganize Europe for Rome. While the first Thirty Years war was a failure for Rome, bringing an end to the Dark Ages with the Peace Treaty of Westphalia, the Second Thirty Years War was a success. </p>

<p>The Second Thirty Years war would include:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Better to sell an idea about secret societies than admit is was about trade and power and keeping the power in the fewest hands possible as for many deliberate deaths, that is iffy to me since human labor was still needed at that time.</p>

<p>It was seriously creepy to read of talk of developing a bomb that would kill people and save structures during the eighties/nineties.</p>

<p>That would make sense now since labor is no longer as necessary as it was. </p>

<p>that suggests intelligence and compassion.</p>

<p>the British did the &#39;Dambuster&#39; raids, amazing and daring bold etc, but the outcome was mass deaths and miserable suffering inflicted upon the civilian population.</p>

<p>the difference between seeing a factory on a map, and knowing that a factory also has people working in it, people living near it.</p>
