       What is your counter-claim "from an engineering perspective"? Maybe bust out a free-body diagram for us? A little F = ma?
      </p>
      <p>
       As a guy with a master's degree in mechanical engineering who took 12+ years to figure this out, I have to say the attachment to the official narrative has nothing to do with engineering -- it is
       <em>
        emotional
       </em>
       , it is
       <em>
        psychological
       </em>
       . We cannot imagine our own government would attack us. We cannot imagine that all our news could be lying to us, in concert. We cannot imagine that our military would be sent to kill hundreds of thousands of
       <em>
        innocent men, women, and children
       </em>
       who have never done a damn thing to harm us. We simply have trouble imagining an evil that great.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has nothing to do with engineering. A child could figure that part out for you.

       Before we begin this discussion, you do know what you set yourself up for right? You are describing yourself as a Mechanical Engineer with a Masters degree in the field with 12 years of experience. You are presenting yourself as an expert in the field. I'm not a full blown Mechanical engineer yet, but I am in my last year before I get my degree. So a person with your stature, I'm assuming you have extensive knowledge in solid mechanics, statics, Dynamics, deformable bodies, mechanics of materials etc. So I expect your reasoning to sound like that of an expert and
       <strong>
        nothing less
       </strong>
       or else I'd write you off as a 1) a pathetic excuse of an engineer or 2) just a troll imposter. I expect you to be able to clearly reason and respond to all of my verbatim pound for pound with your claimed engineering expertise with
       <strong>
        no gaps in your reasoning
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So here we go. A couple odmf days ago there was a "911-physics" thread around here discussing the collapse. I had my explanation for how the tower fell, but unfortunately I lost mine. However, I saw a post from another user (who i believe has engineering training) who explanation was spot on, and very similar to mine and what other engineers explained. So here it is for you to dissect.

       <p>
        <em>
         "If you look into the math, you'll see there was no way for the buildings to arrest the collapse once it started.
Each floor of the towers had 31 thousand square feet of open office space. The average service load on 9/11 was 80 pounds per square foot, so the average floor weighed around 2500 tons outside of the building core.
The truss connectors on each floor (the brackets on the core and perimeter columns actually holding the floors in place) could hold a maximum of 29,000 tons of static weight before failing (bending down or snapping off). When the truss connectors fail, the floor they were holding collapses.
There is also dynamic amplification factor at play. The dynamic amplification factor of a suddenly applied load is 2x.
So, each individual floor of the towers could hold roughly 12 floors worth of static load, and around half that amount if that load were applied suddenly. When the top portion of the South tower dropped, it was 29 floors worth of load, or 5 times what that first intact floor could be expected to support. Naturally the brackets failed and that floor was ripped away from its truss connectors and joined the collapse. The next intact floor would have been faced with 30 floors with of load, and with the same 29,000 ton max load rating of those truss connectors, it too would fail instantly.
The perimeter columns were pre fabricated panels 3 floors high and 3 columns wide and bolted together at join points. When the wave of collapsing interior floors tore their lateral bracing away, the perimeter panels broke at their join points and peeled away in sections, like peeling a banana.
The core columns came in 36 foot long sections bolted together at join points. The wave of collapsing floors tore their lateral bracing away, and the columns were heavily battered by falling debris including massive hat trusses at the top of each tower. They managed to stand for 15 or 20 seconds after the collapse reached ground level."

       You've made many baseless incorrect assumptions about me. If this represents your standard of proof -- just assert something, and that makes it true -- we should be very critical of your analysis indeed... that is, if you had offered one. Instead, you give a copy/paste of another user's comment, point at it, and declare, "Science!"

       Show your math. Show any math. Even just show us initial conditions. This is a wall of technobabble that will only convince a non-engineer. (Yes, I'm expressing doubt that you're an engineering student.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Forget about the dynamics. Just model the initial failure. Prove WTC1, WTC2, and WTC7 necessarily had to collapse without the need for planted explosives. It's a statics problem. F = 0.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, forget all that, just define all the initial conditions.

       First we have to have a source for these numbers and its construction.  After a quick look at this I see that suspiciously absent are the 47 gigantic vertical core columns, which even if you can theorize the floors around them to pancake totally to the ground,  the core still stands.  How do the floors and the core columns collapse on themselves at close to free fall speed through the path of maximum resistance and symmetrically all the way to the ground?  That is what is simply impossible,  and really, any theorizing and math you throw at us will never be able to explain it, because it is impossible.  NIST also thought they could throw a bunch of numbers at us  think we would be fooled by complicated theorizing.  But it turns out they left out key structures from their model, and never released the data so they it could be peer reviewed.  If they failed, I'm sure you will also.  Not because it is too complicated to understand but because it is simple.

       I addressed the core columns. They actually did stand for 15 or 20 seconds after the collapse, 60 floors worth in the north tower and 40 floors worth in the south. They eventually dropped themselves from having no lateral bracing and being heavily damaged by the debris wave.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the core columns stood after the floors made it to ground level kind of blows a hole in the "columns were wired to blow" argument.

      <p>
       If you knocked over the twin towers with the hand of god, the towers would be smashed. If you knock over a cinderblock, the cinderblock will be fine - This disparity means cinderblocks are not appropriate to use as an example.

       After a large earthquake some buildings do just fall over like a cinder block would.  Now I would think many steel frames buildings would do that and not just crumble if they fall over.  But the twin towers were very tall so the impact they create probably would break it apart.  If you dropped a cinder block off the twin towers it would most likely break also.

       You have to keep to scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this little comparison between towers and cinderblocks, the cinderblocks are overwhelmingly stronger than the towers. So it should be no surprise that if you dropped a cinderblock onto another cinderblock, you'd get different results than if you dropped a part of a building onto another part.
      </p>

       It's the most glaring and mind-numbingly ignorant concept, to neglect scale like this.

       With regard to WTC 7 it's exceedingly simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't recall the exact number because it's been so long since I've argued it, but NIST has since acknowledged the building had a period of "free fall acceleration" during it's collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       In layman's terms, the building offered
       <strong>
        no resistance.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The 3rd law makes this scenario impossible without the use of explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the progressive global collapse is systemic, all destructive energy comes from within the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a transference of energy, which there must be, then there would have been noticeable deceleration of the falling structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is simply no explanation, other than some explosion, that can explain where this energy came from in the system, that allowed something like 11 stories of office building to drop through the air with nothing stopping them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, if this collapse was progressive and resulted from irregular damage from fire, we should have observed an irregular collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fire doesn't cause healthy, unnaffected joints all over the building to fail simultaneously.

       Things move to the point of least resistance. The way the building "pancaked" down falling strait into its own footprint and through the steel support beams violates this. It should have fallen and then started falling to the side or somewhere else than completely strait down into the part that was suppose to be undamaged.

       There is no "official explanation of the 9/11 collapse." NIST couldn't figure it out using their own hypothesis for collapse initiation. And yet....no other hypothesis should be investigated?

       3 sky scrapers do not collapse at almost free fall speed perfectly into their own footprints.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nova's pancake collapse simulation has been debunked over and over in so many different ways. Here is just one example explaining how they manipulated the simulation to make it look real.

       Can you briefly explain why you think that statement is incorrect.  I'd like to know but I've never found a good explanation for why Newton's 3rd law doesn't apply. I can't follow all the math I've seen others use when saying that Newton's 3rd law doesn't apply.  I've got a good liberal arts education but I'm lacking on engineering, physics and material sciences so as many simple words as possible would be great.  How much of it has to do with Einstein since so much of his theories supplanted Newton?

       Cinder blocks can be tumbled about and remain intact, does that mean you can knock over a sky scraper and expect it to remain intact?
      </p>
      <p>
       If not, then cinder blocks are not an appropriate comparison to sky scrapers.

       After a large earthquake some buildings do just fall over like a cinder block would.  Now I would think many steel frames buildings would do that and not just crumble if they fall over.  But the twin towers were very tall so the impact they create probably would break it apart.  If you dropped a cinder block off the twin towers it would most likely break also.

       I addressed the core columns. They actually did stand for 15 or 20 seconds after the collapse, 60 floors worth in the north tower and 40 floors worth in the south. They eventually dropped themselves from having no lateral bracing and being heavily damaged by the debris wave.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the core columns stood after the floors made it to ground level kind of blows a hole in the "columns were wired to blow" argument.

       There's no single answer to that. It completely depends how, where, and when the force is applied.
