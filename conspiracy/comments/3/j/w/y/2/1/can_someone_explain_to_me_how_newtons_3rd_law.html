    <div class="md"><p>What is your counter-claim &quot;from an engineering perspective&quot;? Maybe bust out a free-body diagram for us? A little F = ma?</p>

<p>As a guy with a master&#39;s degree in mechanical engineering who took 12+ years to figure this out, I have to say the attachment to the official narrative has nothing to do with engineering -- it is <em>emotional</em>, it is <em>psychological</em>. We cannot imagine our own government would attack us. We cannot imagine that all our news could be lying to us, in concert. We cannot imagine that our military would be sent to kill hundreds of thousands of <em>innocent men, women, and children</em> who have never done a damn thing to harm us. We simply have trouble imagining an evil that great.</p>

<p>It has nothing to do with engineering. A child could figure that part out for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before we begin this discussion, you do know what you set yourself up for right? You are describing yourself as a Mechanical Engineer with a Masters degree in the field with 12 years of experience. You are presenting yourself as an expert in the field. I&#39;m not a full blown Mechanical engineer yet, but I am in my last year before I get my degree. So a person with your stature, I&#39;m assuming you have extensive knowledge in solid mechanics, statics, Dynamics, deformable bodies, mechanics of materials etc. So I expect your reasoning to sound like that of an expert and <strong>nothing less</strong> or else I&#39;d write you off as a 1) a pathetic excuse of an engineer or 2) just a troll imposter. I expect you to be able to clearly reason and respond to all of my verbatim pound for pound with your claimed engineering expertise with <strong>no gaps in your reasoning</strong>.</p>

<p>So here we go. A couple odmf days ago there was a &quot;911-physics&quot; thread around here discussing the collapse. I had my explanation for how the tower fell, but unfortunately I lost mine. However, I saw a post from another user (who i believe has engineering training) who explanation was spot on, and very similar to mine and what other engineers explained. So here it is for you to dissect.</p>

<p>From: <a href="/u/Pvt_Hudson_">/u/Pvt_Hudson_</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;If you look into the math, you&#39;ll see there was no way for the buildings to arrest the collapse once it started.
Each floor of the towers had 31 thousand square feet of open office space. The average service load on 9/11 was 80 pounds per square foot, so the average floor weighed around 2500 tons outside of the building core.
The truss connectors on each floor (the brackets on the core and perimeter columns actually holding the floors in place) could hold a maximum of 29,000 tons of static weight before failing (bending down or snapping off). When the truss connectors fail, the floor they were holding collapses.
There is also dynamic amplification factor at play. The dynamic amplification factor of a suddenly applied load is 2x.
So, each individual floor of the towers could hold roughly 12 floors worth of static load, and around half that amount if that load were applied suddenly. When the top portion of the South tower dropped, it was 29 floors worth of load, or 5 times what that first intact floor could be expected to support. Naturally the brackets failed and that floor was ripped away from its truss connectors and joined the collapse. The next intact floor would have been faced with 30 floors with of load, and with the same 29,000 ton max load rating of those truss connectors, it too would fail instantly.
The perimeter columns were pre fabricated panels 3 floors high and 3 columns wide and bolted together at join points. When the wave of collapsing interior floors tore their lateral bracing away, the perimeter panels broke at their join points and peeled away in sections, like peeling a banana.
The core columns came in 36 foot long sections bolted together at join points. The wave of collapsing floors tore their lateral bracing away, and the columns were heavily battered by falling debris including massive hat trusses at the top of each tower. They managed to stand for 15 or 20 seconds after the collapse reached ground level.&quot;</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve made many baseless incorrect assumptions about me. If this represents your standard of proof -- just assert something, and that makes it true -- we should be very critical of your analysis indeed... that is, if you had offered one. Instead, you give a copy/paste of another user&#39;s comment, point at it, and declare, &quot;Science!&quot;</p>

<p>So let&#39;s dig into that Science:</p>

<p>Math? Oh goodie we like math!</p>

<p>Okay, a bold assertion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Each floor of the towers had 31 thousand square feet of open office space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can we get a diagram? Show your math. (This one&#39;s a gimme, but it&#39;s fundamental.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The average service load on 9/11 was 80 pounds per square foot, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Show your math, include free-body diagrams.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so the average floor weighed around 2500 tons outside of the building core.</p>

<p>Show your math.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The truss connectors on each floor (the brackets on the core and perimeter columns actually holding the floors in place) could hold a maximum of 29,000 tons of static weight before failing (bending down or snapping off).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Free-body diagram? Or just a diagram? Your just throwing a number out. Show your math.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the truss connectors fail, the floor they were holding collapses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can we see a diagram?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is also dynamic amplification factor at play. The dynamic amplification factor of a suddenly applied load is 2x.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Show your math.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, each individual floor of the towers could hold roughly 12 floors worth of static load, and around half that amount if that load were applied suddenly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on a previous unproven assumption.</p>

<p>&quot;Instantly&quot;? We need to be more precise here.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Diagram?</p>

<p>A detailed description... based on what? Show your math.</p>

<p>The core columns came in 36 foot long sections bolted together at join points.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Diagram?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The wave of collapsing floors tore their lateral bracing away, and the columns were heavily battered by falling debris including massive hat trusses at the top of each tower.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Diagram?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They managed to stand for 15 or 20 seconds after the collapse reached ground level.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Show your math. Show any math. Even just show us initial conditions. This is a wall of technobabble that will only convince a non-engineer. (Yes, I&#39;m expressing doubt that you&#39;re an engineering student.)</p>

<p>Forget about the dynamics. Just model the initial failure. Prove WTC1, WTC2, and WTC7 necessarily had to collapse without the need for planted explosives. It&#39;s a statics problem. F = 0.</p>

<p>Hell, forget all that, just define all the initial conditions.</p>

<p>Remember to show your math.</p>

<p>Before you move on to <em>prosecutions</em> (snicker), don&#39;t you think you <em>might</em> want to attempt to convince at least one architectural, engineering, building codes or demolition governing body in the western world of your cockamamie story?</p>

<p>So far, you have a couple dozen different explanations (with no math or models to speak of), including holographic planes and fucking space lasers. You have no proof that anyone planted anything in those towers, you have no proof anyone <em>ordered</em> anything planted in those towers, you have no proof of anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First we have to have a source for these numbers and its construction.  After a quick look at this I see that suspiciously absent are the 47 gigantic vertical core columns, which even if you can theorize the floors around them to pancake totally to the ground,  the core still stands.  How do the floors and the core columns collapse on themselves at close to free fall speed through the path of maximum resistance and symmetrically all the way to the ground?  That is what is simply impossible,  and really, any theorizing and math you throw at us will never be able to explain it, because it is impossible.  NIST also thought they could throw a bunch of numbers at us  think we would be fooled by complicated theorizing.  But it turns out they left out key structures from their model, and never released the data so they it could be peer reviewed.  If they failed, I&#39;m sure you will also.  Not because it is too complicated to understand but because it is simple.</p>

<p>If you knocked over the twin towers with the hand of god, the towers would be smashed. If you knock over a cinderblock, the cinderblock will be fine - This disparity means cinderblocks are not appropriate to use as an example. </p>

<p>You have to keep to scale. </p>

<p>In this little comparison between towers and cinderblocks, the cinderblocks are overwhelmingly stronger than the towers. So it should be no surprise that if you dropped a cinderblock onto another cinderblock, you&#39;d get different results than if you dropped a part of a building onto another part. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the most glaring and mind-numbingly ignorant concept, to neglect scale like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>With regard to WTC 7 it&#39;s exceedingly simple.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t recall the exact number because it&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve argued it, but NIST has since acknowledged the building had a period of &quot;free fall acceleration&quot; during it&#39;s collapse.</p>

<p>In layman&#39;s terms, the building offered <strong>no resistance.</strong></p>

<p>The 3rd law makes this scenario impossible without the use of explosives.</p>

<p>If the progressive global collapse is systemic, all destructive energy comes from within the system. </p>

<p>If there is a transference of energy, which there must be, then there would have been noticeable deceleration of the falling structure.</p>

<p>There is simply no explanation, other than some explosion, that can explain where this energy came from in the system, that allowed something like 11 stories of office building to drop through the air with nothing stopping them.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if this collapse was progressive and resulted from irregular damage from fire, we should have observed an irregular collapse.</p>

<p>Fire doesn&#39;t cause healthy, unnaffected joints all over the building to fail simultaneously.</p>
