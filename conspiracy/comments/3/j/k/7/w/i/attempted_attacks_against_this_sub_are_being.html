       It's ok we'll find another community. We just need to, cohesively, begin the process of developing/choosing our new home. We should start right away, as this sub has been "under attack" (outside influence is probably a better term than attack) for some time now. It's only getting worse with events like today.

       No, we use our collective minds and deal with it in an intelligent manner instead of running away to find a "new home" to where the trolls will inevitably follow us to.
      </p>
      <p>
       We fight to keep this home. r/conspiracy is leaking into the mainstream and this is exactly what we need. We will see more attacks because this sub is getting more attention and waking people up. Increasingly, I see posts from users who are new and are beginning to understand what we are all about. This is a good thing!
      </p>
      <p>
       To runaway and find a "secretive new home" will only work to keep our work isolated from the mainstream and that is just what the people we are exposing would want.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say screw finding a new home. We fight for this one. r/conspiracy is waking people up more and more all the time. People are realizing something's not right with the MSM and they are coming here to understand what that is.

       I never said you were wrong, and I never expressed any desire to prove you wrong. I do feel that your immediate association between unusual karma amounts and shilling is odd, but I honestly don't care.

      <p>
       It's not about the karma score it's about the behavior. Example: cryvape spent over month posting on this sub, frequenting it daily. He's made over 250 posts here and even his name is just a parody of flytape. That's
       <em>
        bizzare
       </em>
       when you consider half of those posts were just him talking about how awful this sub was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Gimace, strange how he was on a posting spree yet the moment I posted a screenshot of his karma and linked to his snoopanoo he just immediately stopped posting. Same for the account that started the thread, mysteriously inactive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nice smear attempt though, trying to make it out like the admins are doing nothing and this sub is just "out of control"  like FPH and coontown. Man those kooky racists are so extreme, wanna keep reddit a safe space so we should ban it right? I like how almost your entire post history is just you trying to convince people shills don't exist,  as though this sub hasn't been repeatedly targeted in the past.

       I get it, you are very, very angry. But this post, at least on the surface, violates sub rules and the targeting of a user (especially one who is not a regular in this sub) might even be against reddit-wide rules. Even if the mods feel it is justified, I'd still like to know their reasoning. I get that this makes you mad. Too bad.

       <a href="/u/swinging_mallet">
        /u/swinging_mallet
       </a>
       did, he somehow has the ability to make an account with its karma starting at 9999.
I made a post with a screen shot to snoopsnoo with his account, which you can see here:

       I then posted this in response to the ask reddit thread. My posts was immediately deleted and my account was shadowbanned, along with all it's other posts being deleted.

       All references to that post and screenshot were deleted. However they did not delete all of my posts, in fact posts where others responded to me were not delete. My guess is to make the cover up less obvious.
What has me so worried is that reddit is in on this, in which case there may well be nothing we can do but attempt to inform the community at large.

       You're not shadowbanned. You're a new user, and most subreddits have AutoModerator set to automatically disallow posts from new users. That's why your posts don't show up.

       Yeah a mod just sent me a PM and explained that to me. Don't be surprised if this comment just says [deleted] in the future though!
      </p>
      <p>
       This was such a sloppy attack though. It's obvious he's a sock account, and his fake post has 3k upvotes and 4k comments in a submission that only has 1.5k upvotes and 99% of the people are talking about gaming subs in response to the question. I mean did the reddit top admins seriously think that not a single person would notice the discrepancy? I'm not gonna lie, I'm actually kind of disappointed that I'm the only one that caught this, though on the other hand I never would have found the thread if other people hadn't linked to it, so I guess I just happened to be the last dominoe in line.

       Ironically by shadowbanning me I feel as though they have only confirmed to me that Gimace did in fact set up the ask reddit thread in order to smear this sub! SCREEN SHOT THIS SUBMISSION BEFORE YOU SEE [DELETED] AND A SHADOWBANNED ACCOUNT, DON'T LET THEM COVER THIS UP!
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/u/Gimace">
        /u/Gimace

       started his account with 9999 karma points!
       <a href="/u/swinging_mallet">
        /u/swinging_mallet
       </a>
       is the only other user I've ever encountered who was able to do this! I fear that reddit may be in on this themselves! SPREAD THE LINKS, SPREAD THE SCREEN SHOTS, DON'T LET THEM HIDE THIS!!!

       Just constructive criticism here.  Using acronyms like FPH disarms your title because some people will not get the reference and it makes you seem not very well spoken.  If you're trying to appeal to the largest audience as possible you need to spell it out and not assume others know what it means already.  Not just for this sub but for your entire life.

       I get it, you are very, very angry. But this post, at least on the surface, violates sub rules and the targeting of a user (especially one who is not a regular in this sub) might even be against reddit-wide rules. Even if the mods feel it is justified, I'd still like to know their reasoning. I get that this makes you mad. Too bad.
