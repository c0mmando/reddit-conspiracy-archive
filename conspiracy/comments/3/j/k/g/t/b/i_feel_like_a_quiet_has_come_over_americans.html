        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Since the revelations about spying things haven&#39;t seemed right. I watched so many people tune in and then check out. They stopped talking about the realizations they and all of us have been making that our government has sold us out. After the spying was revealed, it was irrefutable that we live in one of the societies we were taught about in history class - no more rationalizing CIA experiments on us or pentagon weapons research or secrecy for our safety. It&#39;s clear that we have given way too much power to some people who are very, very bad. And now what do we do? I&#39;m legitimately scared. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why I come to this sub. </p>

<p>No really, the humor and comrade you show here is in-admonishingly effervescent  in the face of what many here fear to be some of the great catastrophe ever conducted by the dark side of humanity allowed to fester under the guise of altruism that ultimately only meekly masks those who seek power through any means necessary. I don&#39;t like speaking of things only conceptual in nature, I feel this limits my ability (maybe others but I wont speak to ones conscience, only their actions) to properly convey reality. Strange how bizzare our common nomenclature is. &quot;The war on drugs&quot;. The war on X. War on a concept is inept, fucking stupid. I dont know. </p>

<p>I feel as though the United States is nothing more than a large out of control social experiment gone horribly awry. </p>

<p>Our &quot;founding fathers&quot; consisted largely of slave owners amd mass murderers and rapists. Christopher Columbus was a slave driver who murder many natives so that he could get gold and be rich and famous in England. The only reason he ended up in the Americas in the first place was because he was a navigational retard.  Why is that celebrated in this nation? Imagine if you love in the Britain today and you bought plane tickets to India but somehow ended up in New York. That&#39;s not a great discover, you&#39;re just a fucking retard. Then because you realize they don&#39;t have guns and you do, you decide to shoot and rape them all. That&#39;s what your life is, killing people and then fucking women with your dick. Fuck Chrisopher Douchelondus, I&#39;m glad he&#39;s dead,I&#39;ll be sure to jerk off to the thought of him writhing in agony as he died of syphilis. That&#39;s the new narrative. </p>

<p>Anyways, remember the trail of tears kids? I remember we learn that pretty young but we don&#39;t really cover it much despite it being one of the most atrocious acts against humanity ever.  I mean just the name alone should clue you in on just how shit fucked America is. If you need a refresher,  its when they wrassled up all the natives and forced them to walk themselves to death. This isn&#39;t in the books but fuck it, they probably raped a bunch of them too,  because why not,  fuck you they had guns. </p>

<p>Oh, how about all the abuse we did to the mentally ill? Lobotomy was a treatment how exactly? You could make the case that they didn&#39;t know better. Still, you&#39;d think the understood jamming peoples brains with a metal bar through their eye is bad. But they don&#39;t need the metal bars anymore, now they use pills. </p>

<p>Most families in America originate from 3 places. Either they immigrated on a boat,  we&#39;re the spawn of these shit fucks who did terrible things to the natives (someone want to see if thr the Bush family has ties? Wouldn&#39;t surprise anymore.) </p>

<p>Native Americans are abused and harrased throughout American history than any other race, yes more than African Americans. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s good at all but they at least let them stay as families. They just shoot the Indians. This continues with the prison industrial complex. Also probably the biggest cover up in American history. I digress however. </p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;m saying is nobody alive today is responsible for the crimes of their forefathers. Inherited guilt is the most ass backwards concept ever, and not everyone is a child of rape, but it&#39;s a reality the majority population im in America is still mostly not aware of. If they are they mostly don&#39;t accept it. I don&#39;t blame them. I could go on and on but I think I&#39;ve written about enough atrocities as is.  Nevertheless it&#39;s a reality that must be dealt with and accepted. It&#39;s the foundation of almost all our problems, truly. Rampant corporate greed, bankster families, prison industrial and military industrial complexes, run by jack boot thugs who literally beleive they have authority ordained by god. I&#39;m sorry about however you feel about the drug war, or people using drugs, or what your respect for peoples values are. I live in a world that will cage you, harras you, ostracize you, or even fucking kill you <strong>because of a flower. A fucking flower</strong>. There is <em>nothing</em> anyone can say to me that that is anything less than pure insanity the result of a sick and barbaric society. </p>

<p>But then again there&#39;s people who deliver weed in the mail. America is such a bizzare place, it&#39;s truly become the freak show Carlin always wanted to see. </p>

<p>But yeah, I&#39;m glad this community has stuck through such enormous storms of shit posting. Reminds me of this. Remember that mos of the world&#39;s decisions are made by just  a few families. But you have the potential to be just as influential. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was having an argument with another redditor the other day and the argument boiled down to them <em>proudly</em> ignoring the evidence I presented to assure me that everything was fine and will remain fine ever, all the while launching ad hominem attacks on me for suggesting otherwise.</p>

<p>But it didn&#39;t upset me.  I didn&#39;t get mad.  Why?  Because it reminded me why I prep.  I prep because there are a <em>lot</em> of people like this in the world.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t fear a collapse to be honest, there have always been cyclical collapses throughout history and humanity has always prevailed. In my opinion the real threat is that technology will allow elites to break-away from their reliance on labor (that is, us) to the extent we are nothing but a burden to them and the planet they&#39;d just as soon have all for themselves without us littering the streets with our despair, destroying their planetary &quot;habitat&quot; in our desperation, and causing all sorts of threatening instability because of the injustice of it all. In this scenario the so-called 1% are no better off than the rest of us. The diminishing remnant of the population clinging like barnacles to the underbelly of elite civilization will form the frightened vassal communities that serve the increasingly rarefied power above them spiraling toward some sort of technological singularity at the center. </p>

<p>I have no solution for this to offer but I&#39;m certain there will be no ground to go to. Those who suffered under Roman rule had some hope they could escape into the wilderness but that option is now off the table. The first step toward a solution is to come to this hard realization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats what I fear as well... One thing that is hopeful is that these &quot;Archon&quot; have been so pampered that they don&#39;t have the same evolutionary pressures the rest of us have and might not be evolving intellectually at the same rate others with more challenges are. They have always relied on us to create their technology, we build the weapons they use to control us, our own little prison cells we cherish, and I could assume they will need us to help build and program their spaceships. lmao So ridiculous, we need to refuse on mass to no longer support ANYTHING that we don&#39;t agree with or anything that does not meet our moral code. Does the military fight for what we the civilians want? No? Well then lets not support them. Lets fucking SCOLD them. Don&#39;t allow your children to join such an evil force. Does congress represent the people? No? Well stop participating in their game. Stop pretending. Lets be in REALITY NOW and withdraw our votes that don&#39;t matter. Lets stop paying taxes. I&#39;m serious. We will have to do this now or wait until it gets infinitely worse and as others have said, wake up in a building that is on fire with no way out.</p>

<p>Otherwise, we are paying for our own enslavement. They are perfecting drones as we speak that could be automated to do whatever they want. They can&#39;t just nuke the whole world but they can send out swarms of drones and kill dissenters or whatever they want and they won&#39;t even have to pay some kids college tuition to have him play the real life murder video game. That&#39;s the kind of power we have to make sure no one ever gets or we may be in more trouble than we realize.</p>

<p>My point being, this is how strong the programming is. I believe very strongly in a lot of alternative thought, yet even still, I have a hard time bringing myself to do anything about it. Cognitive dissonance, even in myself. I think we are all that way to some degree. We don&#39;t know how to act any other way than to (at least somewhat) conform to everyone else&#39;s expectations. Then again, we are at a loss WHAT to do -- except start learning serious survivalist skills and move to a remote location. But am I? Cognitive dissonance, again?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes <a href="http://thoughtmaybe.com/the-century-of-the-self/">The Century of the Self</a> so frightening is that you begin to realize that the practice of manipulating the thoughts of large groups of people began as a theoretical science in the late 1800&#39;s, it&#39;s continuously being honed to perfection, and through recent industry consolidation, it has become even easier and more effective to the point where it could blunt all but the most serious of uprisings.  And even those (through the science of calculating statistical tipping points) can be headed off as soon as they&#39;re detected.  From what I could tell, it culminated in, and we lost control, with the selling of the last gulf war. After that they knew they could get away with pretty much anything - and they did.  The march to war was unabashed and brazen knowing they would win the statistical opinion battle being in firm control of the lowest common denominator. They&#39;ve got it to the point where they can piss on Americans&#39; shoes, look them in the eye, and tell them it&#39;s raining and nothing will happen but a bunch of complaining which won&#39;t amount to anything politically. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. It&#39;s bad.  Most people aren&#39;t aware, and they will be fucked.</p>

<p>Many people do know something is up, and they try to prep.  Even if it&#39;s just a little bit.</p>

<p>These average-aware people feel hopeless about changing society for the better.  They are just an average person going about their day to day life.  They know shit is bad, but can do nothing about it as their time is spent working 40hrs/week and all the other shit they have to do just to get by.</p>

<p>Once they talk to their friends and coworkers about the most recent revelation in the news, they don&#39;t have the time to dwell on it, to do more research, etc.  It kinda fades away.  Not by choice, but just because more immediate things are affecting them personally.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—<br/>
Because I was not a Jew.</p>

<p>Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.</p>

<p>This quote really applies to these average-awake people.  They are aware shit is going down, and its bad.  But they don&#39;t feel like they have a voice.</p>

<p>+1 Bravo, BRA-FUKING-VO !!! You brought tears of joy to my eyes with that comment, the sad part is VERY few understand this and i&#39;m not just talking about USA lol</p>

<p>It seems like the whole Planet has been infected with this kind of system, for thousands of years. Perhaps it was always meant to be like that so it would slow us down or maybe even test us... as human beings. As we all know those that don&#39;t learn from the past are bound to repeat it.</p>

Edgar Hoover is the father of the modern stuff.  He started gaining power and going this route before WW2, but that&#39;s when it really took root.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s what you are fighting.  Fine, people can no longer deny this stuff is happening.  Now the next step needs to happen.  This didn&#39;t start yesterday, it didn&#39;t start Sept 11, 2001.  You need to explain why they should care about what the government is doing when they&#39;ve been doing this since their grandparents were kids, and for a good chunk of time things were going well despite that. </p>
