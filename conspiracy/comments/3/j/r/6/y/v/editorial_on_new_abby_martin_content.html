       Are you kidding? It's wise to expect negative feedback when you state such a wildly off base and very strange opinion. Abby Martin brings to light the things main stream media does not want us to see. Abby is a caring, passionate person. She brings to light the things that are wrong with this Country in the hope that awareness will help lead to change. The people who say things like you did, that she wants us to burn; are apparently those who feel it's better to be sheltered from the truth, and told everything is ok, just ignore the institutionalized torture, it's ok, USA, USA. This type of denial allows things to get worse instead of better. In a world where our media is so prewritten corporate fake; Abby Martin is as genuine as it gets. You don't need to wonder where Abby stands on a subject. She's honest and straight forward, has uncommon integrity as witnessed when she called out her former employer, when she didn't agree with what was happening in the Ukraine. Abby is highly intelligent and when combined with her passion and courage; she is one of the best journalists of our time.

       I think highly of the exceptional Abby Martin. She's done many art shows in the past. She did her first solo art show on August 27th. I made the video as a tribute to her and her art. Personally, I don't consider Love to be weird.

       This guy is obsessed with Abby Martin... maybe in an unhealthy way... he posted a video tribute to her a few days ago (check his history if you wanna see the video) and I jokingly responded to the video by saying "wow.. you are going to kill her one day aren't you?" and got this in reply:
      </p>
      <p>
       An ignorant statement which brings to focus the backwards world we now live in. Someone caring about someone is viewed as "crazy" yet people hating on each on the internet is all the rage. I may live in this upside down so called civilization but I refuse to adopt it's Honorless ways. As a man of Honor who knows how special Abby is and cares about her; I would die to keep her safe.

       It's funny, but I didn't receive it as funny to have someone ask if I was going to kill someone I care about. Perhaps you could explain hows it's funny? (No Joe Pesci reference intended)

       Because the video seemed similar to a video an obsessed fan/stalker would make and those sorts of stalkers sometimes end up trying to murder the object of their obsession.  Even talking about caring for somebody and dying for somebody you don't personally know is kinda weird.  I'm sure you're a good guy and all but that stuff comes across in a creepy sorta way...

       First, how many obsessed stalkers do you know? What, do you run a car service for them? You don't know the details, of how I came to care about Abby. Super cliff notes: I respect her. In may she was bombarded with Rape/death threats. I chimed in because I respect her and I'm a man of Honor. Psycho release her home address (and her mom's) on sniper forums. My defense grew more vigorous and I realized she was in my heart. I didn't suddenly loose sanity, just because I care about her, and I don't appreciate someone speaking about a tribute video I made for her first solo Art show, like it's a nightmarishly bad thing instead of the tribute it was meant to be. I didn't plan on caring about Abby, but here I am. As a man of Honor you have no idea how offensive your original "joke" was to me

       Dude the way you are talking about her is kinda nuts... You have intense emotional feelings for a person you never met.. This is Mark David Chapman shit.  He worshipped John Lennon and idolized him and felt like he connected with him on a personal level but then Lennon said something that Chapman disagreed with and he was so emotionally invested in this fantasy connection he had with Lennon that he felt overwhelmed and betrayed by Lennon and decided to kill him...  That's what I meant when I joked that I think you might kill Abby Martin.

       You can't read or understand reality. You need to tell mom and dad that you need therapy. I've told you this time and time again. You need a therapist and you need mental health help.Get some. Go wake them up and say you "don't get it" and "need help"

       You sight a mentally disturbed individual as if it the norm? Believe it or not, it's possible to care about someone without being deranged. And for the record, because you clearly don't see it; saying somebody will harm someone they care about it, is messed up.

       Reread the thread because you obviously are lost.  The user David_Grecco is obsessed with Abby Martin.  He private messaged you when you made this post about her. A couple of days ago he wrote this to me:  "An ignorant statement which brings to focus the backwards world we now live in. Someone caring about someone is viewed as "crazy" yet people hating on each on the internet is all the rage. I may live in this upside down so called civilization but I refuse to adopt it's Honorless ways. As a man of Honor who knows how special Abby is and cares about her; I would die to keep her safe."
      </p>
      <p>
       That was written by David_Grecco to me because I commented on an Abby Martin video and he got mad at me for it.  Basically I'm telling you that David_Grecco is crazy.

       Actually you are cowardly and clearly lack the ability to comprehend Honor. My reply doesn't show the completely ignorant message I was responding to. But you don't seem like one to let something like the facts interfere with your judgement. After all, that would make sense.

       An unfortunate sign of our twisted so called civilization. How is caring about someone creepy? Why is it so normal for people to hate on each other; yet people freak out if someone cares about someone? You may think my way is strange; just imagine how screwed up I consider yours.

       IF Abby Martin wants anything "to burn" in the United States, then it is limited to the clearly corrupt system and the unaccountable criminals that perpetuate it.  I have yet to see anything that advocates anything beyond that.

       The Federal Reserve, DHS, NSA, TSA, CIA, IRS, DEA, ATF, FBI, U.S. Attorney Office, U.S. Congress, Federal Election System, and various others are not corrupted to the point of them warranting a nearly complete "purge and reboot"?

       An unfortunate sign of our twisted so called civilization. How is caring about someone creepy? Why is it so normal for people to hate on each other; yet people freak out if someone cares about someone? You may think my way is strange; just imagine how screwed up I consider yours.

       You sight a mentally disturbed individual as if it the norm? Believe it or not, it's possible to care about someone without being deranged. And for the record, because you clearly don't see it; saying somebody will harm someone they care about it, is messed up.
