<p>Sanders is Obama 2.0.  Check before Obama was elected and even now, he constantly praises and advocates Sanders.</p>

<p>After all, Reddit has previously been a Ron Paul fan club.  </p>

<p>For awhile, subreddits like <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/">/r/politics</a> were rife with positive articles about Paul.  Nobody was writing code to promote that clown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Norway, Canada, and Sweden have oil funding their programs. England has severe budget problems and all 4 have sky high taxes. None of them have to pay for a large defense force like the US does.</p>

<p>And no, you can&#39;t just cut the military to save money. The US would lose influence and we would go back to being isolationist. There&#39;s no middle ground here.</p>

<p>If Sanders is actually elected and somehow manages to convince Congress to pass his bullshit, I guarantee you his approval ratings will take a nosedive as soon as people see their taxes are 2x higher.</p>

<p>Like I actually do not understand how anybody thinks Sanders can actually get done what he promises with 0 support from his party or Congress. We&#39;ve already seen what lack of control in Congress leads to: budget shutdowns and severely compromised bills. Anything Sanders tries to push through will go through the same process unless by some miracle the democrats win a majority in both house and senate.</p>

<p>I could go on and on about how the various things like free education will only cause taxes to go higher and higher so the overall net effect on the average person is still the same or even worse than before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Befuddled, that&#39;s right. Stalin, Lenin, Hitler, and Mussolini all claimed to be &quot;Socialist/Communist&quot; but nearly zero of their work in office had anything to do with those forms of economic structure. If you actually research the core principles of them, you too would understand the differences.</p>

<p>Take a look at the modern day nations of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, for instance. These are all Democratic nations with Socialist economic structures. Many legislation&#39;s are pro-citizen and humanist in nature. For example, Sweden offers paid leave to new parents. That&#39;s a Socialist idea; that is to say, it&#39;s something that society feels is important for the well-being of the citizens and in no way benefits industry.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with either of these policies. It&#39;s a matter of whether the leaders implement them correctly or spout the flavor of the month catch phrase just to get elected into power so that they can grow their control further. Mao and Hitler are great examples of such.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Befuddled, that&#39;s right. Stalin, Lenin, Hitler, and Mussolini all claimed to be &quot;Socialist/Communist&quot; but nearly zero of their work in office had anything to do with those forms of economic structure. If you actually research the core principles of them, you too would understand the differences.</p>

<p>Take a look at the modern day nations of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, for instance. These are all Democratic nations with Socialist economic structures. Many legislation&#39;s are pro-citizen and humanist in nature. For example, Sweden offers paid leave to new parents. That&#39;s a Socialist idea; that is to say, it&#39;s something that society feels is important for the well-being of the citizens and in no way benefits industry.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with either of these policies. It&#39;s a matter of whether the leaders implement them correctly or spout the flavor of the month catch phrase just to get elected into power so that they can grow their control further. Mao and Hitler are great examples of such.</p>
