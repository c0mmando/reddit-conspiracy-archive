       It's quite possible that the millenial generation just really likes him. Ever think of that? Most every friend I have on Facebook close to my age that's not a brainwashed republican goon likes Bernie Sanders.

       Right so they're just brainwashed democratic goons.

       Sanders is Obama 2.0.  Check before Obama was elected and even now, he constantly praises and advocates Sanders.

       You call Paul a clown and have a hardon for Sanders... Why can't you keep yourself in r/politics?

      <p>
       You socialism advocates are delusional if you think the US will ever adopt those politics.

       I respect your decision to be a collectivist, why can't you people accept the majorities choice not to be collectivist?

       Norway, Canada, and Sweden have oil funding their programs. England has severe budget problems and all 4 have sky high taxes. None of them have to pay for a large defense force like the US does.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, you can't just cut the military to save money. The US would lose influence and we would go back to being isolationist. There's no middle ground here.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Sanders is actually elected and somehow manages to convince Congress to pass his bullshit, I guarantee you his approval ratings will take a nosedive as soon as people see their taxes are 2x higher.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I actually do not understand how anybody thinks Sanders can actually get done what he promises with 0 support from his party or Congress. We've already seen what lack of control in Congress leads to: budget shutdowns and severely compromised bills. Anything Sanders tries to push through will go through the same process unless by some miracle the democrats win a majority in both house and senate.

       I could go on and on about how the various things like free education will only cause taxes to go higher and higher so the overall net effect on the average person is still the same or even worse than before.

       You're comparing a candidate with pro-citizen ideals to a dictatorship? Socialism and communism have gotten a terrible reputation thanks to the tyrants that befuddled their definition pre-/post-ww2. I think a lot of Americans really need to open a dictionary and then a book on foreign economic policy. It sounds to me like you don't fully grasp the things he stands for.

       Take a look at the modern day nations of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, for instance. These are all Democratic nations with Socialist economic structures. Many legislation's are pro-citizen and humanist in nature. For example, Sweden offers paid leave to new parents. That's a Socialist idea; that is to say, it's something that society feels is important for the well-being of the citizens and in no way benefits industry.

       There's nothing inherently wrong with either of these policies. It's a matter of whether the leaders implement them correctly or spout the flavor of the month catch phrase just to get elected into power so that they can grow their control further. Mao and Hitler are great examples of such.

       You know that congress let lapse a bill (Smith-Mundt Act amended) which previously outlawed (made it illegal) for propaganda, right? So, right now, it's absolutely legal for lies (propaganda) to be broadcast thru media. You realize that a war on the mind is now legal. And currently fucking with every US citizen. 
So really the only question of merit is: why are US citizens not fighting back? 
They are legally allowed to lie right to our faces - as they do! What the fuck people...

       Okay, the fact that most of the people that get on Reddit have certain views that fall in line with sanders' extremely well, is more than enough to support my statement. People get on Reddit. These same people that tend to get on Reddit tend to think a bit more outside the box than the people watching fox news or whatever. These people tend to like Bernie Sanders... So they post about it on Reddit, like alot. Boo hoo, let's cry propaganda. I'm sure if you go to foxnews.com you'll find loads of posts about trump/clinton. Chill.

       Never said he was perfect, but it's pretty easy to see that he's the best candidate as of right now. Your theory is a possibility, however highly unlikely. There is a reason that you're seeing mostly positive articles in regards to Bernie on Reddit: the people that post on Reddit tend to be more liberal, and they like him. So you know, go ahead and call it propaganda if you want.

       There's nothing inherently wrong with either of these policies. It's a matter of whether the leaders implement them correctly or spout the flavor of the month catch phrase just to get elected into power so that they can grow their control further. Mao and Hitler are great examples of such.
