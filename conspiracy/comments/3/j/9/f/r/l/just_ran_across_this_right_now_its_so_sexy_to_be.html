<p>I just found it really...odd, if not disconcerting, that these kinds of values are being propagated and advertised so very heavily.  There is really nothing about this video that <em>doesn&#39;t</em> say &quot;Look how cool and sexy he is and looks, everyone!  Being an assassin is awesome and something <em>every</em> kid should strive for!!&quot;</p>

<p>The effects that this kind of stuff has on people&#39;s subconscious - especially on the <em>maaany</em> people into these kinds of games - I&#39;m sure is not very good.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not here trying to say &quot;ban all these games&quot;.  No.  I just, again, thought it was...pretty blatant actually just how obvious the &quot;kill, kill, kill and be <em>sexy!</em>&quot; push these types of games have is.</p>

<p>Sounds about right, and I wouldn&#39;t disagree, but how is good parenting possible when the people growing up to be parents are the very ones who grew up being bombarded by this kind of imagery in the first place?</p>

<p>Yet you say it doesn&#39;t matter how he looks. Also if you think the message is killing is good, you&#39;re not the brightest. I don&#39;t know if you play games yourself, but the trailer you linked is what the company uses to show off their game. They aren&#39;t saying &quot;killing people=sexy&quot;, they are saying ,&quot;Hey, look, if you buy our game here is what you can expect&quot;. </p>

There&#39;s a <em>lot</em> more going on than the superficial perspective you continue advocating.  I wouldn&#39;t doubt if this game in particular, or these types of games, are a favorite of yours.  Last thing you want to here is that you&#39;re not in as much control of your mind and your perspective as you think you are.</p>

<p>Instead of attempting cheap, ineffective ad hominems, maybe you might want to try digging deeper into reality and realizing that societal manipulation is ubiquitous and all-pervasive.  Here.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ3RzGoQC4s">Educate yourself</a>.</p>

<p>That&#39;s an easy one:  We live on a planet that has been <em>greatly</em> contrived toward that type of perspective.  All a company has to do to financially benefit is fall in line with that very type of m.o.  Tow that party line, so to speak.  If you create something relating to peace and wisdom on a planet geared toward violence and war (such as this one seems to be to a large and unfortunate extent), then you will likely not benefit as much as someone who makes games gratifying and advertising killing and murder.</p>

<p>Have you considered from a gameplay aspect how boring a game where you follow the rules/peacemaking game would be? No one would buy No Need for Speed: Sunday Drive, and I highly doubt anyone would buy Call of Duty: Advanced Politics. As good as peace is in real life, it makes for a boring video game. Could you imagine a game in which you woke up, brushed your teeth, and then went to UN peace talks? It would be boring to the average person.</p>

<p>You only say and think and feel that because your mind is so indoctrinated to only look at “cool games” from a perspective of violence, war, and “how many people you can kill!”.  This is, again, exactly the kind of mentality that the gaming industry and that this society/civilization breeds into the citizenry.  No surprise that you have it, but it is by no means the only way possible to engage in a gaming activity that is fulfilling and exciting.</p>

<p>The examples that you pointed out constitute quite a bit of a straw man fallacy, as those are not by any means the only type of gaming experiences that could be made that A) don’t have as their main point violence and the murdering others, and B) are fulfilling to the participants nonetheless.</p>

<p>Regardless, the point is that this society is <em>absolutely</em> structured to think in exactly the limited, “violence only!” manner that you have greatly illustrated here, and that type of caustic way of thinking contributes significantly to the ongoing societal ills that keep all of us down, manipulated, and enslaved as it were.</p>

<p>There is a big difference between portraying someone who&#39;s main goal is freedom and/or honor and/or the defense of whatever country they&#39;ve been convinced is worth dying for, and that individual ends up going to war and killing for it.  That&#39;s one thing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite another to center your focus of attention on an individual whose sole purpose is to kill as many people as possible without getting caught on the way toward finally killing the main person you&#39;re after.  And on the way, of course, you get &quot;rewarded&quot; with bonus points for extra kills and end up finding extra machine guns, hatchets, etc.</p>
