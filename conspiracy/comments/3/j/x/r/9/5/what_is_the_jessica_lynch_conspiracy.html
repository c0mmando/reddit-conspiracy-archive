    <div class="md"><p>As I understand it, she was involved in a firefight, injured, and subsequently taken to a hospital where she was apparently cared for appropriately by the medical staff.  At some point, the Special Forces came to the hospital and &quot;rescued&quot; her.  The &quot;conspiracy&quot; is why a SOF unit would be required to &quot;rescue&quot; a soldier from a hospital where she was being treated by non-combatant medical staff and which was not directly controlled by enemy forces.  It is possible that the rescue operation was really quite routine, but was perhaps embellished for political gain, and/or that the participation of Special Forces was more for training or similar purposes rather than being because their presence was necessarily required due to the dangers of the environment.  For the record:  I don&#39;t know.  Just winging it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going into specifics because i don&#39;t know how much is still classified.   Basically her unit got ambushed and she took a wrong turn in a panic, got lost, crashed her truck (getting some folk from her company killed in the process) and got captured.  The people who caught her were willing to give her over, but local forces weren&#39;t really willing to let her go without a fight.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mmmmkay.   I guess Wikipedia is the absolute truth then.   No sense in arguing with you since you read the article.  </p>

<p>As for all the details, i wasn&#39;t there.   I didn&#39;t go on the mission.   But i had friends who did, and a couple of em came back wrapped in a flag and no longer breathing.  Yes, the hospital was secure, but the route to the hospital wasn&#39;t.   It was primarily a spec ops mission, but some regular forces were used to provide support.  The support guys are the ones you don&#39;t hear about, even though they&#39;re usually the guys who take the the losses behind the scenes.</p>

<p>As for convincing you that I&#39;m not a liar, i don&#39;t really give a shit.  I was on the ground while you were back here reading obscure internet pages and thinking you&#39;re smarter than everyone else.   I have absolutely nothing to prove to you or anyone else.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you were apparently there at the time, you are not in the best position to remember all the stories about the hot little patriot who single-handedly fought the entire Iraqi army, down to the last bullet, while trying to protect her comrades. I&#39;m surprised there isn&#39;t a version of the story where she used a US flag as a tourniquet.</p>

<p>I doubt that anybody has <em>ever</em> seriously said it didn&#39;t happen. The issue with Lynch, <em>as she has said herself</em>, is that the story the media fed us was pure propaganda. It did happen, it just didn&#39;t happen the way were we told and an inordinate amount of resources were spent to &#39;rescue&#39; her.</p>
