<p>I&#39;m sure they keep things secret, as they always do, so they wouldn&#39;t even have to patent or publicly show the patent of whatever they are doing with the chemtrails. The hundreds of patents on geo-engineering is enough to prove chemtrails, get your head out of your ass bruhh</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. Watch and read stuff from all sides and make up your own mind. Dane Wigington has a lot to say about chemtrails, and the standard work on chemtrails is the video <em>What In The World Are They Spraying.</em> David Keith, in the video linked above, is a vocal opponent of geoengineering. So am I. But the qeoengineering he is talking about is slated to take place in the stratosphere, way above where airliners can fly. So having Keith voice-overs while showing photos of ordinary contrails is designed to make you think the contrails are the problem. They are not.</p>

<p>As for <em>WITWATS</em>, there are half a dozen videos on Youtube which tear its lack of logic to pieces. But watch it first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps magnetic was the wrong word. <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US7645326">Increasing the electromagnetic signal seems to be more accurate:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The retransmitted electromagnetic signal is greatly enhanced in an atmosphere charged with aluminum oxide nano particulate. According to this invention, the aluminum oxide nano particulate (hereinafter the “particulate”) is safely, pursuant to governmental safety regulations, introduced into the environment through the heating, ventilation and air conditioning apparatus (hereinafter “HVAC”). The external antenna is required as the particulate introduced into the environment would reflect the microwave remote interrogation signal before it entered the environment. Therefore, there is a need to capture the initial microwave interrogation from the remote interrogation signal and re-radiate this signal through a transformer. The transformer is connected by wire to the external antenna and the transformer is located within the environment under the cover of the particulate. In this manner, the re-radiated electromagnetic signal is reflected and intensified within the environment...</p>

<p>U.S. military research has focused radio-frequency beams at the ionosphere to boil targeted locations. A tool is used to focus and steer the radio frequency energy upward. This research, known as HAARP (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program) research project, is jointly sponsored by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy. HAARP has demonstrated that bouncing directed radio frequency transmissions off of the ionosphere can have dramatic effects in the power of communications and success of transmissions to submerged submarines...</p>

<p>Furthermore, research indicates that a great deal of electromagnetic signal interference is man made noise which includes ignition noise, neon signs, electrical cables, power transmission lines and welding machines. These noises can be exacerbated by ionospheric propagation or as a result of other environments working at the same frequency. This invention proposes that introducing aluminum oxide into the atmosphere of the environment will keep the noise of other competing RFID applications and man made noise out while reflecting the genuine and desired electromagnetic signal to the target RFID tags.</p>

<p>Prior art includes U.S. Pat. No. 4,762,426 by Foss which contemplates aluminum oxide being used to increase reflectivity as a multilayer dielectric. This invention contemplates a remote passive condition sensor apparatus such as a temperature or humidity sensor where it is not feasible to have electrical connections. The aluminum oxide is suggested as an indicator of temperature change as an agent of reflectance. This can be distinguished from the present invention in that the Foss invention does not contemplate aluminum oxide reflection as a means and system of reducing signal to noise ratio in a warehouse or distribution center environment.</p>

<p>The prior art includes a U.S. Pat. No. 5,003,186 by Hughes Aircraft which contemplates using aluminum oxide to ameliorate the effects of global warming. The Hughes invention can be distinguished from the present invention in that the present invention contemplates reflecting energy back into an environment. The Hughes patent contemplates reflecting sunlight back out into space. Hughes spraying, as described herein, is well known in the art. It is of concern to air traffic controllers who must route air traffic around sprayed areas as the aluminum oxide interferes with their radar systems. The aluminum oxide presents on Air Traffic Control radars as a “haze.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got it, I just don&#39;t think you and other advocates in your field need to be so verbose when putting the word out. Play to your audience. </p>

<p>What&#39;s a better way to get someone to listen to you, a long drawn out scientific explanation that makes them feel stupid and shuts their brain down or a simple easy to understand explanation? </p>

<p>Telling people they are polluting the atmosphere to get a stronger radio signal to submarines opens the door for them to inquire more into what you&#39;re saying. </p>

<p>So then your like, &quot;yeah they put small metal particles in the air like an open air antenna.&quot; </p>

<p>Then they&#39;re all, &quot;really? So what?&quot; Or &quot;are you sure? And wouldn&#39;t that harm them too?&quot; </p>

<p>So then your like, &quot;so what!? Well for one it causes all types of health problems and ecological destruction&quot; </p>

<p>Or &quot;yeah I&#39;m sure here&#39;s the patents, here&#39;s the treatments that they have but don&#39;t promote publicly...&quot; </p>

<p>Ya see, start a dialogue with the people your educating to encourage them to ask YOU questions. Bombarding people with long ass complicated explanations only turns them away. The world&#39;s systems acting on the average person is designed to spoon feed them instant gratification and ease. Essentially you have to hack that program and get them to flex their natural curiosity. If someone asks you a question they are being curious, you can get them curious by asking them something first. Whoever is asking the questions is controlling the conversation, you&#39;ll expect their questions as follow ups to yours. </p>

<p>Tl;dr quit preaching and start teaching.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought teaching is what I was doing with my response. I was hoping people would read through the whole thing (and some have) because the fact is: this topic <em>is</em> difficult for most to understand and I can&#39;t explain it much better or in a more concise way than this. When people say geoengineering is as simple as poisoning our skies, others yell &quot;PROVE IT!&quot; So, I tried to do that with other experts who actually know what the heck they&#39;re talking about explaining it instead of myself since it&#39;s actually <em>not</em> my field of expertise. I&#39;m just a human being that&#39;s seriously concerned about it, as I believe a lot more people should be. This compound is in the air you breathe every day. That&#39;s why it should be concerning. Yes, it is harming the people practicing geoengineering, too, but those same people aren&#39;t so concerned about that, from what I&#39;ve seen. I am pretty sure the superiors would rather think it&#39;s harmless and are ignoring the facts, <a href="https://youtu.be/2S_qCV8kFPo?t=10m14s">even from their own scientists</a>. By linking all of the other patents and whatnot that I did, I&#39;m trying to <em>prove</em> that this is <em>actually happening</em> because most people will just brush it off without some sort of evidence.</p>

<p>Personally, in every thread I see asking about geoengineering, the inquirer always gets shut down and discouraged before they can even continue asking questions because they get downvoted to oblivion. There were at least three different threads/comments asking about geoengineering today and I wasn&#39;t going to sit in all of them for hours today. I&#39;d like to try to enjoy the weekend. Most people won&#39;t write up a comment like what I did, so forgive my copy-pasted response. It&#39;s way more than what I see most people typing up for inquiring minds. If it&#39;s overwhelming for some, well, I can see that, but I&#39;m not sorry for that. People wanted information...I gave them information. Most won&#39;t even bother to leave one link, especially on this topic because most think it&#39;s absolute bunk. Also, I&#39;m pretty sure I asked a question at the beginning of my comment: &quot;What do you know about geoengineering?&quot; Sure, it&#39;s a general question, but people were asking about chemtrails, and geoengineering is a wholly new term for many. I&#39;m sorry that you think I&#39;m preaching. Sometimes, at least in my experience, that is the only way to get peoples&#39; attentions...with TONS of links. You can teach people your way, and I&#39;ll do it my way. I&#39;m not a spoon-feeding kind of person, though with all the information I gave out, I&#39;m pretty sure I did a good amount of the hard work for most people anyway.</p>

My approach may be too much, but I&#39;ve tried taking after some of the other users in this subreddit who take the time to write a lot of information with many links. Hopefully even just one person sees what I write and learns something from it. I&#39;ll try to parse it better, but I&#39;m not one for watering down a message, and I&#39;m really not a great teacher. I never wanted to become one. I&#39;m a seeker of knowledge and I like to share, even though sometimes I&#39;m practically dumping it on people. I apologize for misunderstanding you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Face palm ha-ha. That video proves my point, aluminum isn&#39;t magnetic. The aluminum is <em>shielded</em> from magnetic energy, which is different from electronic energy. Electronic energy can produce magnetic energy but the magnetic fields do not get attracted by non ferrous metal. The same experiment can be done with copper to get the same result. Non ferrous metal <em>&quot;blocks&quot;</em> magnetic fields, the opposite of absorb...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL. You ever seen an aluminum aerial antenna on someone&#39;s roof? Or an aluminum car antenna from the days before crack? You have never heard of Lenz law or eddy currents? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>No this is wrong. The conductive aluminum creates a eddy current when the magnet passes by it . Completely explained here. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current_brake">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current_brake</a></p>

<p>EDIT. If there was a material that blocks magnetism I could easily create free energy. It does not exist, they are working on it though. </p>

<p>You never heard of an electro magnet created by electric current? You never heard of electromagnetism? You have never seen an aluminum antenna on a radio? You know that aluminum antenna picks up radio waves, right?</p>

<p>That video was <strong>in response to your comment</strong> saying aluminum is not magnetic. </p>

<p>I haver been, except the whole conversation has been correcting your misunderstanding of electromagnetism. Here is a recap of what you have learned from me. </p>

<p><strong>Aluminum does not block magnetism, aluminum is conductive, aluminum is commonly used as an antenna, antennas absorb radio waves.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it&#39;s a good thing that conspiracists are cdrawing attention to them, even if it&#39;s for the wrong reason. Persistent contrails merge to form a haze of cirrus cloud which allows direct sunlight to mostly get through. But at night it also traps infra red heat which would normally be radiated into space. As you said; the net effect is part of the debate. Rosalind Peterson, founder of California Sykwatch, is on-message. She is calling for urgent action to study the effects of persistent contrails. </p>
