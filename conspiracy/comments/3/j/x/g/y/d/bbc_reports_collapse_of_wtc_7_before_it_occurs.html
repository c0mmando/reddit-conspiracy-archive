      <p>
       We've all seen the video where the BBC allegedly reports the collapse of WTC 7 before it happened. Many people here claim this was because of a slip-up by the media, and that they had foreknowledge of the collapse. Debunkers claim it was a misread of the script, which was supposed to mention that WTC 7 is in danger of the collapse. Every time I hear either of these two theories, I shake my head. Here's why they're both wrong:
      </p>
      <p>
       The background video, shown behind Jane Standley, does clearly show WTC 7 still standing. What's really going on here is that
       <strong>
        the background footage is not live. It is a recording of footage taken before the collapse.
       </strong>
       This is how most news stations, at least in 2001, went about with live broadcasts. When a reporter starts broadcasting live, they're standing in front of a green screen which, for most broadcasts, displays recorded video. Such was the case in the BBC footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no time stamps on the background footage (which makes sense, because nobody wants that to block the full view), but using Occam's Razor, we can all safely assume that a British broadcasting channel would have as little to do with the false flag that is 9/11 as a waitress from the streets of Manhattan. And we can both agree it definitely wasn't a botched script, it certainly didn't sound like it to me at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am posting this because I hate hearing this debate, and I hate hearing this video as proof of foreknowledge of the collapse. Instead it's diverting the attention to the real foreknowledge of the collapse, such as the eye witness testimonies that "they were thinking about bringing it down", and firefighters saying that they think the building will come down.

       And of course the key mistake the OP made is that it
       <strong>
        wasn't a background video, but a window behind the reporter
       </strong>
       , the OP is completely misinformation which many will suspect is deliberate.

       WTC7 was meant to have a plane in it, but the plane got delayed in airport congestion, so had to be shot down instead, the script for the day didn't work out as planned, hence we see a building reported as collapsed while it's still standing

        This has been proven in a UK court of law to no longer be just an allegation, but accepted as an actual fact. The BBC were in court over this, in regard to TV license fee claim, and they LOST.

      <p>
       Wrong. What was your line? "That's an utterly foolish claim. You should really be embarrassed."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a case which has been persistently
       <strong>
        lied
       </strong>
       about by some truthers.
       <a href="http://www.wscountytimes.co.uk/news/local/9-11-controversy-in-horsham-court-1-4829773">
        Here's what actually happened
       </a>
       The man trying to use that defense against paying his license fee, actually had it roundly rejected, wasn't even allowed to present any evidence to that end, and the judge "found Rooke guilty, and imposed a six month conditional discharge with £200 legal costs." Sorry, who lost again? The BBC
       <strong>
        weren't even involved
       </strong>
       , never mind "lost". That is a complete fabrication by the truther movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your claim their report was "accepted to be so in a court of law" is utterly without merit or foundation.

       Yet it still doesn't explain why WTC7 was demolished - it was barely damaged by fire and debris, yet it was demolished into its own footprint at near free fall acceleration at 5pm on 9/11.

       There's still no good explanation for that fact.

       It was a window behind the reporter, not a background video.  The script for the day said that WTC7 would have collapsed at that time, but the problem was it didn't have a plane in it, the plane intended for WTC7 was delayed in airport congestion, this meant a decision had to be made as to whether to still risk demoing the building

       That's a bad argument, because office fires in 2001-on are not hotter than office fires in the 1970's. WTC7 is the first and last building to ever collapse due to office fires. Hmmm.....

       On February 12, 2005, the 28 story Windsor Tower in Madrid, Spain suffered the collapse of the upper 11 floors of the building. The tower had a reinforced concrete inner-core surrounded by a traditional webbed steel-frame outer-perimeter. Between floors 16 and 17 was a 7-foot thick, reinforced concrete transfer floor, designed to act as a bulkhead and to support the steel framework of the upper 11 stories. An office fire began on the 21st floor and after 5 hours, the concrete inner-core could no longer support the melting steel outer-framework. The upper 11 stories collapsed down to street level with remnants of the upper 3 floors collapsing down on to the transfer floor. No one was killed. The building was a composite steel-frame and steel-reinforced concrete design.[17]

      <p>
       On May 10, 1993, the 4 story Kader Toy Factory in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand collapsed after fire broke out on the first floor and spread throughout the complex. The factory was in full production at the time and all fire exits were locked. 188 people were killed and over 500 others were injured. The building was a steel-frame design.[11]

       Weird how a steel building can collapse from an office fire, huh?

        The Windsor Tower (Spanish: Torre Windsor) was built in 1979 in the financial center of Madrid, Spain. This office building was 106 m high and had 32 floors of which 29 were above ground level and 3 below, thus ranking it as the eighth tallest building in Madrid (and 23rd in Spain). It was gutted by a huge fire on February 12, 2005, and

       So, you gave me a partially collapsed building, and a shitty made toy factory is Thailand. None of them fully collapsed and one of them was made so terribly, it wouldn't pass in the US. Nice work!

       Big difference. Wtc 7 had the fires on ground floors and up. Windsor was a high level fire, you can bet that if a similar fire was on the ground level of Windsor it would have gone down completely. I'm not sure if I should use smaller words, you seem like you need it though .

       Do you understand what a support does? Hint: It supports. When supports fail do you understand what happens? Hint:Collapse. And besides that, the building was showing signs of collapsing about an hour before it actually happened. Maybe you should research. But maybe you can't read, which seems likely considering your replies.

       No supports does not equal no resistance. The collapse in the manner we've seen would require multiple points of resistance to be removed almost at the same time. Any bit of undamaged or slightly less damaged structure would present resistance causing the building to slowdown and fall in an uneven fashion. Now, judging by your name I'm not replying to any response from you, lol.

       Skyscrapers are not supported by walls. They are supported by, you guessed it, supports. Wait, you didn't guess it. Lol, did you think a bunch of glass windows on each side of the building could hold it's weight? At least you admit you're "restarted".

       An office fire doesn't damage a concrete building. Look at the footage of buildings in Syria. Non has come down like WTC7.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or look at the Women's Section of Beelitz near Berlin. It was bombed (in 1945 iirc) and totally burned, but the building is still fine, even today. You can visit it and there are lots of photos of it.

       No view of the collapse shows the fires raging like they did in the hours that came before it. There's smoke, yes, but no fires. The smoke that WTC 7 was emitting before its collapse contained very little black smoke. Black smoke is indication that the fires are exceeding 1000 F. For the most part, the smoke was greyish white.

       That's what I'm saying. I know I'm open to anything anybody has to say the rebut my statements, but I'm not sure how a window in the video that Standley does not interact with somehow proves that she's actually standing in front of a live Manhattan skyline.

       How in the hell does a green screen projecting the skyline with a window in it rebut any of my statements? You don't have to be crazy to understand that unless Jane Standley interacts with it, the background could just be green screened. Broadcasting stations did it all the time. This is no different. It's the most logical scenario. And until you can prove me wrong, I'll assume that the event with the least amount of assumptions occurred. So far nobody has provided any evidence to the contrary.

       Yes, exactly. You seem to have it all figured out don't you. I made a post on Reddit about the most likely answer to an unlikely event, then you come over here and accuse me of being.. What?

       Sometimes we need to face facts and concede where it's right to concede. If some random guy 12 years later can persuade a judge into not making him pay a licence fee, more power to him. Nothing about the court case proves me wrong though.

       <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2007/03/part_of_the_conspiracy_2.html">
        BBC's explanation
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At 4.27pm, a BBC reporter, Greg Barrow, who is in New York, appears on our radio news channel, BBC Radio Five Live, and says: "We are hearing reports from local media that another building may have caught light and is in danger of collapse." He then responds to a follow-up question by saying "I'm not sure if it has yet collapsed but the report we have is talking about Building 7."
       </p>
       <p>
        At 4.53pm, on the same radio station, the programme's presenter, Fi Glover says "25 minutes ago we had reports from Greg Barrow that another large building has collapsed just over an hour ago."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So what appears to have happened is they misreported one of their own correspondents, and it snowballed from there. Just another one of the many, many false rumors which circulated on the day. What this actually indicates is that WTC 7 was badly enough damaged, that reports of its collapse were plausible enough to be passed on immediately, without cross-checking.

       So the reality as that a plane was meant to hit WTC7 that day, but it got delayed in airport congestion, this meant that there was doubt over whether to still take down WTC7 or if people would get suspicious and work out it wouldn't have collapsed like that without a plane in it.  The BBC script was now inaccurate, but as soon as the BBC reported the collapse the message quickly go through to the grand planners to quickly demo WTC7 and hope nobody noticed.

       That actually makes a lot of sense. I'm not sure why everyone else is downvoting you but this definitely seems like a likely scenario. We can't take a single court case like it was a manuscript for what happened that day, and while I don't want to come off as ignorant, nothing about this court case really disproves what I said (unless something in there clearly does, in which case please do tell!). I'm glad you dropped by to share your thoughts though!

       It certainly doesn't, and what you're saying is what I'm saying. The BBC conspiracy is false. The controlled demolition theory is true.

       It was a window behind the reporter, not a background video.  The script for the day said that WTC7 would have collapsed at that time, but the problem was it didn't have a plane in it, the plane intended for WTC7 was delayed in airport congestion, this meant a decision had to be made as to whether to still risk demoing the building
