       An assistant professor from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point recently declared that professionals critical of the “War on Terror” constitute a “treasonous” opposition that should be subject to military force.
      </p>
      <p>
       He believes the U.S. should have the right to attack people who are critical of U.S. military operations — specifically, professionals, legal scholars, journalists, and other people effectively spreading ideas that oppose war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Professor William C. Bradford went as far as to publish a
       <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2597971">
        long academic paper
       </a>
       in the National Security Law Journal that aggressively promotes suppressing dissent about military force, civilian casualties, and expanding military operations in the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using the excuse that victims would be “lawful targets,” Bradford argues that “law school facilities, scholars’ home offices and media outlets where they give interviews” should be targeted with military force to suppress dissent. He asserted that the war on terror
       <a href="https://www.nslj.org/issues/vol3-iss2/">
        should be expanded
       </a>
       , “even if it means great destruction, innumerable enemy casualties, and civilian collateral damage.”
      </p>
      <p>
       He further suggested that the U.S. should wage “total war” on “Islamism,” using “conventional and nuclear force and [psychological operations]” to “leave them prepared to coexist with the West or be utterly eradicated.”
      </p>
      <p>
       He said that “Threatening Islamic holy sites might create deterrence, discredit Islamism, and falsify the assumption that decadence renders Western restraint inevitable.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite his self-description as an “associate professor of law, national security and strategy,” a representative of the National Defense University has tried to distance the school from Bradford by saying he wasn’t part of the staff, but rather a contracted professor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sporting a long history of exaggeration and pro-military extremism, “He resigned from Indiana University’s law school in 2005 after his military record showed he had exaggerated his service,” according to
       <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/29/west-point-professor-target-legal-critics-war-on-terror?CMP=fb_us">
        The Guardian
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Though the man seems to be held in high esteem by the military, he spoke with such disregard for human rights that the National Security Law Journal had to apologize.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NSLJ released a statement on the
       <a href="https://www.nslj.org/">
        front page of its website
       </a>
       , saying it
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        …made a mistake in publishing [the] highly controversial article…
       </p>
       <p>
        The substance of Mr. Bradford’s article cannot fairly be considered apart from the egregious breach of professional decorum that it exhibits,” it admitted. “We cannot ‘unpublish’ it, of course, but we can and do acknowledge that the article was not presentable for publication when we published it, and that we therefore repudiate it with sincere apologies to our readers.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Ironically, Bradford has a Master of Laws (LL.M.) degree from Harvard University with a focus in Human Rights Law.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a man who is apparently incorporating his violent philosophy into his teaching at West Point. He started on August 1st 2015 — after he published his article.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is only the tip of the iceberg in forming a complete understanding of the ideological fabric held by many of the war hawks in U.S. Military.

       From a completely academic standpoint, morality aside, he's not wrong.  It just reads like something out of The Art of War and not something you'd expect from an Academic Institution in a modern civilized democratic state.  That's what's shocking about it.   I mean, is the course called How to Rule With an Iron Fist 101?  Because shutting down opposing or even mildly critical viewpoints is a good starting point.

       LOL  Gotta say the guy holds strong opinions.  Thank God someone so extreme is not in charge of anything.  He might, personally, be able to do better in a country other than the USA, where such philosophies already ARE in practice, say China.  Sucks to be a dissident there.  I think the Chinese would be happy to have you Mr Bradford, and you could have a more powerful position than associate professor.  You might consider moving.

       Where in actuality the guy
       <em>
        resigned
       </em>
       the day before this piss-poor excuse for news was published.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/09/01/former-indiana-law-professor-said-inflate-resume-resigns-west-point/71554736/">
        Newspaper article from the day before
       </a>
       - "Former Indiana law professor said to inflate resume resigns from West Point"
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't meant the guy isn't a shitheel - he clearly is. But the rampant criticism of his ideas and his service record embellishment that forced him to resign clearly indicate that this is not as widespread in military academia as Antimedia would like you to think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course this could be incredibly lazy journalism from Antimedia - in which case there's even
       <em>
        less
       </em>
       of a reason for you to post it.

         You won't get a good reaction from this subreddit on this topic unfortunately. Some people seem to be convinced that it only exists "to discredit this sub". That is clearly silly since this sub is a tiny part of the internet and the idea has exploded in many places.

         Of course there is disinfo out there. Massive amounts of it and varying levels of it. The way to avoid being smeared by association is to point out that there is no association. I don't consent to allow anyone to speak for me. Whenever anyone makes a statement like "conspiracy theorists say" I point out that they are setting up for a strawman argument. Discussion on topics can't be allowed to be shut down by the threat of association smearing since that makes the threat itself an effective disinfo tool.

       r/conspiracy acknowledges material whose class of evidence is so specious that it is surprising that the OPs can form sentences using human syntax rather than onomatopoeia. This however shows the ideological grounds that undergird real military education. How is that not relevant when many people are arguing, often on speculative grounds that the government aggressively contradicts the needs of its citizens?
