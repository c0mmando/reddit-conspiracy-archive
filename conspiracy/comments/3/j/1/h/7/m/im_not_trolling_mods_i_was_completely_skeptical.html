        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Then I started reading DMT drug reports in accredited scientific studies, some in forums. I start seeing a consistency: Contact with alien beings but one in particular showed up. Reptiles, humanoid reptiles, alligator-like, scaly skin, most of the time malevolent in nature. Reports of rape, probing and so forth.
After hearing about so many mentions from people who never knew about the subject beforehand, I feel there is something to this Reptilian phenomenon.
If these beings can invade the thoughts of DMT users, why not the world&#39;s powerful?
To be quite frank, I&#39;m scared of this reality. Anyone else having similar thoughts and theories?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s plenty of reported activity on DMT - reptilian, jaguar, snake, and the Elves.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/The-Antipodes-Mind-Phenomenology-Experience/dp/0199252939">The Antipodes of the Mind</a> if you are interested in a more in depth study of the effects of DMT (albeit in the ayahuasca form).</p>

<p>The effects of drugs are largely dependent on the persons mental state - you will find a consistency that those that are susceptible to the kind of paranoia that uneducated &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; tend to have will often have bad trips - self manifesting the things that they fear - nightmare spirals. Those with a healthy skepticism, and a healthy mindset tend to have experiences that are profoundly moving in nature, often that 15 minutes or those few hours will have a profound and lasting effect through life.</p>

<p>There are many instances of alien communication under high dose psychedelics - of this there is no doubt, but I don&#39;t think we can really meaningfully dissect what that is all about - as it tends to occur in a state of consciousness that exists beyond the reach of words.</p>

<p>If you can find it online, there is a great series of articles from a guy who practices enochian magic (John Dee / Edward Kelley) and talks about the kind of interdimensional portals he had created under the use of DMT / ayahuasca while reciting the calls of the aethyrs, and how he was, afterwards, haunted for life with persistent visions, hallucinations, and communications with reptilian entities. Anyway search for that articles - it&#39;s been at least 10 years since I last read it, and I don&#39;t have a link.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a strange and twisted and beautiful and unimaginable world out there - beyond the confines of what goes in under this thin athmosphere on this one lonely planet. I would first worry about things that you can prove to yourself to be true, because there is an infinity of things that you can imagine to be true that can cripple you into a fear spiral, and most of these things only exists in the world of pure imagination (although arguments can be made that a large enough group, believing a fiction, can still act upon it as if it were true) :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To play devil&#39;s advocate, I think Icke&#39;s theory is that these are ancient higher-dimensional creatures (a &#39;Lower-vibrational, 5th-dimensional, service-to-self predator species&#39; as he puts it.) They are not actually Earth-reptilian, but they have an appearance that to our eyes resembles reptilian species. This is just to clarify his view.</p>

<p>Now with DMT, it is beginning to look like one of the things that happens, is that the &#39;dimensional-veil&#39; is lifted for a short time, and one gets a look through the holographic envelope that we all live in. So I think one possible theory as to how these concepts could be connected, is that maybe some people are able to view some of the goings-on behind the veil, with the help of DMT. Maybe their encounters give us an insight as to our true current situation, and that these beings actually <em>are</em> in our daily lives to one extent or another.  Spooky shit to consider.. but hey, just theorizing over here :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not really an Icke follower so I don&#39;t know about his Saturnian and lunar theories. This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve heard these hypotheticals suggested.</p>

<p>Why someone was telling me about the hollow moon just the other day. I agree that math apparently indicates the moon&#39;s mass precludes it&#39; hollowness, but that&#39;s based on some assumptions about uniformity of mass I&#39;d think. I&#39;d be interested to see what math was produced when we bombed the moon a few years back. I vaguely recall it mentioned that it &quot;rang like a bell.&quot;</p>

<p>Phobos is likely hollow. I dunno anything about the ring as though. Isn&#39;t it supposed to be some kinda antenna? </p>

<p>How about the sun? Stargates anyone?</p>

in the Quran it says:&quot;they live in a place from where you cannot see them but they can see you &quot;

    <div class="md"><p>also, i love the unifying idea of djinn which replace all the extraterrestrials, ghosts, elves, mermaid... as they are all that at once, divided into many &quot;sects&quot;.
some may have amazing technology while others choose to live in the woods.
I&#39;ve been told by a friend that in Mayotte, you can get next to daily encounters with them when you get to close to the forest.
also their relationship with distance and time is weird for us: they pass through a keyhole like if it&#39;s a door, or they can live in expanded time (even years per days).
