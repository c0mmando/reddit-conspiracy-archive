    <div class="md"><p>The Bush family is very powerful, and essentially no different than a mafia family ...</p>

<p>but they aren&#39;t all-powerful. Notice how Bush Sr. wasn&#39;t re-elected, and Bush Jr. had to cozy up with his father&#39;s enemies to get elected.</p>

<p>Also, Yeb Bush was supposed to be a shoe-in this time around but he&#39;s struggling against ... Donald Trump, the reality TV actor.</p>

<p>I agree. I think Trump will be kept in place up until the end (<em>or at least as long as they can stretch this thing out</em>) and then at the last minute Bush will be brought in (<em>again, so to speak</em>) with lots of positive media attention and presented as the &quot;reasonable&quot; candidate who has a chance of winning.</p>

<p>Call me a cynic but I&#39;m one of those guys who thinks the candidates were already picked by people richer and more powerful than us a long time ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really think Trump is doing this on his own volition,  and really is a wild card from left field they really didn&#39;t think would strike a chord with people.  I don&#39;t like the man,  and I think he&#39;s just as slimy as the rest,  but he&#39;s at least pretty damn frank about it. One thing that bothered me though is he seemed different after signing that pledge with the RNC.  The tone in his voice and his mannerism changed.  It was...... Odd.  </p>

<p>So do you think that Clinton, the man who assisted the Bushes in running drugs from south america, was any different than the Bushes themselves?</p>

<p>It&#39;s called &quot;national security&quot; and the Bushes and their circle via the Dulles brothers have controlled it at least since the 60s and probably even before that.</p>

<p>The only lapse of control, in my judgement, was the election of Carter, who Bush did a real number on to ensure he would not be re-elected.</p>

<p>But this is absurdity. The title of this thread is misleading and no research was done. You should do your job as a mod and tag this as misleading bullshit or even remove it.</p>

<p>Warning me for calling it out is retarded. If thats the issue we have here, ban me. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll suffer to hard. I don&#39;t mean to be rude here, but the fact that this is being upvoted and the mods are ignoring the fact that is BS is really annoying.
