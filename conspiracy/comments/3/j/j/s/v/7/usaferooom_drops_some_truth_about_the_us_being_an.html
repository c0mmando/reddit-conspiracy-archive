       The Bush family is very powerful, and essentially no different than a mafia family ...
      </p>
      <p>
       but they aren't all-powerful. Notice how Bush Sr. wasn't re-elected, and Bush Jr. had to cozy up with his father's enemies to get elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Yeb Bush was supposed to be a shoe-in this time around but he's struggling against ... Donald Trump, the reality TV actor.

      <p>
       I agree. I think Trump will be kept in place up until the end (
       <em>
        or at least as long as they can stretch this thing out
       </em>
       ) and then at the last minute Bush will be brought in (
       <em>
        again, so to speak
       </em>
       ) with lots of positive media attention and presented as the "reasonable" candidate who has a chance of winning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Call me a cynic but I'm one of those guys who thinks the candidates were already picked by people richer and more powerful than us a long time ago.

       I really think Trump is doing this on his own volition,  and really is a wild card from left field they really didn't think would strike a chord with people.  I don't like the man,  and I think he's just as slimy as the rest,  but he's at least pretty damn frank about it. One thing that bothered me though is he seemed different after signing that pledge with the RNC.  The tone in his voice and his mannerism changed.  It was...... Odd.

       So do you think that Clinton, the man who assisted the Bushes in running drugs from south america, was any different than the Bushes themselves?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's called "national security" and the Bushes and their circle via the Dulles brothers have controlled it at least since the 60s and probably even before that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only lapse of control, in my judgement, was the election of Carter, who Bush did a real number on to ensure he would not be re-elected.

       That whole exchange led me to sitting through the 3.5 hour JFK to 9/11 Documentary.  I'm not usually someone who eats up every conspiracy,  but I felt like all the nagging thoughts in the back of my mind have been fully brought to consciousness. Everything in the documentary is so damn compelling.

       This is actually making me really angry right now.  The people's reactions in bestof, and the fact that this obviously intelligent and well spoken individual felt compelled to delete his account.  That's fucked up, and only proves how right he is and how strongly this social narrative has been constructed.

       Not shadowbanned, deleted (I'm guessing he deleted his own account after getting harassed by countless Redditors on both sides of the issue, but who knows). The comment is pretty damn popular now too. A TON of upvotes and it was gilded a couple of times. People aren't completely blind.

       Being warned because I call out an obviously stupid post with literally no conspiracy?

       Ban me if thats an issue. The user was not shadowbanned, this post is fucking stupid, and you are stupid for not removing this thread after it was pointed out that it is bullshit.

       You got warned for breaking rule 10, no more no less.  Just stop with the douchey rhetoric and there won't be any issues.  Unless you're trying to get banned, in which case just let me know and I'll be more than happy to accommodate you.

       No, I don't want to get banned, I actually enjoy this sub when its at least trying to make sense of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is absurdity. The title of this thread is misleading and no research was done. You should do your job as a mod and tag this as misleading bullshit or even remove it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Warning me for calling it out is retarded. If thats the issue we have here, ban me. I don't think I'll suffer to hard. I don't mean to be rude here, but the fact that this is being upvoted and the mods are ignoring the fact that is BS is really annoying. It makes every thread on this sub look like bullshit when bullshit like this is among them.

       You were warned for attacking the sub and its users, what do you not understand about that?  It really isn't a difficult concept.  Express whatever opinion you want, including calling out OP, but do so without being a dickhead and there won't be any issues.  The rules are right there on the sidebar - read them.  Cheers, enjoy your weekend.

       I just don't understand why you are allowing this post, with a misleading bullshit title, stay on the page if it is entirely bullshit.
