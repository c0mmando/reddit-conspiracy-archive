       Lets start with the white house at the time who ordered the EPA to lie about the air quality at ground zero that directly caused more death than the attacks themselves. Conspiracy to commit mass murder and treason. Also the EPA officials who knew better and followed the orders of the white house should be held responsible and charged as conspirators.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rumsfeld for gross negligence not being available to give shoot down and scramble orders until after the damage was done. How many people died because of that. Treason. Conspiracy to commit mass murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rumsfeld was in public and there are witnesses on record stating Rumsfeld was intentionally unavailable during the attacks when he should have been readily available to do his appointed job.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a laundry list of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feel free to add to the list of criminals and crimes they should be charged with surrounding the events of 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its time to start this conversation opposed to trying to convince those who can't, or choose not to see the obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Grand Jury would have not problem at all issuing indictments on just the two things I listed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's see the conversation move to who should be charged with what and demanding justice. The truth movements investigation has been over for some time. Now it's time the prosecution and justice movement.

       Here, here.  This is what
       <em>
        I'm

       talking about.  TPTB know that so long as they allow the "whodunnit?" debate to continue going, they won't actually have to pay any price because the masses will just keep spinning their/our wheels trying to figure out and debate "whodunnit?" or if it was even done at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's ultimately a massive diversion tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no longer any debate that a false flag most definitely happened.  IT HAPPENED.  There's even quite a lot of overwhelming evidence pointing to various specific individuals and groups that were directly and indirectly involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fucking move on.  Time to go toward focusing on bringing down those that did it.

       The NEOCONs and everyone involved with PNAC would probably argue that they committed 9/11 to secure the future of America.
      </p>
      <p>
       These warped people see themselves as the ultimate patriots, willing to do anything to protect America's position. 
They are fundamentalist Americans, if you like. Doing deeds no ordinary man could comprehend.

       Do you think they believe that? I see why you might, but on the other hand, lately I've been entertaining the idea that many of them are psychopathic, and very well know that they are not doing anything for the greater good, but do it simply because they can. Of course, this only applies to a fraction of the people on the field, I'm talking about people like Cheney. Then there are simply people who like you suggested, want to better the world, and think that their actions in some twisted way will lead towards a better America. These people are simply misguided assholes, fuckhats, and dicknoses, but they are not psychopaths. What do you think?

       In my experience, very few people think of themselves as the villain. It's
       <em>
        possible
       </em>
       that some of them really are just doing evil shit for kicks, but people can justify anything to themselves. I mean, most people don't go in to this doing absolutely evil things--they slide down the moral slope and justify more and more to themselves. They see the pain they're causing others as their own difficult, heroic sacrifice to protect the greater good. They're making tough choices that have to be made, they do the hard things so other people won't have to. They squish any doubt they might feel and parrot the party line, and at a certain point what choice do they have but to keep doing that? Otherwise they'll have to acknowledge that the things they've done are horrific, that they've behaved in monstrous ways. It's far easier to drown yourself in others who understand that the end justifies the means and smother any doubt you might feel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost no one who does evil things does it while realizing and acknowledging that they're evil. I mean, even those child abuse rings we hear about? A friend of mine was trafficked, and she wrote about how people didn't seem to see themselves as doing something wrong, because the kid they were hurting didn't have a name, wasn't fully real to them. Some of them talked to her and they were full of justifications for how this was okay because they were hurting her instead of
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       kids, instead of their own kids. Who loved kids and would never hurt a child. They said it helped both of them deal with their urges, how my friend wanted to be treated this way. Maybe they had doubts about whether how they were behaving was okay, but it was easy enough to starve them out by justifying, not thinking and not really looking the crying kid in the eye.

       You're absolutely correct mate, and that is such an important point you made. However, and as a foreword I should say I'm absolutely not an expert on psychopathy, but last year I took a class that changed the way I see things. It was about psychopathy, and I learned so much about the term 'psychopath'  that I had never been introduced to. Psychopath is not a misnomer for a crazy person, or a dickhead, it's a real condition in which someone is mostly incapable of feeling human emotions. Specifically, the emotions they have trouble comprehending are guilt, remorse, empathy, and altruism. There are people out there, many of them, who wear their "Cleckley's Mask", after Harvey Cleckley, the doctor who gave the psychopath it's name. The Clecklian Mask is the one the psychopath uses to blend in with normal people; like a chameleon they change aspects of their self to match their surroundings, until they are alone. Psychopaths make up about one percent of the population, so before you go thinking they're some very rare breed, you may have encountered one today.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing about politics is that it is a breeding ground for psychopaths. Because psychopaths mostly feel no guilt, they are almost superhuman in the way they are able to fuck  normal people over, all while maintaining your trust. A psychopath will steal your wallet, and then help you look for it. These people make up a staggeringly large amount of corporate CEO's, because the business world is a literal breeding ground for these people. They excel where others cannot, they press on when other's consciousness stops them. They get done what needs to be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why there are so many psychopathic politicians, they are willing to go to distance that most, non-psychotic but very deranged people will not touch. I recommend the book Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go To Work by Robert Hare, another huge name in the psychopathy field.

       To us regular folks their behavior seems psychotic, but put them under a grilling and I bet they'd claim they are more American than apple pie, willing to sacrifice 3000 of their own in order to protect the rest into the 21st century. 
Dont get me wrong, these cunts are sick bastards, but in a twisted way they probably think they done right for the country, when in reality they're just fucking terrorists.

       I should say I didn't mean that every single one of these people are psychopaths, just that from what I've learned, high-level politics and very wealthy businesses are places where they are more often thought to be. It's just an idea, anyway. I'm not suggesting these people are reptiles for christ's sake! Just that they have a neurological problem that allows them to endure an environment where others cannot. But you're right, that kinda gives them an out, where most of these people are just terrorists, like you said.

       It certainly seems that way, but I'm really not sure.  I think most people just don't care and go with the belief that makes them more comfortable, but that's really just a comfort thing, not a stern belief thing.

       Conspiracy theories like this will live forever - just look at the 'moon hoax' and JFK stuff that's still alive - but if nobody manages to get any sort of legal or political change from them, then they will obviously peter out in the public eye. Most people don't spend much time on such things, and short of some actual consequences, they will eventually move on.

       The whole 9/11 thing would ROAR back to life in the public eye if someone came up with just ONE single solid fact showing some conspiracy theory to be true.  That's all it would take, just one piece of really solid evidence.  But no such thing has been found in the 14 years since 9/11.

       That's probably true. By nature, though, conspiracy theories tend to revolve around anomaly hunting - finding unexplained or unexplainable details. The issue being, of course, that they're
       <em>
        unexplained.
       </em>
       You can't build a case on that - you need something which
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       be explained - but only by a conspiracy.

       The 9/11 Truth's problem is not having any actual experts in their corner. Their list of 2,000+ "engineers" and "architects" are either only tangentially relevant (environmental engineers aren't really helpful) or just retired/fired people who are pushing a book.

       We will never get the numbers. It's already virtually a police state.
As long as people bank with banks they control they have all the power.

       The illuminati are incredibly smart they've been dumbing down society since the 80s in an highly organised plan.
( see the leaked illuminati doc - secret weapons for quiet wars ). Every thing in that  80s doc has transpired,  so they are really thinking ahead.

       The origins of bit coin are too mysterious to trust. Many Bitcoin insiders have said it not as secure as people think.
It's clearly a setup.
Besides any money not tied to real physical world value is ultimately just bullshit.
That's why it's banned in many countries they know the score.

       The origins and whereabouts of Satoshi Nakamoto are mysterious indeed. Money not being tied to real world value would be what you have in your wallet or purse right now: fiat money. Not many countries are banning bitcoin and some are at least trying to understand the implications the technology is capable of manifesting. I'm certainly not an expert but an interested and somewhat excited "follower".  It seems one of the best speakers and  well informed people of the bitcoin economy is Andreas Antanoplous. His presentation to the Canadian Senate was respectful and educational. Bitcoin market capitalization is today about 3.5 billion dollars.

       You don't seem to grasp that real banking power comes from having shit loads of real gold. The people who own all the gold, and hence all banking are the illuminati.  Not governments!
Bitcoin is the biggest scam going, it's their way of controlling the black markets.
Which before they had no control. Now they do, and everyone has fallen for it hook line and sinker.
Numbers in a computer just isn't real money.
Not that normal money isn't now either -  but it was, that's the point.
I suggest you watch the "money as debt" documentaries on you tube to truly understand the situation.
People with real power have physical assets - like gold etc.. Full stop.
So unless you have, you are simply a nobody that is controlled.

       Think about it, things like silver/gold will always have value.
Doesn't matter if it goes up a bit or down, you can always exchange it for goods in any culture, time, situation or place.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why the illuminati hoard all the gold, it's real money.
The rest is just fake bullshit agreements. Agreements that can be easily broken. You think people are going to accept Bitcoin in a war zone etc..?
      </p>
      <p>
       You clearly have no idea what money really is. I'm talking about real physical gold.

       I have thought about it and that's why I hold physical gold and silver rather than just talk about it. It is a fairly solid investment and again, that is why I own precious metals. Personally, I believe precious metals to be a bargain right now because quantitative easing has surely to catch up one day and that should make pm's climb significantly. 
Interesting note: Every year there are about 2500 tons of gold mined in the world.  With bitcoin, there will only ever be 21 million "coins" mined. A set cap amount makes for a deflationary currency. FYI - deflationary means that it goes up in value not down like inflationary fiat currency.

       Lol, the amount of gold " mined " doesn't really compare to digital mining. 
Because like diamonds it's actually strictly controlled to maintain value.
Besides bit coin mining is pure bull shit, it's just who has the fastest custom processors.
Which is getting cheaper, the whole concept is really quite silly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even mentally compare bullshit like Bitcoin to real physical stuff. It has no real world value, it never will, it's an imaginary construct and agreement.

        Professor Steven Jones, one of the scientists who made the 'WTC nano-thermite composite' discovery, and one of the writers of the study published in The Open Chemical Physics Journal, has offered his WTC dust samples for NIST to use in their own tests, and has asked NIST to acquire their own materials for the tests, but NIST apparently has not even replied to his letters......For NIST and debunkers, Professor Jones has replied, "They don't need my dust to test. They have plenty of dust of their own where they know the chain of custody. They just won't test it."

       I guess the claim here is that Harrit, Jones et al planted thermite in their dust samples? Or that older samples of normal dust produce the same byproduct as thermite? Or that older samples of normal dust account for the 610,000 ppb of benzene??

       seems to disagree with this statement.  Lots of people say there should be or should have been more investigation.  Some say the govt probably did or should have known more before 9/11 occurred.  Lots of people want to see Bush and Cheney investigated and punished, usually for things after 9/11.  But certainly there is not a majority saying 9/11 was an inside job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just off-hand, I'd guess 95% or more of my family and relatives think the govt explanation probably is correct.  I agree with them.

       To try and understand the thinking behind terror acts such as 9/11, one should look to Leo Strauss and his interpretation of Plato's Noble Lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deception for Strauss is not just an unavoidable bi-product of politics but a central and necessary part of it, a condition of “perpetual deception” between the rulers and the ruled being the sine qua non of a stable society. Strauss suggests that “noble lies” therefore have a key role to play in uniting and guiding the mass of the population –the elite, in other words, need to proliferate certain “myths” in order to give people meaning and purpose and to ensure stability in society, on the basis that a populace dedicated to the relentless examination of what Nietzsche called “deadly truths” can never be conducive to social cohesion and a stable social order. As another Strauss analyst summarizes, he advocates a society in which “the people are told what they need to know and no more”, and he puts forward certain key myths that he claims all governments need to exert control.
      </p>
      <p>
       One crucial myth Strauss advocated was that of nationalism. Following a Hobbesian line of thinking he argues that mankind’s inherently aggressive nature can only be restrained by a powerful nationalistic state: “because mankind is intrinsically wicked, he has to be governed,” he wrote. “Such governance can only be established, however, when men are united –and they can only be united against other people” [emphasis added]. In other words, Strauss believed that “a political order can be stable only if it is united by an external threat”. Moreover, according to Drury “following Machiavelli, he maintained that if no external threat exists, then one has to be manufactured.”
      </p>
      <p>
       So “perpetual war, not perpetual peace, is what Straussians believe in” says Drury, and one only has to look at the mission statements of groups like the Project for a New American Century (PNAC) and the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), both of which are overflowing with disciples of Strauss, to see how this has translated into what she terms an “aggressive, belligerent foreign policy” and the advocacy of a world dominated by U.S. military power. According to her, “Strauss’ neoconservative students see foreign policy as a means to fulfill a ‘national destiny’ –as Irving Kristol defined it already in 1983 –that goes far beyond the narrow confines of a ‘myopic national security.’”
      </p>
      <p>
       In the days following the 9/11 attacks, the Pentagon established an agency known as the Office of Special Plans (OSP), charged with the specific task of finding evidence of WMD and/or links between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda, and somehow nailing it together into a case for the invasion of Iraq. Working under Wolfowitz, the OSP was headed by another of Strauss’s students, Abram Shulsky. In 1999 Shulsky had co-written an article about Strauss and intelligence entitled Leo Strauss and the World of Intelligence (By Which We Do Not Mean Nous); in Greek philosophy the term nous means ‘the highest form of rationality’. Writing in the New Yorker, Seymour Hersh noted that Shulsky and his co-author, PNAC chairman Gary Schmitt, allude in this essay to Strauss’s theory of esoteric writing, in which he observes that, “great philosophers, hesitant to tell the whole story of what they believed, used concealed messages in their writing. Only the very wise could understand the real truth.”

       I should say I didn't mean that every single one of these people are psychopaths, just that from what I've learned, high-level politics and very wealthy businesses are places where they are more often thought to be. It's just an idea, anyway. I'm not suggesting these people are reptiles for christ's sake! Just that they have a neurological problem that allows them to endure an environment where others cannot. But you're right, that kinda gives them an out, where most of these people are just terrorists, like you said.

       Most people can't handle what's really been going on.  There simply aren't enough smart People who can see it doesn't add up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really basic facts, like those planes can't travel that speed at that height,  wings cannot penetrate the towers etc..
There are mile long list of facts that simply don't add up.
