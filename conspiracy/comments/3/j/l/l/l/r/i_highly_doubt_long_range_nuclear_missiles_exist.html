    <div class="md"><p>I envy you. Wish I could believe that ICBM&#39;s aren&#39;t real and that a handful of humans didn&#39;t have the ability to annihilate the whole of humanity within an hour or two. Sorry to say but you are absolutely incorrect, they are very real. If nothing you&#39;ve seen thus far in your life proves that to you then I won&#39;t bother trying with links to the multitude of footage or factual data available out there. All I&#39;ll say is this- All my life I&#39;ve watched rockets and shuttles take man, animal, and equipment into space. Witnessed it with my own eyes mere miles from the launch pads at KSC. Then return those men, animals, and equipment back to earth safely.  If we can do that, why wouldn&#39;t we be able to strap a nuclear weapon to the same rocket, and bring it down over any point on the globe?  Did we have 40+ year standoff with the USSR over nothing? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did a lot of research that led me to this theory, you can research it too - you might also get to realize this specific threat is not real. tho then of course - there&#39;s plenty of other real threats , but still it&#39;s nice to get clarity. I actually started with moon landing. if you research that and see it was staged - and follow all of Nasa stuff - you can start to see how much of it is theatrics - not just the moon landing. then the very important question is Why? I couldn&#39;t answer that for a while. but one day it dawned on me - researching stuff about deception in war -- it was all a system of validation for star wars - it was all a paper tiger of fascination and intimidation. just check it out. if you research it enough it will start to be apparent. of course - first it sounds ridiculous, but - thats how they want it to sound - that&#39;s the point - loose lips sink ships - the most important commodity here is knowledge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow that&#39;s was a lot of words that amount to absolutely zero facts or knowledge.  So by your logic not only are the ICBM&#39;s fake, so was the moon landings?  Basing your conclusions of one cockamamie conspiracy on another cockamamie conspiracy is probably not the best way to find factual information.  I can see that you are too far gone to save from the &quot;everything is fake&quot; mindset that most people in the sub seem to be stuck in. But I guess ignorance is bliss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are blanketing whatever doesn&#39;t make sense to you by saying - you must think everything is fake. I do not think everything is fake - you are wrong in choosing to say this. These are specific cases of fakery I am recognizing and they are all interconnected. And there are specific reasons for recognizing them. You don&#39;t have to see it - you don&#39;t have to recognize it - you don&#39;t have to see validity in researching it. But know if you say those who see it think everything is fake - you are creating your own propaganda &amp; you are creating your own ignorance. </p>

<p>if you say people who recognize some fakery think everything is fake - you are perpetuating a lie and a conspiracy all your own. stick with the facts even about the people you do not understand. you may say you think I am wrong about nasa and missiles. but you may not say I think everything is fake, that is your lie. do not lie. and specifically do not make up lies about people you disagree with. it makes all the rest of your arguments weaker. debate with integrity. </p>

<p>also to steer your need wings/ rudders / wheels - anything to alter how you are creating traction with the the air (or whatever is) around you. a rocket has no external design pieces that can be adjusted to alter it&#39;s direction.  it&#39;s all smooth all around. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To get a rocket into orbit, we have to make its trajectory an arc. There&#39;s actually very little &quot;up&quot; involved in lifting things into orbit, it basically is getting high enough that wind resistance is negligible and then moving parallel to the surface faster than gravity is pulling you back down. Also, rockets 100% can be steered</p>

<p>You drew a direct logical connection between downvotes --&gt; I&#39;m right.</p>

<p>I pointed out another possibility, that is plausible if not more so.</p>

<p>Your response to this other logical scenario is literally</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but like I said Main stream media tactics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, you referenced a loose concept to discount what I said.</p>

<p>Note that nothing about your first supposition is impossible.  It IS possible that is what is going on.</p>

<p>But to hold that it is the ONLY possibility is... incorrect. </p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>Kinetic weapons are feasible, but to be deployed in sufficient numbers/mass the only viable source for them is extra-planetary.</p>

<p>That is, they get their effect from being massive and falling down a gravity well;  we&#39;d have to expend the exact same amount of energy to get them UP the gravity well from here;  far more efficient to just get mass from something that isn&#39;t already deep in our gravity well, like asteroids or the moon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see, that makes perfect sense.  So that suggests that we would have to obtain the kinetic materials we would use to drop from somewhere other than the surface of earth, because it would take too much energy to get something that massive up there.

<p>A good question is why the Cuban missile crisis was such a big deal when Russia already had ICBMs pointed at us? It was like there was no real threat until they were a few miles off shore of Florida, and it was like &#39;mutually assured destruction&#39; was not a deterrent because we couldn&#39;t shoot Russia.</p>

<p>Good thing that they didn&#39;t do that.</p>

<p>Putting TNT next to uranium/plutonium and detonating would give you a <em>dirty bomb</em>, not an <em>atomic one</em></p>

<p>Fat Man was in easy terms a hollow plutonium sphere surrounded by explosive lenses (shaped charges )that when detonaded focused the shock wave into a distinct form. Compressing the plutonium from a hollow sphere into a smaller, solid one and making it go critical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see, that makes perfect sense.  So that suggests that we would have to obtain the kinetic materials we would use to drop from somewhere other than the surface of earth, because it would take too much energy to get something that massive up there.  That&#39;s a pretty interesting thought.</p>
