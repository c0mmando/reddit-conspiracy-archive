       A 2012 DIA report came out admitting that we arm AQI (Al Qaeda in Iraq ie ISIS) in a Proxy war against Syria (Read Sec 3 and 8):

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This report was widely called fake even though it had all the proper foia info. Then a DIA official named Michael Flynn came out and confirmed the accuracy of the document. He then went on to say that allowing ISIS to form was a "willful decision" by the White House:

       I never heard or read anyone calling the report fake. What I did read was
       <a href="http://fabiusmaximus.com/2015/05/24/inteligence-isis-iraq-us-support-clickbait-84846/">
        people calling bullshit
       </a>
       on the "clickbait" headlines like "Secret Pentagon Report Reveals US ‘Created’ ISIS As A ‘Tool’ To Overthrow Syria’s President Assad" and analyses like yours. The report doesn't say that we arm AQI. Show me the sentences where it does if you disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a transcript of the report with analysis by Juan Cole here:
       <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2015/05/strategic-against-assad.html">
        "Did the US DIA see ISIL as a strategic ally against al-Assad in 2012?"
       </a>
       (Juan Cole is a very knowledgeble academic who is extremely critical of the United States government's actions in the Middle East.) Cole wrote:

      <blockquote>

        The answer, in a word, is “no.” Fabius Maximus is right that this is just a clickbait story or an unfounded conspiracy theory.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Defense Intelligence Agency’s correct assessment of where things were going in Syria, done in 2012, doesn’t say that the US created sectarian groups and it does not say that the US favors al-Qaeda in Syria or the so-called “Islamic State of Iraq.” It says that those powers (e.g. Turkey and the Gulf monarchies) supporting the opposition wanted to see the declaration of a Salafi (hard line Sunni) breakaway statelet, in order to put pressure on the al-Assad regime.
       </p>
       <p>
        It doesn’t say they wanted to see a Daesh (ISIS, ISIL) state.
       </p>
       <p>
        It doesn’t say the US or “the West” wanted to see such a thing (the US wouldn’t be included in the “powers” supporting al-Qaeda-linked groups! — especially by the DIA!)
       </p>
       <p>
        In fact, the memo warns that any such development could lead to the break-up of Iraq, an eventuality that the authors clearly felt was undesirable for US foreign policy.

       That Foreign Policy Journal blog post truncates Flynn's answer, which distorts what Flynn said.

       <p>
        HASAN: A willful decision to support an insurgency that had Salafists, Al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood?
       </p>
       <p>
        FLYNN: Well, a willful decision to do what they're doing. Which, you have to really ask the President what is it that he actually is doing with the policy that is in place, because it is very, very confusing. I'm sitting here today, Mehdi, and I can't tell you exactly what that is. And I've been at this for a long time.

       R 050839Z AUG 12
      </p>
      <p>
       …
      </p>
      <p>
       THE GENERAL SITUATION:
      </p>
      <p>
       A. INTERNALLY, EVENTS ARE TAKING A CLEAR SECTARIAN DIRECTION.
      </p>
      <p>
       B. THE SALAFIST [sic], THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, AND AQI ARE THE MAJOR FORCES DRIVING THE INSURGENCY IN SYRIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       C. THE WEST, GULF COUNTRIES, AND TURKEY SUPPORT THE OPPOSITION; WHILE RUSSIA, CHINA AND IRAN SUPPORT THE REGIME.
      </p>
      <p>
       …
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        (C) Al QAEDA – IRAQ (AQI):… B. AQI SUPPORTED THE SYRIAN OPPOSITION FROM THE BEGINNING, BOTH IDEOLOGICALLY AND THROUGH THE MEDIA…
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       …
      </p>
      <p>
       4.D. THERE WAS A REGRESSION OF AQI IN THE WESTERN PROVINCES OF IRAQ DURING THE YEARS OF 2009 AND 2010; HOWEVER, AFTER THE RISE OF THE INSURGENCY IN SYRIA, THE RELIGIOUS AND TRIBAL POWERS IN THE REGIONS BEGAN TO SYMPATHIZE WITH THE SECTARIAN UPRISING. THIS (SYMPATHY) APPEARED IN FRIDAY PRAYER SERMONS, WHICH CALLED FOR VOLUNTEERS TO SUPPORT THE SUNNI’S [sic] IN SYRIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       …
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        (C) THE FUTURE ASSUMPTIONS OF THE CRISIS:
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       A. THE REGIME WILL SURVIVE AND HAVE CONTROL OVER SYRIAN TERRITORY.
      </p>
      <p>
       B. DEVELOPMENT OF THE CURRENT EVENTS INTO PROXY WAR: …OPPOSITION FORCES ARE TRYING TO CONTROL THE EASTERN AREAS (HASAKA AND DER ZOR), ADJACENT TO THE WESTERN IRAQI PROVINCES (MOSUL AND ANBAR), IN ADDITION TO NEIGHBORING TURKISH BORDERS. WESTERN COUNTRIES, THE GULF STATES AND TURKEY ARE SUPPORTING THESE EFFORTS. THIS HYPOTHESIS IS MOST LIKELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DATA FROM RECENT EVENTS, WHICH WILL HELP PREPARE SAFE HAVENS UNDER INTERNATIONAL SHELTERING, SIMILAR TO WHAT TRANSPIRED IN LIBYA WHEN BENGHAZI WAS CHOSEN AS THE COMMAND CENTER OF THE TEMPORARY GOVERNMENT.
      </p>
      <p>
       …
      </p>
      <p>
       8.C. IF THE SITUATION UNRAVELS THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A DECLARED OR UNDECLARED SALAFIST PRINCIPALITY IN EASTERN SYRIA (HASAKA AND DER ZOR), AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE SUPPORTING POWERS TO THE OPPOSITION WANT, IN ORDER TO ISOLATE THE SYRIAN REGIME, WHICH IS CONSIDERED THE STRATEGIC DEPTH OF THE SHIA EXPANSION (IRAQ AND IRAN)
      </p>
      <p>
       8.D.1. …ISI COULD ALSO DECLARE AN ISLAMIC STATE THROUGH ITS UNION WITH OTHER TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA, WHICH WILL CREATE GRAVE DANGER IN REGARDS TO UNIFYING IRAQ AND THE PROTECTION OF ITS TERRITORY.

       No it doesn't. He says, It was "A willful decision to do what they are doing." He affirms the DIA report which says we were arming AQI in 2012. At that time AQI and ISIS were the same thing. The context of the conversation is literally the report I cited above.

       That section is not a description of what had happened by the time the report was written, but a "hypothesis" of "future" directions. Furthermore, once again you have equated "Western countries" "supporting" "opposition forces" with "the United States" "arming" "AQI".

       Yes. When a military says its "supporting" this or that group, what do you think that means? Even if they were just protecting rat lines or giving them air support, isn't that fighting alongside ISIS? How else would the military be supporting them?

       How do those sentences support your contention that we armed AQI?
      </p>
      <p>
       I see "2C. The West, Gulf countries, and Turkey support the opposition; while Russia, China, and Iran support the regime."  So, are you saying that "The West"="The United States", "support"="arming" and "the opposition"="AQI"?
      </p>
      <p>
       All three parts of that are problematic.
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) "The West" is not synonymous with the United States. Other western countries have taken positions different from the U.S. For example, France supported the oppostion by
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/world/middleeast/syria-war-developments.html">
        recognizing "Syrian National Coalition as the sole representative of the Syrian people"
       </a>
       , a month before the United States did. France was one of ten European countries which
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Coalition_for_Syrian_Revolutionary_and_Opposition_Forces#International_recognition">
        recognized the National Coalition
       </a>
       before the U.S. Many western countries supported the peaceful demonstrations in Syria before the conflict turned into a civil war.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) In this document, "support" does not mean just material aid. For example, it says "3B. AQI supported the Syrian opposition from the beginning, both ideologically and through the media. AQI declared its opposition of Assad's government because it considered it a sectarian regime targeting Sunnis." Clearly, ideological and media support are different from sending arms.
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) But, perhaps most importantly, in Syria "the opposition" consists of a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_armed_groups_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War">
        large number of groups and shifting alliances
       </a>
       . Al Qaeda in Iraq
       <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/concerns-about-al-qaeda-in-syria-underscore-questions-about-rebels/?_r=0">
        was just a tiny part of it in 2012
       </a>
       . The U.S. has consistently said that it favors the "moderate" Syrian opposition, especially the Free Syrian Army.
      </p>
      <p>
       From both official and media reports, the U.S. didn't begin sending any material support to Syrian rebels until
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       this report, and it was nonlethal aid at first. The U.S. didn't send arms to Syrian rebels until
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-begins-weapons-delivery-to-syrian-rebels/2013/09/11/9fcf2ed8-1b0c-11e3-a628-7e6dde8f889d_story.html">
        late 2013,
       </a>
       , more than a year after this report.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think this report contradicts that, you need to be more specific. Nothing that you quoted above says that.

       You keep citing mainstream media sources. I am citing a direct FOIA document from the DIA. If the MSM sources counter what the document is saying then it's up to you to decide which one you will believe. I have decided to believe the internal document and the whistleblower that will never get any MSM coverage. It seems that you have decided to side with the NYT and Washington Post. That's fine. To each his own. Believe whatever you want about ISIS.

       Except that ... the document doesn't say what you claim it does! You claim that it says that the United States armed AQI.
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked for the words "United States", "U.S.",  or "US". Nowhere to be found.
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked for the words "arms", "armed", "arming", or "weapons." Not in there even once.
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked for any sentence that said
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       outside group was supporting AQI in any way. Nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you "believe" the internal document says something that it just doesn't say.

       That report shows material support to the Syrian rebels and a "passive" support to the establishment of an Islamic State on the Syrian/Iraqi border.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are two separate things. The US supported the rebels against Assad, but their only support to ISIS was not destroying it when they had the chance. What they were trying to do was divine which of the dozen or so rebel factions would be the most moderate, and support their overthrow of Assad. At the same time, they agreed to not do anything if an Islamic State would arise from other factions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think people realize how multifaceted the Syrian Civil War is. It's not all "Assad vs. Al Qaeda and ISIS". There's at least a dozen other factions involved, and they all fight each other all the time.

       <p>
        In 2013, the group once known as al-Qaeda in Iraq — now based in both Syria and Iraq — rebranded as ISIS.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tension grew between ISIS and al-Qaeda, and they divorced in February 2014. "Over the years, there have been many signs that the relationship between al Qaeda Central (AQC) and the group's strongest, most unruly franchise was strained," Barak Mendelsohn, a political scientist at Haverford College, writes. Their relationship "had always been more a matter of mutual interests than of shared ideology."
       </p>
       <p>
        According to Mendelsohn, disagreements over Syria pushed that relationship to the breaking point. ISIS claimed that it controlled Jabhat al-Nusra, the official al-Qaeda faction in Syria, and it defied orders from al-Qaeda's leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, to back off. "This was the first time a leader of an al-Qaeda franchise had publicly disobeyed," he says. ISIS also defied repeated orders to kill fewer civilians in Syria, and the tensions led to al-Qaeda disavowing any connection with ISIS in a February communiqué.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, ISIS and al-Qaeda compete for influence over Islamist extremist groups around the world. Some experts believe ISIS may overtake al-Qaeda as the most influential group in this area globally.

       Where in that text that you just copied and pasted did it say that the U.S. armed AQI? I didn't see that.. It said that the west "supported" them but that could mean anything

     <div class="md">
      <p>
       How do those sentences support your contention that we armed AQI?
      </p>
      <p>
       I see "2C. The West, Gulf countries, and Turkey support the opposition; while Russia, China, and Iran support the regime."  So, are you saying that "The West"="The United States", "support"="arming" and "the opposition"="AQI"?
      </p>
      <p>
       All three parts of that are problematic.
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) "The West" is not synonymous with the United States. Other western countries have taken positions different from the U.S. For example, France supported the oppostion by
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/world/middleeast/syria-war-developments.html">
        recognizing "Syrian National Coalition as the sole representative of the Syrian people"
       </a>
       , a month before the United States did. France was one of ten European countries which
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Coalition_for_Syrian_Revolutionary_and_Opposition_Forces#International_recognition">
        recognized the National Coalition
       </a>
       before the U.S. Many western countries supported the peaceful demonstrations in Syria before the conflict turned into a civil war.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) In this document, "support" does not mean just material aid. For example, it says "3B. AQI supported the Syrian opposition from the beginning, both ideologically and through the media. AQI declared its opposition of Assad's government because it considered it a sectarian regime targeting Sunnis." Clearly, ideological and media support are different from sending arms.
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) But, perhaps most importantly, in Syria "the opposition" consists of a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_armed_groups_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War">
        large number of groups and shifting alliances
       </a>
       . Al Qaeda in Iraq
       <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/concerns-about-al-qaeda-in-syria-underscore-questions-about-rebels/?_r=0">
        was just a tiny part of it in 2012
       </a>
       . The U.S. has consistently said that it favors the "moderate" Syrian opposition, especially the Free Syrian Army.
      </p>
      <p>
       From both official and media reports, the U.S. didn't begin sending any material support to Syrian rebels until
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       this report, and it was nonlethal aid at first. The U.S. didn't send arms to Syrian rebels until
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-begins-weapons-delivery-to-syrian-rebels/2013/09/11/9fcf2ed8-1b0c-11e3-a628-7e6dde8f889d_story.html">
        late 2013,
       </a>
       , more than a year after this report.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think this report contradicts that, you need to be more specific. Nothing that you quoted above says that.
