    <div class="md"><p>Think about how the police actually function for a moment and then ask yourself if they are really here to protect you or if they are here to protect the powerful interests?</p>

<p>Take, for instance, a company like Comcast.  They have been involved in many immoral business practices (claiming people have not turned in equipment and charging them for it, for instance).  Even think of the scam where banks re-order your debits and credits to maximize the amount of &quot;fees&quot; they can charge people.</p>

<p>This amounts to theft from a citizen by a business, but if you were to bring this issue up to the police, they would laugh at you and tell you to go to court (which is normally not worth it).  They would call it a &quot;civil&quot; matter because if you are a rich thief, then you couldn&#39;t possibly be held accountable and be called a criminal.</p>

<p>However... if you were to go into a Comcast or a bank and steal $100 from either of them, the whole police force would come down on you.</p>

<p>You see, in the US, the system is designed by the powerful to protect &quot;them&quot; from &quot;us&quot;.  People need to understand and accept this fundamental truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The function of police agencies varies by jurisdiction. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Federal law enforcement: Exists to protect the government and the wealthy. They consider the general public the enemy. </p></li>
<li><p>Urban local police: Exist to keep the poor contained by maintaining a revolving door justice system based on the War on Drugs. The real goal is to keep the price of drugs high and give the ghetto inhabitants felony records.</p></li>
<li><p>Suburban local police: Exist to generate revenue for their local government. This is why are seeing these outrageous confiscation stories.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that in no case do the police actually protect the public. This is a direct result of the circumvention of democracy in the US by the wealthy.</p>

Even though stopping a homicidal killer usually falls into the protecting society as a whole thing. That&#39;s the counter people have, that cops protect society as a whole, not the individual.

    <div class="md"><p>This is asinine.  My father in-law is a local police officer.  I&#39;ve spent many a drunk nights with him and his fellow officers.  I have close friends in 3 differents cities all in different county&#39;s, 1 in a different state, and few Sheriff&#39;s deputies.  (the point is, there&#39;s a lot of different laws are rules) There is not a one of them who wouldn&#39;t lay down their life to protect an innocent.   </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been there when my father in law came home crying because he shot someone who shot at him, dude didn&#39;t even die.  A few of them are ticket happy, my father in law only writes tickets for big issues and littering, he hates litterers.  The vast majority of them write tickets as a last resort.  I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t hear about the arrests where officer X arrested that guy because he hated him.  The vast majority of the stories I hear about how they don&#39;t want to arrest some dbag but that dbag left them no choice, there&#39;s too much paperwork.  </p>

<p>Shit like this makes me angry.  What possible motivation does a police officer have to generate revenue for their local government?  to keep their job? No even in the worst times in the last 5ish years there was a hiring freeze and early retirement enticements.   </p>

<p>I simply just don&#39;t get it.  None of the 20 or so officers I hangout with are out arresting people just for funsies or righting tickets to help keep their local government funded. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of these matters are civil.  If Comcast wants to bill you for services/equipment you didn&#39;t receive then dare them to take it to court.  Assuming you have the proper documentation, they will lose and it will cost them a lot of money to even try.  Until they do take it to court, all they&#39;re doing is barking like an hungry dog.  Ignore them. </p>

<p>The issue with banks is a different matter.  Still civil, but that&#39;s a great reason to switch banks entirely.  And it&#39;s not like it&#39;s hard.  There&#39;s at least a dozen banks within 3 miles of me.  If you don&#39;t just want to avoid the issue but want justice, then you need to attack them in court.  Given the complexity of the issue, it isn&#39;t worth it unless you can organize a class action suit.  And you happen to be one of the lawyers administrating it.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a fault of the police.  This is a fault of the government agencies not properly regulating these companies to prevent exploitative practices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And yet... they are all fundamentally theft, which is criminal, but if a legal fiction called a &quot;corporation&quot; steals from you, then there is no individual held accountable for creating this &quot;policy&quot;.</p>

<p>How many bankers are in jail?  When the fed, for instance, prints a bunch of money and hands it out to their friends, then they are stealing the value of that money which our labor has created and call it &quot;quantitative easing&quot;.

<p>And if I don&#39;t pay it, then they trash my credit, which corporations use to further leverage control over you.  An individual who is busy maintaining a job and has a life to live does not have the resources that corporations do, yet the burden of proof falls on the individual to show that they were not responsible for this payment.  And if you do go to the trouble to fight and win through the credit reporting agencies, then you receive no compensation for your loss of time and effort expended fighting the injustice.</p>

<p>Corporations lose virtually nothing by taking advantage of those who do not have the resources to fight back.</p>

<p>This amounts to theft from a citizen by a business, but if you were to bring this issue up to the police, they would laugh at you ... You see, in the US, the system is designed by the powerful to protect &quot;them&quot; from &quot;us&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you&#39;re saying that in non-US countries... you can call the police if Comcast overcharges you? And they&#39;ll go arrest a Comcast employee? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>However... if you were to go into a Comcast or a bank and steal $100 from either of them, the whole police force would come down on you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same thing would happen if a Comcast employee entered my home and took my money. </p>

<p>Normal citizens end up in court against each other for civil matters as well! You don&#39;t have to be rich to pay a fee instead of go to jail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The police and the military are mere extensions of the illogical creation that is government. Put harshly, but nonetheless accurately, they are both attack dogs that are leashed and caged away until required. The funny thing is that they see what they do as correct, yet it is anything but - they perpetuate and uphold &#39;laws&#39; enacted by governments, even when in doing so they do so in a violent manner, which if any regular person did then it would be seen as immoral - but suddenly, when it&#39;s done under decree of government, it&#39;s OK and &#39;moral&#39;.</p>

<p>Who made government the decider on what is right and wrong?</p>

<p>Propaganda is therefore not surprising at all. Ram down peoples&#39; throats TV programs where police are shown as brave, where military servicemen (and women) are shown as upstanding, and quash any opposing view as &#39;un-patriotic&#39;, and the large portion of the populace will simply go along with it and parrot what they have seen on the TV.</p>

<p>In an age where people laud how we are so &#39;progressive&#39; and &#39;diverse&#39;, humanity sure as heck doesn&#39;t lack on the &#39;group-think&#39; front.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To add to this, what really constitutes a country? A country is nothing more than an imaginary line drawn between two areas, and within the lines (that form a country) a particular government rules by a particular set of laws - every few years, the residents may even be fortunate enough to elect a new wolf to rule over them with ever-increasing power. Outside of a particular boundary, laws change in relation to the government that rules over the land. The entire concept of a boundary line to me seems ludicrous, as where is the justification in there even being one?</p>

<p>&quot;Oh dear, in walking these five metres I have walked over this imaginary line. I did not have the correct papers to do so, so I have therefore committed an illegal act.&quot; I mean come on, doesn&#39;t that sound crazy to you?</p>

<p>When people say they support their country, what they really mean is that they support the set of laws that they are forcibly made to live under, and accept that the government ruling over them has the moral right to do so.</p>

<p>Patriotism is the love for imaginary boundaries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There has been a lot of media coverage about the recent rise in police shootings.</p>

<p>There have been 26 police officers shot and killed this year. There were 47 in 2014. Comparatively 792 people have been killed by police (662 by guns).</p>

<p>I dont see a &quot;rise&quot; in numbers of police being shot. </p>

<p>Any police officer shot is a tragedy, and any civilian shot is also a tragedy.</p>

<p>The police need to be concerned with their public image. They need the public&#39;s help. They wont get this by putting on army costumes and acting like an occupation force.</p>

<p>A good place to start in improving law enforcement image is to have all police union officials STFU. Their inflammatory rhetoric is part of the problem, not part of the solution.</p>

<p>Does anybody remember community policing?</p>

<p>I suggest that people find reliable source of information about police and courts and trials. There exists a growing population of people who are obsolete. Economic failures. On TV they are stereotyped as homeless and are meant to be called mentally ill and doped up on drugs. But the reality is that in a challenging business environment and a competitive zero-hour-contract market, more and more Citizens are being pushed out of the suburbs and into homelessness. </p>

<p>The police job is to find these people in parks etc, charge them for trespassing into a park after it is closed, they get sent to bond court, fail to pay their $2000 bond, sit in jail 4 weeks waiting trail court, and then end up with even more Fees and a criminal conviction.</p>

<p>The most interesting thing is that Majority of Americans have no information about Court system provided to them in school or tv, and so cannot comprehend a system that is so negative and dis-empowering.</p>

<p>I found Bond Court to be interesting to watch: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6snPVh4WPxc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6snPVh4WPxc</a> ,</p>
