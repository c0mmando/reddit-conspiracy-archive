    <div class="md"><p>I believe there are a lot of staged events in the news. I can not decide how I think they pull them off. I think many people are in on it - but I don&#39;t know how many are masterminding - how many are intimidated/ paid off - and how many are straight up psychologically controlled. I suspect there are a lot of people among us who have beed traumatized/programed as young people. and will respond to triggers and behave certain ways without even realizing the are not using their own free will. but I&#39;m just not sure - if real people are dying or are all getting rewarded for these fake events. I also can&#39;t decide if the r real motive is gun control. I can see they are pushing hard for that each time, but I can&#39;t decide if it isn&#39;t &quot;too obvious&quot; and there isn&#39;t something else going on. the real motive seems so elusive, - sure disarm the people could open door for hostile takeover, but aren&#39;t we already taken over if they can pull off all this fake stuff and get away with it? </p>

<p>lately I&#39;m interested in how fake events effect stock market. I think they can create predictable fall and rise with these events - the dip is after event before they catch bad guy. and rise follows - everything is resolved feeling. And the key is making these stories that effect everybody&#39;s emotions for those days. so they gotta be all over the news, maybe this is all a racket to manipulate market behavior and make bank. and the guns are just a front. maybe. i do not know, </p>

<p>I do think satanism is involved and it is real for some of those involved. I can&#39;t figure out if it&#39;s a method to control the middle men of whatever they are - or if it really drives their whole machine. it seems so antiquated. and lame. and tailor made for american fear. seems like something somebody thought up in a brainstorm - how can we really freak out american people - ket&#39;s male em think there are a team of satanists controlling everything. but then - -they sure put it in your face - if it&#39;s not really happening - it&#39;s really happening that they want us to think it&#39;s really happening - and well that&#39;s something really happening. </p>

<p>I think Nasa is faking pretty much everything. </p>

<p>&amp; we may indeed not be living on a  ball earth.  surely way more to figure out. (for quite a while if I heard talk of this theory - and i thought well that&#39;s where I draw the line - some people are just crazy. then for fun I looked into it - and wow. if you have same - well poster just jumped the shark reaction - I was with her on the false flags but not with an allusion to flat earth  - is she trying to discredit the real stuff with the nutty stuff?! no. I&#39;m not. I know how it sounds  -I say  maybe look into it anyway - can&#39;t hurt to look :) </p>

<p>also I&#39;m pretty sure royals use surrogates. specifically Catherine and what&#39;s his name, the balding one. just saying. </p>

<p>and if I had to guess who was behind it all I&#39;d say those who own the world banks, starting with British/european elite and the CIA. I think it&#39;s all a kind of invisible imperialism, near-entire-world empire - where nations/people don&#39;t realize they aren&#39;t independent and they don&#39;t resist because they can&#39;t see the oppression. I could see the British empire totally regrouping after the declaration of independence - &quot;- so straight up war did not work - maybe the way to keep america and all our other sovereignties is to make them believe they have freedom, while we really control everything secretly&quot;. </p>

<p>A historical investigation of human evolution (as modern research and understanding dictates anyway) shows that humans went from spear and rock-chunking nomads with super low IQs, to complex-thinking, sky scraper-building architects in a span of time that actually goes DIRECTLY AGAINST the core tenets of Darwinian evolution and natural selection.</p>

<p>According to Darwin&#39;s own theories, it is not possible for a leap as drastic as took place in human evolution to actually have taken place.</p>

<p>This alone strongly suggests a manipulation outside of &quot;natural selection&quot; alone.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe6DN1OoxjE">Lloyd Pye</a> and <a href="http://cdn.preterhuman.net/texts/alien.ufo/Bramley,%20William%20-%20The%20Gods%20of%20Eden.pdf">William Bramely</a> both (among many other researchers) have a <em>lot</em> to say about it.</p>

I like critical thinking beyond religious answers.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I think evolution is a flawed theory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh my.  The current theory of evolution is a HORRIBLY flawed.  I mean…it is like…OBVIOUSLY flawed, and yet no one seems to be talking about it or mentioning it in schools.  Just think about it for a second:  The theory says that everything has come into existence as a result of natural “random” selection, right?  Yet WE HUMANS OURSELVES have curtailed the tenets of this very aspect of the “theory of natural selection” on an <em>innumerable</em> amount of occasions with the countless thousands of genetic manipulations we have put untold number of plants and non-human animals through!  Every domesticated animal on the face of this planet goes directly against the theory of Darwinian evolution via natural selection.  There <em>is</em> no “natural selection” that took place on these particular occasions.  Humans, again, genetically manipulated all these different species in order to get the desired result.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it explains some factors in adaptation but it does not explain the wide variety of species.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct and agreed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>even if DNA is shared that does not prove species evolved from each other. imo. but I don&#39;t think that necessarily confirms any alternative theory at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.  One doesn’t necessarily prove the other.  However, there does seem to be considerable evidence (as shown in the two sources I gave above, among many others) of another alternative theory, and that other alternative theory seems to indicate what ancient tablets described in detail many thousands of years ago.  Just as the human race genetically manipulates many species of plants and non-human animals for a desired end - resulting in a genetically altered species which did not previously exist - so too has it been documented in ancient cuneiform tablets many thousands of years old that human beings themselves were created by a far more advanced species still that used genetic manipulation to create <em>it</em>.</p>

<p>While I am not necessarily saying that this is “the” story of how humans came to be (at all, actually, as it may be a <em>lot</em> more complicated than what I’ve described here.  Various sources state that the human genetic code has been manipulated well over <em>twenty</em> times by as many off-planet species) it seems incredibly deceitful and pernicious on the part of this civilization’s ptb to marginalize the information that exists and keep it from the understanding of the general public.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I like critical thinking beyond religious answers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As well you should - and that is because many if not most religious answers don’t involve a great deal of critical thinking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just think we just settled in on the natural selection thing too quickly and it&#39;s only a small factor</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know if we settled in on it too quickly or not, but I do think it’s only a small factor at best.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the scientific method is still a viable way of discovering it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree, but the <em>true</em> scientific method has been largely hijacked on this planet, and it’s actually not used anywhere near as often as we are made to believe it is.</p>

<p>The scientific method would actually work if the establishment actually <em>used</em> it.  Unfortunately, however, there is ultimately very little such thing as <em>real</em> science on this planet.  There is mostly only “$cience” that exists, and the “academic consensus” on any given subject tends to go to the corporation with the deepest pockets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t equate IQ with sophistication of tools</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the tools are self-created, then it actually <em>is</em> a great barometer for IQ.  If the tools are handed down from elsewhere, however, or given/acquired from another outside/external source, then it may indeed not be a great barometer of IQ at all.  Take humans, for example.  Humans are a great example of this fact, as it has been said that a good portion of the technology we have was actually given to us and acquired from external, off-planet sources.  And what have we done with much of that technology?  The fact that we’ve taken a great deal of the most advanced technology we’ve been given/have acquired and have to a great extent used it to do nothing much more than devise new, better, more effective ways to wage war and kill each other shows that better sophisticated tools most definitely <em>do not</em> necessarily equate with higher IQs at all.  We show what can happened when you give sophisticated tools to a species that is <em>not</em> very wise or evolutionarily advanced.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think technology has always been a cumulative development.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To an extent, I would not disagree with this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>each new invention on the shoulders of the previous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes yes, but sometimes inventions can come across that break the mold, so to speak, and usher in a new paradigm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so whoever invented the spear or wheel or what have you was as brilliant as any software engineer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe, but there’s (again) evidence that computer technology was not exclusively human-created.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s all relative with how much help they were getting from previous generations, and recorded knowledge. and at some point things appeared to move faster but it was due to certain inventions - like printing press - cell phones - what have you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is valid indeed.  I just think there is also more than just that going on, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>any given inventor - is always standing on shoulders of previous great minds. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems valid and generally true - yes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>totally agree real science is very rare right now.</p>

<p>i&#39;ve seen some stuff about alien intervention on development of humans. I say it&#39;s possible. though it&#39;s kind of like a replacement for divine creator - - like there&#39;s still stuff we don&#39;t understand and we gotta throw in a wild card to explain it but we can&#39;t say it was god any more so let&#39;s say aliens. this is an issue that holds me back - what we are doing is explaining the part we don&#39;t understand yet with other worldly. while - it used to be there was a great more we didn&#39;t understand and we explained it all as other worldly when that was the case. other worldly just seems to be a place holder for whatever we can&#39;t yet explain. </p>

<p>however - even though I can think of s &quot;motive&quot; for saying it might be aliens -- I can see how that does not discount the possibility - that it might be accurate all the same. </p>

<p>I find it very interesting. </p>

<p>Sorry, ma’am.  :)  Noted.  I would say the reason for the confusion has to do with the fact that since the demographic on Reddit is predominately male, most people on here simply assume they’re likely communicating with another guy.  Again, however, I apologize.  Dually noted.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And it’s unfortunate, for if real science <em>were</em> applied and used to its greatest extent on this planet, I absolutely <em>guarantee</em> you that there would be a <em>veeery</em> deep level of overlapping between both science, and what we today call “magic”.  Ultimately, there is very little difference between the two, and one becomes indistinguishable and synonymous with the other as they both reach their apex.</p>

<p>It’s like the former CEO and director of Lockheed’s Skunk Works - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Rich">Ben Rich</a> - once said, “<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=we%20have%20the%20technology%20to%20take%20et%20home">We now have the technology to take ET home</a>.”</p>

<p>Things that we can scarcely imagine are already operational and in existence in deep, black, unacknowledged projects under the umbrella of the MIC.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>While I can understand that some equate the two, I personally do not.  An ET is just that:  An extraterrestrial - a being that is <em>not</em> from planet Earth respectively.  The divine creator is the intelligent, volitional force/power/energy that is responsible for everything.  This includes but is most definitely not limited to both Earthlings (humans and non-humans) <em>and</em> extraterrestrials.  As such, ETs, in and of themselves, are <em>not</em> the divine creator per se.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>like there&#39;s still stuff we don&#39;t understand and we gotta throw in a wild card to explain it but we can&#39;t say it was god any more so let&#39;s say aliens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems to me that there’s quite a lot of evidence showing that ETs <em>were</em> indeed significantly responsible for the existence of the homo sapien sapiens species.  I say this independent of any postulation related to the cosmic creator, however.  While it seems that many peoples and cultures did seem to regard more evolved beings as gods, I can only speak for myself and say that I personally do not equate the two things, and what I reference does not the mistake of equating any ET with God necessarily.</p>

<p>Some certainly do this.  I’m certainly not, however.</p>

<p>It will likely come as a shock to many, but some sources state that an untold number of years ago (millennia ago) a visiting extraterrestrial species from a dying, ozone-depleted planet, created the human species as a slave race to mine for gold that was needed to fix that damaged ozone layer.</p>

<p>This is something that most people will largely reject.  However, there <em>is</em> actually a lot of evidence indicating this very thing, and a true, critically-minded individual would not reject the idea offhand without proper investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I accept it&#39;s-for-sure-a-globe-earth thinkers too :) (I was one up until a few months ago) </p>

<p>to me it&#39;s the most fun theory. and probably the one that&#39;s hardest to prove, and the least scary to contemplate / because it doesn&#39;t lead to  recognizing a huge menace. </p>

<p>some people think it&#39;s part of the master plan to keep people ignorant of real shape of earth. I thin they really thought it was round. and when they faked moon landing falsely confirmed it was round by faking blue marble image. and then they just had to keep going with it. if you can&#39;t question evolution in schools - you better believe you can&#39;t question the shape of the planet. </p>

<p>anyway - it&#39;s a super fascinating theory. but also - I realize - probably the most &quot;alienating&quot; </p>

<p>I like this forum I just found it recently. I never really come on Reddit. I like chatting with people who want to talk about conspiracy and don&#39;t just tell me they hope I don&#39;t procreate for trying to talk about it, haha. ugh. </p>

<p>Seems to me that if the Earth <em>were</em> indeed flat, that would constitute perhaps one of the BIGGEST possible menaces imaginable because that would mean that there is an influence on this planet that is SO ubiquitously powerful that it has gotten us to believe something which is almost the OPPOSITE of what the truth actually is.</p>

<p>I can’t find too many things more menacing than a force so powerful that it is capable of and <em>willing to</em> make us believe a lie that is <em>that</em> deep.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think it’s quite alright to question the shape of the planet.  I have to say, however, that the testimony of someone like <a href="http://www.earthcitizenconsulting.org/my-story/#interviews">Captain Randy Cramer</a> has seemed <em>very</em> solid to me thus far, and he’s made mention of and talked about (among many other things) <em>round</em> planets - Earth included.</p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>re: flat earth. I think even the most ardent Flat Earth believers would admit it&#39;s only a theory and they can&#39;t prove it with certainty yet. What the theory is really saying - according to those I respect on the topic - is that flat is a better model to explain all recorded phenomenon than globe. And they do extensive proofs of this and it really gave me a paradigm shift like no other once I really thought through their proofs. I had expected silliness - and after a few weeks of -why-can&#39;t-I-let-this-go research - it turned out I did have to laugh - because they actually changed my mind. But it&#39;s not - that the earth is for sure flat -(though - my paradigm shift is that -  probably it is )  it&#39;s more that the globe model is actually deeply flawed and flat makes way more sense. (and yes airplane travel is explained very well) . but it leaves open the fact that - and drives the point that - the shape of the earth has never been proven. </p>

<p>if you can see the moon landing is fake - the next (side) step is to acknowledge - we never actually took a photo that showed the earth as a blue marble - ball. we thought the debate was locked down. but it was a false positive. </p>

<p>anyway - I think - with this one-  it could be a snow ball effect of lies and a bi-product of other strategic deception. I think people who were doing the moon hoax genuinely believed the earth was a ball - for plenty of good reasons - they were just overlooking a few impossibilities. and then --- they created the false confirmation for their own somewhat unrelated propaganda reasons.  - in fact I wonder if the powers that be may well be fooling themselves on the topic, still. </p>

<p>or maybe they know and it is part of the evil. I&#39;m inclined to believe these evil-behind-the-scenes guys are not all knowing. I think they mess up all the time they just have a huge safety net. and they just got themselves some leverage on knowledge by inventing their own system of deception. </p>

<p>sometimes lies are meant to hide truths. sometimes lies are just people making stuff up because they don&#39;t know - and they want you to think they know. which is kinda less evil. tho still inexcusable. imo. </p>

<p>cheers right back at ya :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the elitist superstructure are bent on destroying religion, not just Christianity, all religions.  The propaganda is pretty obvious at this point.  The idea of a person living by religious tenets creates something the elite cannot control.</p>

<p>Evidence </p>

<p>A.  The bible has clearly been edited to remove problem books (I &amp; II Macabees, among others) that show how religious people successfully resisted power.  Only nonviolent resistance has remained in the bible, the Macabees were warriors and thus removed.</p>

<p>B.  Every portrayal of religious people is negative.  They&#39;re always crazy, or bigots, or poor, or in other ways cultural pariahs.  </p>

<p>C.  The news.  In the scheme of things, many anti religious news stories get blown up far beyond the scope of the number of people affected.  The worst was a pizza place that said that hypothetically if they were ever asked, they would not do a gay wedding.  They&#39;ve never done any wedding ever, because no one wants pizza at a wedding reception.  People affected - 0, but a national story because it gives the media another chance to teach people to see religious groups as backward bigots.  </p>

<p>D.  The biggest theater of war right now just so happens to be the last place on earth where religion is more important to the people than money.  In those countries, commerce stops for prayers several times a day.  They don&#39;t lend at interest, and they refuse to handle some products.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you have a Very good point - that there is agenda to make people forget their right to physically, with force, revolt against oppression. I think this is done on a micro level too - wherein individuals are taught to forgo their personal power and submit to the  feeling of addiction where abuse and pleasure are a package deal. be it with toxic food - mindless/dumbing down entertainment - seductive-sex coupled with crippling consequences - once you live a life of submission personally  - you are more likely to submit to a larger menace that effects the population at large. psychological submission perpetuates physical submission. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I looked up some other stuff on it, in essence - aids is a state of lowered immune system signified by all the diseases that are known to occur with it - but in reality a virus is not the underlying cause - instead it is recreational drug use. the lowered immune system is created by poppers, heroin, other extremely toxic popular drugs. drawing the correlation to the HIV virus was never proven. all the death is real the cause has just been skewed. and possibly some intense meds like AZT - leads to aids rather than prevents it. --- that&#39;s the theory, summarized. </p>

<p>the evidence is that there are a lot of people  with aids who do not have hiv. and aids cases rose in direct correlation with drug use - but did not rise in correlation with hiv infections. </p>

<p>now I understand thanks. my first reaction once i understand the theory is - ok there could easily be some truth to that. </p>
