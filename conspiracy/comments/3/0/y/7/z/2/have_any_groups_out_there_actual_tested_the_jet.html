<p>That&#39;s the whole point. It can&#39;t. Nevertheless, there is evidence that steel <em>was</em> melted. That&#39;s not a strawman. Trying to claim that it is a strawman based on &quot;weakened /= melted&quot; is disingenuous. The fact that steel was melted by <em>something</em> (hotter than the fires) has nothing to do with claiming that steel was weakened by <em>something else</em> (the fires).</p>

<p>Right. And no one claims it can. I&#39;m just confused as to what argument will be put to rest by proving something everyone already agrees with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s not a strawman.</p>

<p>Its a strawman because conspiracy theorists set it up as something that skeptics believe, when in reality they don&#39;t. And since it isn&#39;t true in the first place, it&#39;s much easier to knock down than what they actually believe. That&#39;s like the definition of a strawman argument. </p>

<p>Exactly, you&#39;re completely right. That&#39;s why testing the &quot;jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams&quot; hypothesis won&#39;t do any good for the 911 truth movement, as the hypothesis has nothing to do with steel beams being weakened, which is what skeptics actually believe. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been told literally hundreds of times by <em>non-skeptics</em> (those that blindly accept the official conspiracy theory) that beams and columns were melted by the fires, here and in <a href="/r/911Truth">/r/911Truth</a> and at DIGG before that. It&#39;s not a strawman. It&#39;s believed by many anti-truthers. Perhaps not as many now as before. Over the past few years some have changed their tactics though and now are claiming the fires only weakened the steel enough to cause collapse... which isn&#39;t true either.

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;ve always heard from other skeptics that the steel beams didn&#39;t need to melt and only needed to be weakened. At any rate, all the official sources I&#39;ve read claim that the steel beams did not melt.

<p>Can&#39;t avoid seeing official narrative fundies there. They invade every post everywhere about 9/11. The same goes for every subreddit where one sees questions about 9/11. They invade every forum where one sees questions about 9/11. It&#39;s not <em>just</em> <a href="/r/911Truth">/r/911Truth</a> and DIGG. I was only using them as a couple examples. But then I&#39;m sure you already knew that and wanted to distract from the issue.</p>

<p>If you would ever diligently apply your claimed skepticism to the official narrative you might actually question a few things yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s an insulation test. Insulation for the entire structure is well known to be in dire need of replacement, was never properly installed in many locations, and stripped by impact. Furthermore, the duration of the test is in no way comparable to the actual event.</p>

<p>You are comparing apples to oranges. It in no way is comparable and in no way substantiates your position. In fact, it fully substantiates official statements.</p>

<p>The tests were terminated after a <em>minimum</em> of <strong>116 minutes</strong>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_World_Trade_Center#September_11_attacks">South Tower collapsed after burning for approximately <strong>56</strong> minutes.

<p>That&#39;s entirely the point of the insulation. It&#39;s why it&#39;s there. And the experts have all stated that the duration of that fires would have eventually caused insulation failure.</p>

<p>Again, your counter does nothing but validate the official story all the while comparing apples to oranges.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. This has been reproduced several times now by several groups.</p>

<p>Years ago I watched a documentary where an open pit contains jet fuel with an equivalent steel I-been suspended above on each end.</p>

<p>The fire burned slightly hotter than the conservative numbers provided by NIST. Exactly as projected the beam lost its structural integrity, sagged, and feel into the fire.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also important to remember that the NIST document did not account for the forge effect of that elevator shafts, which means pockets actually burned much, much hotter; especially when combined with all the debris.</p>

<p>Computer simulations also accurately model the structural integrity failure.</p>

<p>Long story short, without question, the fires absolutely were hot enough to cause structural failure of the steel I-beams. Even at the NIST temperatures, 80% reduction of integrity is expected and 20% is nowhere enough to maintain the overall structure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t think so what?</p>

<p>Why is it you guys know about the most invalid, insane, anti-science &quot;confirmation&quot;, but seem to not know anything about the very thing you&#39;re trying to invalidate. Which ultimately makes your arguments weaker.</p>

<p>Shesh people. Just out of curiosity I did a quick search to see how difficult something like this is to locate. One search and the first result I find a video which addresses the actual question.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/N2TMVDYpp2Q">https://youtu.be/N2TMVDYpp2Q</a></p>

<p>If you guys spent a fraction of the time looking for actual facts as you do looking for uneducated, confirmation bias, you would all be better for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL @ the video:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In THIS test, a steel I beam, like those in the twin towers...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then you see the I beam they&#39;re using and it looks like a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2TMVDYpp2Q&amp;amp;t=2m9s">toothpick</a>!  LOL!! </p>

<p><a href="http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/01/62/24/468258/3/628x471.jpg">THIS</a> is the size of the actual beams in the WTC buildings!!! LOL!!!</p>

<p>Then, they <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2TMVDYpp2Q&amp;amp;t=3m16s">load up the center of the beam</a> with enough weight to nearly cause it to bend with no heat at all in a way that is in no way congruent with the actual structures!!! LOL!!!</p>

<p>You&#39;re a funny guy.</p>

<p>Garbage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s relative. Just admit you hate science. The test validates that steel suffers catastrophically in this environment. Note the temps are higher than NIST statements, as other tests also indicate - as I stated. Note the short duration of that video. The structure was under load and proved fuel can cause structure failure of a steel structure, which is exactly as I stated. Which is exactly as every expert has ever stated.</p>

<p>So please explain why you hate science. You&#39;ve yet to answer. This test behaved exactly as science said it would. Exactly as science as we know it says happened in the actual structures. You literally need to explain why hundreds of thousands of qualified scientists and engineers are in on the conspiracy and yet have not provided experiments or data to prove such conspiracy. This is math. It can be validated.</p>

<p>So come on...something other than deflection, avoidance, and general bullshit please.</p>

<p>You have no source and <a href="https://publicintelligence.net/underwriters-laboratories-fire-endurance-testing-of-world-trade-center-floor-truss-assemblies/">Underwiters Laboratories actually did fire testing of floor truss assemblies that resulted in NO failure</a></p>

<p>Heating a small piece of steel is no problem. Heating gigantic, thick pieces of interconnected structural steel is quite another issue.</p>
