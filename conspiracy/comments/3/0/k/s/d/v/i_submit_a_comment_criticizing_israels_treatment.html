<p>I as well have a verified email address. I&#39;ve known for a while about the Israelis&#39; paid shills and can tolerate them. They are obvious. Their arguments ring hollow. But this Reddit restraint thing is a whole different matter. This site might well be in its decline due to corporate oversight. That will be its downfall. People were drawn here for the freewheeling content that was prescribed by the subscribers. It seems they have changed that. If they keep it up, how long will it be until another website bites the dust?</p>

<p>So you&#39;re telling me that in r/worldnews if my comment gets downvoted enough I have to wait to comment again? Doesn&#39;t that just reward Israel&#39;s paid shills. (Please, it&#39;s a fact.

<p>It has nothing to do with the individual comment. It has to do with your comment karma total <strong>for that sub</strong>. By getting a lot of down votes, your comment karma, for that sub, will diminish. <em>If the total goes negative</em>, then you will have the delays. This implies that your overall comment karma is broken down by each sub reddit. If negative in a given sub reddit, you will get delays in that negative sub.</p>

<p>Yes, I have made many comments in many different subreddits critical of Israel&#39;s treatment of the Palestinians. I feel it is a situation that cannot endure and our ally, Israel, needs to change its ways. Barack Obama is basically saying the same thing right now. I think you are going to see a major policy shift in America regarding Israel. I think Benjamin Netanyahu made a huge gaffe by stating publicly what has been Israeli policy for quite some time - namely that they will never give Palestine their own country. Obama now has moral authority to override the Jewish lobby in America. This, of course, is beside the point. Why I am required to wait 8 minutes between comments of this nature in r/worldnews is the point. </p>

<p>Why is criticizing Israel (and/or cheering for Palestine) getting a lot folks nose out of joint? That is a good question. The &quot;useful idiots&quot; that cast the down votes are brain washed to be that way. Why? Money! There are a group of filthy, stinking rich people who are Jewish (the Rothschild Family for example). These people want what the Arabs have - natural resources (Oil, Natural Gas etc). Now the thought of being nice and having to pay for the resources in a civilized manner is an insult to Jewish rich people. This is because of religious pride (false pride) and arrogance. This leads to racism and hatred - both brain diseases. This has been going on for a <em>very</em> long time. The Jews want <em>everything</em> (to take over the world. Yes, really). Since there is a lot of money at stake here, this has filtered down the channels resulting in a lot of people falsely thinking that Israel is good and Israels enemies are bad. These brain deluded people (down voters) become the &quot;herd&quot; and act as such.</p>

<p>I never see real spam getting so many downvotes, just controversial opinions get this treatment. So I wonder how big the spam issue is after all and if this self-censorship mechanism was even meant to target spammers in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, what can you do? If you are getting heavily downvoted then the system assumes you are trolling or spamming , it&#39;s understandable. The fact that you don&#39;t see much spam means it&#39;s working</p>

<p>But the spam is real, just check <a href="/r/spam">/r/spam</a> </p>

<p>Unfortunately, as much as reddit is getting manipulated and all that, in this particular case the fault lies within the people downvoting him unjustly. Nobody ever follows rediquette anymore</p>

If certain number of people report you as a spammer, it should get you to take a few captcha tests and if you pass, you can continue to post.

    <div class="md"><p>Moreover, the wait 8 minute rule deters humans more than scripts (automated spammers). Because, scripts can be programmed to post the comment in 8 minutes.

<p>How it targets spammers more than people with dissenting opinions is beyond me.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the mods, in my opinion</p>

<p>Anyway, I spend the eight (or four, or 16 minutes) ranting about it, the corruption, the injustice, the power-madness of it</p>

<p>You can rant a lot in nine minutes.  I know.  I&#39;ve done it frequently</p>

<p>The rant invariably results in the subs&#39; shills and ratbags screaming back at me</p>

<p>but by then, I&#39;ve moved on</p>

<p>By nature, I&#39;m understanding, decent, moral and forgiving.  It has rarely worked to my advantage.  So when a jew gave me advice, it stayed in my mind.  He said, &#39;Give it back to those who give it to you&#39;.  And now I do. By ranting for however long they delay my posts</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I&#39;ve got it out of my system and moved on, leaving the sub-creeps consumed with rage over my 4, 9, 14 minute rants</p>

<p>If you would, would you mind test-criticizing in the sub I was in (listed by me below) and see if it happens to you? This isn&#39;t good.
EDIT - this isn&#39;t the first time this has happened to me. I am quite vocal about my displeasure regarding the Israelis&#39; treatment of the Palestinians. </p>

<p>So am I. If you do this in <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> you get down voted. Eventually your comment karma for <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> goes negative.

<p>I still don&#39;t get why standing up for an oppressed people put you into negative karma. I believe one day people will look back on the Israel/Palestine situation just like we now do on South Africa.</p>
