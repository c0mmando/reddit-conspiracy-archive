<p>For example, I found this <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3015504/I-m-planning-heinous-act-remembered-forever-Killer-pilot-s-ex-girlfriend-says-shared-chilling-prophecy-Alps-crash-woke-nightmares-shouting-going-down.html">link</a> and am reading through how apparently this guy was &#39;troubled&#39; and a &#39;master of hiding his true intentions&#39; and often stated that he would one day &#39;change the world,&#39; and thought that those statements were vague enough that hey - I think I&#39;ve <em>read those here, and other forums like this!</em> lately.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whatever, Jim, you&#39;re just a conspiracy theorist who&#39;s just looking a little too much into this.</p>

<p>So I keep reading, and come across this <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/03/26/23/27075E2000000578-3013743-image-a-30_1427413009024.jpg">image</a>, and couldn&#39;t help but be somewhat reminded of <a href="http://edwardjayepstein.com/2002image/netherpopup.gif">this image</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>My personal theory is that this world is so preoccupied with hate, that we don&#39;t stop to think about the consequences of propagandizing everyone with 1000 reasons to hate everyone else.</p>

<p>All it takes is one dude with some minor mental issues like suicidal depression, to think &quot;well i&#39;m going to kill myself anyways so i may as well kill a bunch of the fucking cunts i&#39;m forced to share the world with in the process.&quot;</p>

<p>Thats a fucked up thought but think about it.</p>

<p>Hate the republicans, Hate the democrats, Hate the gays, Hate the heteronormative cis scum, Hate them and Hate that.  Hate your neighbors and Hate all the cultures you don&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>Everyone has a reason to Hate someone, or everyone else.  All it takes is a bad break up, or a cancer diagnosis and we are all prepped for a rather unpleasant going away party.</p>

<p>What kind of shit was this guy thinking when he locked himself in the cockpit and decided to crash a plane full of randoms?  </p>

<p>Was he thinking &quot;These are just a bunch of rude customers who are the reason i have to work such bad hours&quot;  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know!</p>

<p>Was he thinking &quot;These people are all flying to this final destination, I hate people who live there, I&#39;ll just kill them all because then i win&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know!</p>

<p>Was he on meds? Did he have a brain tumor that affected his thoughts?  </p>

<p>I Don&#39;t Know!</p>

<p>All i know is that without so much propaganda to drive us to HATE, those meds, that depression or maybe even a brain tumor wouldn&#39;t have had a foundation of HATE to act upon and maybe he would have expressed himself in some other way that wouldn&#39;t have cost so many people their lives.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You nailed it man. We&#39;re bombarded by all sides and all times to hate and envy each other, because if we really just took the time to realize that we all breathe the same air and (insert Monsanto dig here) want to eat the same food, yet our skin tone is different, or we worship a different diety, or we were born in a &#39;country&#39; with borders that were not defined by me or you, I should hate you, take  up arms against you, and kill you (not you specifically, I&#39;d much rather share a beer with ya).</p>

<p>It&#39;s the biggest tragedy I can really surmise and think about ATM, when you look at  history (real history) and how armies are formed and mobilized due to existential threats that may be real or imagined and <em>millions</em> of brothers and sisters and fathers and mothers die as a result, and corporations and banks get rich off of the cannon fodder. It keeps me up at night. And it keeps me here. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s the only silver lining so far, unfortunately. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the rest of this site is so hostile. Everyone senses in their subconscious that shit ain&#39;t right yet the unpleasant feeling of cognitive dissonance and the mental work required to unpack that feeling is too much, so that when someone comes along who challenges the default narrative, they lash out with the full force of their deep seated insecurity. </p>

<p>Why should it matter to you if someone shares a controversial opinion? The way some people react, it&#39;s like their whole reality depends upon you being wrong so they launch into some hate filled diatribe at you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree whole-heartedly regarding the hostility of users here. </p>

<p>I invite you to check out an attempt I had to today with <a href="/u/arminery">/u/arminery</a>, who challenged me on a top comment in this sub regarding the ISIS beheading fuckery. It quickly devolved into word semantics and nothing of substance, so I bailed, but it was a great example (IMO) of a user trying to take time out of my day and distracting me for no reason other than to &#39;occupy&#39; me. </p>

<p>And sure, I fell for it, but today wasn&#39;t that big of a day for me in the real world, and I had some time to burn. It&#39;s blatant, IMO. I won&#39;t link it, but it&#39;s in both our user histories from the past few hours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what frustrates me.</p>

<p>The stills of the beheaded bodies in the ISIS beheading vids, particularly the early ones with the head placed on the back, are, to me, clearly photoshopped and badly done. Basically, the head has been cut out of one picture and pasted onto another so it looks like it has been cut off and is resting on the lower back of the body. </p>

<p>The frustrating thing is that there are millions of people who have the skills to do this kind of image manipulation really well. These people know what gives away a fake, because they strive to ensure their own attempts at such fakery look real, that the shadows are believable and other such small details.</p>

<p>I am someone with those skills, albeit fairly pedestrian. But, even I can see clearly that the job is a bad one.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/arlxANx.jpg">Here is the still</a> (warning, fake gore)</p>

<p>Look at the interface between the chin and the orange of the shirt. There is no shadow and the &quot;cut out&quot; look is blatantly revealing that that&#39;s exactly what it is.</p>

<p>Problem is, I can&#39;t seem to find people to weigh in on it. There are people out there who can spot much better fakes than this, but they won&#39;t even look at it. It&#39;d be like no one ever watching the buildings collapse on 9/11 because it&#39;s &quot;too scary&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny you being that up - I believe that&#39;s the angle the Truth movement has to take. Think about it.</p>

<p>We had AE911, but I&#39;m not an architect and I&#39;m not am engineer.</p>

<p>But you know what I can do? I&#39;m pretty good at spotting bullshit when I see it. So last summer I went and archived all 24 hours of the coverage and watched it. For every network.</p>

<p>Watched it all. Like an episode a night (they are broken into 30 minute to 60 minute files). </p>

<p>And there&#39;s fuckery everywhere with bullshit interviews, bullshit coverage, and even inserting graphics on the lower third on some of the networks to cover up the shitty plane footage until they got it right (the infamous nose-out).</p>

<p>And they <em>tell you it&#39;s a plane</em>, so it&#39;s a plane.</p>

<p>They <em>tell you Saddam has WMDs</em> so he had WMDs. </p>

<p>They tell you <em>this guy was beheaded</em> and the powerful, suggestible human brain sees it.</p>

<p>They tell you he video <em>clearly shows Dzhozkar dropping the bomb at the finish line</em>, and people see it.</p>

<p>I keep banging the drums here about checking sources - but can&#39;t say I&#39;ve seen a project like this discussed or undertaken. And all it takes is an internet connection, an open-mind, and hr willingness to trade the time spent watching The Voice to watching ABCs coverage from 8:30 to 9:00 and comparing it to what Fox had. And what ABC had. And then eventually they all coalesce on the Official Version, and <em>create the reality</em> that is Truth. It&#39;s straight outta 1984, man.</p>

<p>But I havent gotten enough people willing to slug through it and take notes and maybe crowd source something.</p>

<p>Feel me?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would <em>say</em> that that sounds like a worthwhile project, but then I think of how much information is out there about 9/11, and all the summaries of that information, and then thinking how the main points that controvert the official story are just so blindingly obvious in their veracity, yet we still get people who have never even heard of WTC7. It makes you wonder if it&#39;s not the quality of the research but rather the attitude of people that needs to change.</p>

<p>Further, the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor.</p>

<p>This is semantics. </p>

<p>a) the video shows a beheading</p>

<p>b) they don&#39;t show a <em>full</em> beheading from start to finish</p>

<p>both statements are true, they aren&#39;t mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve watched the videos, the part where he actually starts to saw off the head is cut out. Why have IS done that? I don&#39;t know, probably because it takes a long time to cut through sinew, muscle and bone and is extremely messy. </p>

<p>IS also killed a Jordanian pilot by burning him alive. I watched the video, they pretty much showed the full thing, but they still cut parts out</p>

<p>IS have executed and killed a lot of people in Syria and Northern Iraq, it&#39;s been well documented and reported. In fact, insurgents, militants, martyr&#39;s brigades and extremists have been executing and mutilating prisoners of all nationalities for well over a decade in the region. Kenneth Bigley was decapitated, Pearl was decapitated, Magaret Hassan was mutilated and many others.</p>

<p>If you are claiming that these four beheadings are hoaxes/faked/not real.. then that raises a huge amount of questions about not just these victims, but also all the other victims, and calls into question the whole premise of IS (who number an estimated 31,000) and can currently count the US, Iran, Lebanon and Assad as their enemies.</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite the claim. If you have some new information that this claim is based on .. I would naturally be curious. If your entire claim is based on the fact that you <em>don&#39;t see</em> the actual head cutting part.. ergo it&#39;s not real, then that&#39;s something else entirely.</p>

<p>So? Do they have a bandwith issue with the uploads? Some of their propaganda videos are 45 minutes long. Who cares? And if you really think that little pen knife could actually do what is purported to do, I have some beach front property that&#39;s perfect for you.</p>

<p>IS have executed and killed a lot of people in Syria and Northern Iraq, it&#39;s been well documented and reported. In fact, insurgents, militants, martyr&#39;s brigades and extremists have been executing and mutilating prisoners of all nationalities for well over a decade in the region. Kenneth Bigley was decapitated, Pearl was decapitated, Magaret Hassan was mutilated and many others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad people are bad. I think we all get the message. Do you really think you need to convince me of this? I obviously know what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are claiming that these four beheadings are hoaxes/faked/not real.. <strong>then that raises a huge amount of questions about not just these victims, but also all the other victims</strong>, and calls into question the whole premise of IS (who number an estimated 31,000) and can currently count the US, Iran, Lebanon and Assad as their enemies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False equivalency fallacy, plain and simple. Just because some of these hoaxed videos were used for propaganda purposes, doesn&#39;t mean terrible things aren&#39;t happening in Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, and Syria. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s quite the claim. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, your claim. Just because some of these videos are hoaxes does not mean all videos are hoaxes. It does not mean that some very angry people are somehow armed with American military equipment, have the logistical support to drill, refine, and sell oil on the black market (lol), and have fancy new Toyota Hyluxes and plenty of time to run roughshod through Iraq and Syria while the most advanced military power on the planet, with fleets of drones and spy satellites and army bases in Iraq, let it get <em>this bad</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have some new information that this claim is based on .. I would naturally be curious. </p>

<p>Well, you weren&#39;t curious enough to even watch the videos until yesterday, do I doubt that very much.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If your entire claim is based on the fact that you <em>don&#39;t see</em> the actual head cutting part.. ergo it&#39;s not real, then that&#39;s something else entirely.</p>

<p>Being incredulous isn&#39;t evidence of anything. The smaller the knife, the harder the job is. It doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s impossible. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bad people are bad. I think we all get the message. Do you really think you need to convince me of this? I obviously know what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>You missed the point. If they are more than willing to execute people, why does it need to be faked? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just because some of these hoaxed videos were used for propaganda purposes, doesn&#39;t mean terrible things aren&#39;t happening in Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, and Syria.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you do think these videos are hoaxed. The reasoning for that seems to hinge entirely on the fact that the actual head cutting part is left out. </p>

<p>Which begs the question, are all decapitations from the region faked because there wasn&#39;t actually footage of the head being removed from the body?</p>

<p>If you believe that decapitations happen in the region, then what makes you believe that? does every decapitation require a video that fully shows the decapitation from start to finish?</p>

<p>That premise alone opens up a huge amount of further questions</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, the video where the guy is in a cage without a floor? And he just sits there and watches the cliche fire trail leap up to him? Any rational person would <em>literally pick up the cage and try and run away</em>*, not stand there and take it. I suggest you watch it again. And who leaked that video again? The same people who leaked the Filey/Sotloff/Kassig videos? Oh....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you believe that video is a hoax as well? again that seems to be entirely based on your own personal incredulity on the matter. That cage looks heavy enough to me. It&#39;s been reported that the pilot was drugged before the burning, IS have been known to drug certain victims before execution (e.g. Muslims). </p>

<p>Again, it begs a bevy of questions, do you know something the Jordanian leadership, intelligence services, military, and the pilot&#39;s family don&#39;t? why would they fake this when IS execute people all the time? </p>

<p>These claims seem to be following a distinct pattern. Because a part of the video is cut out or a part of it doesn&#39;t subjectively look real to you, that is enough for you to determine they are hoaxes</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It does not mean that some very angry people are somehow armed with American military equipment</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes they have American military equipment. Most of which they got from Iraq. Either from the retreating Iraqi forces or from the military bases they overran. They also have Russian equipment, doesn&#39;t mean the Russians are supplying them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>have the logistical support to drill, refine, and sell oil on the black market</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They control entire cities, like Mosul in Iraq, which is over a million people. Electricity, sewage, water, administration, schools, etc. They also run oil refineries. The same happened in Libya, rebels took over and ran oil refineries. The irony is that some of the oil they sell on the black market ends up going to the Syrian regime, their direct enemies. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and have fancy new Toyota Hyluxes and plenty of time to run roughshod through Iraq and Syria</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They have access to any amount of cars and properties they want in the areas they control. They have captured airports, banks, military bases, huge swathes of land.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the most advanced military power on the planet, with fleets of drones and spy satellites and army bases in Iraq, let it get this bad</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not just the yanks, but Jordan, Iraq, Iran, every regional player let it get this bad. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, you weren&#39;t curious enough to even watch the videos until yesterday, do I doubt that very much</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t like watching people getting beheaded. I&#39;ve watched many similar videos during the Iraq war and subsequent insurgency, as well as videos from Afghanistan and conflicts in Africa. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You do realize we&#39;re still stuck on Socratic Question #1 right? But before we can move on, you have to break your doublethink. It&#39;s hard, I know. But we can do it together, if you want.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m just asking questions, if these simple questions cannot be handled without getting defensive and employing dodging or deflecting techniques, then it would suggest that the claim is failing to stand up to the most elementary scrutiny</p>

<p>Don&#39;t take it so personally. It&#39;s just a claim, you might be right, you might be wrong. However if you can&#39;t give decent answers.. then it seems to be it&#39;s a weak claim, more in line with a personal belief, than any sort of groundbreaking information.</p>

<p>You are spot on about the videos, it&#39;s true, the generic jihadist videos are generally, shaky, blurry affairs. Whereas the IS productions are slick and professional. That&#39;s because, as a group, they are nothing like other jihadist groups.</p>

<p>IS take up to an estimated 3 million dollars a day from various sources and activities (oil refining, smuggling, extortion, theft, ransoms, etc) they control a large portion of Northern Iraq and they run large areas and cities/towns in Syria. Like I said, they&#39;ve raided banks, they control airports, they have an incredibly organised administration system. It&#39;s no problem for them to make quality videos and propaganda, in fact, it appears to be a priority</p>

<p>Considering they have recruited thousands from Europe alone, it&#39;s obvious that their online propaganda plays a vital role in swelling their numbers and &quot;legitimizing&quot; their cause</p>

<p>They are the wealthiest and most powerful extremist Islamic group

<p>The US cannot locate and kill 32,000 men spread out over thousands of square kilometres with air strikes alone.. it&#39;s not like the movies. In the second battle of Fallujah in Iraq, 10,000 US troops took a month just to route insurgents and take the city - they took nearly 100 casualties doing so (and that was against often poorly armed and disorganised insurgents) Likewise the Kurds, whom are receiving broad international help, and the Iraqi army are struggling to retake areas from IS.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s a bit odd to be incredulous that a wealthy terrorist group can make slick videos, but a complicated hoax is more plausible</p>

<p>You think IS would suddenly accept the arrival of foreign made hoax videos? that intelligence agencies of non-aligned US countries would somehow, you know, not notice them? that no investigative journalists or veteran Middle Eastern reporters would spot it? that the family, friends, and native governments of all the different nationalities killed in Syria and Iraq by IS would somehow be fooled by it/in on it?</p>

<p>...ever think about how we went from AOL all those years ago back to this? Where we only spend time on a few sites (before, AOL, now it&#39;s FB/Twitter/reddit), where it is <em>far easier</em> to manipulate and control content for users and influence public opinion and crystallize it?</p>

<p>I find it strangely ironic, and it&#39;s lost on those who didn&#39;t grow up listening to their modem&#39;s dialing up after school every day, and when their mother&#39;s picked up the phone to answer a telephone call, their internet connection ran out and they were disconnected. </p>

<p>As far as Yemen goes - it looks like they are in line for some good old fashion democracy as the Houthis (who you will notice will be reported as rebels, as Iran-backed, etc) are taking over for the time being. The old regime was very friendly to us and allowing us to drone AQAP all day erryday, and I doubt the Houthis will be as cool with it. Expect fireworks, but it&#39;ll probably be barely reported on.</p>

<p>As far as the AIIB goes, James Corbett has a nice piece from a few days ago that explains it much better than I ever could <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/chinas-aiib-what-you-need-to-know/">here</a>. Worth checking out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole event has all but been explained in record time. All from a recording. From which they could identify whose where the cries, the knocks on the door, the <em>breathing</em>.</p>

<p>And then all the convenient shredded notes and previous reports no one had taken notice of.</p>

<p>Smells like they are throwing the co-pilot under the bus. Maybe some catastrophic navigation systems&#39; failure that Airbus doesn&#39;t want to be made public was the actual reason but it&#39;s easier to blame the guy. </p>

<p>Maybe some... <em>glitch</em>. Honestly, I was expecting this to be blamed on <em>cyberhacking terrorists</em>, perhaps some of those ISlS social media geniuses that ensnare foolish teens via twitter and instagram. Well, it&#39;s still early in the game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve listened to the so called record. You hear nobody talking nor yelling which I regard as extremely unlikely in the official theory. </p>

<p>According to a real long time pilot the plane must have gone down 10-15% degrees which can&#39;t be ignored by the passengers.</p>

<p>What you hear are a few &quot;knocks&quot;, some background noise from the air radio communication, beeping to signal danger and the airstream influencing the airplane stability causing some flattering.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t recall hearing explicit breathing but that might have been below my notice level. I only listened to it once.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that was not the answer I was expecting, haha. I wonder if it is a sarcastic thing, similar to how the romans hung a note over dying jesus sarcastically naming him &quot;King of the Jews&quot;. You are &quot;Bohemian Grove&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;d call it a crown of thorns, but it probably doesn&#39;t hurt that much to wear. It is just a picture of an owl, after all. But that is a pretty strange story, and I have a feeling it is to flag your account so it&#39;s more visible (requiring you to be on your best behavior) and to discredit you to anyone who knows what that logo is, although it would probably just draw them in so they would listen more closely, I mean how often do you meet someone who is openly associated with Bohemian Grove? </p>

<p>The US cannot locate and kill 32,000 men spread out over thousands of square kilometres with air strikes alone.. it&#39;s not like the movies. In the second battle of Fallujah in Iraq, 10,000 US troops took a month just to route insurgents and take the city - they took nearly 100 casualties doing so (and that was against often poorly armed and disorganised insurgents) Likewise the Kurds, whom are receiving broad international help, and the Iraqi army are struggling to retake areas from IS.</p>
