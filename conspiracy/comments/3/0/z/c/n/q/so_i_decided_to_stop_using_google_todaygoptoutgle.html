        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been on the fence for a long time, but just yesterday I finally fell hard off that fence. </p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/@DanSanchezV/don-t-see-evil-148ae18bc9fe">Don’t See Evil: Google’s boycott campaign against war photography and alternative media</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>This goes way beyond how Google runs <a href="http://www.google.com/adsense/start/">AdSense</a>; there&#39;s some really questionable things going on with the very nature of the business in regards to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent">manufacturing of consent</a>; content bubbles: tracking, censorship and targeted filtering. </p>

<p>Sure, it&#39;s not like I didn&#39;t get anything in return, but any cheap whore could claim the same. <em><sup>-nothing</sup> <sup>personal</sup> <sup>against</sup> <sup>whores</sup></em> </p>

<p>But I started wondering where all this would lead to if everyone just kept doing what they are doing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that I think Google is the <em>only</em> problem we face, or even the worst, but it is definitely one that <em>I</em> can currently opt-out of, because I still have a choice. A single data point, if even that.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I had dumped <strong>Facebook</strong> years ago for similar but less dire reasons; I must say I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve missed out on much.</p>

<p>But leaving <strong>Google</strong> behind will be harder, their search engine is simply the best overall, though <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DDG</a> is coming along just fine. </p>

<p>Additionally, there will be the lack of some utility with <strong>Youtube</strong>, as I won&#39;t be using an account when accessing videos.</p>

<p><strong>GMail</strong> will be the easiest to leave, I haven&#39;t actively used it in years ever since Google implemented their sweeping identity related changes. There are plenty of other free e-mail services to choose from out there.</p>

<p>As a user of a Linux based OS, I have had to rely on Google <strong>Chrome</strong> to be able to access Netflix, but that too is no longer necessary since the release of <a href="http://pipelight.net/cms/installation.html">Pipelight</a> for Firefox. It also helps that I really like the Firefox browser.</p>

<p>There are just far too many eggs in the Google basket. We here in <a href="/r/conspiracy/">/r/conspiracy/</a> are well aware of the collusion that goes on between the surveillance apparatus and the corporate technological industry; and we also know there&#39;s not a whole damn much we can do about it.</p>

<p>But, <em>I</em> can choose to stop giving Google direct access to my online activities, I can choose to support competing solutions and hopefully more customer oriented ones. Google will still mine the web, I can&#39;t change that, but I won&#39;t be giving them a piggyback anymore in my browser.</p>

<p>So, yeah, I&#39;ll take a small amount of inconvenience just to make a point while also hopefully avoid being just another whining hypocrite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a coincidence, I made the same decision a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>I think we all here need to understand, that with the keywords we frequently use in this subreddit we are likely to be on a list and undergo manual (human) inspection from some underling at the NSA every now and again.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m a perfectly law abiding citizen, but I dont want these fuckers looking through my stuff none the less. Adding to that, I&#39;m mad as hell, and the less they know about me the day I stand up to them the better.</p>

<p>As you say, its a slight inconvenience. Google, Microsoft etc offer some slick free services that the competition is not up to in many ways. However, its at the point where the trade off is well worth it.</p>

<p>Heres some solutions I&#39;m using:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>PC:
Ditched Windows 8 for Elementary OS. Its a slick Linux OS that looks good, is easy to use and has some nice features. Its annoying in some ways, like finding a driver for my printer and Wifi card. Using Firefox with Tor instead of Chrome. Inconvenience factor: medium</p></li>
<li><p>Email. Ditched Gmail for Tutanota. Its a free, open source encrypted email service. The web browser version is nice but they dont really have a proper Android app (just a web app). However development is strong. Inconvenience factor: medium</p></li>
<li><p>Phone. Still using my Android phone (wouldnt touch Apple). For messaging, have download the free and open source Textsecure (&#39;Signal private messenger&#39; on iOS). Its a sexy messaging app that offers encrypted sms/mms and file sharing to other users of the app. It can also be your default SMS app, as it can send unencrypted SMS messages to people who dont have the App. Its sister app Redphone can be used to make encrypted calls. Inconvenience factor: none</p></li>
<li><p>Search: Using startpage. It goes through google, but doesnt give them your data. At the end of the day no search engine is nearly as good as google at this stage. Inconvenience factor: low</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Duck duck go isn&#39;t so great, maybe I&#39;m paranoid but I just don&#39;t feel safe using it, plus startpage uses google anonymously so you still get the &quot;relevant&quot; results</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This will be more and more true as they expand out into areas like an Internet service provision, operating systems and connected hardware, etc.</p>

<p>But to continue using Chrome, GMail, Youtube, Google Search Engine and the host of other direct to consumer services is tantamount to just handing them everything on a silver platter.</p>

<p>Yeah, Google has an algorithm for everything, I&#39;m sure they will be able to finesse a lot by just following crumbs; but the point is to try and make a point.</p>

<p>Google hasn&#39;t spent millions upon millions of dollars to create a web browser, a search engine, an ad revenue model and everything else just to be nice; they want and need as many people as possible using those things.</p>

<p>It&#39;s still not too late for a sea change, but someday soon, it might very well be impossible. The day is fast approaching where viable alternatives will have dried up and the gate-keeping system will be all around us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not unrealistic enough to think that <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/901182-3x2-940x627.jpg">this</a> is going to work with Google, or significantly slow the momentum it currently maintains. However, it might strengthen and help grow alternatives to Google, for those care. </p>

<p>But I do think that the statistical notable attrition of  direct consumers will send a signal to the company and allow for better competition from Google competitors who are perhaps marginally (or even exceptionally) more ethical.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even expecting Google to &quot;change&quot; its ways. But, it is possible that if a small but noteworthy percentage of current Google users across the board start immigrating <em>from</em> direct Google to consumer services to competing services, then that will embolden the competition.</p>

<p>Google hasn&#39;t spent millions upon millions of dollars to create a web browser, a search engine, an ad revenue model and everything else just to be nice; they want and need as many people as possible using those things.</p>

<p>Competition is the only thing that can keep the Google takeover from being a foregone conclusion. </p>

<p>This is how the market is supposed to work. I don&#39;t want a law, or the police or some government agency to storm Google HQ; I want people to vote with their feet and say: <em>&quot;No more piggy backing, trading freedom for a convenience is not something we want anymore&quot;.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha great subreddit. </p>

<p>Before I got back on to Reddit, I deleted my facebook and all other forms of social media for like 2 years. Then I reinstated a Twitter, Facebook, Gmail account, and a few other social media sites, in order to created a limited hang out of myself -- mostly because that kind of shit just amuses me. I told my close friends what I&#39;m doing, so they wouldn&#39;t be confused as to why I&#39;m a rabid Obama supporter all of a sudden. </p>

<p>But all of the time I&#39;ve wasted on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is really fucking up my game. And I&#39;ve been pretty lazy about it, emailing friends and colleagues about conspiracy theories via gmail. Needless to say being a limited hang out takes more discipline than I anticipated; respect to Snowden. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not paranoid or anything -- honest. I was just hoping to have some fun with the interrogator once they round us up in the FEMA camps. ;) But I think I fucked it up thanks to my laziness, they&#39;re gonna know! </p>
