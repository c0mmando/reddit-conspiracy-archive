        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Terms You Need to Know:</strong>   </p>

<p><strong>Administrator (Admin)</strong> -  Reddit employee who can issue site-wide IP bans, shadow bans, and can shut down entire communities.<br/>
<strong>Moderator (Mod)</strong> -  Volunteers who create and manage individual communities. Mods can ban from their communities, but cannot issue sitewide bans of any kind (IP ban, shadowban, etc.)  </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Types of Bans:</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>Ban (Subreddit Ban)</strong> -  A ban from an individual subreddit issued by a moderator of that community.<br/>
<strong>Shadowban</strong> -  An <em>un-notified</em>, site-wide ban on a user. Everything appears normal to the user, but no one else can see their new posts. Originally used for spammers, but the usage has broadened.<br/>
<strong>IP ban</strong> -  A site-wide ban on any traffic from an IP address, including alternate (or sockpuppet) accounts. This is the most extreme kind of ban.<br/>
<strong>Vote manipulation</strong> -  Artificially inflating vote counts by creating multiple accounts with which to upvote or downvote, an IP bannable and shadow bannable offense.<br/>
<strong>Vote brigading</strong> -  Navigating to another subreddit (often using meta links) for the purpose of voting or commenting in a community to which you are not subscribed. This rule is unknown to many users, but reddit doesn&#39;t try to publicize it (I&#39;ll explain why I think that is later).<br/>
<strong>Shadowbait</strong> - The act of tricking (baiting) users into breaking voting rules (vote brigading) which can result in a shadowban. I believe this is being used to silence &#39;controversial&#39; opinions.<br/>
<strong>Controversial subreddit</strong> - A community that attracts negative attention from other reddit communities for any number of reasons. This is not limited to one ‘side’ of any particular issue. For example: <a href="/r/ShitRedditSays">/r/ShitRedditSays</a> and <a href="/r/MensRights">/r/MensRights</a> both consider each other to be a “controversial subreddit,” as do <a href="/r/SubredditDrama">/r/SubredditDrama</a> and <a href="/r/FatPeopleHate">/r/FatPeopleHate</a>. Subreddits I consider controversial are subs like <a href="/r/ShitRedditSays">/r/ShitRedditSays</a>, <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a>, <a href="/r/CoonTown">/r/CoonTown</a>, etc. My criteria for “controversial” is based on how often admins have to intervene in events (like vote brigading) that occurs between reddit communities.  </p>

<p>Most subreddits on this site operate without much intervention on the part of the admins. But controversial communities (like meta subs, circlejerk subs, racist subs, hate subs, etc.) tend to require a lot of administrator oversight since they’re the main centers of site-wide rule breaking activity.     </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong><em>Partial</em> disclosure about me:</strong> I’m on a throwaway for obvious reasons. I’m not actually an <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> user (or really a user of any particularly controversial subreddits, for that matter), but as a mod of several of the larger, more “mainstream” subs (not defaults), I’m growing concerned with the direction reddit is taking.    </p>

<p>I don’t take part in things like racism, conspiracy theories, politics, or general negativity on this website; I’m here to laugh and talk about video games. <strong>BUT: a lot of the censorship that <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> and similar subs have witnessed is leaking into other communities.</strong>     </p>

<hr/>

<p>There is ample evidence for my following several conclusions, but my last conclusions are difficult (if not impossible) to actually prove.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you hang around any of the meta subs (<a href="/r/SubredditDrama">/r/SubredditDrama</a>, <a href="/r/Drama">/r/Drama</a>, <a href="/r/SubredditCancer">/r/SubredditCancer</a>, <a href="/r/ShitRedditSays">/r/ShitRedditSays</a>, <a href="/r/Undelete">/r/Undelete</a>, etc.) then you probably know what a “shadow ban” is. A shadow ban is an un-notified ban where a user’s posts will not show up for anyone else but that user.    </p></li>
<li><p>Shadow bans were originally used for spammers, since an un-notified ban meant the spammers would continue spamming, unaware of their ban. This meant a longer time before they knew they needed to create a new account (or in the case of a bot, it might simply post in perpetuity) .     </p></li>
<li><p><strong>The scope of &quot;shadow-bannable offenses&quot; gradually grew to be used against vote manipulation, brigading, etc.</strong> (See definitions above.)      </p></li>
<li><p>Unknowing users who post to “controversial subreddits” can be caught in shadowban filters if they break voting rules (like by clicking and voting on meta links between subreddits, or &quot;vote brigading&quot;).   </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Users who get shadowbanned because they accidentally broke rules <em>can and do</em> often have their bans reversed if the shadow banned user contacts the admins.</strong>   </p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>Everything I just said above is a verifiable fact if you browse the archives of the meta subreddits and do some simple Google searching. What I’m about to say next is a conclusion I’ve drawn from over 5 years of modding subs and using this site, but not one I can prove. I personally have a very high bar for evidence, and since I don&#39;t have hard data, I simply present this as a hypothesis:    </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Users who are members of “controversial subreddits” that the admins disagree with have a much, <em>much</em> more difficult time getting their shadowbans reversed, while users of more mainstream, &quot;less controversial&quot; subs often have their shadowbans reversed within a few days.</strong>  </p></li>
<li><p>(I have personally witnessed users of video game subs who were caught in shadow ban &#39;filters&#39; get unbanned within hours, even if they <em>did</em> break a rule, but did so unintentionally.)      </p></li>
<li><p><strong>I believe the seemingly arbitrary shadow ban rules are being used as an excuse to ban &quot;toxic&quot; users (read: people with unpopular and/or offensive opinions), and keep them banned.</strong>   </p></li>
<li><p><strong>When ‘non-toxic’ users break these rules, the shadow ban can easily be reversed if the user inquires and/or apologizes and restates an understanding of vote brigading rules.</strong>  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>But when someone in a controversial community breaks these rules, the admins will ignore any pleas for reversal with the argument, &quot;Thems the rules, son.&quot;</strong>  </p></li>
<li><p>Hopefully my point is becoming clear: <strong>Reddit has a system where shadow bans are handed out widely and with little discretion, but shadow ban reversals are only handed out to those who are subjectively deemed worthy by the admins.</strong>   </p></li>
<li><p><strong>As someone who frequents several meta subs, I believe many meta sub users, power users, and even some mods intentionally incite drama between differing subreddits to try to get people shadowbanned, which directly leads to unpopular uses being <em>permanently</em> shadowbanned since their requests for reversal are almost never met</strong>.   </p>

<hr/></li>
</ul>

<p>I guess an argument could be made that it&#39;s not intentional. For all I know, some admins could get hundreds or even thousands of requests for shadow ban reversals every day. And when you give a person individual discretion and a large enough sample size of personal judgments, their biases are prone to show even if they&#39;re <em>trying</em> to be objective.  </p>

<p>But I&#39;m not so sure about that. I really think this is reddit&#39;s hush hush method of trying to root out racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. users.  </p>

<p>The problem is that what constitutes racism, sexism, homophobia, and other morally controversial subjects is largely open to interpretation. What is considered an edgy or off color joke to one person can easily be considered threatening hate speech to another person.   </p>

<p>This is the nature of a place where people gather anonymously, especially when you add in problems of context, subjectivity, personal experiences and preferences, etc.   </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>The only easy &#39;solution&#39; (read: workaround) to this problem of &quot;shadowbaiting&quot; and &quot;shadow ban reversal bias&quot; is for people who are potentially a part of &quot;controversial&quot; communities to make themselves fully aware of the shadowban rules.</strong> Know when you&#39;ve been banned by <a href="http://nullprogram.com/am-i-shadowbanned/">checking your username on this website</a> or even posting in <a href="/r/ShadowBanned">/r/ShadowBanned</a>.    </p>

<p>I tried to keep this as concise as possible to not deter anyone from reading it (and still probably failed in that regard), but if you want me to elaborate on any of my points, let me know and I’ll expand.   </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m going to go cry in the shower because I&#39;m ashamed of just having spent an hour typing this.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting post.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had so many butthurt conspiratards claim to have &quot;reported me&quot; to the admins that I&#39;m actually surprised I&#39;ve never had any issues.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a combination of the fact that I only vote in this sub, I don&#39;t post for link karma (anymore), I only use tor, and I generate a good deal of gold (have 3 months left of 2 years or so). </p>

<p>Also, I try to be very respectful (most of the time heh) and I <em>genuinely</em> want to make reddit a better place, where folks can freely discuss topics that may seem &quot;controversial&quot; to others. </p>

<p>That being said, it&#39;s shocking to me as a mod of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> how many shadowbanned accounts I stumble upon.</p>

<p>As your astute summary suggests, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is one of the &quot;naughty&quot; subs, and it stands to reason that a lot of shadowbanned users comment here.</p>

<p>What&#39;s crazy is, à la Sixth Sense, they would be completely unaware of their predicament if I (or another mod) hadn&#39;t stumbled upon their comment while reading various threads (their comments appear &quot;faded&quot; compared to others). </p>

<p>At the very least we are able to approve their comment, inform them of the shadowban, and wish them luck. I know the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods go out of their way to provide this service...I wonder how many other (larger) subs can say the same?</p>

<p>It&#39;s all rather surreal.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a bit confused by this.  At least 95% of my history on Reddit is in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> so this is the only sub I know really well.  </p>

<p>Is OP saying that if I go to another sub and vote without subscribing to that sub, I am vote brigading?  How about if I vote on posts in &quot;all?&quot;  Cause that&#39;s one place I go regularly other than <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and I do sometimes vote.  </p>

<p>And are you saying that you see faded out comments from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> members but are able to override the shadowban for those specific comments but can do nothing to remove the ban?</p>

<p>So it sounds like I would be a prime candidate for shadowbanning, as a heavy <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> user.  As I travel around Redditland, do mods in other subs see what I&#39;m subscribed to and judge me negatively for being subscribed to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?</p>

<p>Sorry if this all seems obvious to others, it&#39;s not to me.  Thanks.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To my knowledge, only if you directly click a link in another sub to the one you vote on, <em>and someone reports you</em>, do you get shadowbanned for vote-brigading.

<p>Only if you happen to follow a link from another sub of origin. For example, if a user posts a link to r/conspiracy to point out the unfair treatment of another user in another sub and you follow that link and proceed to vote with your conscience, or as you would normally, you are now participating in what the admins and certain powermods consider a &quot;vote brigade&quot; and will risk having your account shadowbanned as a result. This is why the much (and unnecessarily) hated Automoderator will typically issue a polite reminder to use np (no participation) when posting such links here, so that anyone who votes after using these links will not be banned arbitrarily afterward.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And are you saying that you see faded out comments from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>[3] members but are able to override the shadowban for those specific comments but can do nothing to remove the ban?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mods will still be able to see shadowbanned comments, shown as being removed by the autmoderator, as they would with those that are removed by the spam filter. If a user is shadowbanned, when you check the user&#39;s overview it will say &#39;page not found&#39;.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If you vote in another thread while browsing that sub or reddit normally, it shouldn&#39;t be a problem. This is a technicality the admins and certain powermods use to go after users who legitimately brigade and others they may wish to target disproportionately for ideological reasons, and should only affect you if you intentionally or incidentally vote in such a thread after arriving from another thread or link originating within reddit.</p>

<p>Yes, exactly.</p>

<p>Either the faded comments are from new users (your account has to be a few days old to post here) or the user is shadowbanned. To tell, I just click on the user name, and if it takes me to a &quot;page not found&quot; then I know their shadowbanned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that last line is the real problem. When you &quot;cater to the masses&quot; <em>most</em> people don&#39;t see a problem. The people in the default subs that don&#39;t visit &quot;outside&quot; subs like this have the same mentality of the people that say &quot;if you&#39;re not doing anything wrong, you have nothing to worry about!&quot;... Its a symptom physically manifesting representitive of a psycholgical societal illness, IMO. The problem is...the people determining right from wrong are EXTREMELY biased and think that THEIR worldview and concept of right and wrong is infallible... Basically, &quot;I need to enforce this perspective on the rest of reddit so everyone turns out like me....because I&#39;m always right.&quot;</p>

<p>It will reply to this post as well. Anytime someone links to Reddit in a comment, the bot will pop up with this message. Basically, NP means No Participation, so if you are in an NP domain and vote, you could be shadowbanned. Now, the flipside is that the moderators will tell you that following a <em>normal</em> link in a Reddit comment to a thread and voting in it can get you shadowbanned because &quot;potential brigading.&quot;</p>

<p>If that doesn&#39;t sound like doublethink, I don&#39;t know what does (not to mention the latter will <em>not</em> get you shadowbanned unless the person who posted the link specifically was saying &quot;go here and vote on this&quot;).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, that&#39;s not a specific bot, that&#39;s a script for AutoModerator setup by the mods here.</p>

<p>They do this because subs like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> will ban you for linking into their subreddit from other places.</p>

<p><a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> used to do it even for cross posting the same link to an ideological sub like <a href="/r/libertarian">/r/libertarian</a> (not cross linking, but the type of mirroring politic does)</p>

<p>I despise np.  The admins have never officially endorsed it; it&#39;s a dirty hack that breaks internationalization support.</p>

<p>I do think it plays into vote-manipulation decisions by the admins though (i.e. if you vote while on np I&#39;d expect it to be more likely you will be shadowbanned)</p>

<p>I am, and will forever be opposed to np domain links until reddit adopts it as an official behavior.  Until then it&#39;s broken IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Facebook is to Tor as Santa is to Jesus.  </p>

<p>You have to be pretty ignorant, or a little kid to believe Santa.  He keeps the kids in line for the Adults.  Then there&#39;s Jesus.  You have to be mildly ignorant to believe in Jesus 100% as the savior with the given evidence.  He keeps the adults in line for the Rulers.</p>

<p>You have to be pretty ignorant, or a little kid to believe Facebook is not just a huge data collection program.  Facebook is there to collect data from the average, brainwashed person.  Then there&#39;s Tor.  Tor is for those that are too smart to trust Facebook, but not informed enough to realize that Tor is just another forum for data collection.  Black Markets are run by Intelligence Agencies.  They are the ones supplying silk road and the like.  They probably the ones who keep cutting and running to fund their black budgets(Do you really think the CIA is letting some hackers and drug dealers scam those loads of untraceable bit-coins when they are more capable than anyone in the world?) .  Tor is supposedly anonymous... but not if the guy you are buying off of is a DEA front(who is just making money for the Black Budget, and occasionally collecting intel/shutting out competing drug dealers).  </p>

<p>What if the NSA has millions of computers virtually occupying nodes to identify the whole network?  One would have to figure, as you approach &quot;owning&quot; 100% of the nodes, the anonymization breaks down completely.</p>

<p>If you communicate today using Tor, they can&#39;t tell where your packets are going.</p>

<p>In ten years, if they get to 90% of the nodes, they can track the packets to you and to the destination, but they STILL can&#39;t see the contents of the packets unless they are ALSO running the server you are accessing.</p>

<p>Right now, if that guy you are buying hookers/crack/guns from is a DEA agent, they STILL can&#39;t tell who you are unless you let them know. They STILL have to bust you when you try to pick up the package, and they won&#39;t know who they&#39;re looking for. Any weaknesses in THIS system has nothing to do with Tor... If you want to buy [BlackMarketGoodX], then you have to pick it up. If you&#39;re buying credit card numbers, pirated software or kiddie porn... there ain&#39;t nothin&#39; the man can do about it.</p>

<p>It IS anonymous. It MIGHT not be in the future.
It does not deserve to be placed in a hackneyed metaphor with Santa and a religious icon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not correct.  Bit coin tracking is pretty easy and few properly buy them anonymously(it doesn&#39;t matter how much anonymization software you have if you didn&#39;t properly buy your bitcoins.  Even the services on the darknet that offer to sell you &quot;clean&quot;, &quot;untraceable&quot; bitcoins have the potential to be CIA fronts, once again instilling false anonymization confidence to encourage people to feel safer, and thus be less careful.  They can&#39;t tell who you are?  They have your address/PO box.  They know who you are.  This is not even mentioning that as soon as you download Tor, you go on a list.  Tor is nice.  But it&#39;s like a girl who goes around fucking tons of guys without condoms because she is on birth control.  It gives her false sense of security, which then opens her to dangerous activity.  Same with Tor.  People think they are anonymous.  You&#39;re not.  Tor buys you time.  If somebody has time, and resources Tor alone does not suffice.  If you use Tor, there is probably over a 99% chance the NSA knows about it, and knowing them, they have found a way to circumvent Tor by now, or they&#39;d be fighting it(not promoting it secretly).</p>

<p>EDIT: nice little article showing how they are pushing to make tor more &quot;mainstream&quot;.  Just watched an episode of House of Cards(an obvious US propaganda show).  They not only talked about the darknet.  They glorified it.  Then they specifically mentioned Tor, and another program used.  Then they showed you how to use it.  Let me tell you, the government would not let House of Cards do this if it was not in the gov&#39;ts best interest(House of Cards and US gov&#39;t have agreements for rights of use) <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/03/05/most-popular-bitcoin-apps-soon-to-run-on-tor-anonymity-network/">http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/03/05/most-popular-bitcoin-apps-soon-to-run-on-tor-anonymity-network/</a></p>

<p>EDIT2:  I remember a few years back reading an article a reporter did(unfortunately I looked and could not find it).  He tested the anonymity of tor(mind you he&#39;s a journalist not a hacker).  He was able to get a list of the guy he was buying off of&#39;s customers just by tracking the bit-coins(it&#39;s not just you who has to be perfectly careful... your dealer also has to be perfect.  There is no way of knowing if someone on Tor is protecting themselves properly, or if they are bugged, or if they are Gov&#39;t agent).  His conclusion was that if he could do it being a noob, the government could easily do it.  I don&#39;t think that is too far off(and that was years ago).  Don&#39;t forget who made tor.  Bitcoin could be killed so easily by the gov&#39;t.  It&#39;s not.  For a reason.</p>

<p>And to your other point... if Tor were bad, they wouldn&#39;t allow House of Cards to promote it??? SSL and PGP are devistating for the NSA, and they&#39;re still out there.

It&#39;s how intelligence agencies control congresses and parliaments, by blackmailing them with the list of laws they&#39;ve broken (in situations set up by the intelligence agencies in many cases). Like a certain UK case involving children and parliament that&#39;s been making big headlines the last few months, for example. Same thing is going on in the US. </p>

<p>As someone who frequents several meta subs, I believe many meta sub users, power users, and even some mods intentionally incite drama between differing subreddits to try to get people shadowbanned, which directly leads to unpopular uses being permanently shadowbanned since their requests for reversal are almost never met.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, some mods, even lower level mods, will deliberately provoke certain users to give them the opportunity to ban users without higher level mods or other users bitching too much. <a href="/r/socialism">/r/socialism</a> has been taken over by the right or the FBI, as <a href="/r/communism">/r/communism</a> was long ago, and are working to run off committed users. There&#39;s also a largish sub (covertly glances to right) with a mod who does that and worse and who has repeatedly hurt the sub and held it up to hatred.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You define what vote-brigading is, and how it can relate to &#39;trouble&#39; users.</p>

<p>But you don&#39;t actually note just how thin the vote-brigade rule can be stretched to actually get that ban in the first place, which is key.</p>

<p>Hypothetically:</p>

<p>Admin &#39;DB&#39; notices a user with a viewpoint he personally dislikes. He now looks through through his site-visits/history of that user. Just because, of course. Not that he&#39;d be looking through it if that post weren&#39;t so controversial.</p>

<ul>
<li>&#39;Clicked a link that lead to another place on Reddit&#39;</li>
<li>&#39;Voted anytime within 10 minutes of clicking a link&#39;</li>
</ul>

<p>He can now claim you are apart of a vote brigade. Despite the fact that the original link was not related to the approval/disapproval of the post, or that the user just found the general topic and discussion of the link interesting to them unrelated to the first link location. They fall under a vague, general requirement so they can be shadowbanned on vote brigading and have &#39;proof&#39; of it. I highly suspect this being the case anytime you see the really popular post that goes against the grain but the person suddenly up and gets banned for &#39;vote brigading&#39; and &#39;vote manipulation&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s most telling about this whole thing, is the fact that r/conspiracy &amp; r/undeleted is some of the only subs I can think of that would allow a post like this.  Reddit was all about self posts for a long time, now you can barely use them to generate a conversation about the way reddit is run.  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ikx7g/hey_rpolitics_i_have_a_question_for_you_guys/">When the mods took over the major subs, they did so with a heavy hand</a>.  Now you can&#39;t even have a discussion with a community about the way it is ran.  An example, I would love to discuss with r/worldnews their <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/30pmsn/redditor_points_out_the_fact_that_the_entire/cpunqp8?context=3">definition of &quot;news&quot;</a> and how the rules have almost made it impossible to post anything without breaking a rule]. Maybe it&#39;s by design (which I think is the case) or it&#39;s just a system of rules that have gotten out of hand.  Either way, I feel like their should be an option to discuss the way a sub is being ran through self posts... I already know what the mods would say, but regardless the users should have a say in the rule that their posts are governed by.</p>

<p>The neurotransmitter oxytocin &quot;makes people more co-operative, benevolent, loyal, generous and trusting of others. It is involved in the parent-child bond - new mothers and fathers have raised levels of oxytocin. Production also increases when people hug and when they have sex and, recent research suggests, when they receive psychological warmth.&quot; However, oxytocin has been alleged to &quot;foster racism.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;rationalize racism being alive and well today&quot;? Are you saying that racism doesn&#39;t exist anymore? Seriously? Don&#39;t be ridiculous. Just because we aren&#39;t a segregated nation anymore doesn&#39;t mean that there is no more racism or bigotry.</p>

<p>That said, Coontown was so far off the deep end that I found it absolutely impossible to believe that it was 100% serious. It HAD to be a joke. That brand of humor was far and away from anything I liked, though, so I didn&#39;t browse it long. If you&#39;re saying that everyone in that sub was completely serious about what they were posting, then I think maybe you&#39;re a little naive. Sure, there are absolutely horrible people in the world, but the disgusting shit that went on in that sub was too far gone to be any sort of representation of reality.</p>

<p>They do this because subs like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> will ban you for linking into their subreddit from other places.</p>

<p><a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> used to do it even for cross posting the same link to an ideological sub like <a href="/r/libertarian">/r/libertarian</a> (not cross linking, but the type of mirroring politic does)</p>

<p>I despise np.  The admins have never officially endorsed it; it&#39;s a dirty hack that breaks internationalization support.</p>

<p>I do think it plays into vote-manipulation decisions by the admins though (i.e. if you vote while on np I&#39;d expect it to be more likely you will be shadowbanned)</p>

<p>I am, and will forever be opposed to np domain links until reddit adopts it as an official behavior.  Until then it&#39;s broken IMO.</p>
