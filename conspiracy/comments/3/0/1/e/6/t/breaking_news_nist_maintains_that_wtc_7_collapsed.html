       <em>
        The National Institute of Standards and Technology has committed fraud by releasing this unscientific report. Here is one of the many examples of the agency's coverup of 9-11-2001.
       </em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Technical Statement:
       </strong>
       NIST maintains that WTC 7 collapsed due to fire acting upon the 13th floor A2001 girder between columns 79 and 44 and the beams framing into it from the east.
They said that the beams expanded by 5.5” (revised in
June 2012 to 6.25”), broke the girder
erection bolts, and pushed this girder off its column 79 seat. This girder fell to floor 12, which then precipitated a cascade of floor failures from floor 12 down to floor 5,and
column 79 then became unsupported laterally causing it to buckle. It is then said that
column 79's buckling caused the upper floors to cascade down, which started a chain reaction
— a north - to - south then east - to - west horizontal, progressive collapse — with a global exterior collapse that was captured on the videos. The first omission concerns flange
- to - web stiffeners on the south end of the girder (A2001).
See drawing 9114.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        These omitted stiffeners would prevent the girder flange from folding
when the girder web moved beyond the seat, requiring twice the possible expansion of the
beams framing into the girder from the east to move the girder far enough to the west for it
to fall off its seat.

       It's ridiculous. 
I recently watched a presentation about 9/11 by a swiss historian called Daniele Ganser. 
He provided some very interesting facts, for example that the leading professor for structural engeneering in Switzerland (those who teach architects at universities) stated clearly that it was a controlled demolition. 
But you don't even have to be an expert to see the obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually became interested in 9/11 because a friend of mine spoke about it (we're both history students).
 Before I watched the AE911truth movie, I had never heard about building 7 and especially not about all those witnesses hearing bombs which had been excluded from the original report. 
The biggest step is to get people to look at the evidence - once they look at it, they see it was an inside job.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the official theory was correct, they would have included WTC7 in the 911-story. I mean, if you want to convince people to go to war, it's better when the terrorists knock down 3 buildings, not 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you only know about building 7, when you actively dig into the matter and look for it is a clear sign for a cover-up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think those keyboard-warrior "debunkers" are just naive sheeps, but NIST and those guys know what they're doing. They are just as criminal as Silverstein and the Bush administration.

       I was unaware of the collapse until ~2011.  When I showed this to family, friends, and acquaintances, they were also ignorant to the fact that a third tower fell on 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rabbit hole goes deep, gets convoluted with BS, and there's so much disinformation out there it was hard to really wake up.  The only information I trusted when investigating this collapse was Newtonian Physics.  Free fall is the smoking gun -- that structure cannot achieve free fall acceleration unless all the core columns and support beams were completely removed, providing zero resistance.   This can only be achieved with some sort of demolition device(s).
      </p>
      <p>
       The nail in the coffin was when I called to confirm with NIST that they would
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       release their model data for WTC 7 -- which they confirmed they would not.  They have committed treason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shout out to David Chandler for forcing NIST to admit to free fall acceleration for 2.25s in their final report of WTC 7 -- the best evidence to wake up skeptics.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Never give up, Newtonian Physics do not lie, Governments do.

        <em>
         Responding to the criticism, NIST in its final report issued in November 2008 did finally acknowledge that Building 7 descended at free fall.  According to NIST, “This free fall drop continued for approximately 8 stories, or 32.0 meters (105 ft), the distance traveled between times t = 1.75 s and t = 4.0 s [a period of 2.25 seconds].”

       Yes, physics is the key. I watched several presentations by Richard Gage and this almost 5 hour long one which covered all the events, including the Pentagon and Shanksville. 
It gets crystal clear, especially when you combine it with the interviews by people like Ray McGovern. He said that it had become a strategy since the Kennedy assassination to label anyone with doubts a "conspiracy theorist" so the debate ends before it can even begin.
When you're being ridiculed, labled, cursed at etc, you know you're on the right path. 
Also, I think that Susan Lindauer is credible and her information is very valuable.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, the quotes from NIST you provided made me laugh because I know exactly their strategy. 
Bring as many scientific terms into the discussion, so it seems more legit.

       That's like me destroying a sand castle on the beach, and in order not to get yelled at by my mother, I write a 10 page essay.
"The wind blew at my foot with 30mph, so my ankle offered a minimum of muscular resistance and the initiation of collapse (to which I will refer to as the "final collapse sequence for brevity) became inevitable." LOL

       ...kind of like the NIST 'discovery' of a new physical realm where "thermal expansion" can completely destroy a steel fire proofed high rise — achieving free fall.

       Your example is spot on. Just a minor tweak, instead of telling her what happened right away, wait 7 years like NIST did. Lol

       Can I ask how you and family/friends were unaware until 2011?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this because of your age or the general direction of the US (I presume) media?
      </p>
      <p>
       For example here in the UK it was reported on during the day of the attacks, including beforehand but lets not get into that.
      </p>
      <p>
       They showed footage after it happened and during the following weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've had lots of documentaries by the BBC and Channel 4 through 2002-present and they always show the collapse of building 7 unless it's a more personal account or recreation.

       I really don't understand how people don't know. It was indeed broadcast on the day, and I knew from 9/11/01 that 3 buildings had fallen. Bldg 7 is usually overlooked because no plane flew into it and no one died there. Because everything else was repeated so often, and the whole day was so shocking and horrific, I think people just forgot. Or it took some time for people to care that "wait a second, why
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       this fall down?" It's easy to forget/underestimate just how mind-blowing this was at the time.

       Honestly I can't really pin down what it is. I don't want to diagnose everyone in America with a problem but for the people around me in my life there is a huge, and I mean
       <em>
        HUGE
       </em>
       issue with Nationalism. This is the first thing that comes to mind — politically active people and anyone on TV would bash a president or political foe mercilessly but they would never never question an official narrative release by a government
       <em>
        agency
       </em>
       ... Everyone trusts the FDA, the FBI, the CIA, FEMA and pentagon because they are "bipartisan" and "care" about us. Yeah intelligent people
       <em>
        knew
       </em>
       about Iran Contra or that the Vietnam war was a sham, but it got a pass because "we're the best"... I'm just going off memory here, never really had to articulate this, and I'm only in my mid 20s now so I wasn't into politics during 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       My 2 cents. It seems like anyone who cared about politics was either Fox or CNN/MSNBC — there was no other way to go about finding your clique so people gravitated towards these channels which completely ignore real issues, and no one realized this because they were so busy with IRL life. Basically, if something was
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       wrong, the tv would tell them because one side would expose the other, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I distinctly remember during the fervor after those attacks Neeeever hearing about a 3rd building and honestly I can't remember the news showing any footage of wtc 1/2 collapsing -- just the planes hitting over and over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it makes sense....
      </p>
      <p>
       In conclusion:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         our media is completely hijacked and celebrity-gossip-based and they are all basically parading anything the govt says as truth in a time of tragedy.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Americans have been engrained with the idea of being "
         <strong>
          #1!
         </strong>
         " - back to back world champs murica! -blinded nationalists.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         we trusted that one political party would expose the other if something really bad happened -How naive.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         they would shove "NEVER FORGET" down our throats and named treasonous legislation a "Patriot Act" -- so even if you so overcome and find the truth, you'll be attacked AGGRESSIVELY by both political parties, which results in all media being against you. No cracks for legitimate discourse.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Everything has changed since the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was only in 5th grade when 9/11 happened but I saw the towers come down live. I didn't know anything or care about politics until I was 18 (mid 20s now)...So this is just a random rant, hope it helps.

       NIST is just providing material for the "debunkers" to use as official. They keep asking us to provide evidence. But the real evidence is hidden and kept out of view by the government.

       I don't like it when they labeled us, so I don't want to label them. The biggest group of people that believe the official story are just people who haven't paid attention to all of this. You can't really blame them for being out of the loop—debatable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, of those that support the official story and
       <em>
        actively
       </em>
       defend it, I imagine a large number are shills, and I don't mind if one of them gets called out, but the important part is being aware and able to spot them so you don't get dragged into an endless discussion that attempts to drown out important contributions.

       I'm not trying to persuade people. I said it in a spirit of "preaching to the choir".
      </p>
      <p>
       The facts are all out there, so if you tell me that a single collum weakened by office fire and created a perfectly symmetrical collapse, I either attest you malicious intentions or naivity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also not free from naivity or gullibility. I had faith into the gouvernement theory and my picture of what happened was clear until I decided to actually look at the footage and the experts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some years ago, I would have said: "the gouvernement wouldn't do that", and that's OK, but once you looked at the video tapes and listened to the experts, there is no excuse for that anymore. 
And don't tell me NIST are experts. They make more in a second than we all in a year. They are hired liars.
The truth will come out when people are ready, it's a natural process and I don't want to give myself a hard time arguing with people about high school physics.

       No, the reason a lot of people don't know about WTC7 is because no one died there, it fell ~seven hours after the initial attack, it was collateral damage and was never actually targeted.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a cover-up, it's simple news.  There was no blood, there was no drama.  It was a building on fire that fell.

        Did you know? — Senator Max Cleland Resigned from the 9/11 Commission. "One of these days we will have to get the full story because the 9-11 issue is so important to America. But this White House wants to cover it up."

        What is NIST hiding? — Despite adjusting inputs to achieve the desired result, the NIST model does not come close to reproducing the observed collapse of WTC7. This is also apparent by watching video animations of NIST’s model and comparing them to real footage. Plus, NIST will not release this model data for peer review.

       Ashleigh Banfield, reporting for MSNBC, heard a loud sound from several blocks away prior to Building 7’s collapse, turned toward the building, and said:

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Oh my god! Look behind us. Please pan in this way, please… This is it.” [Then there is a crescendo of cries from fearful onlookers as the building begins coming down and a man’s voice is heard saying, “That’s the building coming down.”]

       <p>
        “All of a sudden, the radios exploded and everybody started screaming, ‘Get away, get away, get away from it!’  And, I was like a deer in the headlights.  And I looked up, and…Two guys that I knew were on the transit radio.  I don’t know if those tapes are out there… And I looked up, and it was nothing I would ever imagine seeing in my life. You know the thing started peeling in on itself and,  I mean  there was an umbrella of crap seven feet over my head that I just stared at.  Somebody grabbed my shoulder and I started running, and the shit’s hitting the ground behind me.  And the whole time you’re hearing, ‘THOOM! THOOM! THOOM! THOOM! THOOM!’  So, I, I think I know an explosion when I hear it, you know? So yeah, I wanna know what took that building down.  I don’t think it was a fire and it certainly wasn’t a plane…It had some damage to it but nothing like what they’re saying…I am shocked at the[official] story we’ve heard about it, to be quite honest.”

        “And, at the last few seconds, he took his hand off [the radio] and you heard “3-2-1”, and he was just saying, ‘Just run for your life, just run for your life.’  And then it was like another two, three seconds, you heard explosions.  Like BA-BOOOOOM!  And it’s like a distinct sound…BA-BOOOOOM!  And you felt a rumble in the ground, like, almost like you wanted to grab onto something.  That, to me, I knew that was an explosion.  There was no doubt in my mind.”

Turned around, we were shocked to see that the building was – well, it looked like there was a shock wave ripping through building, and the windows all busted out.  It was horrifying.  And then, about a second later the bottom floor caved out and the building followed after that.  And we saw the building collapse down all the way to the ground.”

       Most of this is just organization of facts written/discovered by way more qualified individuals than me. I try my best to honor their work and efforts by spreading the irrefutable evidence uncovered by those before me. I've only been in this battle for a few years--feel free to copy and paste any of my posts.

       And I've been kicked off reddit before. Unfortunately by a duo of untrustworthy mods in this subreddit who don't like the irrefutable evidence of 9/11, but

       forum sliding actually refers to pumping a forum so full of new topics that important ones get pushed off the bottom.  It's a somewhat common if slightly archaic phrase from the early 2000's when bbs and messageboards were the only meeting grounds for online communities.

       And this guy isn't shillin', he's trollin'.  No facts, ignores actual facts, derails the conversation by forcing us to present evidence debunking his claims, claims that

       </em>
       can't back up with evidence (because he doesn't have any)

       The first part of my post was just proving how pointless his post was.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second part...if I didn't like debates
       <em>
        I wouldn't come to a sub where I disagree with most of what is said
       </em>
       .  I love debates.  They make me research things even more and I either change my mind or get reinforced what I already believe.  I have never accused anyone here of being willfully ignorant, a shill, or whatever
       <em>
        unless it was done to me first, then I just do it in a mocking way
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       But keep those great posts coming.

       How does the top section of the building accelerate as it is being crushed and is destroying the lower section? Objects slow down when they deform and use up energy. Think of a car crash, if you crash 2 cars together, 1 of the cars doesn't accelerate through the other car and then blow itself up a few seconds later. Both cars hit, and slow down as they deform.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did huge section of steel gets thrown hundreds of layers laterally? What force was applied to throw them up and out, instead of down like you would expect material to fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did the top section crush the lower section, when video shows that the top section had already been destroyed by the time the lower section started being destroyed?
      </p>
      <p>
       How did the towers fall so quickly, within a few seconds of freefall. How did a building (which got stronger as it progressed downwards) provide so little resistance to the top section? Both sections should have been crushed at an equal rate and amount.

      <p>
       When was the last time you saw a car hit another car.. accelerate through the car, then crush itself into a ball as it skidded down the road?
      </p>
      <p>
       When was the last time you hit a nail with a hammer and the hammer accelerated after hitting the nail?

       If energy is being used, it must slow down. How can you be converting the same amount of energy to motion, if a lot of that energy is being used to crush the structure below? Energy simply doesn't appear out of magic to even it out.

       Every one of those situations is competent and utterly different. How on earth can you compare those with a straight face?
      </p>
      <p>
       The energy used to crush the object below isn't entirely lost, it's regained as that material and the pushing force continue. The gaps between floors allow for far more acceleration than energy lost.

       Most of the material was pulverized into a huge dust cloud, and a lot of columns were thrown outwards. How can they be crushing the structure below?
      </p>
      <p>
       When you drop the top section onto the lower section, there should have been a jolt where the the top section slowed down. There was not.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the concrete was being pulverized into dust, which it was, the only thing crushing down would be the steel from the floors and the columns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even between floors, you have the perimeter columns, the huge core structure and any material inside the building. Energy had to have been used up crushing this material.

       You apparently don't know anything about WTC 7, because you state incorrect things and ask questions that have been answered many times already.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet despite not knowing anything about this subject, you come here and criticize what others state, make random statements with nothing to show for, ignore everything that contradicts your theory and yet have the audacity to complain about being downvoted.

       MSM thrives on blood and drama.  There was none with the falling of WTC7.  It was reported on in the news as it fell and a bit after, but because it didn't involve death and wasn't percieved to be a target of the attacks, it fell to the wayside.

       I like the way you ignored my question.
FACT - the BBC reported the collapse of WTC7 20 minutes before it happened. I know this because I personally saw it on the screen. the newsreader said it while WTC7 was in the background, still standing. how do YOU explain that?

       You didn't even read the link did you?  It was explained in the link.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the link:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What about the incorrect reporting of the collapse of Tower 7? Having talked to key eyewitnesses who were actually at Ground Zero that day it is clear that, as early as midday, the fire service feared that Tower 7 might collapse. This information then reached reporters on the scene and was eventually picked up by the international media.
       </p>
       <p>
        The internet movie Loose Change has been viewed by more than 100 million people according to its makers and it asks this question in the latest film release: "Where did CNN and the BBC get their information especially considering the building was still standing directly behind their reporters?"
       </p>
       <p>
        It turns out that the respected news agency Reuters picked up an incorrect report and passed it on. They have issued this statement:
       </p>
       <p>
        "On 11 September 2001 Reuters incorrectly reported that one of the buildings at the New York World Trade Center, 7WTC, had collapsed before it actually did. The report was picked up from a local news story and was withdrawn as soon as it emerged that the building had not fallen."
       </p>
       <p>
        I put this to the writer and director of Loose Change, Dylan Avery. I asked whether he believed the BBC was part of the conspiracy. Given the question his film had posed about the BBC I was surprised by Dylan's response: "Of course not, that's ludicrous. Why would the BBC be part of it?"
       </p>
       <p>
        He added candidly: "I didn't really want to put that line in the movie."

        Although Mr. Rooke stated that he had "not been convicted," a conditional discharge offers a circumstance in which a defendant may only be "deemed to have no conviction," as reported above by Peter Drew. Such wording, though confusing, indicates that for all practical purposes, the defendant does not suffer the consequences of a conviction,

       What a cute list. Unfortunately those statements don't exist in a vaccuum. Your initial comment incorporated those statements in a certain narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Said narrative makes claims about
       <br/>
       1) why we didn't hear or know much about WTC 7,
       <br/>
       2) how
       <em>
        it was
       </em>
       collateral damage that took it down (which you now are trying to change to
       <em>
        having

       collateral damage),
       <br/>
       3) how it's not a cover-up,

       <br/>
       5) how it was merely a building on fire that fell.
      </p>

      <p>
       Because the fire was collateral damage, along with the damage from when the towers fell (yes I know NIST says that damage had nothing to do with it falling).  So yes, it had collateral damage and it
       <em>
        was
       </em>

        4) how there was no drama
       </p>

      <p>
       Other than reactions to a building falling over, the drama was infinitely less than the drama surrounding the death and destruction of the twin towers.  I'm sorry, I should have said "very little comparative drama".
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        5) how it was merely a building on fire that fell.

      <p>
       For the news, it was.  For the public, it was.  Again, this falls into the "there were no deaths" category and it was a non-story after the initial shock of it falling.  If you disagree that that's how MSM news works, then go for it.

       lol everything I did say was factual, I guess except how the MSM media works.  That's conjecture, but it's conjecture that fits in with how most seem to view the MSM.

       No deaths = fact.

       It fell several hours after the attack = fact.

       It had collateral damage = fact.

       MSM relies on death and drama = basically a fact, but technically conjecture.  Are you going to disagree with that?

       Separately to Ukraine we are getting involved against proxy wars against Iran/Russia in Yemen and Syria. It can't go on much longer before we provoke a big reaction.

       Additionally, the Western narrative about Russian aggression is really flimsy and won't last very long as an excuse for increasing sanctions. None of our leaders are taking any steps to de-escalate the situation (and the US government refuses to even admit that they have escalated anything).

       I agree we are in a lot of places we shouldn't be, especially Ukraine and Yemen. However it also seems like Russia is acting like a teenager who just found a dick-growth cream that worked. They are being more and more aggressive, Japan and Antarctica. Like they just built a pair of reinforced scissors for some big rock/paper/scissors game.

       I think his request was not unreasonable though. And the comment he responded too has very little of value by just claiming "it's JIDF". I mean, that's just a circle-jerk reply to what is in fact a very good question.

       You're right. A reply with supporting link would've been better. But, to be fair, the question of hasbara, organized downvote brigades (etc),
       <em>

       The guy's [comment] was completely unjustified, however. Nobody is/was suggesting "all Jews", and this moronic accusation of "anti-semitism" is exactly the tactic used to try and smear and discredit discussion of Zionist involvement in 9/11.

       There's a large concerted effort to control the public opinion on popular internet forums, I ran into this post with a lot of information yesterday. It should get you started:

       The truth of the matter is that many people simply don't have the intellectual capacity or the attention span to understand this material.
      </p>
      <p>
       My father is an intelligent, college educated man but he simply does not read. He has admitted to me that he will begin reading and then catch himself re-reading a paragraph over and over again because he is distracted by his thoughts. He has no intellectual discipline.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are going to convince people, we need to come up with demonstrations which are simple to understand and don't come off as condescending, and which don't waste a lot of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those youtube videos where someone comes on and announces something or talks for 5 minutes then show a screen grab of some website are worse than useless. We need a marketing apparatus.

       I'm with you. Something like this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact: Skyscrapers that catch fire always stay up.
Fact: Skyscrapers that are loaded with explosives tend to be  destroyed quickly.
Fact: All skyscrapers that are destroyed quickly have been loaded with explosives.
Fact: The only known cause of a skyscraper being quickly destroyed is explosives, regardless of design, fire or structural damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact: The twin towers and WTC7 were skyscrapers that were destroyed quickly.
Therefore, they must be assumed to have been destroyed by explosives unless explosives are explicitly ruled out by investigation, or another mechanism of destruction is identified and proven.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact: NIST did not rule out the use of explosives.
Fact: NIST did not prove that their alternative collapse scenarios actually took place in reality.
Therefore, explosives remains the most plausible cause of the destruction of all three buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a little rough, but something like that? Somebody can approach and examine each claim. If each is true, the conclusion is valid. Any thoughts?

       sufficient damage occurred. Did you not see the NIST report that quite clearly shows the lack of damage to the towers? Do you suggest we should we go by your assumptions or by evidence?

       This is a great comment, and something I haven't considered.  I am college educated,  try to keep an open mind,  and read everything I can to get a better view of our existence.  I am also not a structural engineer,  or a pilot,  etc.,  so I have a layman's understanding of these concepts and do my best to put that together with my own observations of the evidence (or lack thereof).  What I do see is people with a professional  understanding of this information getting stifled by others who add nothing,  shout over people,  or just character assassinate.  That niche between analyzing a model in depth and some random dude with a webcam is the sweet spot for sure.

       Actually I have traveled the world more than once. My iq was once in the top 5%. My income was once in the top 15%. My ASVAB test scores were in the top 8%.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of things about me that are special. I made my living for 6 months mining cryptocurrency.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what is most special about me is that I once held a secret clearance, and I have spent a decade researching the subject. I have been.to NYC. I have been to Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of these things make me more than competent to debate this subject with people who have lived their entire lives in a singular 50 mile radius and whose entire world view has developed by passive absorbtion of mass media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I am special, because until my mid 20s I got every job I ever tried out for. I got promotions and was mostly the 'smartest guy in the room'. When I was finally blessed enough to find compatriots and go and work for a team of people who were actually smarter than me, Iearned some small measure of humility. I am a self taught programmer who can write 50 line SQL queries and have been compiling my own code since I was 17 years old on the original slackware linux. I have owned actual Silicon Graphics machines. I have owned several porsches, BMWs, Mercedes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think none of these things are an indicator that maybe my well studied theories of how things are supercede the common belief, you are a crazy person.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am no longer in the top 5% iq wise, but I still know more than most people. Most people are fucking stupid compared to me. By their actions and their beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will concede that my emotional IQ leaves something to be desired, but even then I scored in.the top 11% in being able to determine someone's emotional state by facial cues. Meaning I am not autistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also not a liar, which makes me better than many of the people who are as smart as me.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, I don't accept your words. They are meaningless politically correct bullshit. Opinions are like assholes, everyone has them, and most of them stink. If you want proof that people are fucking morons, turn on the television. Any channel. I'll wait.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: on the subject of my father it is difficult for me to understand. He is most definitely intelligent, and he has amassed a fortune and owns large pieces of real estate in 3 states. But I think at some point he developed some mental deficit, maybe from chemotherapy. Or maybe he just lost his intellectual curiosity and his ability for critical thinking and learning was stunted. Like how your critical thinking ability is so stunted that you believe the masses are somehow wise. They are most definitely not. The common person is a fucking moron.

       None of the that makes you special or serves as an excuse for your arrogance. Good job, you've traveled and been afforded opportunities to learn in different environments. Top secret clearance means shit. Source? I served in the USMC and my entire unit had top secret clearance at some point. It's meaningless.
      </p>
      <p>
       You owning nice cars? Means shit. Clearly you made money and weren't use to it. Don't let it go to your head. Watch a reality TV show. People are born into families who have more money than you ever will. It doesn't mean shit. So again no you are not special. You are worse than the less fortunate you talk down to. Whatever knowledge you have is useless because your too fucking stupid to properly share it with others.

       Never top secret. Only secret. Primarily it gave me access to understanding the political process.
      </p>
      <p>
       USMC does not hand out TS clearances, that is nonsense. You don't need to know anything to be a self propelled sandbag. I know enough not to pick a fistfight with a Marine, and I respect that most marines I have met are honest and courageous, even if their world view is nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've spent hundreds of hours under various personas trying to humbly share knowledge. I have some limits of knowledge I cannot share. In payment for this attempt to improve the world I have made some well intentioned mistakes. I have also spent thousands of hours being attacked by complete mouth breathers who think Bill O'Rielly is on the money. People who listen to Rush Limbaugh.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes I get tired of debating people who are closed minded to a fault. On a very few occasions I have given people info that allowed them to step out of their dysfunctional understanding of the world for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was 5 my stepmother was angry with me for not believing in santa claus and jesus. When did you stop believing in santa claus?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I know full well there are people with vast wealth who haven't done anything to deserve it. I am mot bragging about having wealth, but I bragged about -earning- in the top 15%. On my own, with no political or familial help. (In fact after I had completely broken ties with my family)
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many kinds of intelligence. Mine is of the type to be fully aware that the 9/11 story was a huge pile of horseshit.

       The best I can hope for at this point is self preservation. I bought over 20 acres of wetlands to build a carbon neutral cabin on. I have been certified in installing solar systems. I predict there will be both economic collapse and highly modified climate and coastlines in my lifetime. Many people will starve. At this point I am mostly in a "get mine" mode so I can teach my children how to survive and be part of the world in a way that was impossible for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I go out of my way to help people who ask for help. I give money to buskers. I teach people almost every day. But after spending my life savings trying to create an investment property which doubled as a co-op and creative collaborative space, I burnt out being robbed blind. Over $40k in theft over a 3 year period. Bankruptcy. I gave alot, more than most people in my experience. Now I have to be realistic, the world is shit, many people are shit. If you ask for help I am more likely to give it than not. In the meantime I am acting the squirrel, readying for the long winter.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are right, my knowledge is nothing compared with reality. While I believe I know more than most humans, what I really know in the grand scheme of things is nothing. I have accepted that our 3-dimensional experience of the universe will never be complete. If there are 4th dimensional intelligences [and I firmly believe there are] they can intuit time and space in ways that we might have some calculations for, but will never be able to innately understand. Even statistics will show you that what you think about the truth of the reality is wrong. String theory and physics will bring us closer to the god consciousness, but in reality our meat-brains are just bugs. A window of experience. A trial. A part of a greater order which we can idealize but not fathom.

       You don't need a fancy engineering degree to see that World Trade Center Buildings 1, 2, and 7 were blown up - you can see them blowing up in the videos.

      <p>
       It doesn't take any fancy physics analysis either - 9th grade physics is sufficient to describe what you are seeing in the video.

       NIST is a fucking joke.  Treasonous ass-holes.  Anyone with a brain knows that fire didn't take down a building, especially at free-fall.  Only a complete dumb-ass would buy fiction that absurd, as reality.

       I don't understand this conspiracy at all, why did we shoot down the plane in Pennsylvania if it was all an inside job and why would they intentionally demolish an extra building?  What was the motivation for anyone to stage 9/11?  We just really wanted to get bogged down fighting for decades in Afghanistan?  How did they convince people to kill themselves?  Why has al-Qaeda never denied responsibility? I hated Bush as much as anyone but I can't believe that anyone would spend their whole life trying to become president(the most powerful position on earth) and then immediately risking it all by authorizing an attack on their own country and gambling that no one would leak the info. And he wouldn't have just been risking getting impeached, he would be tried for treason, go to jail, ruin his reputation, endanger the lives of his family, and embroil the entire country in scandal.

       Building 7 was hit with a perimeter column from the collapse of the main towers which caused it to become unstable and it was "pulled" down with cables to create a safer collapse.
       <br/>
       Like pretty much all conspiracy theorists, the weakness of this nonsense comes not from just disregarding inconvenient facts, but from not being able to fully explain the motives behind the theory.

        This video

       has two of the best images I've seen - and they are new to me. :-/

      <p>
       1:28 shows the gash in the building. 2:45 shows the entire building pouring out smoke, every floor. On your second source link a firefighter is quoted saying that from early afternoon there was a "three story bulge" that was clearly visible on one side.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still amazed at how cleanly it fell - but it no longer seems like a mystery WHY it fell. Thanks for that, Vlad.

        I couldn't pull up that .avi video so I went to the site. They say building SIX was pulled down with cables, after 9/11. Their little video has a clip of a guy saying it's a big deal to be pulling down an

       None of this is true. If it is please provide citations. NIST itself says the debris from the other towers had no significant role in the collapse. There is no evidence whatsoever of cables being used to pull it down.

       The Iraq war certainly helped Cheney's company but not Afghanistan.  I would even say Iraq was motivated by trying to secure the oil market which the US so heavily relies on.  But if he really only cared about money, running for political office is not the best way to go about it.  I think Cheney and Bush were awful in office but it's absurd to think that they were so psychopathic that would be willing to orchestrate an attack on their own country.  There are so many other ways to be corrupt and make a buck without becoming mass murderers.

       That had nothing about intentionally killing Americans.  The worst proposal was to stage an attack and hold funerals for "mock victims."  And there was no conspiracy plan to profit from overthrowing Cuba's government, it was just an attempt to sway public opinion into taking action during the Cold War in order to get rid of a communist government with Soviet influence that was close to our borders.  The fact that many of our wars were started dishonestly is just more proof that conspiring to stage a massive terrorist attack would have been completely unnecessary.

       They already made a lot of money, the US spends half of its budget on national defense.  A simple bill to raise defense spending even slightly would have achieved the same result.  Or a bill to create tax cuts for those people...  There are a lot easier ways to make money when you control the White House and congress than the mass murder of the people you have sworn to protect.

       The large budget on national defense is not the same as making money. It has to be spent first.
And tax cuts do not put you into favourable global strategic positions nor does it deliver any of the earth's resources. Nor does it light up entire regions in an attempt to divide and conquer.

       <em>

       spent.  We build new planes, ships, and tanks, buy weapons, ammo, fuel, and armor and pay for R&amp;D and training services from the military industrial complex.  We are basically spending our own money on mostly our own industries in a place with no strategic significance. In no logical world does that make us stronger or serve anyone's interests.

       Oh god, I forgot about the mighty Turkmenistan!  I'm sure those minerals(which we aren't mining) are totally worth the trillions we've spent fighting there.  I honestly can't understand you people.  In one minute you are saying that the top officials in the country are intentionally murdering and terrorizing their own people for personal gain and then you flip and say they are doing it for the national interest.  You can't have it both ways.  They're either money-hungry deceitful, manipulative Disney villains or they are regular people doing work they actually like in order to help their country.

       funny that you cherry pick the least important aspect. No word about pipelines, no word about iran... plus companies might want to mine those minerals in the future when Afghanistan becomes a little bit more stable. So it could be a strategic foot in the door - but as i said, there are more important aspects.
 And there is no flipping - it's not personal OR national interest. It's both - at the same time. Why should both options exclude each other? The world isn't black and white. To be fair there are limitations (depends on how you define true national interests).

       ...Because that's where Bin Laden, who planned the attacks was and we needed some kind of a response to 9/11.  Why is that complicated or hard to understand?  The taliban would have never given up Bin Laden even if they actually had that capacity which they didn't.  Afghanistan is poor as fuck and no government can really establish order there because there's no money.  That's why it provided a great training ground for terrorists and why it posed a threat.  It was a dumb war but it wasn't part of a malicious conspiracy by government officials.

       Then you actually buy into the "we're going to kill terrorists over there so they don't come over here". Isn't that why Al Qaeda flew their planes into the towers in the first place? Do you really think there is a need to fight an invisible enemy overseas?

       Dude, you need help.  Bin Laden admitted it on video several times.  Obviously you don't invade a country just to get one person.  As I explained, the lawless, radically-run state of Afghanistan provided a safe-harbor for terrorists and posed a threat to the US and the West.  It was stupid to invade, yes but you are giving Bush way too much credit in thinking he or anyone influencing him could pull off something so intricate and evil against their own country just for money.  When you have power and the ability to control other people's money, you really don't personal wealth.  Yes, many capitalized on the situation and benefited from it but that does not mean they did it themselves.  The articles you cited even refute what you are saying.  The French troops who were claimed to have had him in their sights denied that ever happened.

       Well, someone did, but certainly not Bin Laden. Bin Laden, starting as soon as 13 september 2001 denied having anything to do with the attacks, he repeated this on multiple occasions.

One French soldier says, “In 2003 and 2004 we had bin Laden in our sights.

       Money.  The PNAC spells out the motives quite clearly.  Preemptive wars.  Convince the American people to give up freedom for security.  The 4.5 billion would be Silverstiens motive.  The attacks did nothing to benifit the arab community, and everything to benifit an unpopular president at the time, who stole an election, never heard that very much after 911, the trillions the pentagon said they were missing the day before 9/11 was forgot about after that, the pipe line they told the Taliban they needed to let US companies go through country and control it, told them if they did, they would be showered in a carpet of gold, if they didn't, they would be showered with a carpet of bombs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The heroin that was non exhistant under the Taliban, now the CIA has a monopoly on the heroin trade, which im sure is billions.  The illegal wars we launched from the attacks were probably one of the main reason.  The insurance for the WTC im sure was another main one, and luckly for Silverstien, he didn't have to have the Asbestos removed from the towers, that was going to be extremely expensive.  There were far more motives and benifits for our government, than were for the motives that we were told being they hate our freedoms.  Which is probably the truth, they just failed to say our government was the ones that hated our freedomw.  Operation Northwoods

       Just try to think about this logically.  How much money would someone have to offer you to kill yourself?  Because according to your theory two dozen Arabs volunteered to kill themselves in order to contribute to a plot to hurt Arabs and enrich a few people.  And how much money would you have to pay al-Qaeda to accept responsibility and become targets of the most powerful military in the world for decades?  How do you people not see how ridiculous that sounds?  Getting people to give up "freedom and security" is not a benefit to a democratic government.  When you are president of the United states and 60+ years old, personal wealth is pretty trivial and besides the executive is in charge of allocating trillions of dollars provided by congress - it would be so much easier to just misplace some of the money than carrying out such an elaborate scheme.  Also, the federal government literally prints money, and the president knows where all of it is.  He could easily have someone hijack shipments of it or take gold from the reserve.  You have no evidence to support this crazy theory and it's not even logically consistent.

       I didn't say it benefited Arabs, it clearly hurt them.  But nonetheless, Arabs were the ones who hijacked the planes and killed themselves.  Why would they do that?  The only way to explain it is Jihad which is clearly laid out in the Quran.  I recommend you read it because if you actually believe it, the idea of suicide for religious goals doesn't seem that crazy - unlike the baseless theories being thrown around in this sub.

       Thats the story we have always been told.  But several of the arabs turned up alive and showed up in our embassys overseas saying, it wasnt me.  Alot of muslims have the same names, but these had the same faces.  And I have looked into 9/11 for 13 years, I started trying to prove someone wrong that was saying it was an inside job.  It really pissed me off when I couldn't.  And the more I looked, the worse it looked.  Have we ever even been shown any proof the arabs were on the planes?  Honestely.  The pictures they have ever shown were a couple of stills or sketchy video of Atta without date and time stamps.  If you know of any, please send me the link.  But as of this day, I really haven't seen any evidence that they were on the planes.  It sucks but our government does lie to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Baseless? I wish it was.  Who benifited?  Afganistan? the Taliban?  Al CIAda?  Bin Laden was a CIA asset they called Tim Osman.  Iraq had nothing to do with it.  The didn't  benifit.  Haliburten benifited.  Im more than willing to entertain evidence and have always had an open mind.  Just every rock you turn over, has fingerprints of the white man.  Not arab.  I appreciate the debate and more than happy to keep an open mind with any one that does the same.  The thing that is really disappointing, is our government has let these stories continue by not releasing the tapes at the pentagon, the flight manifests, the videos of the arabs in the air port getting on the plane.  With the governments credibility in the toilet, I need to see something.  By all means, please disprove what Im saying, I will be able to sleep better at night knowing our government didn't have a hand in this.

       I don't think you have a good grasp of how this works. You don't tell them "go kill yourselves for my evil plot". You control the entire structure under which they exist (Al Qaeda for instance) through key figures and then you tell them what they want to hear. They're fighting for Allah against Western imperialism. That's how patsies work.

Who is it that you believe is spending all of these resources creating puppet terrorist organizations and calling all the shots?  If someone is powerful enough to control al-Qaeda and the POTUS undetected, how are they not powerful enough to just control the Federal Reserve and print all the money they want for themselves?

       So you're just going to pout and downvote my comments since you can't create a substantive response?  You make baseless assertions like the president isn't really in control but can't articulate who is actually controlling him.  You think this was about money but don't even understand the difference between the creation of wealth for individuals and creation of wealth for countries.  Pathetic defense of pathetic and disgusting assertions.

       You believe in a conspiracy perpetuated by a few people.  Printing money does create wealth if only a few people have it, even a few hundred.  It only causes inflation once it is circulating in the economy.  Even then, as long as the country is strong overall, what really matters is relative wealth. If only a few people instantly gain a ton of money, that has no effect at all on the demand for money in the general economy. You can't be this dumb.  You really think that if a billion dollars just showed up in your lap, you wouldn't be more wealthy?  Unless of course you are trying to argue that this conspiracy was done in order to make the country richer as a whole which is absurd considering how much debt we accumulated from the wars.

       NIST has more than proven themselves to be full of shit.  Where we at as far as a new investagation?  There is no way the first one can be viewed as anything but a joke.  No one can look at the computer models, or info NIST used for them.  There is more than enough to justify a new investagation.  Lets quit fucking around and get some people that have no conflicts of interest on a committee and do it right.  Unlimited budget, time, supena power, swear witnesses in, follow it wherever it goes without pre determined conclusions, and lets charge the ones responsible.

       This. I saw this interview live. This was the most compelling evidence to me that there is SIGNIFICANT disparity between the official reports and what actually happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the owner of bldg 7 was on TV live, concurring that the building needed to be taken down. It did not just collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, nobody holds anyone's feet to the fire on this point. It gets no followup from any news outlets. it frustrates and confounds.

       Great catch, but there is no longer a debate among reasonably "thinking" people.  WTC1, 2, 6 &amp; 7 were all so OBVIOUSLY controlled demolitions....  you really have to be a complete tool believe otherwise.  (no disrespect to the tools -- i know you all can't help it.)

       Folks, notice that these "anti-truthers" are always using these specific tactics - personal attacks, calling people crazy or fringe.

      <p>
       They can't debate because there's nothing to debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       But ask yourself - why are there so many people on the internet attacking truthers? What would be their motivation? It's odd, isn't it?

       You missed my entire point. I never said I disagreed with everything here. I love this post and think more people should hear this information. I'm saying calling people tools and saying "I know you can't help it" sounds arrogant and comes off as insecure. If you want people to listen don't insult them. Or am I missing what your trying to say? I haven't heard the term "truther"

       Look up. Clearly on both sides you've got people who are 100% sure of themselves making rabid personal statements about anyone who's on the other side. Anyone in the middle up for some rational and respectful debate doesn't want to get involved. Maybe you think there's nothing to debate but by saying that in that way you alienate exactly the openminded people you should be trying to convince and attract people who are just interested in calling you names.

       Using certain terminology is detrimental to spreading information — I bet we all can agree. 9/11 truth makes people very frustrated at times and disparaging others by name calling is to be expected. We've all done it at some point...
      </p>
      <p>
       We are all on the same page when it comes to the fact that NIST has conducted a massive coverup of a terrorist attack, remember we are not each other's enemies. Do not become
       <em>
        too

       divided over trivial details...we all have our ways of expressing frustrations. Just wanted to say this out loud.

       Actually, I'm one of the complete tools lacking in intellectual capacity and attention span who isn't convinced. ;)

      <p>
       But I accept it's possible, know there have been plenty of false flags in the past, and love discussing about this sort of thing in real life. Online, it's basically impossible as the discourse on both sides is generally as superior and insulting as what's found in this thread. It's a shame. Even religion and politics are less vitriolic these days.

       Yep, I think it's a combination of the anonymity and the flip side of the web's awesome ability to connect people with the same interests -- that it also groups people with the strong opinions into opposing camps. Engage in discussions IRL with a group of people on any subject and the argument gets drawn to finding middle ground because you're dealing with opinions all along the spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then people learn pretty quick that's the best way to convince others anyway, by arguing from the centre, subtly cajoling and debating while respecting alternative viewpoints instead of pounding away on how sure you are and how stupid everyone else is not to see that -- or else people will find you pushy and annoying and won't talk to you for very long. But online, you can just preach, loudly, to a huge choir. The more extreme and inflexible and arrogant you are the more people in your camp will flock to you -- and nobody knows/cares how to deal with anyone else.

       How is that funny? Being "fringe" doesn't excuse being an asshole. And it certainly doesn't excuse you from such hypocrisy as vilifying those you disagree with in the same thread as bitching about them doing the same to you.

       At this point it doesn't matter, calling people tools and saying "I know you can't help it" isn't going to help anything. No one is going to listen when you insult them first. Plus there's nothing special about this guy, he sounds arrogant and insecure insulting others.

       Actually, I'm one of the complete tools lacking in intellectual capacity and attention span who isn't convinced. ;)

      <p>
       But I accept it's possible, know there have been plenty of false flags in the past, and love discussing about this sort of thing in real life. Online, it's basically impossible as the discourse on both sides is generally as superior and insulting as what's found in this thread. It's a shame. Even religion and politics are less vitriolic these days.

       And antagonize?  Questioning you is antagonizing?  Or is it because I get attacked first, then respond a little salty?  Nice bias you have there.

       This. I saw this interview live. This was the most compelling evidence to me that there is SIGNIFICANT disparity between the official reports and what actually happened.

       Yes, the owner of bldg 7 was on TV live, concurring that the building needed to be taken down. It did not just collapse.

      <p>
       Yet, nobody holds anyone's feet to the fire on this point. It gets no followup from any news outlets. it frustrates and confounds.

       What resources does Afghanistan have?  -none.  The large budget on national defense
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       spent.  We build new planes, ships, and tanks, buy weapons, ammo, fuel, and armor and pay for R&amp;D and training services from the military industrial complex.  We are basically spending our own money on mostly our own industries in a place with no strategic significance. In no logical world does that make us stronger or serve anyone's interests.

       You're right. A reply with supporting link would've been better. But, to be fair, the question of hasbara, organized downvote brigades (etc),
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       discussed here fairly regularly, and in greater depth.

       The guy's [comment] was completely unjustified, however. Nobody is/was suggesting "all Jews", and this moronic accusation of "anti-semitism" is exactly the tactic used to try and smear and discredit discussion of Zionist involvement in 9/11.

       How is that funny? Being "fringe" doesn't excuse being an asshole. And it certainly doesn't excuse you from such hypocrisy as vilifying those you disagree with in the same thread as bitching about them doing the same to you.
