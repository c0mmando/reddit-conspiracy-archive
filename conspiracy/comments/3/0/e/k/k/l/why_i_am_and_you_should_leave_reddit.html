       It would appear that Reddit is in the hands of those who wish their particular narrative to be the only one that trends here. If you for instance in anyway make contrary arguments in regards to Israel, Russia, Palestine or you present arguments that cannot be countered with simple emotional rhetoric, you will be banned and this is silencing legitimate voices. reddit is a sham. You should know it.

       I'm sticking around for the subs that are non political. But I gotta say that after spending some time nosing around in /worldnews I can't believe how controlled this place is.

       Yeah. Going to world news or any of the Main Stream subs will completely demolish your faith in those subs. But you were probably an idiot for expecting the mainstream to be anything but parrots and sheep.

       You're a fucking hypocrite. Mankind should be in this battle together and people should be helping their fellow people learn about what's going on.

       If you do not support the agenda narrative they will ban you and lie to you about why they banned you. Green_Flash accused me of attacking others and making racist comments. I challenged him on that. I do believe he didn't like the fact that I didn't support some US/Ukraine love triangle situation and explained how things were from a different point of view that is highly contrary to the typical American narrative. Boom! Fake. This place is indeed just another piece of the surveillance kingdom like facebook and others. Weird, small minded control freaks. I don't trust people who hide behind an ounce of authority that can cause you real problems. It's ugly and small.

       You make a good case, why do you want to deny yourself an audience? Reddit doesn't control anyone's mind,  its a tool. How you use that tool is up to you. It's primary purpose is self-advertisement, what do you expect? If you believe you are sharing the internet with other intelligent beings, you are sadly mistaken.

       Honestly though, I now make a new account every month or so. If you go against the grain in big default political subreddits, you end up with comment waiting times, or you get your username banned, or
       <strong>
        most importantly
       </strong>
       , you actually get stalkers who will send you lunatic PM's or who will follow you around from post to post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I ended up deleting my MAIN account because I pissed off some people somehow and they started digging through my history trying to piece together where I lived or where I worked, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, once my main account was gone, I realized that I no longer was held down by the subconscious chains of the point system. Changing your account every few months allows you to freely speak your mind on this site, with zero worry about anything else.

       <em>
        this

       sub and asks us all to leave, just like the Govt, conspiratard and other injustice supporters would like? Well how about we all stay and keep enlightening the vast amount of people here to the disgusting practices of TPTB and reddit?

       Account age is just another way for narrative drivers to belittle people's opinion - shouldn't matter an account's age, the veracity of someone's comment, if it's contributing and if the opinion is honest should be the only factors that matter.

       I have no idea why people think the age of an account is relevant. I've been on reddit since the beginning. I've had dozens of accounts and have logged in from multiple IP addresses. Try to be more critical in your thinking.

       Because a longer account history allows other users to decide for themselves whether you are a genuine user or just making shit up.

       I made some money doxing these guys to eachother. I am not able to do it anymore, I have been almost entirely compromised. The next step is they would find my control system. Either way it was a fun game for a couple of years. You should try it.

       I just read this from wherever you sent it from which means its not entirely hopeless. If you had actual info to link or anything of value to say now is the time to say it before it really get shitty. I guess we are as good as the site, but at the same time we cant deny businesses are in on reddit and have accounts, yes even businesses from within the government.

       I have been downvoted for speaking out for thise reasons. But thats because this is a US based site, majoroty are american users. So to go against murica, to go against propogabda that gets spread there is a tough thing. So I come here for the junky posts. Keeping my serious abd political disscussions out of US based forums. Best thing atm imo. US isnt friendly, social or resonabke bunch on the webs. Too much them vs us mentality.
