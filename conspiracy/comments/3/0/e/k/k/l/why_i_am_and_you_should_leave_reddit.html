<p>How can you preach about the government being elitists who want to keep the common man down and say something like this, and then say something that implies you are better than other humans?</p>

I challenged him on that. I do believe he didn&#39;t like the fact that I didn&#39;t support some US/Ukraine love triangle situation and explained how things were from a different point of view that is highly contrary to the typical American narrative. Boom! Fake. This place is indeed just another piece of the surveillance kingdom like facebook and others. Weird, small minded control freaks.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly though, I now make a new account every month or so. If you go against the grain in big default political subreddits, you end up with comment waiting times, or you get your username banned, or <strong>most importantly</strong>, you actually get stalkers who will send you lunatic PM&#39;s or who will follow you around from post to post.</p>

<p>Also, I ended up deleting my MAIN account because I pissed off some people somehow and they started digging through my history trying to piece together where I lived or where I worked, etc...</p>

<p>Lastly, once my main account was gone, I realized that I no longer was held down by the subconscious chains of the point system. Changing your account every few months allows you to freely speak your mind on this site, with zero worry about anything else.</p>
