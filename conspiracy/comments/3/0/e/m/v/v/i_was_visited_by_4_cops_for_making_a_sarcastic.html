        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This happened after I repeatedly called out Evan Solomon on the Ottawa shooting &#39;evidence&#39; that he falsely presented as fact. </p>

<p>I also made a stink about  the Halifax non-shooting event where the neonazi from USA was turned in, and the minister described them as &#39;murderous misfits&#39;.    </p>

<p>Around the same time I was being set up, and the person I exposed later was reported suicided.   </p>

<p>First off I would never kill myself.  Never ever, or ever harm another person willingly.  I am a pacifist and a humanist.  </p>

<p>Knock knock - there&#39;s 4 police, 3 in full gear menacingly at my door.   They didn&#39;t know who to look for because IP is shared (IP is not identity)  I overhear something about internet and assumed it was for me.  </p>

<p>A user had threatened me saying that I should be worried about the stuff I am posting, and I wrote back &#39;I&#39;m not worried I have a d%%%y b%%b on a de%d m%n s%itch&#39;  - not the first time I&#39;ve made such a ridiculous comment.     </p>

<p>Of course if I really had such a device it would be very dumb for police to knock and find out if it was true.. they knew it wasn&#39;t.    </p>

<p>One of them had a printout of all my comments from reddit (wow a big waste of paper)  I told them my comment was plainly ridiculous, and they insisted they come inside.    I asked for a warrant and they said &#39;we don&#39;t need one because there is an EXIGENT THREAT&#39; - fuck off.   no warrants because we decided we don&#39;t need one.   </p>

<p>Anyway they come in, and ask if I have any weapons, and complain to me that they are wasting their time.  Also that they were sent there (being used) by someone I had pissed off - is that you Evan, or Peter?   So who is wasting their time and our resources?   </p>

<p>I asked them &#39;where is it ok to be sarcastic then?&#39; - no answer.  </p>

<p>The cop asked me if I was a conspiracy theorist, and I explained that 3 kids had been arrested on &#39;CONSPIRACY to commit murder&#39; charges, and that those with the narratives are the ones purporting conspiracies, while I am merely debunking them using logic.  </p>

<p>After a few minutes they left, but not before a stern warning to &#39;cool it&#39; with my social activist posts - would be violation of my non-existent rights</p>

<p>Here&#39;s where the story gets even weirder.  I&#39;m a chemist and answered an ad on craigslist for a job.  The person wanted to pay a good sum of money to help make a chemical for their &#39;jewellery refurbishment business&#39;   - I gleaned that the chemical result was cyanide, and I asked the person why don&#39;t they just order it?   So they insisted they couldn&#39;t and asked me to do it, and still offered to pay a lot of money.   After she was unwilling to provide me details I needed to order the chemical and asking if I could make it from crushed apricot pits -  I got suspicious and traced back the phone number to a girl with a different name than in the email.   After my visit I contacted her and told her that I would be contacting the news and retaining a lawyer for my protection.   She mailed back quickly begging me not to.    </p>

<p>Last week I was curious what had happened to her, and if I could find any info.  I only found some articles in Peru newspapers that a Canadian had committed suicide using a veteranary product near Machu Pichu.  Their facebook page had turned into a memorial.  </p>

<p>Frankly I don&#39;t know if this person even existed at all, but they have an odd internet trail, no relatives, and lots of friends from a university they atttended.    The newspaper is not interested in the story, so I assume the person was a fake identity and their cover was blown.     </p>

<p>I assume since I had made the comment I was targeted for a honeypot and that I was to be set up and taken down as a &#39;terrorist&#39; - they should have done their research, and not wasted our time and resources.   </p>

<p>These cops make $100,000 a year and more and are sent out to intiimidate people at the whim of politicians.    I&#39;ve decided to leave this country, protecting nazis and setting up people that complain about it is beyond my tolerance.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll answer any questions you have.   </p>

<p>TL;DR  cops were sent to my house to intimidate me after making a sarcastic comment on reddit, and another person that tried to set me up to make a deadly chemical was reported suicided.  </p>

<p>Can you imagine if all Canadians started making such ridiculous comments and the police are sent to your door at the whim of some pissed off bureaucrat?   The police would be endlessly busy wasting their time.  Maybe it would underscore the ridiculousness of the whole thing.  Possibly Canadians are too timid to stand up for their rights and would rather censor themselves?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not how bureaucracies work. Someone obviously reported OP, leaving police with the option of assuming that it is nothing and leaving it alone, or following up. If they don&#39;t follow up and something bad happens, whoever decided to not bother investigating is well and truly fucked. As a consequence, you need to anticipate interaction with the cops if you&#39;re going to post stuff like that online.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is part of the problem with today&#39;s litigious society. I see countless videos on line of police harassing people for taking pictures and when the guy asks why they are even there since it&#39;s not a crime, they always fall back on the excuse &quot;we got a call&quot;.</p>

<p>Well fucking fantastic, if you get a call about someone picking their nose would they investigate? No, because it&#39;s not a crime.</p>

<p>And neither is posting &quot;i have a dirty bomb on a dead man&#39;s switch&quot;. </p>

<p>Yes, everything is black and white. The police have no ability to use discretion or use the tools available to them to determine the validity of a threat. Showing up and actually asking if they were serious should be the very last thing. Hell, if the guy was serious why would he admit it or even answer the door for the police? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That mostly depends on the context. For one they can look at his post history and see if the guy really seems like a threat or if he is most likely joking.
They could try to ID him and see if he has a criminal record or the capability of procuring/making a dirty bomb. If I post that I have an ICBM in my yard and have it trained on the capital of England, should they investigate that?</p>

<p>Stuff like that.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a better question though, do you think the way they handled it was effective? It sounds like they came in, acted like they were annoyed they had to do it, and then left without any investigation. </p>

<p>So, had OP actually had a bomb, do you think they would have figured it out? I don&#39;t think they would have, which is why I think these house calls are more about covering their own asses (as you pointed out) or to intimidate. </p>

<p>You&#39;re assuming they didn&#39;t do that and really, making a bomb isn&#39;t that hard with access to a hardware store if you were disposed to such behavior. If they had really believed he had a bomb, especially a radiological device, I&#39;m guessing the response would have been different. However, a visit often allows investigators to get a sense of what a person is like and what their motives might be so actually serves as a pretty good middle-ground between a full-scale response and just assuming that there&#39;s nothing to worry about.</p>

<p>The police did not take this threat seriously. If they had, they would have sent in a bomb squad and OP would be in a jail cell until the matter was cleared up.

If I can reliably determine that claim was actually made whether or not it may have been sarcastic, then that person will be taken with me for a psych evaluation at the proper facility. I may know the claim was bullshit, as do most others involved in, but due to the litigious nature of society the person must be evaluated. My example is different than yours with the police, but both situations come down to a liability issue. Maybe it is different in Canada but down here we must atleast investigate certain claims. Now as to the cyanide situation - that is the most interesting to me. It would seem to me it was used as bait to land some charges on you after the authorities wasted time on your sarcastic claims. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They literally do sometimes.  That is so that populations remain fearful of each other and divided and do not unite to overthrow the elites.  Like I told you before, it is a part of a strategy of tension that has been employed for at least hundreds of years through governments and probably thousands of years through relgions.</p>

<p>The following is a passage from Howard Zinn&#39;s &quot;A People&#39;s History...&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bacon&#39;s Rebellion brought together groups from the lower classes. White frontiersmen started the uprising because they were angry about the way the colony was being run. Then white servants and black slaves joined the rebel­ lion. They were angry, too-mostly about the huge gap between rich and poor in Virginia.</p>

<p>The greatest fear of wealthy southern planters was that black slaves and poor whites would combine in another uprising like Bacon&#39;s Rebellion. One tool to keep blacks and whites from uniting was racism. Edmund Morgan , a historian of slavery in Virginia , wrote in his American Slavery, American Freedom that racism was not a &quot;natural&quot; feeling about the differ­ences between black and white. Instead, white leaders encouraged a negative view of blacks. If poor whites felt contempt for African Americans, they were less likely to join with them in rebellion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s the same strategy gone global.  And now that we have instant global communication, they can&#39;t just lie about it in the newspaper and trick everyone.  They have to actually act it out or find patsies to act it out for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah man.  All of these &quot;terrorist attacks&quot; in Europe now, for instance?  </p>

<p>So you saw that video off the Charlie Hebdo thing, right?  Here is what I saw.  I&#39;m no expert, but I have been putting in a lot of time into reading and learning how these operations work:</p>

<p>I saw a couple of professionals work smoothly and cleanly.  They had a very well-planned out attack and made a nice escape.  It certainly did not look like a couple of guys who have never seen action and suddenly self-radicalized.  Even if you have trained, unless you have seen a lot of action and can control yourself, then you are going to be panicked and scattered.  Those guys were smooth and in control.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the big tip-off to me was the leaving behind of the ID cards.  This always conveniently happens.  Oswald&#39;s wallet, James Earl Ray&#39;s &quot;bundle of evidence&quot;, and even the passports that miraculously showed up at 9/11.  It&#39;s a common tactic because it works so well on the general population and spin control through their agents in the media can discredit those who point out the absurdity.</p>

<p>Now what happened the next day?  </p>

<p>Well, a couple of guys took some hostages in a bakery or something.  This is where those agents who try to find people willing to become radicals come in.  If you had to make something like this happen, what do you do?  You probably show them that you can get them money and weapons.  You probably use your knowledge of other fake acts by other agents to show them that you are connected to the terrorists.  Then you tell them, &quot;The signal is coming.  There will be an attack today, then muslims like us everywhere across Europe will stage a coordinated attack.  Your mission will be to hold hostages in this bakery!&quot;  Then they see the attack happen and believe that it is real.  These aren&#39;t ever really bright people to begin with so they never figure out they are being set up.  The reality is those poor patsies would have probably never had a vector to do anything at all if these agencies had never enabled them.  Do you think they got those guns by themselves?</p>

<p>Seriously... this is how those types of things operate.  You have to create an illusion like a magician.  If you go and look at those JTRIG slides, that&#39;s exactly what they talk about.  These guys love to compare themselves to magicians that create false realities.</p>

<p>I know it sounds like madness, but we have some really famous quotes to back it up:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>William Casey, CIA Director 1981-1987:  “We’ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.”</p>

<p>The aide said that guys like me were &quot;in what we call the reality-based community,&quot; which he defined as people who &quot;believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.&quot; ... &quot;That&#39;s not the way the world really works anymore,&quot; he continued. &quot;We&#39;re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you&#39;re studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we&#39;ll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that&#39;s how things will sort out. We&#39;re history&#39;s actors ... and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.&quot;
—Unnamed White House aide[1]  The quote is now widely attributed to Karl Rove</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what Karl Rove meant by &quot;we are history&#39;s actor&#39;s&quot;.  They are literally creating a reality of their own choosing (that of course serves themselves) for the masses to move them to the actions that they want them to.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s madness, but if we want to be, we have to deal with reality and be history&#39;s actors and end this nonsense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sickening but 100% true.</p>

<p>I knew the Charlie Hebdo shit was bullshit when I saw the ID thing. Who the fuck brings their ID when they go to kill people?! Also LOL at the black boxes in the planes used in 9/11 being decimated, but one of the hijackers ID&#39;s goes though a plane crash, explosions, fires, and rubble to fall down thousands of feet onto the ground. What a goddamn joke. </p>

<p>Like you said, calm, very professional, very smooth. Even with my military training I couldn&#39;t pull that off.</p>

<p>Also when the shit went down the next day and they talked about the guy that supplied those hostage takers with weapons all I could think of was INTELLIGENCE AGENT. He was their &quot;handler&quot; and set them up.</p>

<p>Within the week france was enacting anti-freedom/anti-terrorism laws and arresting people for criticizing Jews and questioning the narrative. </p>

<p>We live in the Matrix. It doesn&#39;t sound like madness at all. Television, movies, are all mind control. It&#39;s magick. They use symbols and lies to incapacitate us. They call them television programs because they&#39;re programming the public.</p>

<p>I googled on her name. I&#39;m omitting it here so that friends and family 
of hers won&#39;t find this if they search her name.</p>

<p>I found <a href="https://twitter.com/mcgillu/status/578888554421551104">this tweet</a> on McGill University&#39;s twitter: &quot;The University Flag is lowered today March 20, 2015, in memory of R___ N_____, student in the Faculty of Arts&quot;. I also found a <a href="http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2015/03/aus-endorses-sexual-assault-policy/">mention of a moment of silence for her</a>, &quot;who passed away recently,&quot; and a <a href="http://ausmcgill.com/en/notice-regarding-vp-internal/">notice in January</a> that student organization needing a replacement officer since she &quot;is not currently at McGill University for the Winter 2015 due to reasons of poor personal health.&quot; I found an interview with her from last October where she says that she is running for that post, and says what town she&#39;s from. I found a school newsletter from 2005 for an elementary school in that town that says that she was in a play. There are also a few slide presentations on a web site that look like they were done by her for a high school class. One mentions a museum in her home town.</p>

<p>There are a handful of tweets from friends about her death and a FaceBook page.</p>

<p>Some details and links omitted because of Reddit policy, but they&#39;re not hard to find if you search.</p>

<p>It looks to me like she was a real person who died.</p>

<p>Why pour money and resources into huge projects that work against themselves? It&#39;s short sighted and a huge waste. A very wrong move IMO.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the only thing these agencys are  interested in is power, and how do they get power? </p>

<p>By catching &quot;terrorists&quot; and saying they need more rights to foil their plans earlier <strong>or</strong> by not catching terrorists   , suffering a terrorist attack and say they need more power to prevent those in the future.</p>

<p>Its makes totally sense from their perspective, because there are no drawbacks when catching false-positive &quot;terrorists&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not to sure about the Craig&#39;s list stuff. If your normal pattern is you use it very regularly or mentioned it on other social media then possibly maybe. Its shady for sure and not worth it but if you contacted them most likely not anything entrapment wise just regular everyday craigs list shady. It&#39;s understandable to be rattled by a visit to from the cops but if you weren&#39;t contacted directly about a job then I&#39;d be fairly confident it&#39;s nothing like that. </p>

<p>Be lawful and be lawyered and all will be well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dox the dead person, follow the leads on their facebook and get the real story.</p>

<p>This reeks of an entrapment plot. While probably &quot;legal&quot; if you&#39;re a squirmy wormy scumbag, these tactics they use often fall into the &quot;illegal&quot; category very easily. Follow every lead you can, document the entire thing with as much detail as possible. Make sure to keep the documentation visible, share it with people. </p>

<p>What did the news agency say they actually did? Could they have hit a dead end and are just dismissing you as a &quot;crazy conspiracy theorist&quot; or as someone who just wants attention? That will be your first hurdle.</p>

<p>Details, phone records from your phones [was this person contacting you from south america? Probably not. This was a cover story, and easily pulled threads]</p>

<p>You can do a few hours of work and confirm the death record and the date yourself. Find out if the person even spoke english. If you can get enough evidence to prove that the person who was trying to recruit you wasn&#39;t the dead end lead, you will have proof that someone was trying to game you. From a newspaper or news person&#39;s perspective, that person could still be actively trying to create poison. This should be treated as a serious threat, even though you and I know it was a honeypot by some bored fed types with no useful leads. It could even be as simple as they have to do due diligence and this was the scummy way they went about it.</p>

<p>Dishonorable tactics indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doesn&#39;t surprise me <em>someone</em> would alert <em>someone</em> when you produce phrases like that without any other connection, the IP would be investigated and cops sent to their house. Police would come under heavy fire if it was discovered that a conspiratard threatened bombs online and followed through without them getting involved at all. Thing is, nobody can see into your head, whether this is your level of &quot;funny&quot; or whether you&#39;re a dead serious threat is simply unanswered. I would send 2 units myself just to be sure. It&#39;s nice, if not a little egoistic, how you&#39;re reading into it further, but it&#39;s quite unlikely you&#39;re an interest to anyone past what was suspected, making phrases like that and ending up with what seems like just another cop interview they had to do doesn&#39;t strike me as nothing more than wishing to star in an action movie on your end. You love this situation, don&#39;t you?</p>

<p>edit: Thinking of it further, I would likely keep you on a possible threat list for good with such a phrase, definitely not off the radar, that would be very unsafe to do. You would get visited and kept &quot;eye on&quot;, but not for the reasons you would wish for. It&#39;s just that nobody wants maniacs running into the crowd with dirty bombs, which you presented yourself as.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know I&#39;m late in the thread here and chocked this mostly up to mere coincidence, but since I became active here I&#39;ve been pulled over 3 times and have had to pay $200 in bullshit fines (which I OK with for now, admit fault, and am luckily financially stable enough to take the hit, although a new vehicle will be purchased soon.</p>

<p>Unfortunate OP that you&#39;ve had to deal with this and I am sorry.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve been <em>preaching</em> here lately - is yes, **there are problems in society, and especially in America, and I am not including the general populousness fault for this. It was more me being side tracked by shit here and there and not playing by the rules you agree to in America by using state and federal roads.</p>

<p>I do think it is interesting after my 4k/karma multiple gilded post that the next weekend I got pulled over for an expired inspection sticker (yeah, I know, but I just don&#39;t care) and was, for once, treated with respect and dignity.</p>

<p>Not all cops are assholes and are just doing their job. Work with them - remember - in this shitty Matrix analogy they are just like you, just they have life experiences that have conditioned them (I would argue on purpose) to think you are they enemy.</p>

<p>It is <strong>our job</strong> to treat with everyone with respect. You will not win anyone over with fancy words and pictures of the Pentagon at 11:34 AM on 9/11.</p>

<p>Take it slow, take care of you and yours, and be ready. Because change is coming and it won&#39;t work without you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But muh principles! Being rude to police officers in any encounter is definitely a tactical mistake and a strategic barrier to winning the long war for liberty. Attitudes like that alienate some of the badasses on our side, like the Oath Keepers, and just make their jobs harder.</p>

<p>Same goes for any group. For example I happen to be a Nazi sympathizer -- I like what Hitler had to say and what he did, and believe the holocaust never happened -- but I&#39;m always friendly to Jewish people I meet. Why not? Some of them are holocaust deniers too! And even if they aren&#39;t - I like getting along with people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trust me I know in the heat of the moment it&#39;s much easier just to give in to their unlawful threats (especially if you don&#39;t like conflict, like myself) 
When you consent to letting them in your house, they can use any &quot;evidence&quot; they find against you though.  If they come in without your consent (or a warrant) any &quot;evidence&quot; they find should be thrown out if it were to go to court.</p>

<p>I&#39;m only trying to help incase it happens again.  Please watch the video I linked when you have the time.(it&#39;s a must watch) It will clearly explain why the chances of being &#39;set up&#39; go through the roof if you cooperate with the police, even if you have nothing to hide.  Especially if they are really trying  to make you out as a terrorist because of a reddit comment.</p>

<p>they deemed it an &#39;exigent threat&#39; at which point I conceded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They lied to you and tricked you, which they are allowed to do.  Some Reddit comments do not deem an exigent threat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course if I really had such a device it would be very dumb for police to knock and find out if it was true.. they knew it wasn&#39;t. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You even admitted that they knew the comments weren&#39;t true.</p>

<p>Anyways I&#39;ll leave you alone.  If you have really watched that video and still think it&#39;s in your best interest to talk to police without a lawyer (when they are trying to set you no less) by all means please do.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>On the other hand should we really be sending police to investgate every post like this online?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not how bureaucracies work. Someone obviously reported OP, leaving police with the option of assuming that it is nothing and leaving it alone, or following up. If they don&#39;t follow up and something bad happens, whoever decided to not bother investigating is well and truly fucked. As a consequence, you need to anticipate interaction with the cops if you&#39;re going to post stuff like that online.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>hint I it was credible it wouldnt be posted online</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People talk about all kinds of stupid stuff online, even when it presents a potential risk to their future liberty.</p>
