    <div class="md"><p>&quot;to broadcast (an event) on the internet as it happens&quot;. If I&#39;m not completely wrong the first moon mission was to broadcast live to the whole world. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t answer your question, but doing some Googling I found a probable answer for you:</p>

<p>Q8. The landers should have kicked up a lot of dust when landing, but there is no sign of any dust on the landers in the photographs.</p>

<p>A. The landers were throttling back when landing and using little thrust. Also they didn&#39;t come straight down but at an angle travelling over the surface. Touch down kicked up only a little dust that in a vacuum quickly fell back to the surface.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Unless you were alive at the time, and had the necessary equipment to determine where a signal was coming from, then you don&#39;t know. Just being alive at the time would not be enough. Just because the tv says it is live, doesn&#39;t mean it is.</p>

<p>As for the &#39;answer&#39; you found. Like I said, not satisfactory. Not even close. We are told the dust on the surface is very fine, finer than talcum powder. So fine that it got into virtually everything, through the tiniest of cracks.  </p>

<p>So, &#39;throttling back&#39; fails completely to explain the lack of dust on the pads, as does lateral movement. If anything sliding to a stop would kick up even more dust.</p>

<p>Go look as some moonwalk videos. Look how much they kick up. </p>

<p>They can tell me the rocket thrust required to touchdown a 30,000+ pound vehicle won&#39;t kick up dust, and they can repeat loud and often, but I&#39;ll never believe it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  NASA never successfully tested the &quot;jiffy-pop&quot; moon-lander on earth.  So, NASA just said &quot;Fuck it, they&#39;ll figure it out when they get there?&quot;  We don&#39;t even test aircraft this haphazardly.</p>

<p>Recently, Space-X tried to land a rocket on a barge out in the ocean and couldn&#39;t do it.  This is supposed to be a 40 year-old technology.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, that all other extra-terrestrial landings the ships deployed parachutes to reach the surface of the planet.  </p>

<p>I think Elon Musk was trying to send a subtle message.  A message that most of the world knows--except for Americans--that the Apollo missions never happened.  When Space-X does send a mission to the moon, it will be far more sophisticated than the Apollo missions.  And it will take them more than 10 years to figure it out.</p>

<p>You realise there&#39;s a difference between landing a 25+ ton largely empty rocket in wind on an ocean platform with gravity of 1G versus landing a ~5 ton craft where there&#39;s no atmosphere and &lt;0.2G?</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to land on Earth with parachutes - a precision landing from the atmosphere is however much more difficult</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But even the lander platforms that NASA tested in the 60s, couldn&#39;t land without crashing.  </p>

<p>When I mentioned parachutes, I was referring to the missions to Mars (Viking, etc.)</p>

<p>But here&#39;s my point, NASA didn&#39;t test this technology out thoroughly.   It really was a giant leap.  Can man, in those Apollo spacecraft, withstand the radiation outside the Van Allen belts?  We didn&#39;t even test this theory with a monkey?  The Russians tried to send a manned mission around the moon and they lost them.</p>

<p>Why haven&#39;t we been back to the moon in 40 years.  Or why haven&#39;t even the Russians.  The Russians have a planned manned mission to the moon for 2030?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has always been my personal favorite conspiracy theory because I think it goes to the heart of what it means to be a conspiracy theorist. To entertain the idea of a moon landing conspiracy one must first be willing to question the very reality that has been universally accepted as true by every single respectable authoritative body on Earth. The most compelling evidence to support that the moon landings happened is that we all know that they happened. Broadcasting Armstrong&#39;s &quot;One small step&quot; live and across the globe effectively made the entire human race witness to an unquestionable and actual event. To this day it is socially unacceptable to question the circumstances of the moon landings. On that fateful day in 1969 the moon landing became a reality and it is inherently offensive to people when one questions reality. But the thing is, once you get past that first hurdle of questioning what you&#39;ve always known to be true, once you accept the slight possibility that what everybody saw on TV that day might not have been 100% real, once reality is placed in doubt it becomes very easy to entertain the idea of a moon landing conspiracy. To be completely honest, I personally find it very hard to believe that the moon landings occurred the way most people understand them. It seems illogical to believe that it occurred just as it has been presented and I find it unintelligent to accept a fact and defend its existence merely because it has been provided. I fully understand how uncomfortable this notion can make people feel. </p>

Also, all the images that I&#39;ve seen that apparently show the equipment left behind never have sufficient resolution to unequivocally confirm what we&#39;re actually looking at in the images.</p>

<p>Further still, with today&#39;s technology it seems it would be possible to transport the equipment there with robots, so even if that could be shown, it doesn&#39;t prove that it&#39;s been there all this time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To comment on the whole &quot;livestream&quot; thing, that does seem like quite a risk considering the uncertainty around what they would find there. I am sure there was a significant delay so that they could edit appropriately. Also, if they really wanted to cover their asses, and to tie in the Stanley Kubrick related conspiracy; maybe they had some believable earthly footage created so that they could somehow play parts of that possibly mixed in with authentic moon landing footage in order to cover up anything found that would be difficult to immediately explain. This actually makes a fair amount of sense, because even if they found something that could eventually be explained, there could have been concerned public perception between when the unexplained thing happened and the explanation that they would want to avoid. </p>

<p>Frankly, it would have been incredibly difficult to fake, and extremely likely that they would have been caught out. I really cant imagine how it would have been so incredibly faked.</p>

<p>However, there are <em>so many anomalies</em>. So many reasons to suspect that it <em>was</em> faked. </p>

<p>Its an oldie, but this is my favourite video on the subject: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W79mIGx9Ib4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W79mIGx9Ib4</a></p>

<p>Bill Clinton himself says in his book that when he was young, an old man used to say the moon landing were faked. Bill thought he was crazy. But, after 2 terms in office, Bill saw some things on TV that made him wonder &quot;if the old man wasn&#39;t ahead of his time.&quot; This is probably only relating to how events of Bills time in office were portrayed in the media, but an interesting comment none the less.</p>

3- Without atmosphere, sunlight is not diffused on the moon; there should be no shadows -- either light or dark. Pictures taken on the moon should show shadow and do not -- particularly those most famous pix of astronauts, which were taken by chest-level cameras.
4- Some of the so-called &quot;moon rocks&quot; have been proven fakes; a MAJORITY of other moon rocks have disappeared.
5- All the moon landings took place at roughly the same time major Vietnam operations were being launched, during the height of the anti-war movement, pushing war off the front page.
6- Nobody&#39;s been back to the moon in nearly 40 years
7- There was very little space in the landing capsule, not enough to hold the men, the &quot;suitcase car,&quot; and all the fuel needed for liftoff.
8- Speaking of that suitcase car....how come no billionaire or other wealthy showoff is carting around his suitcase car to show off?
9- Temperature on the moon is over 200 degrees in the sun, more than 200 below in the shadows -- when astronauts were half in shadow, was the suit adapting 50/50? 
10 - Tons of stuff Neil Armstrong allegedly left on the moon were recently found hidden in his closet after his death.</p>

<p>There&#39;s more, but you should start here, then report back about what you think.

<p>Thing is....I DON&#39;T WANT to believe that all this is a lie, that the American people have been fooled and mislead and manipulated pretty much steadily since the JFK murder and probably before that only less regularly. But the more I investigate, the more it looks that way. And you know they&#39;ve gotten away with so much, there&#39;s no way it&#39;s going to stop.</p>

<p>I insist that no such evidence exists in any form.<br/>
Does a complete and utter lack of evidence not constitute a solid argument for the position of skepticism?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, for good evidence, here we go.</p>

<p>Lunar rocks have many unique characteristics, such as micrometeorite impacts and different ratios of isotopes of certain gases. You can read more about it <a href="http://meteorites.wustl.edu/lunar/howdoweknow.htm">here</a> and <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast23feb_2/">here</a>. </p>

<p>The retroreflectors are also solid (yeah I know you&#39;ll say regolith can reflect photons DIRECTLY back at you too) so I will use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmVxSFnjYCA">this</a> video where they actually pulse a laser at the lunar highlands then at the retroreflector. So unless we magically found a freaky shiny and oddly retroreflector shaped piece of lunar terrain, we are hitting a reflector we placed there. This cannot be done against plain soil. And before people say it can be done without retroreflectors, you are correct, just you would expect about a factor of 100 reduction in photons returning. <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/2010/12/16/all-right-im-gonna-delay/">This</a> post explains this fairly well.</p>

<p>Japan&#39;s SELENE mission also matched the terrain seen by the Apollo 15 mission, and caught evidence of their exhaust plume from takeoff from the lunar surface. You can read that <a href="http://global.jaxa.jp/press/2008/05/20080520_kaguya_e.html">here</a>. </p>

<p>Also there was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGXTF6bs1IU">this video</a> circulating purporting that faking the videos would have been impossible. Since I can&#39;t verify it because I don&#39;t have that sort of knowledge, I am not 100% on it, but I will share it just because. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lunar rocks have many unique characteristics</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Going to start by saying that you present nothing as evidence here, but I&#39;ll try to read into your statement a bit (such as if instead you claimed lunar samples themselves are evidence) so as to give <em>some</em> response</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_and_missing_moon_rocks">There are no publicly available lunar samples to be scrutinized.</a> Of samples which were scrutinized, 100% were found to be fake.  Most have gone missing, including many under NASA control.</p>

<p>That&#39;s correct, every time a lunar sample has been tested by an independent party it has been shown to be terrestrial in origin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>retroreflectors</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You pretty much lambasted this one all by yourself.  The reason that retroreflectors are insufficient as evidence of mans walk on the moon is that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunokhod_programme">man is unnecessary for their appearance or operation.</a></p>

<p>Quite frankly, by their very nature a well designed retroreflector could be launched quite haphazardly into the moon and still function quite well; hardly requiring a delicate human touch to deploy. Quite.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SELENE</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tempting to just rule it out as film evidence, but that wouldn&#39;t be fair.  Did you look at the pictures SELENE provided?  The one in your very link? Hardly what I would call persuasive, much less conclusive.<br/>
I think you may be seeing what you want to see.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>faking the videos would have been impossible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one just grind my gears. Why is it believable  to successfully complete an entirely novel mission to a heavenly body, but insane to presume an improvement in filmmaking technique enabled the video capture of the moonwalk?<br/>
<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-hass.html">Heck, even NASA is pretty sure they made some breakthroughs in the way film was captured</a></p>

<p>But I digress, it is quite silly to claim it&#39;s more likely that we&#39;ve done something never attempted than to improve on existing technology, improvements we continue to see to this day (unlike more moon missions, one could say).</p>

<p>Do you think I&#39;ve answered any of these unsatisfactorily or have you thought of <em>exactly one</em> new piece of evidence (barring the film) that man walked on the moon?</p>

<p>It&#39;s because people like you don&#39;t look for the evidence and when evidence is presented to people like you, you put your fingers in your ears and just say La, La, La, La, La, La, I can&#39;t hear you, La, La, La, La.....</p>

<p>Recently, Space-X tried to land a rocket on a barge out in the ocean and couldn&#39;t do it. This is supposed to be a 40 year-old technology.</p>

<p>You realise there&#39;s a difference between landing a 25+ ton largely empty rocket in wind on an ocean platform with gravity of 1G versus landing a ~5 ton craft where there&#39;s no atmosphere and &lt;0.2G?</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to land on Earth with parachutes - a precision landing from the atmosphere is however much more difficult</p>
