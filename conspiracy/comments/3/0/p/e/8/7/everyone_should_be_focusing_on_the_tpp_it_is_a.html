       EXACTLY my point as well -- if we get active enough in r/worldnews and others, we can get this bill defeated.  Come on -- now's the time, for goodness sake.  Or do you want to get it passed, and forget about our constitutional rights?  Are you that blind?

       It's sad that I have an MBA and have been working in the financial industry for over 15 years and consider myself pretty darn informed. And I learned about this on R/conspiracy. Sad.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was my recent FB post (ugh). And I hate discussing politics via social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Imagine a piece of legislation that does not involve national security, introduced by our President but supported by both parties, written by multi-national corporations, negotiated with foreign countries, fast-tracked through Congress without any debate, deliberately kept from the voters until FORTY YEARS after it has been voted on and will fundamentally change the sovereignty of the United States and its relation to an autocratic world body. This is not tin foil hat stuff. This is called TTIP, or the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.
When you hear criticism about it in the media, it will be spun as conspiracy. It's creation is fundamentally undemocratic and opaque. The level of secrecy is unprecedented. Access to governing documents are kept from, not only the public domain, but the voting bodies themselves, i.e. Parliament and Congress.
It will remove important barriers such as, environmental protection, labor rights, and digital privacy laws. It grants corporations nation-state status, rather than entities that are granted powers to incorporate BY THE PEOPLE.
Regardless of your political leanings towards regulations and their intentions, or the political party introducing the bill, this agreement fundamentally undermines the democratic process in numerous countries, not just the U.S.
Please take a minute and learn about it."

       So my understanding is corporations can basically sue the governments of this "partnership".    Is this true? Can a corporation sue the government for expected loss of future profits?  If this is true is there a limit?  What kind of protections are there from stopping corporations from crushing countries with debt?

       They can sue for loss of profits due to politics already. It's a standard part of trade agreements to stop governments from intentionally crushing a corporation due to political reasons. Frankly I'd find it more disturbing if the TPP forbid suing governments. Keep in mind they have to prove the damages and show that they are outside regulatory statutes.

       I see the problems with the TPP to be similar to NAFTA. It really isn't anything new. the new leaked section is just an anti

       It takes some mental gymnastics, but I am of the opinion that there have been many political, financial, religious and industrial capitals in this
       <em>
        New World Order
       </em>
       that has actually been running things (sure, Rome stumbled, but I am of the opinion that she did not fall completely and merely took control via the Vatican).
      </p>
      <p>
       Previous financial capitals have included Rome, the Vatican, the City of London (not London), who currently run things via the Fed (who controls America, the military arm of this whole thing).
      </p>
      <p>
       It appears to me that at least one more of these capitals is moving East, most likely financial, if there ever is a problem with the Petrodollar and the most logical landing spot is the current industrial powerhouse.

       I think a useful tactic, especially for persuading conservatives/Republicans, is to label this as Obama's trade initiative, a blatant power grab and an assault on America's sovereignty and freedom. Admittedly, this is only half the story, as leaders in both parties and the interests that finance them are committed to this path. But most of the pushback I've seen is from the left, conservatives I know in real life have generally not heard of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This treaty will live or die by the senate fast track bill. If that passes, this deal is as good as done. Enough uproar from the Republican base against "Obama's tyranny" might just be enough to sway a few senate votes to defeat this. Is this a fallacious rhetorical trick? Yeah, but thats politics.

       Paid troll? I'm not paid, and I'm not a troll, I just studied international trade and hence this stuff is second nature to me. The TPP also doesn't involve Europe, so I don't support the TPP in

        Once the agreement is concluded it will become public. It will be a way before it goes to the Parliament for ratification. You can see that in case of EU-Canada agreement, the text is now accessible on our website, it can be consulted by anyone and it is the agreement which has still not even been submitted to legal revision. After it is submitted to legal revision, it would need to be translated, and it would be more than a year before it goes for consideration to the European Parliament.

       It's sad that I have an MBA and have been working in the financial industry for over 15 years and consider myself pretty darn informed. And I learned about this on R/conspiracy. Sad.

       This was my recent FB post (ugh). And I hate discussing politics via social media.

       "Imagine a piece of legislation that does not involve national security, introduced by our President but supported by both parties, written by multi-national corporations, negotiated with foreign countries, fast-tracked through Congress without any debate, deliberately kept from the voters until FORTY YEARS after it has been voted on and will fundamentally change the sovereignty of the United States and its relation to an autocratic world body. This is not tin foil hat stuff. This is called TTIP, or the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.
When you hear criticism about it in the media, it will be spun as conspiracy. It's creation is fundamentally undemocratic and opaque. The level of secrecy is unprecedented. Access to governing documents are kept from, not only the public domain, but the voting bodies themselves, i.e. Parliament and Congress.
It will remove important barriers such as, environmental protection, labor rights, and digital privacy laws. It grants corporations nation-state status, rather than entities that are granted powers to incorporate BY THE PEOPLE.
Regardless of your political leanings towards regulations and their intentions, or the political party introducing the bill, this agreement fundamentally undermines the democratic process in numerous countries, not just the U.S.
Please take a minute and learn about it."
