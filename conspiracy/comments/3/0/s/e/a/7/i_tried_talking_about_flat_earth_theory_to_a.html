<p>I just don&#39;t understand this wild disconnected with flat earth theory. How can someone flat-out reject it, but completely endorse the fractal universe theory? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a question for you:  How does the flat Earth theory account for the differing but predictable temperatures across the equator and the poles of the planet?  It would seem that what accounts for the cold/freezing temperatures at the poles and the very tropical temperatures at the equator <em>is</em> indeed the elliptical shape of the planet, and if one proposes a flat Earth, then there seems to be nothing in that theory that effectively accounts for these differing temperature dynamics balanced across entire geographical locations.</p>

<p>How could the flat Earth theory account for the differing yet predictable temperature dynamics that the elliptical theory seems to quite readily and effectively answer?</p>

<p>The elliptical theory&#39;s ability to account for the planet&#39;s differing temperature across continents seems to be something that the flat Earth theory cannot do, and seems to be (among various other things) a pretty significant death knell upon such a theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There could be many reasons for why the temperatures differ at different latitudes in the flat-earth model.  If we adopt the model where Antarctica is an ice wall around the outer edge and the the Arctic is in the centre, then the sun is moving in a circle in between those two, so laying most of the heat in the equatorial region.</p>

<p>But even without an explanation for some observed phenomena, that does not mean we need to completely reject any given model.  Any model, whether it is a round earth, or a flat earth, heliocentrism, or geocentrism, is merely an explanation for our observations. A model which seems to explain the data may still be completely wrong and there&#39;s no way to test it.  A model which fails to explain some data may simply not have that particular explanation, but that does not prove it is wrong.</p>

<p>Wait a minute there, my good man.  The very use of the word &quot;latitude&quot; in the first place and <em>by definition</em> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=latitude&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8"><em>presupposes</em> a spherical model of the planet</a>.  There <em>are</em> no latitudes unless a planet is spherical.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>But wait a minute...Is it only the Earth that is flat in this model?  It would seem that what this model proposes applies universally, no?  Otherwise positing that only the Earth is flat but all other celestial bodies are not makes the theory even <em>more</em> untenable still.  So if all celestial bodies are flat, then that means...that the <em>sun</em> is flat too...and if <em>that&#39;s</em> the case...then what you&#39;re essentially saying is that a flat, angular, square-like or rectangular sun is...moving in a <em>circle</em> around a flat, angular, square-like or rectangular Earth.  What is causing the sun to move in a circle in the first place?  It would seem that it is gravity, correct?  And if one is going to allow for a correct theory of gravity in this model, then you are once again running into some significant and undermining problems with this theory, as it has been experimentally shown that gravitational influence tends to turn otherwise nebulous objects into <em>circles</em> - not squares.  As such, that same gravitational influence that causes the sun to, as you stated here, move in a <em>circular motion around</em> the Earth will also be responsible for turning the objects of the Earth and the Sun themselves both into spheres - not flat squares or rectangles.</p>

<p>Essentially, much as I continue to try to give this flat Earth theory the benefit of the doubt, logic continues to rear its ugly head and show that such a theory seems more and more untenable.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I agree with this notion in theory.  However, a deeper investigation of the logical implications of the flat Earth theory does seem to reach self-defeating conclusions.</p>

<p>I do agree with everything you said in terms of the explanation you gave in your last paragraph, however.  Yes.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I thought you were being precise and technical.  My apologies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s no need to assume anything about other celestial objects in order to justify a flat earth model.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if you don’t apply the particulars of a flat Earth cosmically, then you’re applying a unique set of circumstances to the Earth alone - circumstances that the theory is not applying to other celestial bodies - and that seems to, therefore, make the flat Earth theory even <em>less</em> sound or likely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The earth may be the entire universe</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would seem that one would have to contend with a whole slue of data that summarily contradicts this postulation if one were to hang their hat on <em>that</em> particular idea.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>with the flat earth being the centre, the dome of the heavens overhead, and an underworld.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait a minute…Holy smokes…Are you here postulating not only that the Earth is flat, but that it is also the <em>center of the universe?</em>  What?  And, for that matter, even if one <em>is</em> postulating something like that, even if the Earth <em>were</em> the center of the universe, this still does not account of all the other data that seems to show that celestial bodies are in fact spherical - not flat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The exact nature, shape, and size of the stars and other heavenly bodies is undetermined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their very primordial <em>nature</em> might not as of yet be fully understood, but it <em>seems</em> that there is enough known about them to safely postulate their shape as being spherical.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s no need to assume gravity is real in a flat earth model. We simply do not know what causes the effects that modern science currently ascribes to gravity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay but here we are dealing with a “rose by any other name” type of scenario, as even if we might not know what specificly causes the effects modern science ascribes to gravity, we do know that there’s a <em>something</em> that “causes the effects that modern science ascribes to gravity”.  It seems to matter not what specifically it’s called - whether “gravity” or anything else (“a rose by any other name”) - so long as it is acknowledged that there <em>is</em> indeed a “something” that exhibits the effects we currently <em>ascribe</em> to gravity.  And that specific “something” seems to exist quite independent to the planet Earth itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>most flat earth models describe the sun&#39;s path as a parabola overhead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If its movement was exclusively parabolic, it would go from, say, left to right, but this alone would not account for its cyclical return back again from the left.  This could only happen if it were indeed moving <em>around</em> the Earth and <em>not</em> parabolically.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some describe it as a spherical object, others as flat and working like a flashlight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the sun were a flashlight only shining forward from a flat surface, that would mean that the radiation it emits would be unilateral and felt only in the direction that it were shining.  However, studies have shown that objects above, below, to the left, right, and <em>behind</em> the sun are just as effected by the same radiation as objects in front of it.  This pretty conclusively indicates that the “flashlight” is shining all around in every direction, and not just straight ahead - i.e. the sun definitely seems to be spherical and emitting its solar radiation from <em>all</em> sides and as a sphere, and <em>not</em> as a flat flashlight-like object emitting radiation in one direction only.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s a lot to be said for flat earth despite its many detractors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I’ve been able to see thus far, it’s not so much that the theory has many detractors as much as it is that the theory itself has many defects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the level of conspiracy is as great as most people will admit that it is, then this is entirely possible. What I mean is, if they can kill JFK and stage 9/11, then we really can&#39;t trust anything we know which we were simply told by state agencies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a fair assessment, sir, and I do very much respect it.  You are indeed very correct in terms of the deep level of chicanery responsible for JFK and 911 (incidentally, sir, and speaking of JFK and 911, please do check out the super thorough documentary featured <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/337nkj/extremely_eye_opening_and_comprehensive/">here</a> if you haven’t done so already.  I don’t think you will be disappointed).  However, the reason I find the theory difficult to support is not so much because I do not think it possible for TPTB to effect a rouge that is this global in scope (heavens no, as they have already accomplished deceit of absolutely global proportions already).  It is because, as far as I have been able to thus far assess, the theory simply does not seem to stand up to any level of real, logical, critical analysis.  It falls apart all over itself and becomes logically self-defeating.  It implodes upon itself when the theories it puts forth are followed all the way through to their logical conclusions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The state has constructed an entire worldview based on information for which they fund and/or regulate every source, and that&#39;s just what we can prove.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.  We certainly live in a prison planet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the fundamental, core planks of that worldview is the flat earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this constitutes a conflation of monumental proportions, as one theory (that we are ruled on this planet by a power that is absolutely ubiquitous in its scope and nefariousness) should not necessarily be equated with the other (that the Earth is both flat <em>and</em> the center of the universe).</p>

<p>Dude, if you have a proper, intelligent objection to what I initially posted, then PUT IT UP.  Don&#39;t just come on here and talk shit saying you know something others don&#39;t.  PROVE IT by actually intelligently addressing what I wondered about in my OP.</p>

<p>I really have to actually help explain how to properly communicate to you?  You&#39;re not aware that you haven&#39;t said <em>anything</em> yet other than &quot;Dur...You&#39;re stupid, man.  You need to learn things.&quot; lol</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you actually explain to all of us (ELI5, perhaps?) how to reconcile the objections I presented above?</p>

<p>And if you come back here and respond with nothing other than more &quot;I&#39;m smarter than you - durr&quot; vitriol, then...just don&#39;t, because you&#39;ve accomplished exactly zero doing that thus far.</p>

<p>Whaat?  Vehemently against?  What the actual fuck are you talking about?  lol.  Wow.  I don&#39;t even...I&#39;m &quot;vehemently against&quot; it because I OPed an intelligent objection that I&#39;d like addressed? an objection that seems to heavily undermine any flat earth theory if the objection is NOT addressed?  That&#39;s not &quot;vehemently against&quot;.  That&#39;s what&#39;s called an &quot;intelligent rebuttal&quot;.</p>

<p>Man...facepalm.  Reading on in the rest of your (non)response, I see you have STILL not actually answered my initial comment/rebuttal.</p>

<p>That pretty much shows that you don&#39;t actually HAVE a rebuttal.  And what does <em>that</em> further show?  It shows that the flat earth theory...is pretty much flat.</p>

<p>Go home, son.  You lose.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Oh.  And let me guess.  He&#39;s gonna come back and respond with more &quot;Fuck you, man.  You don&#39;t know shit.  Educate yourself, dumb ass!&quot; ad hominems...all the while STILL not actually addressing the very point I initially made which seems to thoroughly undermine any flat earth theory.</p>

<p>I tell you, if you only addressed the points I made effectively, then you guys might actually have a leg to stand on.  As of right now, you&#39;ve been shown to be unable to answer a pretty basic and fundamental question which seems to thoroughly do away with your little theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have posted this response in another topic but it also fits in here very well:</p>

<p>I think this all goes a bit deeper. To be honest right from the beginning, I am a round earth believer and I know that not all flat earth believers are stupid (not everyone is parrotting nonsense s/he heard from a friend which read something on the internet what a friend saw on youtube). I think this all is just part of a huge controlled disinformation campaign in order to make people resistant for the upcoming disclosure and the massive information dump which is to come linked to this. Because if one gets the masses to disbelief in science and get them to not being able to distinguish honest and true science from fakes, then the masses also won’t believe in disclosure and other true informations coming out. Lots of us are looking for informations, and at some point you will come across the illuminati &amp; cabal groups, and if you are up to date you’ll probably know about the sphere alliance and the SSP’s. It is obvious (at least to me and many others) that the cabal groups have infiltrated the conspiracy theorists and it seems this is all well prepared. People around the globe are slowly waking up and are realizing that somethings not right here. People know that NASA, our politicians, the media, schools and what have you weren’t always truthful and honest. So I believe that this huge disinformation effort is to discredit science with the weaopns of the conspiracy theorists. It is basically their last stand because they know if that doesn’t work they, the cabal group, will be history. But no matter what, this time they’ll lose anyway. I have read a lot about flat earth theory and in every forum, and on youtube etc. at some point the flat earthers are fighting fiercly with the round earthers about their beliefs. This tactic is old, very old and it seems to work on us almost every time unless someone notices it. Not only on this topic but also on many others. Get the people to fight each other so they don’t care about the one initiating all of this. I think what we should focus on is prevent this useless namecalling, fighting, insulting and so on because aggression does not get you anywhere in this discussion. No one knows everything and the one who claims to know everything is a liar. Only full disclosure is real disclosure and anything other than that will be orchestrated by the cabal groups. Its as easy as that. Technically we could be much further than we are at the moment and if the real full disclosure occurs we have to be able to distinguish the fake from the real thing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to start to explain details of this because I wouldn&#39;t be able to do this as good as the ones who are doing this for years. But I can provide some links so you can research for yourself.</p>

<p>Planets, or wandering stars, are just that: lights in the firmament that move. They act as hands stemming off of the sun to create a clock in the sky, nothing more. The ancient pagans considered them gods, while modern pagans consider them terrestrial bodies. They&#39;re just lights made for signs, seasons, days, and for years.</p>

<p>There is a solid firmament above us. There is no space to explore and no &#39;out there&#39; as we&#39;re told. There are lights in the heaven and there&#39;s a glass ceiling above us. The sun and moon are about the same size - roughly 30 miles across and approximately 3-4,000 miles up - and they&#39;re also just lights.</p>

<p>Cosmic evolution is a fairy tale. If you want the truth, read Genesis 1.</p>

<p>Nope. The moon is approx 384,467 kilometers up. Measured via Lunar Laser Ranging experiment.

<p>Genesis is historical narrative. The world is indeed ~6000 years old, there <strong>was</strong> a global flood ~4400 years ago, and the Father of creation gave the key to eternal life to all those who will turn their hearts to Him. The Bible is here as a witness to everyone. It is proof of God&#39;s existence, character, and more. Pick up a King James and it&#39;s true from start to finish, both cover to cover and from the beginning of time itself unto the end...</p>

<p>This is not how science works. This is how a religion works. The only assumption that have to hold is that our physical laws are constant. Look at the data we have, and build a model around it. Religion starts with a claim and reaches for scraps of anything that backs up the idea.</p>

<p>There is much, much, much more evidence for a young world, by the way.</p>

<p>For the flood, I recommend this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs3YQHkufLY">one hour seminar</a> as a starting point. There is overwhelming evidence that the flood is very real... Geology makes no sense without it.</p>

<p>Jonah&#39;s story is miraculous. Jesus&#39; divinity is centered around Old Testament prophecy. If you would like to really dig into these things, then you should take the time to seriously study the Bible on your own.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also I&#39;d like to know if you still follow the laws of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>I believe everything is there for a reason and for an example. The law was put in place to reveal our wicked nature and the high standard we could never hope to live up to. It&#39;s for instruction. We live in a time of grace, but the law will never be done away with.</p>

<p>God has granted us mercy if we will turn from our wickedness and look to Him. If you continue in transgression you will surely die. It&#39;s not for us to enact God&#39;s law as He will be the one to serve justice. We are not the hand of God.</p>

<p>Again... even a rudimentary understanding of a Biblical worldview requires personal study and a lot of it. If you just neglect it and choose not to honestly evaluate it yourself you&#39;re doing yourself a great disservice.</p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;ll add this resource of <a href="http://nwcreation.net/videos">creation science seminars</a> for your viewing pleasure. Real science confirms the Biblical worldview.</p>

Besides that fact, none of it holds up to scrutiny and is provably wrong... yet people are so brainwashed they won&#39;t even look at the evidence against it.

<p>I&#39;m just calling it latitude for the sake of convenience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought you were being precise and technical.  My apologies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s no need to assume anything about other celestial objects in order to justify a flat earth model.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if you don’t apply the particulars of a flat Earth cosmically, then you’re applying a unique set of circumstances to the Earth alone - circumstances that the theory is not applying to other celestial bodies - and that seems to, therefore, make the flat Earth theory even <em>less</em> sound or likely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The earth may be the entire universe</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would seem that one would have to contend with a whole slue of data that summarily contradicts this postulation if one were to hang their hat on <em>that</em> particular idea.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>with the flat earth being the centre, the dome of the heavens overhead, and an underworld.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait a minute…Holy smokes…Are you here postulating not only that the Earth is flat, but that it is also the <em>center of the universe?</em>  What?  And, for that matter, even if one <em>is</em> postulating something like that, even if the Earth <em>were</em> the center of the universe, this still does not account of all the other data that seems to show that celestial bodies are in fact spherical - not flat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The exact nature, shape, and size of the stars and other heavenly bodies is undetermined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their very primordial <em>nature</em> might not as of yet be fully understood, but it <em>seems</em> that there is enough known about them to safely postulate their shape as being spherical.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s no need to assume gravity is real in a flat earth model. We simply do not know what causes the effects that modern science currently ascribes to gravity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay but here we are dealing with a “rose by any other name” type of scenario, as even if we might not know what specificly causes the effects modern science ascribes to gravity, we do know that there’s a <em>something</em> that “causes the effects that modern science ascribes to gravity”.  It seems to matter not what specifically it’s called - whether “gravity” or anything else (“a rose by any other name”) - so long as it is acknowledged that there <em>is</em> indeed a “something” that exhibits the effects we currently <em>ascribe</em> to gravity.  And that specific “something” seems to exist quite independent to the planet Earth itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>most flat earth models describe the sun&#39;s path as a parabola overhead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If its movement was exclusively parabolic, it would go from, say, left to right, but this alone would not account for its cyclical return back again from the left.  This could only happen if it were indeed moving <em>around</em> the Earth and <em>not</em> parabolically.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some describe it as a spherical object, others as flat and working like a flashlight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the sun were a flashlight only shining forward from a flat surface, that would mean that the radiation it emits would be unilateral and felt only in the direction that it were shining.  However, studies have shown that objects above, below, to the left, right, and <em>behind</em> the sun are just as effected by the same radiation as objects in front of it.  This pretty conclusively indicates that the “flashlight” is shining all around in every direction, and not just straight ahead - i.e. the sun definitely seems to be spherical and emitting its solar radiation from <em>all</em> sides and as a sphere, and <em>not</em> as a flat flashlight-like object emitting radiation in one direction only.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s a lot to be said for flat earth despite its many detractors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I’ve been able to see thus far, it’s not so much that the theory has many detractors as much as it is that the theory itself has many defects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the level of conspiracy is as great as most people will admit that it is, then this is entirely possible. What I mean is, if they can kill JFK and stage 9/11, then we really can&#39;t trust anything we know which we were simply told by state agencies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a fair assessment, sir, and I do very much respect it.  You are indeed very correct in terms of the deep level of chicanery responsible for JFK and 911 (incidentally, sir, and speaking of JFK and 911, please do check out the super thorough documentary featured <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/337nkj/extremely_eye_opening_and_comprehensive/">here</a> if you haven’t done so already.

However, the reason I find the theory difficult to support is not so much because I do not think it possible for TPTB to effect a rouge that is this global in scope (heavens no, as they have already accomplished deceit of absolutely global proportions already).  It is because, as far as I have been able to thus far assess, the theory simply does not seem to stand up to any level of real, logical, critical analysis.  It falls apart all over itself and becomes logically self-defeating.  It implodes upon itself when the theories it puts forth are followed all the way through to their logical conclusions.</p>

<p>Agreed.  We certainly live in a prison planet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the fundamental, core planks of that worldview is the flat earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this constitutes a conflation of monumental proportions, as one theory (that we are ruled on this planet by a power that is absolutely ubiquitous in its scope and nefariousness) should not necessarily be equated with the other (that the Earth is both flat <em>and</em> the center of the universe).</p>
