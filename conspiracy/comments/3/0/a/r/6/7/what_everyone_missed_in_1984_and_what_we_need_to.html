        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Something about all the MSM rhetoric about 1984 and the term Orwellian being thrown around has bothered me since the last time I read 1984. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a copy of the book in front of me but i read it 3 times in my life, the last time being about a year ago. Heres the thing that stood out to me that no one talks about. By the end of the book Winston and his lover are imprisoned. A lot of his neighbors, friends and co-workers are imprisoned. We meet them one by one and it is discussed how they were &quot;caught&quot;. </p>

<p>To my recollection and this could be inaccurate: none of them were arrested because of the vidscreens. All of them were turned in by family members, a co worker, a boss a neighbor or in one case - the teachers of his children. The reality of the 1984 wasn&#39;t that this technological terror allowed the state to monitor everyone - rather the state  mind controlled the entire populace to turn on one another. You never see this discussed. </p>

<p>And this isn&#39;t even counting the fact that the only opposition to the state was controlled opposition. Why hasn&#39;t a phrase like &quot;O&#39;Brien&quot; caught on? Or what about &quot;Goldstein?&quot; Surely we can agree that a controlled opp exists even if we disagree as to who it is. Surely there must be a Goldstein (I think Orwell and Huxley themselves are the Goldsteins in our world) </p>

<p>In my opinion this is a huge deal. The vid screens were used to keep people on their toes when no one was around but ultimately the real power that the state had was through controlled opposition and brainwashed snitches. Thoughts? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point. The central thesis of 1984 is often neglected as well. The way the book is taught in many schools is, in a sense, a form of newspeak: the central themes of the book are either omitted or redefined. Which is why plenty of people think of 1984 as some kind of anti-communist manifesto, when it was nothing of the sort. Animal Farm gets a similar treatment.</p>

<p>In a sense, how the book was taught to me was more informative to me, about the reality of the world/system I was living in, than the contents of the book actually were. </p>

<p>The same for Animal Farm. I read that and thought &quot;this is our world now&quot; but I still here the tired old refrain &quot;no that is about socialists and communists way back then.&quot; </p>

<p>Another thing that is important to remember is that sci fi about the future isn&#39;t written about <em>the future</em> its usually a parable for the present day. In that regard I see 1984 as being a fun house mirror version of the western world post WW2. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. The whole &quot;anti-commie&quot; angle exploits that Orwell was being intellectually honest by taking the ideology he was partial to when writing the books, socialism, into its ultimate consequences. But them underlying themes of those two works are applicable to basically almost any other ism or ideology. </p>

<p>Both 1984 and Animal farm are really treaties on power: 1984 exposes that the ultimate goal of power is power itself. Animal Farm explores that the underlying societal power structures/dynamics/systemics remain even after revolution, i.e. you can abruptly and forcefully change the players all you want, but the underlying game is still the same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I glazed over the various references to specific political conventions. Ultimately to me the means by which power was usurped and enforced was through means that could metaphorically work in any system. I mean thats the REAL genius of animal farm. It&#39;s about a fucking farm with talking animals. Why take the specific political ideology so seriously? The point is that its a metaphor. </p>

<p>Like I said, it kept them on their toes but ultimately everyone was turned in by someone they knew. The state won by breaking down social bonds not by developing a new technology. </p>

<p>What you&#39;re saying has the <em>air</em> of being &#39;paranoid&#39; but we&#39;re living in a reality where its actually <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/exclusive-woman-held-psych-ward-obama-twitter-claim-article-1.2159049">mainstream news</a> on a <a href="http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/inside-mind-lone-wolf-terrorist">regular basis.</a> </p>

<p>This is something i&#39;ve really come to wonder about. Kids growing up are seeing that the old cliches about paranoid conspiracy theories that people who are ages 25-30 or older joke about are actually just a part of their daily lives. A lot of what used to be considered crazy is now just straight up reality... so why is there such a fucking disconnect between the sleep walkers and the awake? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I don&#39;t like about the common interpretation of 1984 is that people read the book and assume everyone is under the surveillance Winston is under which is simply not true.</p>

<p>This leads to the &quot;If you can talk about 1984, its not 1984&quot; argument you see parroted around often. What these people fail to realize is that only people with any actual power were monitored. That would be the politicians, journalists, celebrities, judges, the people who&#39;s voice mattered. In the book its represented by the inner and outer party. The proles (you and me) could be left to their alcohol work and sports and didn&#39;t need surveillance.</p>

<p>How this pertains to America is, the government has been caught spying on the politicians and journalists. The political implications of this are massive, giving whoever heads the surveillance state massive, 1984-level control. Just my 2 cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your correct in that assessment. It&#39;s my all time favorite and I read the book annually, since 1984....while the citizenry doesn&#39;t know that it isn&#39;t two way, but the screen does interact with Winston, as we know that would be easy to fake, but a scared and fearful people would only need to know that on the occasion (like a psychic) they actually hit the target.
This all feeds into that fear...we saw it happen to us after 9/11 with the color terror alerts bar and announcements. The idea that it &quot;might&quot; be the NSA embedding spyware (they&#39;ve never denied being equation...) keeps us on our toes, so to speak, we could use this against you, we don&#39;t need a reason and you&#39;ll NEVER figure out how  we did it frame ups...
It also hasn&#39;t been that long ago when the WH MSM were chanting see something, say something...</p>
