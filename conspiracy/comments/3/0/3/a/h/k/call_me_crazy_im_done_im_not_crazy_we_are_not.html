       All the shit going on in the world, we are not crazy. I knew a crazy, no thought. I asked him, explain it. He couldn't. We explain this all so well. WE are not crazy. Why do people think we are? We aren't, we just see the fuck up shit and call it out, wtf. I'm so done with this. We all get mocked, and harassed. We aren't crazy, we see shit for what it is. What. the . actual. fuck. We are supposed to think rationally, science FTW. But they don't think, they just believe, I'm living with crazys who think I'm crazy, what the actual fuck. This is a rant, sorry. But I'm sick of it..... Left is right, up is down and you are a degenrate if you think other wise... WTF? We live in a topsy turvy world, i ask again wtf........

       I feel the same way. I feel like I'm not playing a game anymore. It's really happening. The CIA really is arming al-qaeda, the dollar really is backed by nothing, the history we were taught in school was a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really is true and you aren't a worse person for refusing to put up with the lies anymore. I feel like I "snapped" recently. I really feel a  transformation taking place within myself. I am thoroughly convinced in the justness of my cause and I will not give up, no matter how 'they' mock.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read a post on here a few weeks ago which really crystallized things for me -- It's like the part midway through Fight Club where Ed Norton stops giving a fuck and starts showing up at work all bruised and bloody. And when someone tells him off, he fights back.
      </p>
      <p>
       IDGAF about what people think any more. I'm going to say what I know is true and people can think what they want. 30 stories of skyscraper above the impact zone can not vaporize 70 stories below. Jet fuel can't melt steel. Two planes can't knock down three towers. Cellphones don't work on airplanes today and they certainly didn't in 2001.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't give up, you aren't descending into madness, you are undergoing a mighty transformation from afraid outsider into courageous leader.

       You're going to stay solid! You will temper your personal impulses! Short of that, you will never bend knee and you will know what it is to die defending children, women, old men, yourself. That is your transformation, mine, OP's.

       Honestly when people tell me thats not how they see or it or thats not their opinion, I've simply started to state FACTUALLY, what you think doesnt matter or your opinion doesnt matter, to me or at all, and each and everyone of us needs to realize this, freedom of speech fuck yeah BUT only if you speak the truth, lies cost you so it aint free speech. Litterally when someone says this this and that in the face of truth simply say "well what you think means nothing, because thinking isnt knowing" REMEMBER its THEIR psyop that all speech and ideas even the most derogetory and inhumane "are important because they come from you" Well i dont give two flying fucks who you are, if you aint speaking the truth you're spewing garbage and filth and making the air stink and its not helping a single person.

       While you're snapping remember that part of what we have been taught is that we are only human yet I have found our mind is in charge of our body and all the aches and pains that go with it are reproduced by the mind and can therefore be stopped by the mind with proper understanding of how thoughts are things.

       Booze is the easiest way to check out. Good and bad. In the micro scale, I'm happy to buy alcohol from my country (US), in lager and bourbon. Consumerism dollars kept domestically. However, it ain't good to be addled by ye old potables. But thinking about the status quo is stressful........

       No one likes to be called crazy; as Dave Chappel says "it's dismissive."  I'm not this way because I was raised this way, I'm this way because I went down the rabbit hole of symbols and found out what TPTB were worshiping.  Figured if there was a bad, then the good was real too and He was going to come back like He said He would and burn it with fire.  Glory to the King.

       That the devil is real and hollywood is his tool.  You can follow the symbols alllll the way back to just after Noah got off the boat.  The names have been changed, but the SYMBOLS stay the same; all of them.  And all of them represent fallen angels.  The same symbols show up in crop circles; movies; music; art; advertising; company logos, they're E.V.E.R.Y.W.H.E.R.E.  The people in charge worship satan, (or lucifer, same entity).  If that entity is real, then Elohim is real too.  Right now they're working on order out of chaos, and it will ramp up until cern opens the portal and let's that entity into this dimension.  Go ahead and call me crazy, but there's just way way too much evidence to the contrary.

       definitely was not getting an argument vibe from you, just sort of general advice that I wish this board might follow a little more. Maybe the problem is that this board is dedicated to discussing conspiracy theories. Are we done theorizing?

       These ancient documents are surely proof that history is larger than we know now, I'm just more inclined to accept the idea of advanced lost civilizations than I am to accept anything supernatural.

       Personally, the way I'm seeing things the U.S. may have outlived its usefulness. After the $ crashes, what are they going to do with all of us? I'm thinking that they may set off yellowstone, which really wouldn't take much if you've been watching it at all.  What sort of prophesy do i see?  is see the 2-state solution in Israel may be the start of some serious fireworks.  I see the Hosea prophesy in the mass animal die-offs increasing exponentially over the last 2 years, from fish to cattle to birds.  Then there's Cern, the gateway to the pit.  Their logo is even 3 sixes and a nine (ninth gate).

       Both are at work, and more. Have you considered the possibility that what we usually call 'supernatural' could actually be entirely natural? Our brains are quite small, you know...

       YES. User_Defined, you are well onto the right track. But don't despair! For all of our enemies in high places, we have friends as well. And it may be that our friends hold the real trumps in this game.

       They have a project called Rainbow Gravity.  The rainbow is representative of God's throne (rev 4:3) and they're going to attempt to bring it down, much like the tower of babble days.  Additionally, I suspect the plane crash today was a direct result of cern's "short circuit," or vice versa.

       Deist is an intelligent viewpoint if not for the bible. I don't care what people think of it, it can be confusing and many things don't seem right, it was written by men after all, but christ was the messiah prophesised in the old testament and if people actual followed his message of love for one another we would live in a much better world. The truth about God is God is everything and everything is God. You are the part of God experiencing life as you and when you die your spirit will return to heaven.

       The left has been brainwashing the entire population for decades. It has a narrative that is a total fantasy, not the reality. We are all expected to believe the fantasy narrative, and if we express doubt we are abused and shamed and punished for our free thought. That is the world we presently live in. Children are being actively and deliberately brainwashed in school to hate themselves if they are white, or to hate white children if they are black.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's standard government policy today. It's war on Christianity, war on religion in general, war on white people, and especially war on anyone who thinks independently and doesn't accept the narrative of cultural Marxism.

       I don't fight with people about it, there's no point in that.  I was just answering questions, I hope you didn't think otherwise, my apologies if you did.  I will tell you though, Biblical prophesy is turning out to be the most interesting subject I've ever researched.
