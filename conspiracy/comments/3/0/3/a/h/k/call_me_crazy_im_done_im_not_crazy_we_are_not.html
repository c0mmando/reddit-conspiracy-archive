    <div class="md"><p>I feel the same way. I feel like I&#39;m not playing a game anymore. It&#39;s really happening. The CIA really is arming al-qaeda, the dollar really is backed by nothing, the history we were taught in school was a lie.</p>

<p>It really is true and you aren&#39;t a worse person for refusing to put up with the lies anymore. I feel like I &quot;snapped&quot; recently. I really feel a  transformation taking place within myself. I am thoroughly convinced in the justness of my cause and I will not give up, no matter how &#39;they&#39; mock. </p>

<p>I read a post on here a few weeks ago which really crystallized things for me -- It&#39;s like the part midway through Fight Club where Ed Norton stops giving a fuck and starts showing up at work all bruised and bloody. And when someone tells him off, he fights back.</p>

<p>IDGAF about what people think any more. I&#39;m going to say what I know is true and people can think what they want. 30 stories of skyscraper above the impact zone can not vaporize 70 stories below. Jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel. Two planes can&#39;t knock down three towers. Cellphones don&#39;t work on airplanes today and they certainly didn&#39;t in 2001. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t give up, you aren&#39;t descending into madness, you are undergoing a mighty transformation from afraid outsider into courageous leader.</p>

Litterally when someone says this this and that in the face of truth simply say &quot;well what you think means nothing, because thinking isnt knowing&quot; REMEMBER its THEIR psyop that all speech and ideas even the most derogetory and inhumane &quot;are important because they come from you&quot; Well i dont give two flying fucks who you are, if you aint speaking the truth you&#39;re spewing garbage and filth and making the air stink and its not helping a single person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>definitely was not getting an argument vibe from you, just sort of general advice that I wish this board might follow a little more. Maybe the problem is that this board is dedicated to discussing conspiracy theories. Are we done theorizing?</p>

<p>Is it time for &quot;r/revolution?&quot; That&#39;s super lame, yes, but if people today can&#39;t get off the couch and protest, maybe they can at least pay some attention from the couch. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Also:</p>

<p>I am endlessly fascinated with biblical prophecy, kabbalah&amp;the occult, ancient sumerian and sanskrit texts. What sorts of biblical prophesies do you see in the world?</p>

<p>These ancient documents are surely proof that history is larger than we know now, I&#39;m just more inclined to accept the idea of advanced lost civilizations than I am to accept anything supernatural. </p>

<p>This sort of stuff ^ resonates with me in the same way that organized religion does. The facts are not exactly correct, but the general outline, attitude, meaning is solid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, the way I&#39;m seeing things the U.S. may have outlived its usefulness. After the $ crashes, what are they going to do with all of us? I&#39;m thinking that they may set off yellowstone, which really wouldn&#39;t take much if you&#39;ve been watching it at all.  What sort of prophesy do i see?  is see the 2-state solution in Israel may be the start of some serious fireworks.  I see the Hosea prophesy in the mass animal die-offs increasing exponentially over the last 2 years, from fish to cattle to birds.  Then there&#39;s Cern, the gateway to the pit.  Their logo is even 3 sixes and a nine (ninth gate).  </p>

<p>Both are at work, and more. Have you considered the possibility that what we usually call &#39;supernatural&#39; could actually be entirely natural? Our brains are quite small, you know...</p>

<p>YES. User_Defined, you are well onto the right track. But don&#39;t despair! For all of our enemies in high places, we have friends as well. And it may be that our friends hold the real trumps in this game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Deist is an intelligent viewpoint if not for the bible. I don&#39;t care what people think of it, it can be confusing and many things don&#39;t seem right, it was written by men after all, but christ was the messiah prophesised in the old testament and if people actual followed his message of love for one another we would live in a much better world. The truth about God is God is everything and everything is God. You are the part of God experiencing life as you and when you die your spirit will return to heaven.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The left has been brainwashing the entire population for decades. It has a narrative that is a total fantasy, not the reality. We are all expected to believe the fantasy narrative, and if we express doubt we are abused and shamed and punished for our free thought. That is the world we presently live in. Children are being actively and deliberately brainwashed in school to hate themselves if they are white, or to hate white children if they are black.</p>

<p>That&#39;s standard government policy today. It&#39;s war on Christianity, war on religion in general, war on white people, and especially war on anyone who thinks independently and doesn&#39;t accept the narrative of cultural Marxism.</p>
