        UPDATE

       : Wrote to the mods on advice from others and just got this message back:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It looks like you got caught up in a vote brigade, but upon further investigation it looks like you were not part of it. Thanks for writing in so promptly. I've unbanned your account.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not quite sure what "vote brigade" I would have been a part of. At least they answered. I am not going to dive into a whole new rant, but I will say that the whole banning situation still seems super sketchy to me.

       What can we do to push this viral on the Internet at large? Anybody have contacts with other (presumably independent) media outlets? It's a good story.

       edit: Would make a good basis for a short video documentary, or supporting material for a longer expose of how the Internet is being corrupted.

       Yeah, its freaking insane really. In over 6-7 years on the website, I have never been shadowbanned. And I have been going against the grain like it is my job for at least the last 2.5 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have even made two other "How Reddit Was Destroyed" posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       My conclusion is that the admins have gotten quicker. Or maybe I was reported by someone.
      </p>

       This is definitely very brazen. Good thing I don't give a fuck and will now scream about this to the ends of the Earth. So they rolled the dice and lost. I will not be intimidated by this shit.

       If you're not intimidated you'll notice that eventually you'll start having a little mob of people follow you around in different subreddits and they'll comment on your posts about how you're a doxxer or something else designed to defame you.

       Yeah, that already happened to me on one of my previous accounts. One of the reasons that I now make new accounts frequently. Some of the PM's I was getting were scary. Also, someone made a dummy account that would follow me from thread to thread, for weeks.

       My first case of censorship was in
       <a href="/r/games">
        /r/games
       </a>
       , when that girl wanted to become the official
       <a href="/r/games">
        /r/games
       </a>
       interviewer. I linked to one of her youtube videos, which was her and her friends being "funny". It was pure cringe. I posted the video, because I thought everyone should know the type of person who would be representing
       <a href="/r/games">
        /r/games
       </a>
       . I didn't get banned from the sub. I didn't get shadow banned. I got
       <strong>
        IP banned
       </strong>
       . I didn't even know that was a thing!
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically what happened was that every time I tried to log in, it said my password was wrong. If I made a new account, it would automatically do the same thing. Once I changed my IP, the problem was solved, unless I tried to log into any account that was made under the old IP. If I did, the problem returned, and any new account from the new IP, was now linked to the old IP, and would be automatically banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this because I linked her youtube page, and made the comment that "I do not want this person representing
       <a href="/r/games">
        /r/games
       </a>
       ". Wowza!
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I just want to point out that I don't think the girl had anything to do with it. I mean, I can give her the benefit of the doubt. I have no problem calling out the mods, though.

       Hmm, it was a while back. Basically, during one E3, this girl (forget her name, she's somewhat known, I believe her dad invented the lightsabre) did interviews at E3 (I beleive) for
       <a href="/r/games">
        /r/games
       </a>
       . Later on she started a thread where she put forth the proposition that she become the official interviewer for
       <a href="/r/games">
        /r/games
       </a>
       . Basically representing
       <a href="/r/games">
        /r/games
       </a>
       . The "cringe" video(s), which were of her and her friends desperately trying to be funny in front of a camera for hours on end, were posted on her youtube page, the same one where she would post the
       <a href="/r/game">
        /r/game
       </a>
       interviews. It should be pretty easy to track down her page on reddit, but I'm on a phone, and I can't really properly search for it right now.

       Oh, I remember her.  Her dad is a special effects guy (won an Oscar for Spider-Man 2) and last I saw she was dating Chris Hardwick (she posted a couple of pictures of her and her "boyfriend" which was clearly Chris Hardwick).  I have no idea if they are still dating or if this comment is even relevant in any way at all.

       Yep, that's the one. I remember a lot of comments being removed. A comment graveyard due to "sexism". Honestly though, I don't think this was the girls doing at all. It seems far more likely that it would be the white knight mods, trying to "protect" her.

       No, she didn't. And I honestly don't even think it was her doing. Though I don't know for sure, and I don't want to start shit, but I do believe it was the Mods trying to "protect" her.

       only other info they have is all the cookies and tracking cookies and the your IP. We can test it, if you still have the banned account, tell everyone what the user name and password and we can all get ourselves banned. Or delete all your cookies or install a new browser that you haven't used before and try loggin in using the old banned accounts? I can't think of any other tests at the moment

       oh well, you know for next time. Most uni's and businesses now use the same IP for everyone in that building or institution sometimes whole ISP's users might appear as a single user. Which is why I say it's a stupid idea to IP ban people but I'm sure it still happens. I reckon it might have been a cookie though, it might not even have been a reddit cookie. You can test by deleting all your cookies (but it will mean you have to relog in to all your websites) (or you can use private mode in firefox)

       I don't think linking to a YouTube page counts as doxing. She had also already given out a lot of personal information in her post. Also he wasn't shadow banned, he was ip banned.

       You're allowed to give out your contact information, etc, in a post if it's relevant and unnecessary. That's very different from someone else posting your personal info/webpage/email/anything without your permission. I could see someone get IP banned for doxing before. I've had the admins check multiple accounts' IPs and ban people before for doxing me, so yeah, it's understandable.

       Posting a link to publicly available content, designed with the intention of having random people give it views, isn't even fucking close to doxxing.  If they didn't want people to see the videos, they should've been private.  There's no such thing as a "personal" Youtube page.  It's not designed to backup your videos... it's designed to share your videos with the world.  Calling linking to those videos doxxing is retarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       She could also go back and make the videos private or take them down... if it's a problem, she's at fault here, not this guy.

       Yeah the difference here is that you didn't post your likeness and full name in your post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doxxing is providing personal information that wouldn't otherwise be available.  Obviously if I posted your Facebook page, it would be doxxing, since people now have access to your name, which they didn't have before.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you post your fucking full name and videos of yourself, and someone finds your dumbass Youtube page, it's not doxxing.  People who want to be public figures generally consider this free promotion...
      </p>
      <p>
       They're so obviously far from the same thing that I can't help but feel you're intentionally being dishonest with your argument.  Nobody could realistically both type coherent english, and think those two situations are anywhere close to equivalent.

       Unless the person provided the Youtube channel link, you wouldn't be allowed to post it. It would be doxing, and you would get banned. Feel free to message the admins and ask. It's not my problem if you don't understand the Reddit rules.

       Whether or not reddit admins would action your account doesn't dictate the definition of a word. Just means reddit admins are fucking idiots.  Nobody is saying you wouldn't get banned, we're saying you would get banned and the admins would be in the wrong.   Obviously.  That's what the comment were replying to is kind of about.   This is such a fucking stupid reply.  Your arguments are terrible and your tone is insufferably cuntish, so we're done now. Later.

       Falling into personal insults is a pretty tacky way to argue your point, don't you think? :) It doesn't matter if it's "right" or "wrong." This is a private website run by the admins and you must follow their rules. No posting personal information of other users, period.

       Nah. I only delete comments when they get low enough that hivemind downvoting begins. It also lessens the number of people the admins have to ban because having a highly visible highly downvoted comments leads some users to send harassing PMs which are a bannable offense.

       Sometimes just random hate-mail like "Go Kill Yourself" etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       I got a string of one-sentence threats like "Stop what you are doing." Or "I can't be held responsible for what happens next", stuff that I honestly just assumed were conspiratards trolling me, but then I noticed at least 5 different accounts that went to usernames with long histories (3+ years) but no comments or submissions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then I got some just plain weird ones, like real psycho shit. Stuff I cannot even remember because of how weird it was. Once again, could just be harmless trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then someone made an account called "Says.hi.to.(my username)" and they followed me around for about 2 months just saying "hi" after every post. At first I laughed it off but then it just started creeping me out, like it was a subtle "you are on our list now and we will watch everything you do".
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a good thing that I was already on alternate accounts by that point. One of the main reasons I originally deleted my main 5+ year account. Because I realized that people could dig around in my history and make a pretty good guess about where I worked, they could have reverse image searched submission I made with my personal art, and been directed to my facebook etc...

       Many people do. They just don't want people to snoop around what they have posted before. For instance, I have a friend who found out my username, he then went and looked at my posting/comments history. I don't want anyone I know to read that.

       This, this, a thousand times this. Causing stress is far more effective than a direct attack. And it is why the people who make a real difference often appear a little odd (e.g. Julian Assange): only the ones who don't fit in can survive the pressure.

       Don't forget death threats. If anyone has actual numbers for how many death threats are actually followed up on I'd love to see it. Seems like in most cases it's just a way for people who should be dealing with some blame and accountability to go into hiding. Not very many of these threats have been actually verified.

       Lots of people have threatened to kill me on the internet.

       'Uhh ooook..' and I move on.

       People lie and make false claims on the internet. It's what the internet is best known for. This shouldn't excuse the inexcusable.

       When I get home from work I'll post a perfect example of this. I pissed of the wrong people I guess. Got -570 downvotes on a single comment. I made it clear I didn't care, and in no uncertain terms asked for more downvotes. Quite by accident I discovered a few days later my entire comment history was clearly nuked. Things I said weeks ago that had been at positive votes were suddenly at crazy downvote levels. I still don't care, so they wasted their time. It was just funny actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/punchablefaces/comments/2xxiad/these_two/cp4nlzz?context=3">
        Here
       </a>
       is the initial comment I made. It's currently at over -600 something downvotes. As you will see, after I first noticed it was getting downvoted (at about -5) I made an intentionally dickish comment. I expected the downvotes to go to about -20ish...whatev...
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/we_kill_creativity/?count=300&amp;amp;after=t1_cp5f60i">
        Here
       </a>
       is where you can see the before and after of my comment history. That comment starts about halfway down. Everything after that is horribly downvoted. Like I said, I have very little pride tide up into my reddit comment history, but it's interesting to see how it happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 2: Hmmm...When I first noticed the downvoting I stopped looking after going back a couple pages in my history. I guess it stops shortly after that, but if you take a look you can clearly see what I described.

       That's crazy.  When i was IP banned, someone messaged me the real name of someone (not even sure if it was a real name), then must have messaged the admins about "doxxing".  I never replied to that message but didn't delete it so needless to say the admins went into my messages, saw that one, and shadowbanned me lol.  I guess it's an easy way to get rid of someone you don't like.

       Oh yeah, and they know it.  I was followed into benign subreddits too like cabin porn and cascadia lol.  the best is when you get randomly banned because they message the mods (owned mods i guess) about it.  "you've been banned from
       <a href="/r/xxxxx">
        /r/xxxxx

       because you posted elsewhere about the holocaust"

       Meh...it didn't really phase me. I think they do it more to make an example out of you to intimidate other people. If they're doing it to you it's probably largely because they know you don't give a shit.

       Always remember, there's a shit ton of lurkers on here, people who don't even have accounts. That's who these bastards are playing to. You've made your decisions on this website. They're trying to affect the people who are still making theirs.

       That's crazy....i've had similar things happen but not to that extent.  Almost always i'd be able to trace down that my comment was linked in one of the tard subs or SRD.  Not direct link, just a print screen but they were still diligent enough to track down the comment en masse and downvote

       Those subreddits (tumblrinaction etc.) honestly make me cringe, entire subreddits dedicated to shaming people publicly or making fun of people because they are different. They do nothing to further the discourse or change peoples minds they just feed into the same type of hatred as racism.

       Comparing what those subreddits do to "racism" is flawed. You can't change your race, but you sure as hell can change your misguided, irrational beliefs.

       Fair that it may be a flawed comparison, but making fun of people and shaming them is what kids do in highschool, it doesn't do anything towards convincing people they may be wrong, if anything it will entrench people in their beliefs and put up barriers towards dialogue.

       The subreddits are shaming their beliefs, not the people who hold the beliefs. Important distinction. (Note: I'm only talking about tumblrinaction)
      </p>
      <p>
       "if anything it will entrench people in their beliefs and put up barriers towards dialogue."
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people on the other side don't even want a dialogue. They don't care about facts, they don't care about logic, they only care about what they feel is right.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to realize that. I've seen tumblr folks label FACTS as racist. You just can't have a dialogue with some of them. They don't play by the same rules.

       Yea that sub used to be about crass, insulting, non politically correct jokes that were funny. Now it just seems like its full of teenagers who are trying way too hard to be edgy and the only thing they know is racism.

       I'm all for making fucked up jokes, including racist ones if the times right, but pointless racism is just that and it gets really old really fast.

       Fatpeoplehate is run by an abused homosexual with severe abuse issues himself. He mocks fat people because he's been abused all his life and fat people have no defence it's like a child abusing the dog because his parents abuse him.

       I checked them out and I am not sure they are any better. Seems to me they are going to have (if they don't already have) the same issues in a very short period of time. Maybe before the exit alpha even.

       Adam Curry at No Agenda has also been banging the internet censorship hard lately, and this may fit in with his angle as well.

       It is terrifying actually. Reddit was (what I thought) once a great place for free discussion and sharing of thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it is repetitive memes, celebrity endorsement and unbalanced voting. There is even an approximation that it is worth $240 million from the increased popularity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people have died for far less than that. There is an agenda at play now and anyone that stands in its way has to face the almighty shadowban

       The same could be said for the Internet at large. I feel like we have a limited window of opportunity to get the word out that the public is being manipulated on a
       <em>
        massive
       </em>
       scale. AI is starting to take hold, and when it gets good we are screwed.

       Whelp...I'm not sure but if you can prove that reddit investors and or 'customers' (i use this loosely, meaning an entity that writes checks to reddit or parents) are US Government, then you might be able to prove that reddit is in fact a public forum.  And public forums have rules.  Like first amendment rules.

       It demonstrates how reddit is being massively manipulated. Could lead to a discussion of manipulation in other forums and the implications, how it fits into the propaganda machine.

       Idk, I've always felt like usually this kind of thing is more than likely due to some personal issue between OP and mods. A lot of them do seem to feel pretty self important but ultimately I'm not sure anything that happens on this site should really matter to anyone but those personally involved. If it is being manipulated then so what? I've always seen that there's general fuckery afoot in our gov't and media but I just don't think the "rabbit hole" is is very deep In most cases. Is it just that I don't apply the term conspiracy as widely as many people here may do or what? What am I missing? Isn't just being aware that the governments national interest seems to be to create a global empire and the majority of media is entirely subjective and toeing some party line? I don't see any sweeping change in awareness, consciousness or even caring happening in society besides as things stand nothing short of a massive violent revolt would probably change anything anyway right?

       You canj bring up any issues with Reddit on a ton of different subs, theres even subs with only admins as mods where they see messages from users. Also.. we've seen many issues about reddit brought up through

       isn't exactly something you need to see on 'the front page of the internet', people newly visiting the site wouldn't understand anything in
       <a href="/r/circlejerk">
        /r/circlejerk

       . default subs have a reason for existing, most people who use reddit OFTEN/are experienced either have their own list of subs they use or they use
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       . Default subs are like an intro to the site. It's not a controversy.

       not sure what your point is with this. You can post as much as you want.. but certain subreddits have limitations to how often you can post unless you have x amound of karma within that sub. There's no controversy there.

       funny how this post is near the top of

        /r/all

       , and multiple times videos submissions/other submissions about corruption of reddit admins/ceo/etc have been on front page as well. Front page is decided on how popular x thing is at x time. Default subs will have a push because they are default subs.. people who just start using the site will see that stuff first. It's Always been like that.

       yeah.. voat.co is still there and it got hugged to death with its 'became popular overnight'. Maybe reddit DDoSed it, or maybe a bunch of idiots did, or maybe a ton of people visited the site in a short amount of time. All you did was link to voat.co and to an article thats completely unrelated. Did the guy who runs VOAT.CO some out and say anything official about it? k

       yes it was. Reddit destroys itself by design. The more people that come into it and the more popular it gets the more you will dislike it and it will slowly wither itself away from what you liked about it at first. Remember, over half the users will be nearing mental retardation in IQ - since it's one of the most popular sites in the world right now it reaches the General Audience. The people that watch all the shitty TV shows that have no substance, the people that read magazines and not books, the people that browse Buzzfeed 24/7.

       I'm sure you have some points in there that mean something, but it is taken way out of proportion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, when I click your profile that was banned/doesn't exist - the user is still there with recent submissions. Also, Voat.co is up and getting more traffic than it did before the blow up.. it's not like it will become the #1 thing ever overnight.

       I would never ask for upvotes, but I really wonder what would happen if this post also went viral.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone know if they can shadow-ban your IP address?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it sucks that my mind starts to get super paranoid and then I start thinking what else they are capable of. Reddit obviously is one of the biggest and most powerful web-forums in history. To protect that, they would do anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't want to get a knock on my door, my computer confiscated, and then suddenly they find "child-porn" or some other nonsense. It really sucks that I even have to consider if that is possible.

       Yep, they can shadowban by IP. Fortunately, using Tor browser lets you circumvent their tiny-dicked Nazi moderators, and the worst bans they can throw out.

       I've been shadowbanned a few times now. They can't stop the signal.

       edit: ok that's not exactly what it is as far as i can tell, some clients open their ip to be used as vpn, and all the clients can go through it. There seems to be 2 weeks of logging by default too. This is still dangerous imo but i could be missing something.

       Not sure if you're going for sarcastic or funny, but you're not doing well at either. A proxy might do in a pinch, but many forums and sites that allow comments go out of their way to block proxy traffic, and with good reason. Proxies, transparent or anonymous are used by so many human and automated spammers that it's just easier to block them where possible. Very few ISPs these days force the use of a proxy, so the chances of blocking legitimate traffic are low.
      </p>
      <p>
       Proxies won't provide any of the other benefits to privacy that VPNs do. Evading forum bans is the most trivial of VPN uses. VPNs are not slow for web content, either.

       Neither. Just the facts Ma'am.

       For the above mentioned purpose, getting around bans, a proxy is every bit as good, and comes a less resource penalty than a vpn. You don't even need to bother installing special software to use them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never said vpns aren't 'good', just given the situation, not as good, for the same reasons tor is not as good as a vpn.
      </p>
      <p>
       No doubt though, the merits of a vpn are much over rated, and flat out false.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt very much that the powers that be are unable to see what you are doing just because you've installed some software that you did not write, likely could not write, have no idea how it works, and depends on some strangers website/server for 'security'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is, the only way you will ever be secure it to design and manufacture all the components for a computer yourself, assemble them, write all of the code that will execute on the computer your self, and connect only to a network that you have complete control of.

       I got shadowbanned on my original account and I don't even know why. I didn't post anything that was "anti-reddit" or conspiratorial. Mods/Admins are just on a power trip. Really  frustrating since I had that account since 2008.

       You can always reset your modem/router, and have new ip addresses issued. With my particular router, i have to leave it off for about 5 minutes before i can turn it on and have a new ip. This resets your local and public ip.

       Yes, but any settings for the router will also be reset. Any port forwarding will be gone. If the Wi-Fi password was changed from the default, any wireless devices will be disconnected.  IMO it's less of a hassle to just turn off the router for a few minutes.

       Or even dymanic IPs can be set to only change every so often, even if you reset or try to renew.  I think Comcast will just give me the same exact IP if I reset, but like next month I'll have a new IP issued.

       They can ban any IP they want. They don't know if it's static or dynamic. What I'm saying is they (Reddit) can ban an IP but, if dynamic, the ban would only be effective until it is recycled and some poor schmuck gets the banned IP while the intended recipient of the ban gets a new IP that isn't banned.

       I don't think you understand rhetorical statements. Yes, they can ban IPs. No it would not be an effective method of banning someone. Yes, they still do ban IPs (hence why this thread exists).

       A rhetorical statement is one that is made with rhetoric; ie an appeal to emotion or character.  I think you're thinking of rhetorical question.

       Instead of quoting the first line of the dictionary, you should look up the word rhetoric. It doesn't always appeal to emotion.

       Rhetorical statement does not mean "a statement made without meaning to elicit a response".  That's just a statement.

       Not appealing to emotion != "without meaning to elicit a response". A statement, much like a question, can be rhetorical. Except that it isn't a question, just rhetoric. But if makes you shut up, then sure, you're right or whatever.

       It's possible, but these days it's rare to see IP bans on any websites/services (unless for region restriction) because IP bans are not really practical - many users may use the same IP like at a school, so banning one person using that IP would ban the several other innocent users, and also persistant users would use proxies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The popular thing lately is mobile verification (mostly found on asian websites). Banning phone numbers is a lot more practical because it's more difficult for a person to obtain a new phone number than it is for them to obtain a new IP, also only 1 user can register using the same phone number.

       OP claims "the cowards didn't even tell me they banned me". That is 100% the entire point of being shadowbanned. It was designed for spammers and other people like trolls, CP peddlers, vote cheaters etcetera. The idea is that they don't know they are banned, so they won't create a new account and do more rule breaking shit. Of course the admins will not tell you. Then there's his post from the other day:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        1) The first thing they did was take away r/reddit.com.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you had any concerns about the website as a whole, you could address them through r/reddit.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You still can. Seriously. Go to
       <a href="/r/reddit.com">
        /r/reddit.com
       </a>
       and you'll see. The only thing you can't do is post there. If you message the mods, you are contacting the admins. That is literally how you speak to them.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        2) The power now resided in individual subreddits, obviously the most popular ones. There was a power grab to become moderators of these subreddits.

       <p>
        I remember as the upcoming election loomed, all of a sudden, r/circlejerk (one of the old default subreddits) became completely obsessed with bashing Ron Paul. I am not even a RP supporter, but that was definitely orchestrated, and NOT by some kids trying to be funny. Also, it coincided perfectly with this highly suspicious campaign to filter him out of the election.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You can do it too! Ever noticed that button on the side of the frontpage that says "create your own subreddit"? It's really that easy. As for 'power mods', those who have control over a large number of subs, ask yourself: you need mods for your subreddit that has millions of subscribers. Who do you recruit, the guy who's been on reddit for 6 months with no mod experience, or the 4 year power user with experience modding defaults? Gee, I wonder. There's no secret cabal, it's just getting the best man for the job.
      </p>
      <p>
       And with
       <a href="/r/circlejerk">
        /r/circlejerk
       </a>
       going apeshit over Ron Paul, blame the users. They're the ones who post the shit. Look to 4chan, as most of the childish shit on here comes from there.

        I remember when r/IAma was open to anyone and the popularity was decided by voting. Now it is nothing more than a cheap place for celebrities to whore out their products and you need to be "approved". Someone named Victoria is involved and how does that makes any sense whatsoever? Celebrities have entire teams of branding/PR/social media teams that work for them. Why do they need to be at reddit HQ and/or required to have a reddit rep? Because these AMA's are extremely organized and sponsored with money.

      <p>
       Maybe because mods do far too much to announce every single thing we do. And why the hell would we announce it anyway? If we automate rule enforcement and tell people how, they will just find a way to work around it. "Oh, but Streisand effect, the users will find out, you can't hide it forever". Trust me when I tell you, for every secret mod action you find out about, there are a shit ton more that you don't. And they're not evil. Most of them are word/phrase removal, like f***** or n*****. A lot of subs auto remove those, because who wants to see that shit?

        All of a sudden new accounts started popping up out of nowhere. Cue the birth of r/HailCorporate. "Feel good" military posts started appearing, like a soldier coming home to his dog. New users entered AMA's to lob softball questions "Mr Burns, your campaign has the momentum of a runaway freight train, how does it feel to be so popular?" From brand new accounts that never posted again.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Maybe because it takes less than 30 seconds to create an account. And the AMA thing has been debunked so many fucking times it's insane. Celebrity Bob is doing an AMA. Bob posts on twitter to let his fans know. Bob's fans come to reddit, create an account to ask their idol a question, then are never seen again because reddit is not a site they use. It doesn't take a brain surgeon to use that kind of logic. As for shills, are there any? Has there ever been? Probably. Reddit gets over 150
       <em>
        million
       </em>
       unique visitors every month. What company wouldn't try to exploit that? In those cases, they receive the aforementioned shadowban, that you all think is so nasty.

        What ever happened to letting people vote on the content of this website? Trash tabloids constantly go viral on political subreddits due to sensationalized headlines and the fact that most Americans are unaware of different overseas publications.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not to mention the fact that default subreddit rules are now completely refined, sophisticated and purposely worded to allow maximum mod-interpretation. Honestly, someone with a law degree with a proud.
Major politically-charged subreddits now insist on exact titles or quotes because that stops users from being able to post the important point summary of the article as the title . Using only official titles from only approved media has turned reddit into mainstream media.

       happened. That sub was a testament to what happens when the users are allowed to decide content.
       <br/>
       And the reason the titles are required  to be the same as the article is to stop sensationalist and false titles being posted, because most redditors won't read the article, only the thread title. If it's wrong, they don't get the correct info, do they?

       Try reading that guy's post. It's hilarious how fucking stupid he is. "People can make requests for my sub, whatever will I do to get it back?" I dunno, maybe request it yourself you fucking spanner. There's also the fact that mods cannot shadowban. Only admins can. So he's pissed them off somehow. Most likely from posting things that get removed.

       Most likely because an accusation like that would get those problem doxxed. Everyone knows how reddit loves to play Batman (Boston bombing anyone?). Make them think someone might be a shill and they'll

       OP is quite literally arguing that reddit's part in the Boston bombing debacle that I just mentioned was a good thing. You want to take advice from someone this fucking stupid?

       As I said before, 150 million visitors a month. I wouldn't be surprised if some of them did it. Or one. There was a while ago when reddit was DDoSed by one guy so bad that the site was screwed for days

       I thought the entire point behind a conspiracy theory is having insider info that others aren't aware of? OP doesn't have inside knowledge, he has a lack of it. Pretty much everything I refuted I was able to in less than 5 seconds by thinking about it. OP is a moron.

       This happened to
       <a href="/r/knives">
        /r/knives
       </a>
       .  Someone posted a knife and the mods banned it for some reason. Then the entire reddit community caught wind of it and posted the same knife picture and flooded
       <a href="/r/knives">
        /r/knives
       </a>
       with that same pic.  The mods were scrambling trying to delete them all.  They finally gave up and said "we get it"... they also made the sub private for a while.  Not sure if they ever apologized.  But the Streisand was in full effect that day.

       Please upvote this to the top. Reddit is such a great vehicle for change (for both public and private entities) and the members still adhere to that "grassroots" mentality. We have the necessary members and platform right here on the site. The owners of this site NEED to realize that there lots of people who see right through all this....bull shit.

       hah no worries! My reply was useless Reddit snark. It's an advanced european country with a reasonably strong record on human rights =], so potato/potato

       your point about not being in the US rings true but is so depressing. I guess it's a mark that you're old when you say "it's not the country it used to be", even though i'm only in my 20s.

       Yeah... but at least you guys seem to be a half-step behind us on the march to neo-con crazyland... we're developing this funky police-corporate-libertarian state fusion that's so incredibly weird and stupid that it defies all credulity
      </p>
      <p>
       Case in point: the 2/3 ruling party is in favor of expanding uranium mining in an area directly adjacent to the grand canyon. arguably the greatest American icon, regardless of party affiliation. That, to me, is maybe the most emblematic thing that's happening in the country related to the 'tea party' fervor. they control the population and sell everything to the highest bidder.

       True, we're not quite as batshit crazy here govt-wise and I hope it stays that way. Nothing short of a mass refusal to pay taxes, boycotting voting and a country-wide general strike is going to sort America out any time soon.

       At the very least you would want to limit a mods powers. Instead of a delete, they can flag a post with the corresponding rules violation and it shows up under a "rules broken" tab. Plus none of this shadow crap - if banning exists, the banned list should be a public part of the sub.

       Voat doesn't use the same code as Reddit... it's all custom coded. There are tons of features on Voat that do not exist on Reddit.

       I think their biggest issue they will need to overcome is the similar UI and educating the public that it's not based off of Reddit's code...

       If you have no experience/knowledge on servers, please do not respond. If you are running a windows server, running C#, you are asking to be hacked. This right here proves that I will not join voat, sorry. Windows == backdoors and hacking. Windows is a hackers wet dream. This shit should be on a linux server, written in either PHP, Ruby, or Python. Take your pick. Windows is a joke, and this site will be hacked by those who want to shut it down.

       Nice attack, what is the difference of linux and windows? How do you setup a server on linux, mainly port 80? What is difference? What is the root dir of linux and what is the root of windows? Does windows require a fee and is linux open source and free? What is a server on windows? How do you run PHP, python or ruby on windows? Fail to answer  10 mins, you are googling it and a shmuck.

       If you give up here you're giving them what they want.  They want you to go away.  It makes their jobs easier and it's exactly why they do what they are doing.  To drive you away.  Take it as a badge of honor.  And don't quit.  I'm not saying don't go to other sites but you shouldn't give up here.  I've posted in the past about this sub and moving on from it but really we should stick it out and not let them win.  No matter how much they want to discredit everyone here as racists and bigots and whatever other tricks they try to steer people away we should stay and prove them wrong.   Debate their propaganda with our own.

       Why do you want to stay here? It's a website. It is not permanent. It's not some historic building that means something. It's a shitty website owned by some faceless corp.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would you want to stay here and "fight?" When that just gives them more power. Every page view, every visitor, every comment is money to these people. Reddit is too far gone to be what it once was. The only way to change reddit is to leave. If you leave this website, and every one else does, it's useless. What's a website with no visitors?
      </p>
      <p>
       People take this website way too seriously. It's a website. It's not a country, it's not a government. It's something that could be gone tomorrow if the users decided they no longer like it. This is just a window to the Internet to me, it is not a fighting ground. It means nothing because there will be hundreds more after which will do the same. Think about digg and MySpace or xanga or....
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop putting so much into this website. It's just a page of the internet. You give them more power by thinking it's more than it is. "Fighting" gives them what they want! Page views and visitors is all reddit cares about because that is money.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it odd that people complain about reddit here on their website and are surprised by bans and what not. It's a website. They can do whatever they want. It's not a democracy. Open yours eyes and see what this is.

       I disagree with this. They fight us because they want to drown out the information. So, us leaving, is the ultimate victory.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right that this is just a website. But it's the biggest community/news aggregator, we shouldn't let anyone bully us away and then assume that everyone will follow. It's far more likely that only a small portion will leave and the majority will stay and be more susceptible to all the bullshit in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't feed the trolls, simple as that, just pile on the links, evidence, information. In a sense, do as politicians do, don't answer questions, but say what
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       want the discussion to be about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that these shills don't believe the official story, they just don't care either way.. Treat them like the bots that they are and just focus on all the good people that are still out here, there's plenty of people with an open mind who are happy to start a normal discussion.

       Communities come and go. How much of a community is there if more than half are bots &amp; paid accounts (marketers, shills, corporate interests, "celebrity" accounts, politicians, the list goes on, etc). How much of this community do you really know? How do you know half the commenters here are genuine? Do you really think the shills care about some no-name comment on the internet? Most of the comments here are bought and paid for (as is the karma). Your opinions don't mean much when the person behind the screen isn't reading what you're saying.

       Do I think they care? Yes. Otherwise they wouldn't be here.  And it is making a difference.  When a front page reddit sub posts about pesticides causing cancer from a respectable scientific study they care.  It's viewed by thousands and they come back the next day and attack that study and any dissenters with their obvious brigades.  Corporations do this and have money invested in doing this to save face.  If they are going to shill on this site then I'm going to anti-shill on this site.

       now that reddit has gotten more mainstream, they want to kick out the original redditors who have that certain mindset. Now there's buzzfeed people here who can't think for themselves.. and this is what current reddit wants to keep.

       What the fuck world do you live in? They want the user base to leave? it's a business, the more traffic they get the more money they make.
      </p>
      <p>
       Censorship? You're laboring under the delusion that reddit exists solely to provide you an outlet to speak... it's OWNED by a business and they can control whatever they want in it.  It's not like they're reaching into your personal conspiracy filled site to shut you down, you're using their fucking site that they make money on to bash on them.  That's the same thing as Muslim terrorists using Twitter to criticise western countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hypocritical, no one owes you shit and if you want to say whatever you want without anyone being able to police you then go create your own forum.  Honestly if the lack of transparency on a fucking privately owned internet forum is the worst of your problems then you're pretty fucking well off...

       We need an alternative that can't be easily compromised. That's the tough part. Maybe something distributed, where nobody could gain too much power. One problem with that would be spam, it would be a magnet for spam. Still, a distributed model would have some advantages, such as not being beholden to any individual owner or host. It could also limit the damage that a bad actor could do. Such a system would allow for anyone to easily clone an existing "sub", which would mean no more than a name change while preserving content. It would be simple to allow anyone to back up data of interest, and republish as necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously, I'm just spitballing here, but I think we need a different
       <em>
        kind
       </em>
       of system than reddit. It's a failed model due to its vulnerability to corruption.

       Reddit is open source.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the code, disable the vote fuzzing and other things that lie about data, and host it. Possibly on TOR so you would be free to not delete
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       . But subreddits still need a way to stop their content from going to shit. Possibly have every single post show up in
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       and the subreddit it was posted to, and if it's deleted it just shows up in
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all

       Personally, I still think reddit's codebase is fine as it is. Also, they switched languages (maybe when it was a lot smaller) before, so switching again would give a chance to go over all the code and see what it does. But I like python, so I have no problem with it as it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I would like to see is image/video/misc data hosting inbuilt into the website, instead of relying on outside content. A lot harder to take down that way, and more anonymous. Would use a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of disk space thougAll they will find is that I'm an anime watching, 24/7 computer gaming nerd.h, text compresses a hell of a lot better than
       <del>
        dank memes
       </del>
       images.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what do you do about illegal content? You can either host it on TOR (and only on TOR) and have hardly anyone use it, but you wouldn't be forced to take down anything, or you can host it normally but you will have to take down illegal content.

       To each there own, I mean the code is fairly simple. I would rebuild it with PHP, but why not just start from scratch based on "how it works".

       That is the problem, how the hell do you handle that. Which is why it makes it risky running a site like this without a team of lawyers. They could litigate you out of business, sigh....

       I hardly think any team of lawyers would help you when someone's posting CP to the front page, and you're refusing to hide or delete it in any way. You HAVE to get rid of it. Or hide the server on TOR.

       Oh definitely, that is what I worry about when I think of maybe creating an alt to reddit. Obviously the site would have to, and I'm all for taking down THAT content. Also, I don't think TOR is the right way to go, because it limits the user base. It would have to be on the regular web, not deep web.

       I think someone could make a slippery slope argument, in that you'll just start censoring stuff you don't like if you start removing anything, but 4/8/whatever chan does it quite well, in that anything that could get the website taken down is removed, and that's it.

       It doesn't work because the-powers-that-be or some jokers immediately spam a new site with CP and the like, thus begins the need for advanced moderation. It evolves from there owing largely to humans being involved and not being able to handle power.

       It is my understanding that not being informed about having your account shadow banned is part of being shadow banned. You are not supposed to know that you are invisible and impotent, because if you know this you will make a new account and continue your unwanted actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm curious to what do you think you wrote that actually made someone want to shadow ban you? I read your post and saw nothing that's actually news.

       Also, could it be that someone in power is part of the anti-conspiracy (not to be confused with anti-
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       ) and actually shadow banned you so that your original post, and by extension you, would get more visibility?

       According to the updated OP the mods responded to OPs message informing that he was banned because he had been mistakenly interpreted as being a part of a vote brigade. Since
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       is a sub where the No Participation bot gets consistently downvoted I'm willing to accept that this is indeed what happened.

       Shadowbanning is a reddit-wide thing that's supposed to exist to stop spammers.  You still see your posts, but nobody else can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moderators can still approve posts by someone who is shadowbanned and they will show up.
      </p>
      <p>
       What some moderators are doing, though, is having automoderator automatically delete posts by people they don't like.  It's even harder to detect, and is really shitty.

       I don't see why it's goldworthy or banworthy - all that shit's pretty much common knowledge in any meta sub.  The spin/interpretation of it is a bit extreme but, considering the sub, it's to be expected.

       It's pretty amusing that people are suddenly treating "censorship" as a bad thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been using this website for five years, and in that entire time the site-wide trend has been toward more and heavier moderation. And the reason is not because moderators somehow overrode the wishes of the population. Almost all of these decisions were extremely popular, and it's still quite common to see people request that various mods remove or ban even more posts than they do currently.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been against increased moderation for a long time. In my view, the voting system works perfectly fine without any interference, and people are always free to go to alternate subreddits or sites if they want to. However, this is apparently a minority opinion. It seems like most people are in favor of more censorship, as long as it only extends to posts they don't approve of.

       Reddit mods get a little bit of authority and they really feel they are something. I would even argue that most of them bring up offline that they are mods on this internet forum. This is how new the role is to them. I am telling you never look upon these "newbies" lest you become like them - hypocrites.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have no idea that they are blocking actual information while they abuse this authority. Truthfully most mods are blind. The reason for this is because they aren't mature and are unsure how to properly moderate or facilitate with this privilege.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't blame them as a whole but blame the ones who work and conspire together, we have been shown chat logs but still continue to use this site. No different than most do with Facebook at this point. We submit our voice in turn for these cheap services. There are cops who patrol and will show up at your door for what you say on here too. It's become the same concept. The blind are truly leading the blind but no real admission of it from them. They don't know what they are or where to begin as themselves, but remain comfortable with being a hypocrite.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trouble you all expect will come. Keep watch then against the world.

       As for me I will continue to use this site less and keep safe measure against the ones who I described, yeah, I will be at ytmnd.com

       The right way to deal with mod bias is to fork a community. You can thus route around moderation bias by subscribing to a set of subs, mixed to match your interests.

       I feel there is a confusion among this community.

      <p>
       Reddit has become corrupt and is as that.
      </p>
      <p>
       This could be because the user enjoys having a high tally of karma-points or being a member for a lengthy time. There are individuals who are mods in multiple sub-reddits, spread across this entire domain. Because of this, nothing is to change at this website. They have managed their desired traffic poorly. The persons who have made sub-reddits with specific names have only allowed specific posts.

       What is to happen is that the reddit community will divide itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, a possibility that a front page pinned post about 'fixing the issue' with no real fix as the problem remains embedded permanently. This is as good as it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       The smart will disconnect and the rest will see rejoice seeing their stories on CNN, FOX, etc

       There are certain sites that analyze reddit accounts. At least one of them maps hourly activity charts. Try plugging in some high profile users. They are active on strict 9-5 hours. Not a single post outside of those hours. The last one I noticed was probably working in Eastern timezone.

       Not saying that there aren't people paid to shill on Reddit. Probably a lot are, more than I can imagine. I mean, I have friends who are paid to tweet.
      </p>
      <p>
       But also most day jobs are boring, computer based, and have a lot of downtime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just sayin there's probably a lot of factors.

       But those sites sound awesome, do you have any links? Would love to check some accounts out (and my own). See how they compare.

       I worked on a fairly high profile senate campaign that got lots of national attention. The office I worked out of had 10-12 interns at any given time constantly posting and manipulating votes in an insane variety of subreddits. I'm pretty sure there were 5 other offices involved in this operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not gonna say what campaign I was on, but I will say this. I'd be very surprised if the DNC didn't have some kind of deal with Reddit. You don't just get the world's most powerful person to do an AMA without any strings attached.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering the politics of people like Alexis Ohanian, I'm sure it was something Reddit offered to do.

       I just read through all your comments on your conspiracy post and multiple times you violate the rules of reddit.

      <p>
       It is likely that you were banned because you violated the site wide rules.  You know you can message the admins and they will tell you why you were banned.

       You should probably either link or better yet screecap a few of those "rule violating" posts, because as it is this is just an unsubstantiated allegation. I'm not saying it's false, I'm saying it's unsubstantiated.

       No, that's backwards. We know for a fact that people get banned from Reddit all the time for perfectly ordinary reasons, and that sometimes they then lose their shit and post rants about a conspiracy to suppress them. We have no actual evidence that anyone has been banned from Reddit for their opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sensible thing to do when a rant like this is posted is to assume that OP was banned for vote manipulation etc and just has a martyr complex about it. It's on OP to demonstrate otherwise, no sensible person would waste time researching it themselves when the answer is so obviously more likely to be "yeah, they were banned for violating rules X, Y, and Z and making 10 different accounts to evade it."

       Ehm, no, it really isn't. I'm not asking AndyWarwheels to go out and read OP's comment history and post examples; I'm asking him,
       <em>
        since he's already gone through it
       </em>
       , to post some examples to substantiate what he says. I'm not putting an unreasonable or improper burden of proof on him, in fact I don't think he has a duty to do anything, but it's not wrong of me to ask.

       I've been around here for more than five years and have watched the slow decline in quality and big rise in censorship. I don't see the point in banning accounts unless they explicitly break rules such as calling for upvotes, spamming, or using social media to brigade. And even then I think there should be some sort of warning given. I have run across a number of people who got shadowbanned and they honestly had no idea why. I would go check it out and see they had posted to their blog too many times compared to their other engagement, or some shit like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a mod at
       <a href="/r/dreams">
        /r/dreams
       </a>
       I have invited members of the professional community to drop by the sub and share their knowledge, but I have to warn them about all kinds of "reddiquette" and have found it turns them off. "You can do this but you can't do that and if you do too much of this and that your ass will get banned and your soul eaten by Satan."
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Reddit is screwing itself. I mean, it'll still get all sort of traffic, which means revenue, but I think it's scaring away people with knowledge to share. If you read what founders like Aaron S. said about why they created the site, they wanted to create a community to share knowledge and information. But hey, George Clooney is doing an IAMA so fuck it.

       You have changed my perspective of this website (and the media, and governments and basically everything) completely. Just reading through all the tedium links in the posts, I have found that I am no longer going to be able to take ANYTHING at face any more. This seriously made me question the world I live in, and I thank you for provoking such thoughts.

       I thought this subreddit was for conspiracies, not people who got banned from a Website after complaining about it on that very same Website? I'm not saying it's right that they did that, but it's not exactly grassy gnoll/aliens-among-us/"Republicans are in league with the antichrist" material, is it?

       I'm not sure what all the fuss is about here. Is it shocking that the NSA or [insert government/subcontracted spying agency here] is heavily monitoring and censoring a massive and open internet site like Reddit? For fuck's sake, they've admitted to much, much worse. Absolutely EVERYTHING we do now is watched. The chips in your car, every CCTV, every device connected to the net or GPS...etc, etc, etc. I'm no conspiracy guy but it's not a conspiracy when it's in your face 24/7.

       You canj bring up any issues with Reddit on a ton of different subs, theres even subs with only admins as mods where they see messages from users. Also.. we've seen many issues about reddit brought up through

       not sure what your point is with this. You can post as much as you want.. but certain subreddits have limitations to how often you can post unless you have x amound of karma within that sub. There's no controversy there.

       , and multiple times videos submissions/other submissions about corruption of reddit admins/ceo/etc have been on front page as well. Front page is decided on how popular x thing is at x time. Default subs will have a push because they are default subs.. people who just start using the site will see that stuff first. It's Always been like that.

       yes it was. Reddit destroys itself by design. The more people that come into it and the more popular it gets the more you will dislike it and it will slowly wither itself away from what you liked about it at first. Remember, over half the users will be nearing mental retardation in IQ - since it's one of the most popular sites in the world right now it reaches the General Audience. The people that watch all the shitty TV shows that have no substance, the people that read magazines and not books, the people that browse Buzzfeed 24/7.

       I'm sure you have some points in there that mean something, but it is taken way out of proportion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, when I click your profile that was banned/doesn't exist - the user is still there with recent submissions. Also, Voat.co is up and getting more traffic than it did before the blow up.. it's not like it will become the #1 thing ever overnight.

       And by this time tomorrow everyone will have forgotten about all of this. Whomever is behind this is good, and is stopping us from stopping them. We keep letting these men behind the curtain go because nobody every follows through with trying to bust them. We figure if it doesn't directly effect us than we will be alright.

       Sorry to hear that, bro.  If it's any consolation, one does not really pop their r/conspiracy cherry until they get themselves shadow-banned.  ;-)   On the plus side, the term "shadow-banned" was like big-foot or the chupacabra around here about a year ago.  It was something people didn't really believe was happening or existed.

       That how things go in r/conspiracy.  The term "shadow-banned" use to be something no one talked about here.

       So yeah, go back in time a year and ask people around here about what the term means and you will get called crazy.

       He made a point of saying, in the other thread in a lower comment, that it's banned from appearing on the front page, for unsigned-in browsers (people who just open r/all but don't log in).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless Reddit is tracking cookies across browsers somehow, I just opened the
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all

       on a browser I have never logged in on, and it's current sitting there at #11.

       As far as the shills go, you should have seen the change in popular opinion when reddit decided that AlienBlue should have sponsored posts show up in the client, regardless of whether or not a user paid for pro.  One day, everyone up in arms.  Within 24 hours, those people are assholes because they just can't stand seeing a few ads!  Incredible.

       I completely agree with your take on the AMA subreddit.I used to love checking out ama for interesting stories about people's lives and what they have experienced. Now its just a whore sub for whatever celebrity wants to push shit down our throats , and don't even think about asking a controversial question because Victoria will be sure to ignore it on top of other good questions asked.

       That's messed up. I read your v 3.0 post when it was up. I commend you for your diligence! I've always doubted reddit, but you paint a clear picture that's easy to see. I wish I could help, and will when I can, but my reach is limited. Regardless, keep on keepin' on!!!

       So please tell me, what crimes were ekjp and yishan convicted of exactly? Because one needs to have committed a crime to be a criminal, which you'd know if you'd bothered to look up the definition like I said.

       Good argument! Have you considered a career in law by any chance? With such a strong grasp of rhetoric and legal definitions you're bound to go far. You should speak to your school's guidance counsellor.

       He's showing that reddit isn't what it is anymore. This website was designed for freedom of speech, posts, and all the like. It's clearly not that anymore. They're trying to control what we see. What see on in social media, which we use to get away from the ever controlling society that we live in.

       Ever since Aaron past away this website changed. I hope you see that.

       I see it as the mods upholding free speech. They claimed they banned him for vote brigading, which is taking away other users rights to free speech. When they found out he didn't do that, they unbanned him.

       I've secured several domains, some foreign.  I started combing through reddit's code offering, but it's too much for one person to validate.

       Just saying I'm going to try to create a safe, uncensored environment.  I live on a fixed income, but I have no interest in making money or selling ads and certainly not selling information.

       That said, how can anyone know they could trust my intentions?

       I'd be surprised if it were something so trivial. It's more likely that he's like the 8th consecutive alt account of someone who habitually breaks all the rules "to compensate for CIA vote manipulation" or whatever.

       Luckily I rarely walk those subreddits thats political-, news- or religion-orientated (etc), so I dont notice it much, BUT I do remember that there has been a few occations where I thought "wtf is going on" where like certain views (anti-climate change or similar) suddenly was mass-deleted (censored) by the mods. This shadowbanning of you, is an eyewakener though.. Something is definetely fishy here.

       Much respect for sacrificing your account to inform people. Thing is, only few must do so, the majority must stay calm and conscious to the situation, not spreading info but consuming it, keeping their cover, pretending to follow the stream. Otherwise there will once be nobody to inform people anymore.

       Can you post the raw comment to pastebin? the whole "how reddit was destroyed", raw with markdown, so we can make small changes (few bytes all over) and post in in various places.

       I know it's fun to hate on Reddit Admins in here, but let's get something straight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Users can be banned
       <em>
        automatically
       </em>
       . Reddit Admins don't have to bring down the banhammer manually. If a user gets too many reports, the user will get shadowbanned by the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       A simple, polite message to the admins can clear it up if you didn't actually break any rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is that if you broke rules, your account will remain banned, but if you didn't then it will come back.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that lots of
       <em>
        shills
       </em>
       probably reported your post and the user was automatically banned. If approached correctly, and if no actual rules were broken, the user will come back.

       Yep. completely dead. You sound like one of those wow players that claim every new game coming out is gonna be the 'wow killer' and claim it's so awesome. Only you still login to wow every day and you watch your friends go to this new game and after the free time is up, they all come back.

       It's the most single, childish thing that can happen to you on reddit. If some mod doesn't like what you are doing, you get banned...fair enough? Here comes the childish bit, they don't tell you. You will post like usual, think your posts are being read, when all the while nobody sees your posts. 
Some fat nerd is getting some pleasure out of this. Why on earth they can't let you know is beyond my understanding and I wish they'd stop doing it this way. Just let people know ffs.

       Either way, I choose to embrace my undeniable Sovereign Rights protected by Common Law and the like. Uncle Sam, and the government servants are number 2, and I am number One of The People. They can be creeps all they want, until one of my laws are broken. After all, they claim they are looking for terrorists, and that I am not. By the way, we all have these Sovereign Rights at birth, and are not required to be granted any rights as a Citizen slave. If we have excepted this, the choice has no requirements, and is interchangeable; as we may contract with; or not contract with who we choose. Our Rights to complete Freedom from damages from persons, or People never go away. No matter what propaganda you hear. Common Law rules Internationally. The new Statutes that are constantly created under The Constitution, are not laws; and do not apply or hold up under a 'legal' document that we are told is "the highest law of the land." (It isn't even signed by any one, like any legal document should.) It is a list of rights that The People already have, and a list of rights to the Servants of The People to uphold. So Live with Peace, but invoke your Rights, and your own Laws when needed, with consequences when they are violated. Never except any contract law with a reptile, unless it truly benefits you, and does not damage your freedom. "The People should not fear their Government, The Government should fear their People."

       It happens over and over again. As soon as it b becomes about making a profit all goes to shit.

       It just becomes a billboard which has to be kept clean. Advertise that game, that show that movie, that celeb.

       Other then that sites like reddit have no use for corporations.

       Having a good community. Discussing interesting subjects for their own sake. Mindless distraction without any hintergedanken because it's clear that what you see has been manipulated by money hungry cunts.
That's worthless. Grow up. The bottom line is profit.

       I lost a previous account because another moderator in a subreddit I had was friends with an admin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever I tried recovering the account the recovery email that I received would always expire when I tried to change the password. Messaged admins twice, posted to a few subreddits thinking it was a bug, and absolutely nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was frustrated but didn't think much of it until I talked to the other subreddit mod about it months later and he mentioned something suspicious about it.

       Wanted to add I saw this on the front page but its already gone.  Anyone have a good alternative?  I've been tired of Reddit's lackluster community for a while now.  All this aside, its just become populated with silly bullshit.  I enjoyed it when it was intellectual and techie far more.  I've been waiting for the next big thing for a while.

       To those who think that this is a string of anecdotes and assumptions sourced by other anecdotes and assumptions, and not proven yet, I'm right there with you. However the admins of Reddit have dug this hole themselves. The way they responded to this is because of a tumor of either corruption or incompetence in the administrative ranks.

       Other subs, often subs related to freedom in some way, have done the same, as well as used shadow banning, the most evil thing on the internet IMO, especially while pretending to be all about freedom.

I won't say anything more about that here though, except to say that there is a related sub, several actually, doing the same thing to the same specific group of people. And ya, shadow bans there too, if you dare speak up.

       I'm not commenting further off-topic. IDGAF about analogous situations or what have you. The fact is Reddit is a service. We are the product Reddit sales. If I want too argue about what Reddit is doing I will. And I can do it on Reddit or elsewhere. OP can take his inconsequential opinion and shove it. Because he can't do anything about it.

       I see a lot of people saying they want an alternative to reddit, and I see a lot of people saying we need to stay and fight, overwhelm the enemy, win by numbers.
I say we do stand and fight. But this needs to be an organized effort. If everyone works together to flood one sub with the same previously banned post, the mods may give up there. If we divide, we cannot overwhelm them by numbers like we all could together.
I also say we create new subs as alternatives to the major ones. Same themes, but keep them as under-the-radar as possible. When they begin to become regulated, fight back. It will have a smaller, tight-knit community full of people who are really dedicated to pushing back the regulations and shadow-bans and whatnot.
An Internet divided cannot win. We need to fight, and we need to fight TOGETHER. One post at a time, let's take the first step to taking back reddit.

       If you don't like the way reddit is now, just fuck off and find an alternative. Don't fuck this place in to a pile of shit on the floor on your way out.

        I say we do stand and fight. But this needs to be an organized effort. If everyone works together to flood one sub with the same previously banned post, the mods may give up there. If we divide, we cannot overwhelm them by numbers like we all could together.

       I know that this comment will go straight to the bottom, but w/e.

       Look, guys, the Internet is public property. Websites are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no such thing as an "abusive mod." If you're talking about the site owners, it's their site, and they can do whatever they want. You have no rights here, nor should you expect any.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like if you walked into someone's house, set down, and then demanded they cook you a meal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, to make it more relevant...it's like if you go into their house and start bitching about how strict they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you expect their reaction will be?
      </p>
      <p>
       A rational person would expect something like this, "Hey, get the hell out of my house, then."
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're talking mods of an individual sub...grow up. News flash:
       <em>
        You can make your own sub.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       With AutoModerator, a mod can set it up so that if you get negative karma in their sub, you get shadowbanned. It can all be automated. This is the only way they can fight trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        There is no conspiracy here. Don't poo all over other people's way of making money unless you want to be shown the door.  It's common sense. What's irrational is to complain about it on that same website.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time of this writing, this thread is 93% upvoted. So are you guys really such free thinkers? I see a lot of willful mob mentality here. Is it so unreasonable that Reddit would ban someone for trash talking their site
       <em>
        on
       </em>
       their site?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know no one will see this, since you guys are going to scuttle this comment, but I had to say my peace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peace out!

       Reddit died when it sold itself over to becoming left wing propaganda. Look at
       <a href="/r/Politics">
        /r/Politics
       </a>
       . It was made a default along with
       <a href="/r/atheism">
        /r/atheism
       </a>
       to automatically gain millions of subs to fluff the numbers and recruit. Any right wing source is considered sensationalist and removed, yet left wing sources that post blatant propaganda are allowed and upvoted to the top. Notice how everything in that sub has 100-300 upvotes yet the anti-Right wing stuff always gets 2000-5000. Anything anti-Left wing is downvoted to silence. But people on reddit don't care about blatant propaganda and censorship because it helps their agenda. And people will downvote to deflect my post but really it just proves me correct everytime, much like how they ban people like OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit - Love the downvote brigade, as predicted. Keep proving me right.

       Notice how you assumed I'm a right winger. That's another funny thing about it. People on here are so brainwashed they think anyone that speaks out against the left wing
       <em>

       For one you are assuming the person you responded to is a "right winger" (Whatever that means anymore) and not a "left winger"(Again whatever that means).

       You then bring up global warming and weather. Shit tactic. If the great debates in human history all started with each side grabbing at the low hanging extreme fruit of the opposition, I wouldn't be replying to your bits saved on a database, of a server, connected to the internet, from a computer I built, with parts from a company with global presence.

       Both "sides" have good rational points. If you mind to look past the 
sensationalist titles. Stop with the "my tribe and your tribe" bullshit.

       I give you today's example of the "rhino hunter". Protesters knew, but left out the information that the hunter was hunting the rhino for actual "good" reasons. Someone who just read the long as hell title(and I presume the article), would have never known.

       Ha! As if any part of mainstream reddit is any way left wing. All the default subs and any others with a lot of subscribers are nothing but establishment swill. Leaning liberal, perhaps, but definitely not left wing. I'm a die-hard lefty and I suffer the wrath of the downvote brigade constantly.

       that's not the point lol they banned him for exposing for what reddit truly is. If they banned him for disobeying one of the subreddits rules that's a different story. But they banned him for the content that's in the post, which clearly doesn't disobey any rules in this subreddit.

       What do you mean "they" banned him?  It's a fucking internet website / news forum.  Also, that voat website is lucky they only got "hacked" and not sued for blatantly mimicking reddit.

       The.. Mods? LOL and the motto for when reddit was first made was free speech, posts, and the like. Clearly that changed. and I'm pretty sure mimicking a website that didn't copyright or patent it's layout is not illegal. That's called Capitalism.

       So what else would they sue voat for? mimicking is not a patent? Copyright? Nike can't sue someone off Copyright infringement cause they use the exact symbol? LOL

       I hope you know that they can IP ban users.. Or you want me to explain that for you too? since you clearly don't know what you're talking about lmao. I think I'm replying to a brick wall.

       Copyright isn't like a patent, you don't need to do anything for it to exist on your original work.  However, you can register your work with the copyright office in the USA.

       You can revoke anyone's right to your intellectual property at any time, unless pre-existing contractual obligations explicitly wave such right.  In the exact same way a mall owner can revoke your right to access the mall property at any time and for any reason, and make you a trespasser should you decide to stay on the property against their wishes.  The right to exclusion is arguably the most fundamental right in property law.

       Some of what you are posting is insanely reasonable and the other bit seems way out there. It neuters your message to have both, because people can handwave the insanely reasonable stuff away by pointing to, for example, that self congraulatory thing about the misidentification boston bombers. The kid's sister and parents were bombarded in death threats.

         Whoever does shadowbanning is needs to work on their damage control, because you already wrote your own post into that grey area where it's easy to just shrug and say you're crazy, and all they did was hand you back all the legitimacy you destroyed.
        </p>

       <li>

         At least some of what you have said is 100% correct.

       No, it's used on trolls and vote manipulators so they carry on without realising no-one can see their comments and their votes aren't being counted. If they were told then they would immediately make a new account.

       Also notice how reddit removes anything that's against climate change, even discussion, deeming it crazy. I've never seen a better way to brainwash than to say everything scientists say is correct and anyone questioning it must be silenced. Hell, scientist could come out and say climate change is deemed false and people would just say they're "crazy right wing scientists". That's how science works, right? But people love to fall for it to make themselves feel smarter.

       Sometimes just random hate-mail like "Go Kill Yourself" etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       I got a string of one-sentence threats like "Stop what you are doing." Or "I can't be held responsible for what happens next", stuff that I honestly just assumed were conspiratards trolling me, but then I noticed at least 5 different accounts that went to usernames with long histories (3+ years) but no comments or submissions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then I got some just plain weird ones, like real psycho shit. Stuff I cannot even remember because of how weird it was. Once again, could just be harmless trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then someone made an account called "Says.hi.to.(my username)" and they followed me around for about 2 months just saying "hi" after every post. At first I laughed it off but then it just started creeping me out, like it was a subtle "you are on our list now and we will watch everything you do".
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a good thing that I was already on alternate accounts by that point. One of the main reasons I originally deleted my main 5+ year account. Because I realized that people could dig around in my history and make a pretty good guess about where I worked, they could have reverse image searched submission I made with my personal art, and been directed to my facebook etc...

       If you are shadow banned then a subreddit mod has to manually approve your comment for it to be visible to others.

       Personally, I still think reddit's codebase is fine as it is. Also, they switched languages (maybe when it was a lot smaller) before, so switching again would give a chance to go over all the code and see what it does. But I like python, so I have no problem with it as it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I would like to see is image/video/misc data hosting inbuilt into the website, instead of relying on outside content. A lot harder to take down that way, and more anonymous. Would use a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of disk space thougAll they will find is that I'm an anime watching, 24/7 computer gaming nerd.h, text compresses a hell of a lot better than
       <del>
        dank memes
       </del>
       images.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what do you do about illegal content? You can either host it on TOR (and only on TOR) and have hardly anyone use it, but you wouldn't be forced to take down anything, or you can host it normally but you will have to take down illegal content.

       To each there own, I mean the code is fairly simple. I would rebuild it with PHP, but why not just start from scratch based on "how it works".

       That is the problem, how the hell do you handle that. Which is why it makes it risky running a site like this without a team of lawyers. They could litigate you out of business, sigh....

       Shadowbanning is a reddit-wide thing that's supposed to exist to stop spammers.  You still see your posts, but nobody else can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moderators can still approve posts by someone who is shadowbanned and they will show up.
      </p>
      <p>
       What some moderators are doing, though, is having automoderator automatically delete posts by people they don't like.  It's even harder to detect, and is really shitty.

       They can ban any IP they want. They don't know if it's static or dynamic. What I'm saying is they (Reddit) can ban an IP but, if dynamic, the ban would only be effective until it is recycled and some poor schmuck gets the banned IP while the intended recipient of the ban gets a new IP that isn't banned.

       Up vote for mentioning Corbett. I've spent the time to go through his source material; he is now my favorite journalist. The guy is amazing.

       No-one is forcing you to pay. You can use this site 100% without ever buying gold. If no-one does. It goes away. Just like if no-one donates food for the soup kitchen, eventually it's gonna be gone. The food doesn't come from thin air.

       If you don't like the way reddit is now, just fuck off and find an alternative. Don't fuck this place in to a pile of shit on the floor on your way out.
