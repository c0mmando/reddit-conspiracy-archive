There&#39;s a lot of information that comes through here. To walk the path and find out what&#39;s really happening in this mess is quite an experience. It&#39;s all too easy to get confused, angry and scared along the way.</p>

<p>It takes a lot of effort to compile commentary of the quality that we get in here. If it weren&#39;t for that commentary, I feel like I&#39;d be lost trying to make sense of what&#39;s going on from just the articles alone. I just wanted to thank all the users in here for their tireless contributions to the collective understanding. There&#39;s a number in here that go above and beyond to share their knowledge with anyone and they do so in an extremely polite and respectful manner. This is truly great work and I just wanted to let those people (you know who you are) know that it&#39;s very much appreciated.</p>

<p>Keep it up guys and gals. </p>

<p>Peace.</p>

<p>This is true, however, there is a difference. People on this sub are extremely aware of the official narrative of an event but they have found it lacking. Conversely, most people who dismiss a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; know virtually none of its details and are also completely unaware of the inconsistencies of the official narrative which gave rise to the alternative explanation(s).</p>

<p>In other words, most would-be debunkers we see here are completely unaware of how little they actually know. They are Dunning-Kruger poster boys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quite true.  I think this is because once you start debunking &quot;conspiracy theories,&quot; there is a rabbit hole that keeps going deeper and your whole world kinda comes apart at the edges a little bit.  The Venn overlap of &quot;ignorance&quot; and &quot;conspiracy theory debunker&quot; is very nearly 100 percent, IMO.</p>

<p>The general openness of this community is one really cool little corner of the Internet to me.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m the same. I started surfing r/funny on this site and that got stale fast so I went to political and news subs but after being banned from r/news and r/worldnews for criticizing israel and having real discussions with people, I found this place. Probably through someone claiming I was from r/conspiracy or something and then I decided, might as well check it out. :D</p>

<p>With so much crazy stuff being thrown out that is easily discredited with a 2 second google search, new people coming in will think we&#39;re just a bunch of idiotic morons.</p>
