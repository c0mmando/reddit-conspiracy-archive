        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Conspiracy Shower Thought [CST]: a new type of self-post to this subreddit. All discussion must assume that the premise is valid so the OP and believers can delve deeper into the subject without being harassed. </p>

<p>[CST] could be a tag for self-posts, like the [Serious] tag in r/askreddit. Those who do not respect it are banned from the subreddit. </p>

<p>This particular idea may need some refining. Thoughts? </p>

<p>I believe ideas like this are necessary if we want this subreddit to thrive. Way too many OP&#39;s are put off from self-posting because they are trolled by people or the threads devolve into an attack on the basic premise. This is a CONSPIRACY subreddit, I should be able to post about something like the moon landing being fake and be able to have a safe discussion with other people who are also willing to <em>entertain</em> the thought. </p>

<p>UPDATE: I really think r/conspiracy should at least attempt to implement some new systems. At least for a trial run. If anyone here is interested, I have made a subreddit as a way to test the system: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/">https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/</a></p>

<p>I used some of my graphic skills to throw some lipstick on it. Come join us if you are interested and tell others about the sub if you see them getting trolled here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like it but the trolls will swarm like flies on roadkill. If enough people treated the major conspiracies to an Aristotelian dialogue, they might arrive at irrefutable evidence. Murderers don&#39;t like the light to shine on them and would enlist an army against the subject. Eventually, as we drew closer to the truth, they&#39;d smash the chessboard. I&#39;d say try anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This will get trolled hard, another problem being how you are talking about creating an echo chamber. Another issue is wether it should be moderated at all due to the nature of criticism (not vitriol, totally different subject)</p>

<p>Basically any sub or self post here is still ruined by it being the internet and the state of things. Continue making posts and go ahead with the prefacing, but you may want to consider some voat or another outlet. Or tweak the name as not to have any conspiracy connotations and try to figure out something more original. Also to avoid said trolling for a while until it picks up. Technically you could already do this on reddit with the non conspiracy name if you cared to avoid trolling, moderation or censorship.</p>

<p>It would be nice if we could discuss maturely over the internet without all the idiocy, but I doubt you can avoid it with a word so involved with propaganda throughout the centuries, especially the last two to four hundred.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your concerns and definitely feel like they are valid. These are my thoughts:</p>

<p>If I say &quot;I think the moon landing is fake&quot; then I would love to have a conversation with people riffing off of that idea. People will have 100 different theories as to why, or how, etc...</p>

<p>If that is an &quot;echo chamber&quot;, then maybe people need to be in an echo chamber sometimes in order to build from their theories.</p>

<p>A less &quot;out-there&quot; example is 9/11. If I want to discuss WTC 7 and why it was brought down. I don&#39;t want to have every other message in my mailbox be from people who are going to take all of my time and energy by explaining how stupid I am for believing it was a controlled demo. And most of the time it boils down to, &quot;You are wrong and here are all the mainstream excuses (that I have literally heard 1000 times and thought of 1000 times)&quot;.</p>

<p>Lastly, the best example I can give is math. If I want to have a discussion about advanced algebra. I don&#39;t want to have to deal with people who barely have a grasp on addition or subtraction. A lot of conspiracy theories require a great deal of research. And there are people who want to talk with others who have also put in the time and energy needed to research the subject. A lot of times you have people coming in who have done no reading, research, or even thought about the subject beyond what they were taught about it in middle school. These people (whether trolling or not) will enter your threads and derail every conversation with their ignorance. And remember, its not stupidity, it is ignorance. They are ignorant of the subject because they don&#39;t know. These people deserve to be kept in check. </p>

<p>CST is taken.</p>

<p>C_S_T will work, and is anonymous enough to not attract a lot of attention from the you know who&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, I agree. Moreover, most of those that frequent this sub have greater than the average imagination/consideration for opinions they themselves don&#39;t believe in and are willing to entertain. Making it clear with a tag or with a comment in the description works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My problem with this idea, is first off, it could be used to censor dissenting opinions pretty easily. But more importantly in my opinion, if you assume a premise to be true, you&#39;ll never go any &quot;deeper&quot; into that idea. </p>

<p>Seems to me that by &quot;entertaining&quot; an idea you mean to contemplate that idea in a vacuum, ignoring all evidence to the contrary and only ever scratching the surface of that idea. You may go &quot;deeper&quot; but it will only be deeper into a fantasy. You&#39;ll never get to any real conclusion about anything. If this is what this sub wants, then by all means go ahead, just stop pretending that this will promote any kind of meaningful discussion.</p>

<p>If you really want to entertain an idea and delve deeper into it, you can&#39;t study it in a vacuum, you have to consider all the evidence, whether it supports the idea or not. You have to open it up to criticism, otherwise you&#39;ll never be able to develop your ideas. So I think this is a great idea if you want <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to become even more of an echo chamber, and I mean that sincerely. If this sub wants to be an echo chamber, that go for it, but realize that that&#39;s all you&#39;ll ever be.</p>

<p>On a side note, I find it hilarious that you consider any one who disagrees with the basic premise of a conspiracy to be a troll and that you equate disagreement with harassment. </p>
