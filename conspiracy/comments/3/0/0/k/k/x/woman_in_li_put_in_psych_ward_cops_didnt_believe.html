       ""A Long Island woman’s insistence that President Obama follows her on Twitter made doctors at the Harlem Hospital psych ward think she was delusional and suffering from bipolar disorder — but she was actually telling the truth, a lawsuit charges.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kam Brock’s frightening eight-day “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” ordeal at the mental facility included forced injections of powerful sedatives and demands she down doses of lithium, medical records obtained through her suit filed in Manhattan Federal Court show.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also indicate that doctors didn’t believe the leader of the free world followed her on Twitter — though @BarackObama follows over 640,000 accounts, including hers. They were also skeptical she worked at a bank, records show.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Objective: Patient will verbalize the importance of education for employment and will state that Obama is not following her on Twitter,” the document reads.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also notes “patient’s weaknesses: inability to test reality, unemployment.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Adding insult to insanity, the hospital hit Brock with a bill of $13,637.10, she charges in her suit seeking unspecified damages.
The bizarre experience began Sept. 12, when the NYPD seized her prized 2003 BMW 325Ci in Harlem because they suspected she was high on weed, her attorney, Michael Lamonsoff, said. Cops found no marijuana but confiscated her ride anyway, he said. The NYPD declined to comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The following day, Brock walked into the NYPD’s Public Service Area 6 stationhouse in Harlem to retrieve her car, her suit charges.
Brock — an eccentric 32-year-old born in Jamaica with dreams of making it big in the entertainment business — admitted in an interview she was “emotional,” but insisted she in no way is an “emotionally disturbed person.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevertheless, cops cuffed her and put her in an ambulance bound for the hospital, her suit charges.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Next thing you know, the police held onto me, the doctor stuck me with a needle and I was knocked out,” Brock said, tearing up. “I woke up to them taking off my underwear and then went out again. I woke up the next day in a hospital robe.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Lamonsoff said race may have been a factor in the way Brock was treated."

       No surprise here. Who was the guy who showed you could get yourself put into a psych ward just by knowing a few key words. He also proved that the doctors had no real way to distinguish between a crazy person and a sane one. All of the people who got admitted into the hospitals under false pretenses were not allowed to leave as they could not convince the doctors they were OK.

       Yes, but the thing is that, all those patients in the experiment initially told them they were hearing voices.  And then when you suddenly start denying hearing voices after initially saying you did hear voices, it just sounds like you're lying to try and leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not really that easy to get locked into a psych facility though, I don't think she should have been locked up for 8 days and clearly nobody bothered to verify her life story that she was telling (they should have called some family/friends) but she was probably pretty damned agitated at the police tow compound for them to actually have her sent to a hospital.  Then she was probably screaming about how she's a banker and how Barack Obama follows her on twitter, mostly to suggest how powerful she is, etc.  Frankly I'm not sure why you would tell people these things, if you just calm down and asked for them to call your family they'd just let you go from the ER.

       Well she is about to make it big. Hope gets a nice fat check. I wish I believed anyone would be fired over this.

       Reminds me of the time humpty and dumpty came out of the woods at a campsite in central texas with night vision equipment. They had been watching us smoke weed and arrested the girl who rolled the joint. One of them tripped and fell on the way intk our campsite. We jumped up to help him but that didn't end well. I was with an army medic who had just been fighting for his country. Almost saw and participated in a murder that night. They did not mirandize her. When they asked us what we did and I told them I wrote software (but not for who) one of them said 'yeah right'.

       In Oklahoma there was a law once that allowed people to turn a person for 30 days observation in a pysch ward and be paid 50 dollars.  I thought about this odd piece of legislation and thought a person can make some money if they took someone off the streets and had them committed.  Hell.  Someone could make more money if they had a Van.  I don't know when this practice ended.

       i've heard of that too, getting paid to send someone to an asylum, maybe years ago that really was a thing. good thing it's not real now, so many people out of work, imagine how many people would end up in a ward?
