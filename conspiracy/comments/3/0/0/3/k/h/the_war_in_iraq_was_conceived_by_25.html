Two of them, journalists William Kristol and Charles Krauthammer, say it’s possible.</p>

<p>This is a war of an elite. [Tom] Friedman laughs: I could give you the names of 25 people (all of whom are at this moment within a five-block radius of this office) who, if you had exiled them to a desert island a year and a half ago, the Iraq war would not have happened.</p>

<p>Yes Tommie, lying the USA into fighting wars for Israel, destroying ME nations Israel hates and getting millions killed and many millions more wounded is so funny.</p>

<p>This kind of arrogance, which is part of the Jew mindset, can be displayed because Israel knows they have America by the balls and won’t stop squeezing until we collapse from within due to all the debt racked up fighting ‘Wars for Wall Street and Israel.’</p>

<p>By promulgating that notion you are only aiding the zionists who rely on the perception of Zionism as ethnic or racial in nature, subsequently making opposition to Zionism &quot;racist&quot;.

<p>Judaism =  Zionism</p>

<p>Look at the works of the queer (i.e. anti-racism imposing) rabbis or any of the anti-racism imposing Christian Identityist rednecks and anti-racism imposing WASP Zionist Yankee genocidalists.</p>

<p>Opposition to Zionism is anti-racism imposing and it is more interested in imposing it on the Palestinians (see Chomsky)  and on you (see Chomsky&#39;s dick sucking WASP Zionist Yankee genocidalists).</p>

<p>cmon man. its putting everyone in the same category. we hate when people call us &#39;tin foil hat nuts&#39; and put us in the same category as people like <a href="/u/cantstopwhitey">/u/cantstopwhitey</a> whos a confirmed white supremacist, dont we? thats why im sick of this whole repetitive &quot;jews did this and that&quot; with the only &#39;evidence&#39; being what the mans race is? seriously? Israel is a bad cunt of a place, run by bad cunts of people, but its not a &#39;jew mindset&#39; thats doing these crimes against humanity, nor is it the common people in Israel doing it, its THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP, WHO ARE ALL RACES AND CREEDS. IM really sick of this shit, i really am. im ready to quit fucking reddit altogether, because of this bullshit. why cant people stick to facts instead of using race as &#39;evidence&#39; when in fact, its just one thing in amongst many points, and its not even relevant, unless theres concrete evidence to suggest otherwise. think about it from a police detective&#39;s point of view: the fact that some of them are jewish, thats a commonality, not a motive or a vehicle to do the crime, is it? honestly, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is my last bastion of reddit, and i can feel it slipping away. i dont get sucked into shit like this, im better than that, and you should be too. fuck <a href="/u/Indra-Varuna">/u/Indra-Varuna</a> and all the other veiled racists like him. fuck them all. </p>

<p>so im a jew now huh. are you for real? i dont give a fuck what race, color, religion you are, youre innocent till proven guilty. your attitude toward ethnics is based almost purely on dna. tell me if im wrong? ive seen the videos and shit you comment on, and for an intelligent fellow like yourself (im not pissing in your pocket, credit where credit is due) its quite an emotional logic that you use. you use deduction based of probably some traumatic experiences. anyway, i dont really give a fuck, a spades a spade. </p>

<p>I disagree.  It is quite the opposite, in fact.  Firstly, while DNA is quite proficient at determining many characteristics from appearances to abilities, both mental and physical, it is not the only component.  The culture in which one lives can influence, positively and/or negatively, behavioral traits as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ive seen the videos and shit you comment on</p>

<p>That is irrelevant.  Does commenting in <a href="/r/TwoXChromosomes">/r/TwoXChromosomes</a> make me a female?  Does commenting in <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a> make me funny?  Your argument is foolish.  It is an example of you performing what I have just been accused of:</p>

<p>These people (mostly of khazarian decent) are later converts to Judaism. They hide behind a shield of antisemitism when they&#39;re not even semites themselves. Depending on how far you want to get into the rabbit hole, there is evidence to suggest that the blood lines of these Ashkenazi Jews correlate with higher expressions of psychopathy and further down still, that they&#39;re of reptilian ancestry as supported by their lack of the Rhesus antibody on the surface of their red blood cells. </p>

<p>If you look into Jordan Maxwell, you&#39;ll see there&#39;s interpretations of the old testament in which in can be concluded that the Elohim whose image we were made in, were in fact physical entities though not of this world. </p>

<p>Logic 1: Claims to have been raised in Judaism and been to Israel</p>

<p>Logic 2: Judaism has nothing to do with Zionism (the belief that Jews have a right to return home to Israel)</p>

<p>Logical Deficiency: You literally lumped in having &quot;been to Israel&quot; as part of &quot;the whole nine yards.&quot; All you do is prove my point and pretend to be Jewish. I should just sit back and let you continue to contradict yourself on a sub that believes Jews are lizard people.</p>

<p>Also as for what you gain: It provides some support for your argument. If Zionism isn&#39;t a commonly held Jewish belief than certainly it would be easy to find Jews that do not support it. By claiming to be one yourself it feeds your argument. In my entire life I have never met a single Jew who did not believe that we have a right to Israel. I have heard of Jews disagreeing on matters of Israeli policy but never in the matter of whether Israel has a right to exist and whether Jews have a right to go there. IN FACT: If you had a shred of knowledge on the subject you would be familiar with the Ethiopian Jews who even though separated for 1000&#39;s of years held on to the belief that Yerusalem was there homeland and one day they would return <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Israel#Gondar_period_.281632.E2.80.931855.29">there</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe I did mine in 2013, before the FDA sent 23andme a cease and desist letter requiring them to remove the health risks breakdown portion of their website. Now days, I believe its primary function is to display ancestry, but provides you a raw genetic information data file you can upload to alternative websites for health data. <a href="http://geneticgenie.org/">http://geneticgenie.org/</a> comes to mind. I presented the information to my doctor, and he was incredibly interested and it really gave him a heads up on my potential health risks. For instance, I have a mutation that causes insufficient absorption of both Vitamin D and Vitamin B, so now I supplement for both and feel much better for it.</p>

<p>There are some issues with ancestry. As I understand it, we&#39;re limited to solely the maternal genetic information on the maternal haplogroup information, so paternal genetic information on the maternal side isn&#39;t present, and vice versa. It may be different now, I haven&#39;t looked recently. Regardless, the gene sequences are put in a mass database, so it&#39;s easy enough to compare my own genetic information towards the rest of humanity to determine I&#39;m not, in fact, a reptilian shapeshifting humanoid. I do have 2.3% Neanderthal DNA, or something along those lines.</p>

<p>Anyway, it&#39;s cool and it&#39;s only $100. It&#39;s well worth it in my mind.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re uncomfortable with your genetic information being stored in a database likely available to other businesses (and certainly government) it might not be the best thing for you, but meh, I didn&#39;t really care at the time and still don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Fuck off. Reptilian ancestry doesn&#39;t even make sense. Reptiles can&#39;t interbreed with mammals. It doesn&#39;t work that way. Evolution doesn&#39;t work that way. I can breed with any female human being no matter their religion or ancestry because we&#39;re all mammalian human beings. At no point did reptiles veer off into a separate upstanding human-like species. If they did, those human-like reptiles wouldn&#39;t be able to interbreed with mammalian homo sapiens. The fact you haven&#39;t come to this obvious conclusion yourself shows you&#39;re a nutjob incapable of critical thought.</p>

<p>Question everything has to be just that - People should be allowed to question what they want.  Wonder about what they want.  Entertain whatever possibility they want.    </p>

<p>I have no idea why you are getting so bent out of shape about someone saying its <em>possible</em> you have reptilian DNA.  In fact, I think your defensiveness is a little suspicious - you might be a reptile.  I don&#39;t think someone that is purely human, and is secure in that knowledge, would be acting as defensively as you are now.      </p>

<p>Why are you so threatened by the mere possibility of some reptile DNA in your ancestral past that you have to attack someone about it?    </p>

Mares or jennies which have been sensitized by a previous pregnancy develop antibodies by fetal blood cells crossing the placental barrier. The iso-antibodies do not transcend the fetal barrier, but are present in colostrum. The Neonatal Fc receptor which in case of humans transfer the maternal antibody from mother through placenta to fetus, in this case is involved in transporting the IgG1 antibodies from mother animal&#39;s mammary gland into milk and then again from the ingested milk across the newborn intestine into the newborn animal&#39;s circulation.[2] The placenta of mammals can be of many varieties and unless it is hemochorial like humans and some rodents, the IgG of mother cannot directly cross the placenta and passively immunize the fetus. Horse (and also ruminants) have epitheliochorial placenta. Thus IgG1 will enter the bloodstream of the foal only after birth when colostrum immunoglobulins are exposed to FcRn in the newborn intestine, in the first days of life. Hence, hemolytic disease will develop only after birth : first to 4th day in foal [3] and 3 to 7 days in newborn mules. Affected animals show lethargy, recumbency, tachycardia, and progressive icterus of eye and mouth mucosae, which rapidly leads to death. The condition is also described in newborn pigs and other animals [4]&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;re delusional. There are plenty of delusional people in the world with degrees. Nice strawman. I&#39;d expect as much from a crazy person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because there are plenty of level headed people in this subreddit that don&#39;t hide their racism behind hogwash. Your petty argument is as weak as people saying Africans are lesser because they lack neanderthal genes. Except at least that argument has some empirical basis as it is factually derived and not just an unfounded assertion with zero scientific backing. If you don&#39;t like Jews, just don&#39;t like us. I don&#39;t care. It doesn&#39;t bother me, but be honest about it. I don&#39;t like a lot of Jews. It doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re fucking reptiles. </p>

<p>Just to clarify, Africans aren&#39;t lesser in any way because they lack Neanderthal genes, just an observation that roughly 99% of them do lack the genes present in those whose ancestors did at one point interbreed with Neanderthals.</p>

<p>I never pull the &quot;Jew&quot; card, but man, you are forcing my hand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol at racism. I have no such pretension that one race is superior than another. This extends through to my understanding of ET species with none inferior to another and all simply expressing varying degrees of consciousness and playing their part in an interconnected universe.</p>

<p>You&#39;re way out of your league here and if you would actually perform some inquiry into what I&#39;m saying rather than copypasta a paragraph on haemolytic disorder in horses as a refutation for my theory (an actual strawman) you&#39;d realise you have no idea what the fuck you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>You want to run your mouth as if your model of evolution is iron clad and civilisation just miraculously sprung up in mesopotamia some 10 000 years ago. So please tell me, o sane one, how does your model then explain Gobekli Tepi, or the whole host of other archeological ruins that predate the younger dryas period? Or how such structures that predate the official dawn of civilisation, exist in alignment with sophisticated constellatory and astrological knowledge?  Please tell me how your objective truth accounts for the awareness of these prior civilisations to the fundamental geometry expressed throughout the universe as shown in the flower of life? How this same truth accounts for the stories of the Sumerian&#39;s sources of knowledge, of the book of Enoch, of the origins of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>I imagine you&#39;re only just stepping into the world of conspiracies and you&#39;re still at the level of &quot;ZOMG gov is spying on us, shock horror!&quot; but when you spend a bit more time here and stop writing other people, who share ideas you don&#39;t understand, off as crazy, you&#39;ll realise that literally nothing is as it seems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not out of my league, I&#39;m quite comfortable with where I stand in this discussion. </p>

<p>Okay, strawman, strawman, strawman, completely unrelated to the reptilian Ashkenazi claim, endless pursuit of unrelated patterns, strawman, pretty dreamstuffs, ancient books must have some basis in reality after all. I really hope people of the future don&#39;t believe The Hobbit was an accurate depiction of the world in the 1900&#39;s.</p>

<p>I have no qualms with human civilization predating Mesopotamia, the issue here is with your assertion that Ashkenazi hail from a separately evolved, or separately planted, reptilian humanoid genome - with no factual data to back it up. It&#39;s complete bunk David Icke madness. Please, lend me some reputable sources that say otherwise, and not just pseudo-scientific claims that Ashkenazi&#39;s with hemolytic disorder can&#39;t procreate because the offspring is a non-Homo Sapiens species (come on, man, don&#39;t be ridiculous). Hemolytic disorders exist throughout the animal kingdom and aren&#39;t unique to humanity. Claiming differences in Rh factor necessarily means one descends from aliens, and isn&#39;t just another genetic mutation similar to blue eyes, blonde hair, epicanthic folds is unfounded and irrational. It looks like you just latch on to anything with any semblance of a pattern as factual, whether or not the end conclusion is based in reason. </p>

<p>I&#39;m familiar with conspiracies (you&#39;re using the term wrong), I just don&#39;t lend credibility to baseless assertions. I do not trust the official narrative, and believe the government and other secretive groups have the capacity to sway public opinion and the way society functions. I don&#39;t need to incorporate fantasies into the picture to recognize the fact evil stirs in the upper (and all) echelons of society.</p>

<p>What I said wasn&#39;t strawman, strawman, strawman, unrelated.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should have spelt it out a little clearer: If Graham Hancock is right, there was an advanced civilisation that spanned the globe prior to a cataclysmic event some 12 500 years ago. The fact that there remains such mystery about the construction of many of the wonders of the world implies that this civilisation had a more advanced knowledge of forms and energy than we currently do. The flower of life motif that is depicted throughout the world, represents fundamental geometry of the universe according to Nassim Haramein&#39;s recently developed holofractal theory.</p>

<p>Haramein&#39;s theory implies that Tesla was right and it is possible to tap into wireless electricity in the form of zero point energy through creating devices in accordance with this geometry. Cosmic wormholes are also very much accounted for in his theory as well.</p>

<p>If we take these findings together, there&#39;s enough evidence to at least investigate the idea that this earlier civilisation, with advanced knowledge of the universe&#39;s fundamental principles could have been seeded by extra terrestrials. Especially considering the references in Sumerian culture and the numerous other isolated references of sky people. </p>

<p>Now when you check out what&#39;s out there in relation to these ideas, these are some of the books you come to. Much of it has some startling correlates to biblical events, which again should be enough to trigger a little curiosity in a keen individual. </p>

<p>I found <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/hidden_hand_bloodlines">this</a> article of an interview with an alleged ruling blood line priest to give an interesting perspective on the matter as well. It&#39;s written a few years ago and some of the things they mention obviously haven&#39;t come to pass, but none the less it still contains some valuable insights regardless of if you believe it or not. </p>

<p>Now I haven&#39;t really touched on the Ashkenazi stuff in here because much of the stuff to suggest that is just a weird collation of references over my research. I can assure you though, I&#39;m not being prejudiced in any way here. I don&#39;t entertain any ideas of one being being superior to another or advocate any kind of discrimination against anyone. I am simply seeking to identify the ancestry of a group of people, which there is reason to believe, have an intimate relationship with extra terrestrial entities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t read the lost texts of Adam and Eve nor the lots book of Enoch. Interesting, I&#39;ll take a look now</p>

<p>I am familiar with Graham Hancock&#39;s work. I find the evidence he&#39;s unearthed through his work to be most compelling towards the conclusion that we had an earlier advanced civilisation. The implications of such a conclusion are phenomenal. </p>

<p>Of particular interest to me is the presence of the &#39;flower of life&#39; motif, found in many ancient civilisations. Are you familiar with Nassim Haramein&#39;s work? He has solved Einstein&#39;s unified field equations with a holofractal theory of the universe. In the geometry of his model, there&#39;s a particular organisation of fundamental units within the universe, that repeats at harmonic intervals ad infinitum. The interference pattern of the arrangement of these planck units, creates the flower of life motif. </p>

<p>The implications of such a theory, are extremely profound with one of the outcomes of it being a framework for tapping into zero point energy from the vacuum. In addition, if this earlier advanced civilisation had this knowledge, it&#39;s reasonable to assume they could have used it for the construction of massive structures such as the pyramids. The interesting question also arises of how did they get such knowledge?</p>

<p>I believe Haramein has produced one of the most important discoveries for mankind with this theory. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s the first to have figured it out, and presume that many of the secret societies have had access to this knowledge over the millennia. Presumably as remnants of the lost civilisation. Manly P Hall talks about this in his lecture: Atlantis and the Gods of Antiquity.</p>

<p>Other implications of his theory are the presence of worm holes that dramatically reduce the distances of cosmic travel, the fractal and holographic nature of the theory also implies that at any instant, there is an instantaneous sharing of information from all points in space with one another. Everything is connected and everything is vibration. If one practises certain techniques of the mind, it should theoretically be possible to interact with this omniscient phase space and obtain data from it regarding any point in the universe.</p>

<p>There&#39;s much more to it. It&#39;s essentially a mathematical proof for monism. When you think it through, so many things start to make sense. Plato was right on the money it seems with his idea of forms and existing in a process of infinitely becoming.</p>

<p>I did notice how some of his theories are oddly perfect, and he definitely knew how to manipulate language.</p>

<p>I would caution you to not immediately dismiss someone&#39;s entire syllabus of claims, just because of a new thing. People change, and the man I am today is faaaar different than just two years ago.</p>

<p>I think we can apply this to both AJ and Icke, as they probably had noble intentions at first and somehow lost their way (either intentionally or not).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct...i made a typo.   Name changing to me means hiding something. A deliberate and ultimate falsehood, a misrepresentation as to who you are. We see this among the Jewish population quite often, changing to a name that less readily identifies them as a jew, as to fit in better on The Goyim Plantation. If you can not be honest about your name, what else are you going to misrepresent? </p>

<p>Not most of them Jewish. Most of them fascist, zionists. I appreciate what you&#39;re saying, but you&#39;re doing yourself a disservice by categorising these perpetrators as simply Jewish. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely!  Neoconservatism is an ideology created by a group of eastern european jews, but that doesn&#39;t associate neoconservatism with jews in general.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These people (mostly of khazarian decent) are later converts to Judaism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe.  Ashkenazi Jews are descended more from european than mediterranean/middle eastern ancestry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They hide behind a shield of antisemitism when they&#39;re not even semites themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is certainly a group who does this. And yes, they are often less semetic than the people who they abuse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Depending on how far you want to get into the rabbit hole, there is evidence to suggest that the blood lines of these Ashkenazi Jews correlate with higher expressions of psychopathy </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alright, now while I buy that it&#39;s possible that there might be a predilection for psychopathy in certain genetic traits/lineages- now you&#39;re getting into some dangerous eugenics and racism...  And I highly doubt that you have ANY evidence to back this up.  Ashkenazi jews make up a significant portion of the Jews. It&#39;s one thing to say that they don&#39;t have a genetic right to israel since they probably don&#39;t even come from israel.  And it&#39;s absolutely true that there is a war mongering ideology promoted by a group of eastern european jewish academics who believe it necessary to keep the middle east out of asiatic russian control.  You might even go so far as critiquing jewish culture and expounding on the the conspiratorial view of the &quot;International Jew&quot;.  But when you start dehumanizing an entire genetic group by saying that they have a higher rate of psychopathy, you need some serious evidence to back that up.  That accusation leads to very bad places.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and further down still, that they&#39;re of reptilian ancestry as supported by their lack of the Rhesus antibody on the surface of their red blood cells. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>NOW you&#39;re just making shit up.  Even Icke and Maxwell don&#39;t conflate their crazy reptillian thesis with singling out Jewish genes.  And what the hell is a rhesus antibody?  That&#39;s not even a real thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t mistake me, I am merely trying to demonstrate that there is always more to the picture than meets the eye. I don&#39;t find the idea of psychopathy dehumanizing. It does concern me and it&#39;s something to be aware of but I would in now way advocate any kind of discrimination based off that understanding. As you claim I don&#39;t really have a lot of supporting evidence for what I&#39;ve said and it&#39;s simply been a story that I&#39;ve come across a number of times in my research.</p>

<p>I made a mistake with the Rhesus antibody. It&#39;s actually a surface antigen and it is very much a real thing. It&#39;s what determines whether a blood type is negative or positive. It&#39;s also the cause of haemolytic disorder when the two blood types attempt to procreate. This usually ends with the female miscarrying as their body attacks what it identifies as a foreign body. Sometimes the mothers have to take a supplement so that they developing foetus doesn&#39;t cause an autoimmune response in them.</p>

<p>I should have mentioned other characteristics that are claimed to be associated with the O- blood type: ¨ Extra vertebra.
¨ Higher than average IQ
¨ More sensitive vision and other senses.
¨ Lower body temperature
¨ Higher blood pressure
¨ Increased occurrence of psychic/intuitive abilities
¨ Predominantly blue, green, or Hazel eyes
¨ Red or reddish hair
¨ Has increased sensitivity to heat and sunlight
¨ Cannot be cloned
¨ Higher incidence of reported alien abduction.</p>

<p>I apologise if I&#39;ve offended anyone who identifies as an Ashkenazi, I thought it would be obvious that I don&#39;t mean to say they are all psychopaths. Perhaps, it&#39;s something as simple as the blood type correlates to higher IQ, which when raised in a religious culture that dehumanises other humans like Muslims or whatever, results in expressions of psychopathy? </p>

<p>I&#39;d encourage you to have a poke around in this space yourself. Just approach it with an open mind and don&#39;t shy away from things just because you&#39;ve been conditioned to be repulsed by eugenics. What if there is a master race, that is preserving their blood line through eugenic selection, and that blood line has some kind of psychic ability or simply an awareness of their lineage which through that, thinks less of general humans and seeks to dominate them for their own interests?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an interesting thread talking about some of the stuff I have mentioned here:</p>

<p>Yes it is, although it&#39;s a protein rather than an antibody.  It&#39;s what&#39;s being referred to when you see Rh-positive or Rh-negative with respect to a person&#39;s blood.  Rh-positive means you have the &quot;rhesus factor&quot; on the surface of your red blood cells, Rh-negative means you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>White Europeans, specifically the &quot;Basques&quot;, have a significantly higher percentage of Rh-negative people - which is incredibly rare among Africans, Asians, Native Americans, etc.</p>

Your petty argument is as weak as people saying Africans are lesser because they lack neanderthal genes.

I don&#39;t care. It doesn&#39;t bother me, but be honest about it. I don&#39;t like a lot of Jews. It doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re fucking reptiles. </p>
