<p>We are already slaves.  The vast, overwhelming majority of us simply don&#39;t know it.  This civilization was not designed for our well-being - for our development and evolution.  It was designed to allow us to remain in our roles and keep us from finding out what we are <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/duracell_matrix.jpg">really and truly used for here</a>.</p>

<p>Realize then that while TPTB have significant control over those physical vehicles called &quot;our bodies&quot;, they are not as much in control of our spiritual energy, and we can develop and use <em>that</em> to gain better and better control of the path we walk while we are in this prison-reform school called &quot;Earth&quot;.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, know that and rest in that understanding.  While you are here, definitely learn and develop as much as you can.  Yes, your time here may be restless.  Mine most definitely is as well, so I can relate.  However, we <em>will</em> be handed our &quot;parole papers&quot; soon enough.  We <em>will</em> eventually graduate from the current grade of junior high school development we are in on this planet.</p>

<p>Like any school, however, we must first complete the grade we&#39;re in before passing it and moving on to the next level of development.</p>

<p>We might be on similar wavelengths in terms of some of the things we feel, then, as you&#39;ve said various things which I very much understand as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think we&#39;re close because we&#39;re not falling for their ruse or settling for the mundane. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I also think development is not so much an &quot;on/off&quot; switch as much as it is a gradient of unfolding enlightenment that blossoms over time.  As such, I would say that what we&#39;re &quot;close&quot; to is the next stage of our evolution as spiritual beings - whatever that next stage may be.  And after that? after we reach that next stage?  Well, we will go on to the next, and then the next and the next...</p>

<p>The good news is that we are relatively new and underdeveloped beings - we humans - so it seems there is a much greater expanse of development and awareness awaiting us still.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I feel a pull growing within me for whatever comes next. I know I&#39;m not ready yet because there are selfish ideas and actions I need to rectify. I am changing everyday. I strive to be better and I know that&#39;s the path i need to stay on. I must say is nice to see someone who understands like I do. As you you probably know...

    <div class="md"><p>That hurts them. Remember a few years back when people took their money from banks and moved it to credit unions? That&#39;s the right idea but it still operates within &quot;their&quot; system. </p>

<p>Ghadaffi tried. In fact, Afghanistan and Iraq were invaded to establish a Central Bank in those countries.
In the year 2000, there were seven countries without a Rothschild-owned Central Bank: Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, Cuba, North Korea, and Iran.
The only countries left in 2003 without a Rothschild-owned Central Bank were: Sudan, Libya, Cuba, North Korea, and Iran.
The only countries left in 2011 without a Rothschild-owned Central Bank were: Cuba, North Korea, and Iran.</p>

<p>Its about resource allocation. That the most precious things we have on the planet being water and food. Corporations already control a vast majority of one. Now they are working on another. The big business can&#39;t control air like that its an involuntarily action within humans. But eating and drinking is something we must venture out to get.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to be of use in a crisis like that. I don&#39;t want to be here now, but I still have things to learn to grow as a person.. Those are the only things I am concerned with. I play along for now. I&#39;m waiting to go to the next plane or dimension, obviously I am not fit for this one. I&#39;ll be gone soon. And when it comes down to it... Im out of here. Back to star stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know I can be wrong. Maybe there is no conspiracy. Maybe its just the way shit works. Many of us in this sub try to see patterns where they don&#39;t even exist. Its the mentality.</p>

<p>Took me a while to realize this. For the longest time I was pissed offat everyone and everything. I could see what I thought were things that can change or even be better somehow.</p>

<p>Well that ain&#39;t the way shit happens. It took me seeing the people that moderated the sub at the time where no better then the msm and all its sensationalism. I saw it with my own eyes what was really going on and how they were hyping it up for the karma or hits to the blogs which they ran.</p>

<p>It was then that I saw it was all just bullshit. Your best objective in life is to keep happy. Die with loved ones and be remembered by your children. Thats the best I can think of. </p>

<p>Everything about this sub perpetuates hate. Lol there are so many other sub&#39;s made to discredit this one. Each on trying to force its narrative upon the other. Makes me laugh at the time and energy wasted to it when they could be using it to better their own lives then argue with someone over an issue they know can get them attention from their fellow sub members.</p>

<p>Try to find a hobby man something that just let&#39;s your mind wonder. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought that too. I think the reason I come to this sub was to somehow find a reason for all the bullshit and emptiness. I do realize that things are this way because we&#39;ve chosen it to be this way... One way or another. Our compliance makes us accomplices. I focus on things i love. Learning and growing as a person, until I get to the next realm. You&#39;re right. Most people come here with unhappiness looking for someone to blame for the way they feel. Looking too big on the picture, instead of within. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have met a couple great people here. Then I have met some that just need a punching bag. Words don&#39;t bother me. Its when they threaten to visit your home to teach you a lesson. </p>

<p>I have a deterent for that thou it involves me hitting them with a 2012 Chevy express 2500. Lol I am the type that likes to smear dipshit all over the windshield. Most are just empty threats but one day there will be that one crazy mother fucker you know.</p>

<p>What&#39;s funny is that mods say oh tell us we can ban them. Lol they will make a new name if they don&#39;t have one already and repeat the cycle. Most the time I think its people from hate sub&#39;s. There are so many on reddit too. </p>

<p>With all the hate on reddit there would have to be some good ones you would think. I really hope its just .me thou. Really don&#39;t want it to be there is more hateful then positive. </p>

<p>I mean I get that its easier to hate someone. Its also more easily acceptable too.  Don&#39;t understand why reddit allows these sub&#39;s to exist. I don&#39;t think everyone should get a trophy but I think they shouldnt have a place to congregate within reddit. Its not condusive to the site. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I try not to humor negativity,but we all have our buttons. I wasn&#39;t aware that it was that drastic, but I&#39;m usually just a lurker. I come to reddit for information to add and weigh against my opinions and knowledge. I believe this sub has a place because maybe someone who hasn&#39;t woken up might see something that sparks some curiosity about the bullshit and more people will realize that what&#39;s going on in the world is a distraction from what our true and only purpose is.... To learn, grow, and find meaning in things that make us happy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That label of waking up I find stupid. People know the system is flawed. Its apparent in all facets of day to day life. They choose to ignore it because its too much of a challenge and most when they do challenge the system are delt with.</p>

<p>I spend most my week on hotels because of my job and I love to watch people at breakfast. It is so amusing how many people do certain things.</p>

<p>For instance. They have a juice machine here. Well next to it they have these 3oz cups. Well two feet away they have coffee cups that are 10oz and people will always grab the small ones and walk up and get refill after refill.</p>

<p>Or they will sit closer to the juice machine so they don&#39;t have to walk as far. Its funny to see who will grab the coffee cup. Doctors, lawyers, pilots, all grab the small one its usually they guy that is driving a beat up ford pickup with the gun rack and the odumbo sticker that gets the larger cup.</p>

<p>Its the smaller things I see people do that fascinates me on how programmed we are to just accept what we are given and not question it. </p>

<p>Try it sometime just go to a public area and watch habits of people. You will find there is a constant behavior. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will start watching for things like that. I like organizing and puzzles so i figure things out pretty easy and I try and try to get my mom to do things a certain way to make things easier and she just refuses. They are programmed and It&#39;s hard to override that I guess. I&#39;ve always been the stand out person, whether it&#39;s me being weird or the black sheep... I&#39;ve always been different. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t think you are alone in being different. You are unique just like everyone else. Lol fight club is a great mind fuck of a movie. If you can I suggest watching it. </p>

<p>I enjoy puzzles and such too. Its why wife and I got into lego. You would be supprized at the adult fan base Lego has. I never knew till I found <a href="/r/lego">/r/lego</a> typical assholes in there as well just looking for someone to get into a bitch fest with. For the most part is a great community. </p>

<p>It helps me to relax and let my mind wonder. Kinda like unwinding. Plus reliving my childhood. Its great to find a common ground with your kid if you have one. Problem is that mine keeps fucking around with all the goddamn mini figures. </p>

<p>I swear to god they are everywhere. It dont help we have almost 2000 of them. Yeah I am that fucking weirdo that has a basement of lego. </p>

<p>It works thou. Some sets are 5 bucks and give you a variety of options to make. Or you can do your own. Currently we have 350 pounds of lose lego on the floor and maybe 700 sets built on tables. </p>

<p>The challenge with lego is finding it cheap. Lol. I have done that many times.</p>
