       While I do believe that the Annunaki exist, I don't believe they're coming back any time soon. Personally I think this Christianesque fantasy was dreamed up by new agers who would rather feel good all the time than face reality/true spirituality.

       You are aware of the ancient sumerian texts that go back thousands of years, right? Or are you suggesting that the

       of those texts was "dreamed up by new agers"?

       Sorry but Zachariah Stichen is a known freemason and his interpretations of the story are strongly debated.

       Ive never seen anything about him being a freemason before... Whered you get that?

       But regardless, it is true that his interpretations are debated. Its almost gotten to the point where im going to learn sumerian and figure it out myself...

       My girlfriend had a prophetic dream about a "war of angels" taking place this year, while I've also experienced what I'd call "warnings" about this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of all the stuff happening the world: Ukraine, Russia, Middle East and ISIS, Israel and Palestine, South America's drug cartels, Canada Australia and Britain's push to become Big Brother, Presidential elections in the next year, Yemen, Iran, Syria, Monsanto, etc. I feel like things are about to blow, but it could still be awhile...

       It's hard to describe, but they've mainly taken place during psychedelic trip meditation. I believe in the collective unconscious and the demiurge, and if I had to place a face for these feelings, they come from whatever "higher being" is watching us (alien, deity, or otherwise) or a wave in humanity's subconsciousness building from all the negativity and problems in our world.

       FWIW... i'm not trying to start a debate about personal beliefs, i'm not condemning you or demonizing you at all. I just think it's important to be very careful when opening yourself up to another 'deity' in meditation, especially psychedelic enhanced. I believe the Bible is the true word of God and it has warnings about submitting ourselves to these beings. It says to communicate with God through humble prayer. That being said, here are a few biblical warnings about prophecy and how we must "Test the Spirits" that reveal themselves to us:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A1-6&amp;amp;version=ESV">
        1 John 4:1-6
       </a>
       "Test the spirits", note verse 3
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A22-27&amp;amp;version=ESV">
        1 John 2:22-27
       </a>
       - ask the spirits if they admit that Jesus is the Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+13">
        Ezekiel 13
       </a>
       - "they have seen false visions and lying divinations... they have mislead my people." It also says "Woe to the women who sew magic bands upon all wrists, and make veils for the heads of persons of every stature, in the hunt for souls!" - magic bands in this case sounds like a type of conjuring - a parallel to psychedelics.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+cor+11%3A14-15&amp;amp;version=ESV">
        2 Corinthians 11:14-15

       But the founding of the Church of Satan in 1966 and the death of Hitler in 1945 have nothing to do with the start of the worldwide power outage in 2015

       I've heard theories for different worldwide power outages- and by power, of course, we mean electricity. I haven't heard tell of any that should be happening soon though, well, maybe when the poles shift? Though "they" say it won't affect anything.

       they're supposed to return, but I keep seeing articles about Annunaki; The Book of Enoch, the Hopi Nation's story, etc, I liked the Hopi version, I thought it was easier to read &amp; it's starting to seem real.

       Well, technically I dont need salvation because I was "saved" Dec 7 1998. But yes, religion is used to control you. It's used to shape the way you think, especially in regard to Israel. It is also a playbook for the NWO. Everything in the Bible is vague so it can be interpreted by the reader to mean what they want it to mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, are you open minded enough like I was to look into this? Or are you close minded to the point to where you're like: Nope, Im right. God's real. Satan has now taken over your heart and you're going to hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went thru a severe depression once I realized religion isn't real. It took me a while to get over it.

       Basically, everything is an illusion to keep us hating each other, and poor, and slaves. We're all slaves, but you as a Christian will never unite with a Muslim because YOU fear HIM, which is what they want. As long as we're segregated by race, religion, sex, sexual preference, language, we'll continue to be slaves.

       Wow dude, you completely projected yourself on me. In that statement you described yourself, not me. There is still a lot of hate in you and it's clouding your thoughts.

       lol well maybe you'll talk to me. Religion yes has been created by man, Religion is a belief system that requires physical obligations to be a "believer". Yahweh set up the law and no man could abide by it, Yahshua, Yahweh manifested in or out of a physical body, fulfilled the law which he instituted, so as to institute his law within us (Deffinition of your conscience). He said those that follow Yahweh must follow in spirit and in truth. Yahweh did away with physical following, Currently all religions follow physically, Carnaly following Yahweh is the doctrine of the devil because it denys Yahshuas death, your salvation btw there is no being saved in Jesus the scripture says there is no other name given you can be saved by, except saving in the name of Yahshua.

       No as for your lack of faith in the bible being written by inspiration of Yahweh. The bible as understood and taught by many many religions Is erroneous and false doctrine even the messiah said there will be many false teachers in the end. Yes Christianity is false yes they are lying to the world. History also tells this tale, if you are ernestly saying you researched, did you learn about the history of modern Christianity? Did you find out that they were a "softer" sect of Catholicism? Did you find out that after the apostles died the doctrine has been soooo skewed it aint funny? Did you know that since then The seventh angel has sounded and the truth is available again? Did you know theres a book that has no lies in it and contains the knowledge of the pattern of the universe? Are you going to dismiss what im saying to you because you beileve yourself to be right? or are you going to look into the book and THEN give a responce?

       Yep, it's because I approved it.  Any other comments he's made since being shadowbanned would be invisible.  If he responded to me in here, for instance, his comment would be invisible until I hit "approve".
