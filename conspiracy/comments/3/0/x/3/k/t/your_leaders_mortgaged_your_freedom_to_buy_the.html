        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is no &quot;Conspiracy World&quot;</p>

<p>I am an investigative journalist covering politics. &quot;Conspiracy theory&quot; is a pejorative term made up by a US government public relations department designed to discredit opposing viewpoints.</p>

<p>We have no &#39;new conspiracies&#39; because the conspiracy is out in the open now. We lived through the first movie and now we&#39;re in the sequel. We figured out all the secrets, blew up the death star, but the death star was a secret project.No one even knew about it but the rebels. And they were building tons of them. The empire might not be all powerful, but it is still there and now it is Striking Back. 
And we better not give up before Death Star version two is complete.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t even bother to hide it.</p>

<p>&quot;Jade Helm&quot;? Are you kidding me?</p>

<p>China is our biggest creditor and you use the word JADE in your domestic 
insurrection drills???</p>

<p>What do you think the military will be enforcing on the people? The big reveal is coming -- that their inheritance, homeland and birthright has been secretly mortgaged to China to pay for a Chinese-style totalitarian control grid right here at home.</p>

<p>But what are we going to do; rehash how every war since 1812 has been fought on false pretense? How the British royal family invented the slave trade in the 1600s? </p>

<p>How George W. Bush used his daddy&#39;s influence to dodge the draft or how his daddy killed JFK or how his daddy&#39;s daddy&#39;s bank was behind the &quot;German economic miracle&quot; that Hitler got credit for. Should we re-hash 9/11 and Boston and Michael Hastings and David Crowley and Anwar al-Awlaki over and over ad infinitum?</p>

<p>We&#39;re at the point where there isn&#39;t much left that is secret. Whistleblowers have come out of the NSA,CIA,WorldBank, UN, Federal Reserve. The only problem now is trying to piece together who is real, who is controlled, who is insane, what is really happening and what (95%) is gov&#39;t promoted bullshit --the Alien connection-- or just normal human bullshit --the spiritual connection.</p>

<p>When we strip what is left we get this:</p>

<p>False flags, mind domination, slavery, hate, envy, evil, psychopathy-- are all real and abundant in this world.</p>

<p>Pollution and overconsumption are destroying the ecosystem, nature, our bodies, minds, and our very DNA.</p>

<p>The lifestyle that is causing these problems isn&#39;t the only way to live, but the people who have been running our society for generations aren&#39;t ready to let us evolve.</p>

<p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a new conspiracy theory.  It&#39;s called, &quot;The fall of the NWO&quot; and it goes something like this.</p>

<p>Realizing the west has built a global financial system that is not only wholly corrupt and unworkable, but is also being used to suck unbelievable amounts of money out of the real economy and into the black economy, the east decides to build a new system.</p>

<p>Along with creating this new independent financial system, they also create enormous new economic corridor projects for trade.</p>

<p>They make the new system transparent, unlike the old system. Also, to work in the new system you need to bring real assets, not fake fiat debt monies like the old system is built on.</p>

<p>Sick and tired of being stuck playing in the only casino in town where every single game is rigged for the house to win, the entire world very rapidly moves to using the new eastern financial system. Leaving the NWO behind to play with themselves in their own filthy nest.</p>

<p>The power of the NWO comes from having complete control of the global financial system, so they can suck all the money out and into their black economy.</p>

<p>Having lost total control, their financial &quot;instruments&quot; no longer accepted anywhere, and their mechanisms for stealing the peoples wealth shut off, the NWO loses their stranglehold.  They can&#39;t buy off people anymore, the can&#39;t pay for their private armies, and all their secret programs and projects dependent on that massive black budget fall apart. </p>

<p>They wither away and die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>BRICS - Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa </p>

<p>Loose &#39;alliance&#39; of emerging economies, they could form a new bloc to challenge the Anglo-American one.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/parag-khanna/new-brics-bank_b_5600027.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/parag-khanna/new-brics-bank_b_5600027.html</a></p>

<p>Russia got heavily involved in Syria and Ukraine, which were attacks by the west on their allies and assets. Libya was in there too, Gaddafi wanted to move Africa off the petrodollar and towards a gold dinar. You saw what happened to him. The US, wahhabi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, were trying to overthrow Assad to damage Iran (another ally of Russia). They managed to take out Yanukovich and drop Ukraine into a civil war. Iran is now heavily involved in fighting in Iraq and Syria, and Yemen is starting to pop off. Russia has its hands full just keeping its few remaining allies afloat. It&#39;s not unlikely that the Resistance Axis (some BRICS countries and Iran) will lose these wars and the banksters will win. Russia is in no position to challenge American hegemony at this point except in a suicidal nuclear exchange where they might come out on top (as in 12 russians live and only 8 americans do). </p>

<p>The only way global capital can be defeated is if we the people take them out from the inside. Burn the rich, class war now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Income tax is basically theft and definitely unconstitutional.  However, sales tax is a valid and acceptable way to fund infrastructure based projects (Projects that benefit the society as a whole) such as road maintenance, healthcare, and education. Only in a functioning, non-corrupt system though. Our government abuses taxes and uses most of the money to fund war or other greedy endeavors. Personally, I don&#39;t comply with income taxes, ever since the truth of how backwards and evil our government is really sank in.</p>

<p>All of the above is based on my personal opinion, just to clarify.</p>

I don&#39;t know what the easy solution is, in fact I doubt there even is one, but we need to acknowledge the problems in their entirety before they can be addressed and the fact is that we, the masses, provide the huge majority of the funding for these criminal governments/militaries/corporations.</p>

<p>But the beauty of it is that if every person on Earth did as he&#39;s done, there isn&#39;t really anything TPTB could do.  Widespread non-participation, that&#39;s all it would theoretically take and the whole house of cards comes tumbling down.</p>

<p>Of course, <strong>far</strong> easier said than done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.</p>

<p>One of the thoughts I keep coming back to when I try to snap myself out of the &quot;conspiracy mindset&quot; is that so much money is spent demonizing certain ideas. How could so many independent people be saying (and arguably demonstrating conclusively in others) the same things? How is it possible for many independents to reach a similar conclusion while simultaneously being rebuked uniformly by &quot;official&quot; sources? </p>

<p>It is sufficiently proven in a number of ways that online discourse is heavily moderated by a number of groups with clear conflicts of interest. How much money in America is spent on PR / Advertising? Indeed the very website you read now is made possible by it. The NSA has ridiculous &quot;fusion centers&quot; set up everywhere that are staffed by hundreds of people and massive amounts of processing power. We know elements of the USG have spent money on financing &quot;artificial personalities&quot; for the purposes of participating in online discourse. </p>

<p>What do you think these people are doing?</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;d like to digress for a bit of speculation. Starting with the money; why would individuals who have very little potential income to gain risk tremendous personal difficulty and perhaps safety to come forward with ideas or evidence against persons or groups resulting in massive financial losses for said persons or groups? Not including the potential criminal charges or international ramifications, it would seem to me that the financial incentive alone would compel these persons or groups to do whatever they could to insure that these individuals were defamed, debunked, ridiculed, humiliated, incarcerated or perhaps even killed. If unrelated parties chime in, all the better to spin up the circlejerk and insure the concern is never really addressed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect your views and I certainly understand the need to get that out once in a while.  It can be a daunting, lonely existence as we do our best to separate propaganda, from lies, from the truth.  It can be incredibly depressing as we pour over documents that the government never intended us to have access to.</p>

<p>Keep fighting the good fight.  Regardless of our own separate beliefs, which are still - at the root - being tugged by social engineering that we strive to discard, we are all on the same team here.  We all want the truth.  </p>

<p>I welcome any and all perceptions of our reality, as I feel that&#39;s one of the only ways that we can expand our minds and see things in a different light.  This is regardless of what the specific views or beliefs may be.</p>

<p>Best wishes.</p>
