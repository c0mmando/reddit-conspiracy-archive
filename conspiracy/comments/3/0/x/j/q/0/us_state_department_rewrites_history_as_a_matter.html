        Have readers noticed that recently U.S. government and White House “mouth pieces” have taken to rewriting history? Below is a perfect example where the U.S. State Department’s spokesperson is talking about a ‘long-standing’ policy regarding overthrowing foreign governments.

        State Department Announces New "Long-standing" Policy Against Backing Coups

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Did readers catch that numerous individuals, including government leaders, e.g., Russian, Venezuelan, Syrian, would dispute and challenge Psaki’s rather ‘vituperative’ remarks, plus those U.S. journalists who did just that, at that press conference?
       </p>
       <p>
        Have readers noticed the snide tenor exercised toward journalists who are being ‘schooled’ by government employees and/or bureaucrats. After all, don’t bureaucrats work for us? Who pays their salaries? Our tax dollars! Shouldn’t we expect honesty, transparency, less putdown and, certainly, no rewrites of history, which obviously is happening on a daily basis by using controlled spin and the media?
       </p>
       <p>
        To set the U.S. State Department’s record straight and not rewrite history, here are the overthrows, or attempts, that the U.S. government has been involved in since the 1950s according to William Blum, an official critic of U.S. foreign policy, historian and author.

       "Whoa, whoa, whoa! The US has a long-standing practice of not promoting, what did you say? How long-standing is that? In particular, South and Latin America...that is

       a long-standing practice."

       I love how she uses the term "long-standing" and then replies with "my point here, without getting into history..."

       Thomas Jefferson was the first Secretary of State; and he lied to suit his own political puposes, directly contravening the policies of Washington.  G. Washington finally got wise and had a falling out with Jeff.; consequently Jefferson did not dare to attend Washington's funeral.  TLDR: the US State Department was been lying from the time of it's inception.
