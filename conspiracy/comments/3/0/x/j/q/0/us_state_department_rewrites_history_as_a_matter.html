<blockquote>
<p>Have readers noticed that recently U.S. government and White House “mouth pieces” have taken to rewriting history? Below is a perfect example where the U.S. State Department’s spokesperson is talking about a ‘long-standing’ policy regarding overthrowing foreign governments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;As a matter of long-standing policy, the United States does not support political transitions by nonconstitutional means. Political transitions must be democratic, constitutional, peaceful and legal.&quot;</p>

<p>--Spokesperson Jen Psaki </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=frO1T3vZNrA">State Department Announces New &quot;Long-standing&quot; Policy Against Backing Coups</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did readers catch that numerous individuals, including government leaders, e.g., Russian, Venezuelan, Syrian, would dispute and challenge Psaki’s rather ‘vituperative’ remarks, plus those U.S. journalists who did just that, at that press conference?</p>

<p>Have readers noticed the snide tenor exercised toward journalists who are being ‘schooled’ by government employees and/or bureaucrats. After all, don’t bureaucrats work for us? Who pays their salaries? Our tax dollars! Shouldn’t we expect honesty, transparency, less putdown and, certainly, no rewrites of history, which obviously is happening on a daily basis by using controlled spin and the media?</p>

<p>To set the U.S. State Department’s record straight and not rewrite history, here are the overthrows, or attempts, that the U.S. government has been involved in since the 1950s according to William Blum, an official critic of U.S. foreign policy, historian and author. </p>

<p><a href="http://williamblum.org/essays/read/overthrowing-other-peoples-governments-the-master-list">There are more than 50!</a></p>

<p>Instances of the United States overthrowing, or attempting to overthrow, a foreign government since the Second World War. (* indicates successful ouster of a government)</p>

<p>&quot;Whoa, whoa, whoa! The US has a long-standing practice of not promoting, what did you say? How long-standing is that? In particular, South and Latin America...that is <em>not</em> a long-standing practice.&quot;</p>

<p>I love how she uses the term &quot;long-standing&quot; and then replies with &quot;my point here, without getting into history...&quot;</p>

<p>Don&#39;t fucking invoke the past and then backtrack. </p>

<p>Reminds me of that god awful White House presstitute who didn&#39;t even know what the Bay of Pigs was, haha.</p>

<p>I always say, it is always the opposite.  This should be one of the best examples of them doing/saying the opposite in order to reprogram people.  New people come up and unless this is quashed.....they will believe the lie.</p>
