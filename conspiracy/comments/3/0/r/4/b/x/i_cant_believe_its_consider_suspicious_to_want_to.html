    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s weird to think about but corporations and our government own much of the desired land in this country.   Whether it&#39;s downtown areas or state beaches,  we have to get permission to visit these places.  What prevents us from starting a business for the people?  Not a charity or anything but a kickstarter where the whole premise is that folks can invest whatever amount the want to form an organization that invests/builds /grows,  democratically within itself by its community.   A la The Green Bay Packers are owned by the season ticket holders.   I don&#39;t know what this organization would do,  but man it&#39;d sure be nice to go somewhere and see the &quot;people&#39;s beach&quot;  or walk into a building in downtown Chicago that allows full access to citizens because they OWN it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m starting to think this will become more and more prevalent in our society, people having their cash seized under civil asset forfeiture. As the US government tries to force people away from using paper currency, whether through legislation banning it (or more realistically the Federal Reserve ending it and instituting a national digital currency) or through more forceful means such as the seizure of property that has been happening already. All of this progressing towards a society that uses all digital currency, first through means that exist and are used in mass today (Credit Cards, NFC, Online Transactions, etc.) Then eventually culminating to the new system which will most likely not be optional, RFID chips.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Much of the last two or three centuries was the state creating and enforcing a monopoly on violence.  Going forward, the state will monopolize privacy, which will essentially become the state monopolizing individuality.  Personal freedom is being destroyed, and corporate freedom is being stressed.  <em>But,</em> not all is lost.  There is very little stopping you from forming an S-Corp, essentially incorporating yourself.  This is how the 1% operates (obviously they get a lot more complex, but this is the start).  They change the rules of the game for everyone while really only they know the new rules, so only they can even play.  You can try to drop out of the system, but that&#39;s not really how it works; look at those sorry fucks who were busted and fined for growing perfectly legal food crops.  that probably wouldn&#39;t have happened if they were operating as a corporation.  the world is not a simple place, the game is constantly changing, and there&#39;s no way to exit or not participate in the game.  If you don&#39;t move your piece, it&#39;ll be moved for you.</p>
