       I think what's even more frustrating and scary is that unless you use a bank,  your money is effectively less valuable.   Why can't I have a personal account that isn't associated with a bank yet give me the same freedom that debit cards provide?

       . All you have to do is look into the system, you need debt, the more debt the more you can borrow. If you are financially sound and don't have debt, sorry cannot get an advance. The whole system is upside down. It's fucking insane.

       I have no idea. I checked out, or am making my way of checking out. Beer helps, makes me laugh at this shit. How people see this reality makes me laugh. I bought some land in nature, have a lake and forest to hunt food. I'm just trying to do my duty in civil disobedience. Stop buying into the system. I'm trying to hunt, fish, grow, and brew my own food/drinks. Cannot avoid state tax, but I'm not about to supply money to Walmart. We need to put our money where our mouths are. Stop feeding this beast. I'm looking into bartering and trading goods/services. I'm very new to this, so I may not be the best/most experienced help.

       Aye, people need to realize, life was not always like this. I'm a programmer, KISS (keep it simple stupid). We have been brainwashed to think right is left and up is down. People need to realize, this whole system is stupid and corrupt. I'm jaded these days. I try to help others, but they just wont listen. So, I know when to hold them when to fold them. I'm trying to help, but at my wits end. I'm down for collaborating. It's just people dont want to/cannot see it, sigh....

       It's weird to think about but corporations and our government own much of the desired land in this country.   Whether it's downtown areas or state beaches,  we have to get permission to visit these places.  What prevents us from starting a business for the people?  Not a charity or anything but a kickstarter where the whole premise is that folks can invest whatever amount the want to form an organization that invests/builds /grows,  democratically within itself by its community.   A la The Green Bay Packers are owned by the season ticket holders.   I don't know what this organization would do,  but man it'd sure be nice to go somewhere and see the "people's beach"  or walk into a building in downtown Chicago that allows full access to citizens because they OWN it.

       You can.  Well at least in UK.  We have

        pay upfront credit cards
       </a>
       that you can register in any name you like.  They cost more to run but there are no credit checks.  Well, last time I used one ( couple of years ago) anyway it was in a different name and to an address that wasn't mine.

       I'm sorry officer, but I learned that if banks fail, they can now take your money to cover for their failure.  You may want to pull your money out of the banks as well, because they are highly leveraged.

       I'm starting to think this will become more and more prevalent in our society, people having their cash seized under civil asset forfeiture. As the US government tries to force people away from using paper currency, whether through legislation banning it (or more realistically the Federal Reserve ending it and instituting a national digital currency) or through more forceful means such as the seizure of property that has been happening already. All of this progressing towards a society that uses all digital currency, first through means that exist and are used in mass today (Credit Cards, NFC, Online Transactions, etc.) Then eventually culminating to the new system which will most likely not be optional, RFID chips.

       It's all about control. If one is willing to forgo convenience and any sort of safety net, it is still possible to exist outside the system. Without a physical currency it is impossible to exist outside the system.

       Much of the last two or three centuries was the state creating and enforcing a monopoly on violence.  Going forward, the state will monopolize privacy, which will essentially become the state monopolizing individuality.  Personal freedom is being destroyed, and corporate freedom is being stressed.
       <em>
        But,
       </em>
       not all is lost.  There is very little stopping you from forming an S-Corp, essentially incorporating yourself.  This is how the 1% operates (obviously they get a lot more complex, but this is the start).  They change the rules of the game for everyone while really only they know the new rules, so only they can even play.  You can try to drop out of the system, but that's not really how it works; look at those sorry fucks who were busted and fined for growing perfectly legal food crops.  that probably wouldn't have happened if they were operating as a corporation.  the world is not a simple place, the game is constantly changing, and there's no way to exit or not participate in the game.  If you don't move your piece, it'll be moved for you.

       because if everyone would run for the bank and withdraw their money and saving, all bank would closes, the money supply would run dry and this would crash the usa economy.
      </p>

       so they limit people withdrawal and now they want to make sure all your cash is in you bank so they will force you to buy expensive stuff threw a specific method to keep track of you even more.
