    <div class="md"><p>Specially with the reputation the website as a whole has gained and the mass exodus of &quot;socially&quot; accepted yet questionable subs that we have seen banned ( I won&#39;t name them for fear of being labled, but I know you have been around long enough to know what I&#39;m talking about). We are on a short list here at r/conspiracy. Their already exists or will be a planted mod that will render this sub much less &quot;free speech&quot; or they will find a way to have some sort of &quot;event&quot; or whatever that labels us (maybe even more) irrelevant.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know... Sometimes I wonder if I am the crazy &quot;tin foil&quot; one for suspecting something like this to happen. But I just think it is pretty much a matter of time.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s tinfoil at all. We&#39;re all here for a reason - it&#39;s one of the last places on this site where you don&#39;t have to navigate through a bunch of bullshit to get something posted/approved.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s a <em>somewhat free exchange</em> of ideas here, give or take, and a reason users coalesce here. And at some point it will get snuffed out.</p>

<p>My advice?</p>

<p>Enjoy the show. Try and see the humor in it, keep all your eyes open, and treat everyone here (and IRL) with the respect they deserve until they have proven that they don&#39;t deserve it anymore.</p>

<p>Glad you stayed true to your username, by the way. I like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your feedback! I have been following you and your account in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for a little while now. One of my biggest concerns/worries is the loss of this sub and finding a congregation or people who are willing to think critically lie I do.

    <div class="md"><p>I have had similar thoughts. Whole issue would be making sure it wasn&#39;t hosted on an actual &quot;hosting&quot; site. Some one putting it up on their on server that could be accessed if given the credntials (granted my thought is at this point open forums aren&#39;t a viable option). I have a couple ideas my self and the means to host. Send me a pm if you feel like discussing a little more about it! </p>

<p>I think you should put out a open forum of your own! It would be a good discussion ground! Don&#39;t be afraid to reach out if you want some help with any tech help. This is one of my alts</p>

<p>That&#39;s fine, to an extent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you in your own way do what you can do to end it, why not?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Advocating <em>cyber attacks</em> is no different from advocating physical violence at this point, and I rarely see it (if at all) in this sub, so your post is suspect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are a <strong>script kiddie</strong> don‘t hack what you can‘t. But if you can get info get it and post it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t think they still used the word script kiddie. How old is your script?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We the people have the power!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure. Bit we don&#39;t need to be advocating cyber crimes here. And I doubt most users here would even know how to start. So this is double plus ungood.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let‘s not give it away so easily. We all know in america voting doesn‘t work.  Let‘s start it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Organize yourself locally and physically then. Figure out what your community wants and find out of their satisfied, and if not, offer solutions and try and run for office. What&#39;s your solution?/DDOSing something? Which one&#39;s more productive?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don‘t sit idly by, until all the pieces are in place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most here aren&#39;t. They are reading, listening, and paying attention. They are getting organized, but for positive purposes. Not negative ones. Perhaps this isn&#39;t the forum for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That‘s what i am saying.  Or else don‘t bitch about shit!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can bitch about whatever I want, which certainly includes this post.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t bother replying, I will no longer engage you after this. And I suggest others do the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your mind is where the battle field is! Learn to control that first!</p>

<p>My message was specifically to the people that have the power and position to do things.  </p>

<p>I do not prefer another cold war, i prefer peace, but i see so many people about to starve, needlessly!!!  </p>

<p>Fuck it!  We are not standing for it.  Hack what you can hack, destroy what you can destroy. Let‘s end this multi-national control!!!</p>

<p>If they gave back, cool. But they are literally sucking the life-blood out of all nations. </p>

<p>Let‘s end it!!! Now, fuck it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your feedback! I have been following you and your account in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for a little while now. One of my biggest concerns/worries is the loss of this sub and finding a congregation or people who are willing to think critically lie I do. Do we have a back up plan if this place is banned or made private? I just would kind of be lost without this place. </p>
