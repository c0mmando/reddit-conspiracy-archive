       This sub won't let me post it as a link because it's on facebook. I think she posted it on Facebook because she didn't have any other way to reach out to the public. 
This is a fifteen minute video in which she speaks about her uncle (who works in ASIO)  threatening her with psychological control tactics that would end in her taking her own life, if she spoke out about how he sexually assaulted her. 
When she tried to tell the police what happened to her and what he threatened her with, they tried to make her think she was crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will post the link in the comments

       What I got from the video (feel free to correct any mistake) :
       <br/>
       _ girl's uncle was a member of the Australian Navy for 17 years, worked in communications
       <br/>
       _ she lived with him when he sexually abused her. She lived 7 months with him
       <br/>
       _ they had a conversation together
       <br/>
       _ during the convo her uncle tells her it's possible to isolate people, cutting them from friends/family etc
       <br/>
       _ the goal is to "send them mental"
       <br/>
       _ he tells her it's possible to hire hospital rooms for money and drive people crazy there
       <br/>
       _ he mentions the information is available on the internet
       <br/>
       _ he threatened to lock her up, if she ever spoke about the sexual abuse
      </p>
      <p>
       Later as she went to the police station (in Sydney?) the police officer didn't believe her and called an ambulance to lock her  in a place with no windows, no privacy, no doctors for days. She was later released by a doc who said she had no reason to be there

       Of course he would say anything to try and convince her not to go to the authorities, who unfortunately bungled it.

       At any rate this guy's abuse of her is out in the open now.

       Wow... So she mentions that the information is available on the internet if you know where to look. Has anyone tried looking? I'm at work or else I'd try and I know there's many qualified researchers on here that could do it!

       Edit: Does anyone know where she is right now? Is she safe?

       She scratches a letter

       into a wall made of stone

       maybe some day another child
       <br/>
       won't feel as alone as she does
       <br/>
       it's been two years and counting

       since they put her in this place

       she's been diagnosed by some stupid fuck
