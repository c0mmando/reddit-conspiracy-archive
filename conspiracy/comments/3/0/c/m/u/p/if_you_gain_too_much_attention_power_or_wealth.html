       There are, but we've been conditioned to not believe in them. If you think in terms of vibrations, there are higher vibrational energies that are in a sense, a condensation of the aggregate good done in the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you start walking the right path and carving it out yourself, you become receptive to these energies and they assist you in progressing along that path. The way this works out isn't obvious at first, but you start to see it in little synchronicities, or flashes of insight, but as you start to let these in, you become receptive to more and more, and eventually you're getting more and more miraculous manifestations of divine assistance.

       While I'm not sure it qualifies as conspiracy, I recommend watching the youtube channel Spirit Science. I can't quite recall which video it is, but they somewhat may help explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       It discusses things such as
Chakras , math of the universe and how it works, crystals, meditation, sacred geometry, and other things. I've yet to fully watch al of them but in an earlier video they do discuss "vibrations".
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope this might help.

       Spirit science is pretty cool. I've watched a few of their videos and I didn't think it was a waste of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that Metaphysics is going to become as big as mainstream science is now in the near future.

       Have you ever heard of
       <a href="https://youtu.be/WaYvYysQvBU">
        cymatics
       </a>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially what I'm trying to convey is the same principle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your heart and brain have their own electrical activity. There is also a background of electromagnetic radiation which can interact with your electrical activity. Depending upon which frequencies you tune into, you can generate forms within the electrical field of your brain (consciousness) and heart (feelings). What is generated can be thought of as insights, or forms of various universal ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this context, a state of fear would emit vibrations/be receptive to vibrations from a lower frequency and love would emit/attract more positive energy from the higher vibrations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that help at all?

       To be fair, the first Illuminati were a secret society within Freemasonry who were devoted to killing all the kings of Europe. Fuck Monarchy. If there is a neo illuminati I hope their aim is as noble.

       Actually if the NWO stuff turns out to be true we can imagine that there is a cabal of people working towards eroding government towards something new and never before seen. Whatever good things you have to say about democracy or republics or whatever. Don't get too attached to them, remember that they're really just inventions and we'll invent something better eventually.

       In my opinion some form of communism is the only way we can live in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are on the brink of the next industrial revolution. Most jobs can and will be replaced by automated machines in the future and without some form of altruism and communism a lot of people would die hungry.

       How old is communism, socialism, capitalism? They're just inventions. Recent inventions at that. And I don't think it makes sense that leaders of a new world order are trying to bring back something ancient. I think they've got their eyes on something new. Globalism really is the best word for it.

       That probably depends.   What is your definition of Good?   It seems Good and Evil can be rather subjective terms.   Some people may tell you NO and have a completely different interpretation on Good.   It may also be people telling you YES and having a very different interpretation.

       If they were truely "good" and seeking to improve the world, they wouldn't hide in the shadows, they'd boldly march forth in rightousness. But they can't, because in the end, thier plan required the cover of darkness, and that tells me that while there are good ppls that have been illuminati (Jefferson for one), the organaztion itself is pretty much Satan's cartel.

       It would seem that way - definitely - but this is actually not necessarily the case.  You can often aid someone a lot more by subtly helping them find the solution to their issues themselves and on their own rather than simply handing them the answers without their doing the amount of work that they'd need to in order for the lesson to REALLY sink in.

       One never learns to ride a bike by simply being told, for example.  They have to get on the bike and do it themselves - get the scraped knees and bloody elbows and everything.  They'll never learn otherwise.

       Well said. Any situation in which your relinquish the responsibility for your situation to another being is setting yourself up to be exploited. Ultimately we have to realise this power in ourselves and act with conviction towards creating the reality we want. As soon as we do that, we find that there is a great many positive beings cheering us on and waiting to assist us in making that journey much easier for us than it would seem at the first step.

       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/c7gwqaz">
        a pretty serious school of thought
       </a>
       that posits that the
       <em>
        reason
       </em>
       why the elite structure that exists on this planet is full of such deceit and tricks and chicanery is so that the human species can develop the necessary skills, ability, and wisdom necessary to
       <em>
        overcome
       </em>
       the problems and evolve into the next level of consciousness - something it's said would not be possible
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       the difficulties spurring the species on toward further evolving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, pretty mind-blowing if you think about all these horrible problems in this civilization that way.

       Yes I have.  Some predictions it made were not accurate, of course, and some of the specific dates and quantitative data it posed did not coincide with what actually happened.  However, its
       <em>
        qualitative
       </em>
       information and the ultimate, holistic message behind the interview is what is of most importance and, in fact, holds, deep, deep relevance regarding what one can do to evolve themselves further and move forward as an intelligent being.

       Hunting wizards cause it's right
Hunting wizards day and night
Gooooooo wizard hunters!!!!

       True that the illuminati wanted the end of the monarchies but what they also wanted and what the jews want today is basically communism.

       It's the usual tactic of co-opting and taking over organizations with good intentions to turn them into a tool for evil.

       Might be of interest, the link itself is shadowbanned though (try it yourself and log out, comment doesn't appear).

       While I'm not sure it qualifies as conspiracy, I recommend watching the youtube channel Spirit Science. I can't quite recall which video it is, but they somewhat may help explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       It discusses things such as
Chakras , math of the universe and how it works, crystals, meditation, sacred geometry, and other things. I've yet to fully watch al of them but in an earlier video they do discuss "vibrations".
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope this might help.

       Have you ever heard of
       <a href="https://youtu.be/WaYvYysQvBU">
        cymatics

       ?

       Essentially what I'm trying to convey is the same principle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your heart and brain have their own electrical activity. There is also a background of electromagnetic radiation which can interact with your electrical activity. Depending upon which frequencies you tune into, you can generate forms within the electrical field of your brain (consciousness) and heart (feelings). What is generated can be thought of as insights, or forms of various universal ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this context, a state of fear would emit vibrations/be receptive to vibrations from a lower frequency and love would emit/attract more positive energy from the higher vibrations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that help at all?
