       Normally in the month of April do human sacrifices occur, but I can see it happening between March - May. Around these months expect to be extra vigilant with so called 'accidents' and 'incidents' concerning mass casualties.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       people assume that things are different now than what it was in the past with the human sacrifices (like the mayans, etc). Fact is, nothings changed.

       I mean, the biggest human sacrifice campaign happened within the last hundred years (holocaust). Wow did the sellouts deliver murdering an untold number of civilians just to appease their gods.

       Exactly.  I could think of no scenario where Pilot 2 deliberately makes the moves to lock out pilot 1, except with foul play.  If Pilot 2 died, Pilot 1 would still be able to get back in.  So it was a deliberate lock out.
      </p>
      <p>
       But imagine they follow procedure, and a flight attendant comes in to the pit while Pilot 1 goes to the potty.  Now the flight attendant disables Pilot 2, and locks the door, and moves the throttle into a downward slope until impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems it would take only one bad flight attendant, a low level employee, to create this scenario.

       But the voice data recorders are sensitive enough to pick up on the co-pilot's breathing pattern, and there's no evidence (conversation, movements, breathing) that there was a flight attendant in the cockpit at the time.

       Yes, there would. They would need to 1) Know how to operate the cockpit door override to stop the pilot from using the emergency keypad in the cabin to reenter the cockpit and 2) Know how to disengage or reprogram the autopilot in order to put the plane into a descent.

       But isn't there the auto-pilot over-ride which would stop some random person from intentionally crashing the plane?

       If someone were to disguise themselves as a pilot long enough into the flight to do this, they would have to be trained well enough in the systems and take off procedures. Pilot one would have thought something was amiss if they didn't do the checklists properly for example.

       As I recall from that or a similar article, the 2nd blackbox was very badly damaged and the memory card had been dislodged. They had a picture of a very mangled looking blackbox, but it may not have been the one from the crash.

       Since when have black boxes been replaced with digital cameras? These things don't have "memory cards" that can be removed externally...unless this thing hit the earth with a force unimaginable for the aircraft it couldn't have damaged the black box.

       A quick Google search shows that the crushed part of the FDR is the interface portion of the unit. The "memory card" (stack of memory chips) are housed in the undamaged cylinder. That cylinder is the most protected part of the recorder.

       Alternate theory: Pilot puts rooffies in Copilot's coffee, waits for C to doze off. P sets autopilot and heads aft, the door locks behind him. P makes half hearted attempt to open door. Pilot now appears to be the victim.

       The official version is now that the copilot commited suicide and dragged 149 people with him to death.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are mainly 2 things that are suspect to me (about the flight recorder):
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Why were there no last words from the copilot on the flight recorder? If I wanted to kill myself and drag over a hundred people with me, I would for sure tell the world why.
       </li>
       <li>
        If the captain was locked out of the cockpit, why wasn't he talking to the copilot? Only "knocks" on the door and screaming voices from the passengers have been reported so far. If I was the captain I would have tried to convince my copilot to change his mind. Either by shouting at the door or talking via the radio equipment.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Nothing like this has been reported to be found on the flight recorder. Maybe there were technical difficulties which caused the plane to crash and the airline wants to hide it to get arround the millions of compensations they would have to pay the dependants. Furthermore don't forget about their reputation. Germanwings would be ruined if a technical flaw had caused the crash.

       Why would the airline try to cover up technical difficulties to not pay insurance compensation? Why would they rather go with Co-pilot suicide, which means the plane intentionally crashed rather than accidentally, which means insurance compensation would be astronomically higher than if it were by accident? Doesn't make sense Jobe. Lufthansa (owner of germanwings) would have its reputation tarnished for sure over an accident, but not ruined. What would ruin it is if one of its pilots commit a tragedy like this.

       You can't fault a whole company for the sick mind of a single employee of them. If it was in fact the copilot who killed everyone, this would mean that it could have happened to any other flight as well. Mad people can be found everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are very strict rules for the maintenance of airliners. This is just an idea, but lets assume something went wrong there and either Lufthansa (Germanwings) or Airbus knowingly ignored a technical issue. It doesn't even have to be deliberately. Maybe someone just forgot to tighten some screws, whatever. So wether it was with or without their knowledge (the first case is worse of course), this would actualy be a very good reason to try to cover something up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word "ruined" is a bit exaggerated, I can see that. But we're still talking about millions if not billions of euros here. It's not just about the compensation they would have to pay. The value of their stocks would suffer immensely and don't forget about the missing of future earnings because people would rather decide to book from a different airline.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has happened before that companies ignored mechanical problems especialy if a lot of their machines had the same flaw. Maybe there was no particular regulation for the exact part which wasn't completely safe. I can see that a company would decide to let it stay as it is rather than changing the same part of every plane they own for a ton of money. Their engineers could have evaluated the chances of something happening as minimal (it doesn't even need to be a serial flaw for that). Their bosses would then be like "fuck it, we're a budget airline, let's save the money and take the off chance of something happening". An engineer wouldn't take the risk for sure, but a businessman could decide like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just making up ideas. Imo something along these lines could have possibly happened and it would definitely be Airbus/Lufthansas fault.

       It was reported he was .. (wait for it) .. under pychological "treatment" right up until he flew the jet into the side of a mountain. We will never know what these lizards were doing to this guy behind closed doors, because muh 'patient privacy', I guess. The only place where 100% privacy exists are the psych treatment records of mass killers or FF patsies, even after they are dead and MSM famous. This case will be no exception.

       I suppose one could argue that all these cases are acts of terrorism. The idea that some people in this world want to kill themselves (for whatever reason) and think it's a good idea to take 100+ people with them is pretty terrifying.

       Terrorism is terror used for a political purpose. If someone is apolitically terrifying, like the clown at my 8th birthday party, it's not terrorism.

       I agree, that is a completely valid statement.  I would counter that a terrorist act is usually done for a cause or specific goal, whereas suicide is usually someone wanting to end their own life due to personal reasons.  I can't argue with your statement that crashing a plane with 100+ passengers on it is completely terrifying.  That must have been horrible for the passengers on board.

       You're right about that. But look at MH17. The investigation showed that the plane was shot down by a ukrainian fighter jet, yet everyone still thinks it were pro russians because this was everything our mass media reported.

       That's not what I was talking about. I know that the photo was fake. Although I have to correct myself from earlier, "the investigation showed" is wrong in this case. However we're still waiting for an independant analysis of the black box recordings. What I was talking about is

       Am I the only one that thinks we are getting answers way too fast. I have watched enough Air Disaster episodes to know that plane crash investigations take weeks if not months to come to a conclusion. I find it odd that they are so quick to label the copilot as the bad guy.

       They found the black box recorder, (which is difficult to find in a situation ex: where a plane crashes into the ocean rather than an accessible terrain). Additionally they were able to quickly locate the crash site, which adds to the quick timing of the results coming to fruition.

       Air Disaster episodes shows the official investigation through it's process. It does not cover the wild speculations and conclusions that emerge as information begins to trickle out. It will likely be a very long time before the investigators release the official report. And that's what you see on TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we have right now is the cockpit recorder, the investigation is far from finished.

       Good point, however I still don't think they would reveal what was found on the voice recorder so soon. I could be wrong, but it doesn't seem right to me, especially when a man's reputation is on the line.

       They found the voice recorder, they had the contents of it and likely had listened to it the day they found it. At that point there is nothing to stop someone from telling the world about it's content.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean the evidence so far does seem to point to the co-pilot.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also possible the French may be overly eager to announce that there was no mechanical failure in order to protect Airbus as company.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the investigation is far from finished, there is still a significant mountain (I know... I'm horrible) of evidence to go through.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I do think it's important that people who want to follow the case do keep an open mind and don't jump to conclusions quite yet.

       Sorry, but this article makes no sense to me. Why would they hide it if he was actualy related to islamic terrorism? History has shown that rather the opposite is the case. People who are muslims are often labeled as islamists although the connection is rather uncertain. If there was any possible connection to islamists we would have know for sure even moments after the crash.

       FlightRadar24 reports the autoflight altitude was changed to 100ft shortly after the co-pilot locked the pilot out:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Between 09:30:52 and 09:30:55 we can see that the autopilot was manually changed from 38,000 feet to 100 feet and 9 seconds later the aircraft started to descend, probably with the "open descent" autopilot setting.
The reason why the selected altitude is 96ft is that least significant bit for altitude setting equals 16 ft, and we suspect that you can’t set autopilot to 0000 altitude, so the minimum would be 100ft down rounded to 96ft in binary representation in BDS40h register.

       So say the co-pilot wanted to do this deliberately.  How did he know the pilot would get up so soon to use the bathroom?  Seems like a short enough flight that they could have both just stayed in the cockpit the whole time.  So what was the plan if the pilot never got up?  That seems odd to me.

       Nearly every flight of any length at all I've ever been on has had one or both of the pilots take turns going to the lavatory at some point during the flight.   If the guy's plan was to crash the plane killing himself and 149 random people he probably didn't care if he did it on this flight or the next or the next.  At some point, procedures do not preclude it, he is going to be on the flight deck alone.

       This actually has me thinking now of the previous flights the co-pilot was on... hundreds of people (if not more depending on how long he may have waited for the opportunity) could have been one pee break away from death....

       Sorry, but it doesn't seem odd to me at all. If there was a plan while the other pilot was in the cockpit, it certainly would have been more difficult to pull off than with him outside the cockpit. Seems to me like he just took advantage of the situation.

       Maybe he just took the opportunity, or perhaps he has tried in the past and the other pilot didn't get up to goto the bathroom which thwarted the plan previously? that would make some sense that it was just a random act and not targeted to anyone?

       My question isn't about why the pilot went to the bathroom.  My question is about how the co-pilot was counting on him to leave.  With that flight, the pilot
       <em>
        could have
       </em>
       stayed in the cockpit the whole time, so having him leave at just that time couldn't have been part of a plan.  Most likely, this was a spontaneous "well, now's a good time!" kind of thing.

       Agreed. Its also possible the guy has a habit of getting up after takeoff and the copilot knew it. These guys live by their routines.

       I agree, a plan to kill one's self and 150 others is not likely to rest on the "opportunity" that someone

       You're right, it isn't. What's likely is that he meant to overpower the other pilot, but rather took advantage of an opening for an easier alternative. Improvisation.

       There are so so many suspicious things going on here. These sorts of investigations usually take MONTHS but apparently they have it all figured out after 2 days?  Even recovering black boxes and checking them usually takes over a week. Also there were a large number of cancelled flights the day after as many pilots and crews did not want to fly. This is almost unheard of after a single plane goes down. I still think there has been a huge mechanical failure and that there is a covering up of this. I will wait for the actual investigation to be completed though, I cant believe so many people are accepting what a
       <em>
        prosecutor
       </em>
       with zero airplane knowledge is saying.

       Is a list of the passengers available anywhere? This doesn't look like a terror attack, but it does seem like a pretty clean way to disappear somebody without appearing to target them specifically. I wonder if the pilot was coerced somehow.

       I don't know enough about world politics to think of specifics, but some people are willing to strap bombs on their bodies and sacrifice themselves for a cause.  The pilot left alone in the cockpit behind the locked door could have been on a suicide mission.  For whom and why is something to think about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Some digital locks use wireless control.  This is complicated but maybe someone might take a look at this article in Popular Mechanics and have some insight:

       The section called

       shocks me someone would take out innocent people - though it has been done before

      <p>
       the pilot and co-pilot had already made one journey - did the co-pilot not have the opportunity on that journey?
      </p>
      <p>
       why wait for the second journey? was he building up the bottle to do it. I would of thought he would do it on the initial journey instead of the second.

       There are some issues with the list of passengers on board...? can anyone link me a list of passengers? anything I try and find leads to just nationality and even that is questioned because the reports are all over the place with different number of passengers of certain nationalities.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the pilot was forced to crash the plane? I mean...suicide is one thing...but mass murder is another. The amount of will power to keep a plane heading straight towards mountains for 8 minutes while you hear a man trying to beat a blast proof door down. I know murder suicide by plane crash has happened before, but those all had instant links to problems. He didn't make a sound?... no crying, no panic breathing, no nothing, like he was told to just sit there silently or else...

       If you've never heard of a plane vaporizing you need to read popular mechanics. Also I've been reading in coverage of the Alps crash that there are safe guards that prohibit a plane from being manually driven into the ground. For example a pilot can't just take control of the plane and nose dive it into the ocean, it has to be a long slow, measured descent.

       I can do a search, I read the actual issue myself but I heard there was a pdf of the infamous debunking issue floating around.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been pointed out by myself and others on this forum that the official debunking issue of popular mechanics was essentially what woke me up. Before I read it I didn't give a flying hoot about 9/11. Then I saw all the bollocks about vaporizing planes and was like "ok this some bullshit right here"

       I give credit to this airline and that country investigating for being honest with the worldwide audience. Instead of doing zionist media laced reporting, they have come forth with the truth right away.

       Just wait, they'll find on the pilot's phone that his GPS logged him as visiting the kabob place next to a mosque on a weekly basis and spin that as him being a member of ISIS.

        fled the city

       now as well. We don't know all the facts yet, and their story could be central, or it could be nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       They could have been held hostage and possibly killed, they could have been financially set for life after the matter, or they could be afraid of the backlash that would likely be targeted at them for all of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I think this crash was one part of a grander scheme by some transporation conglomerate to cut down on air travel. This is, of course, considering all of the other recent plane disappearances and crashes. Maybe because they have a new method of transportation in store, or perhaps because they want to expand upon a previously existing method. (It all started with Malaysian airlines, and has been restricted to Asia/Europe, maybe it's high-speed rail?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty much unrelated: I'd like to see airships put into play again, for short distance travel in places with high traffic. Not for safety or convenience really, more because I like to imagine a sky full of airships and how awesome that would be. I've had dreams where I'm riding up to a big city and am able to see it from tens of miles away thanks to the airships in the sky above it.

       Thanks for showing me that, I was wondering. So there must just be more media coverage on it. Which still supports my theory, someone could be putting money into media coverage to bring down public trust in air travel.

       This is hilariously nonsensical.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a transportation conglomerate wants people to stop flying this is a stupid way to do it. It would much easier to just double ticket prices, not only does this involve not killing anyone it also has the advantage of actually accomplishing their goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       This of course ignores that 2011, 2012 and 2013 were some of the safest years on record.

       Why on Earth would you assume that airliners would want to be part of a conglomerate to bring down air traffic? That's what's nonsensical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously it would be made up of entities that have interests in water or ground transport. How would they be able to control ticket prices for flights?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, raising ticket prices does nothing towards reliability. It wouldn't bring down public perception of the safety of flight. Without an immediate alternative, people still have to fly, and they still would. Whereas bringing down perception of safety will end up leading people to call for new modes of travel, rather than having them thrust upon us when we already have better alternatives. That would play right into the hands of this "transportation conglomerate."
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone else informed me that last few years have been the safest for airline travel, but they've also been the years to get the most media coverage on it. I mentioned in another reply that the increased media coverage could just as easily be funded by this most-likely imaginary transportation conglomerate.

       jim stone has an interesting take that the incident was a remote-controlled plane crash at
       <a href="http://82.221.129.208/">
        http://82.221.129.208/
       </a>
       . in his explanation, he correctly pointed out that the descent and crash must have been due to wilful intent.
      </p>
      <p>
       the official mainstream story is one of a pilot gone berserk (but not terrorism) which is pretty incredulous itself and supports jim's statement of 'wilful intent'. IMO, Jim's explanation of a remote-controlled crash is at least as plausible as the official one, and explains the 'pilot silence'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The kicker in Jim's report is whether or not fighter jets were witnessed when the plane crashed. Jim posted a daily mail report that included witnesses who saw fighter jets fly past when the plane crashed, and a second daily mail report with the 'fighter jet' detail expunged.

       Wasn't it weird how the White House came out yesterday before anyone knew anything and said "It's not terrorism."?  That struck me as odd.  Like, it's a German plane.  Has nothing to do with the US, and I think at that point we didn't even know there were Americans on that plane, and the White House is making a statement like that?  Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it might have been terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it hilarious that a sub that almost collectively agrees the WTC fell because of thermite charges secretly planted by Dick Cheney to appease his lizard people overlords finds it inconceivable that a plane crashed by a pilot with no apparent motive couldn't have possibly been part of a terrorist plot.

       They probably made that statement because it just wasn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plane was crashed in a remote area of France with nothing much but mountains around; and simply taking down a plane isn't impactful enough. We haven't heard from any "Terrorist Group" yet saying they did it, either. Not everything is a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, if you absolutely want it to be a conspiracy: they knew it wasn't terrorism because they didn't plan it.

       The FBI was contacted, as I'm sure were several agencies around the world, and background checks were done on all the passengers and crew. Likely the FBI, as well as everyone couldn't find any indications of politically or religiously motivated terrorism. Also there is thus far 0 evidence of any political or religious motivations.

       I think it's more likely that they wouldn't be willing to release that info, had they obtained anything significant,  without taking their sweet time weighing the consequences and result of said statements. It happened in France and therefore no one here is going to push our government for answers when they should be coming from the French. Its in the best interest of the FBI to play their cards close to the vest until they know how they can use this event to their advantage.

       There was a coworker of an American victim on CNN who was very composed and even smiled.  The girl hasn't even been at her  that long but the coworker claimed to know the victim well enough to give very specific, confident info about the victim and made statements like she had been coached. She then said something about the power of social media that just didn't sit right with me. Something seemed definitely weird.

       Check out the CP's FB profile. There is a weird photo on Andreas Lubitz's FB account of a cityscape. The numbers 3/0/7 are featured prominently.  I'm not usually into the numbers song, but this is very strange.  3/07 is the date MH370 went missing and also reflects the flight number.  Check it out.

       It says 3017.... you're reading between the lines far too much, even if you take the 1 as a / its 30/7. That flight is listed as going missing on the 8th anyway.

       How is that pretty incredulous (it's happened before) but a remote controlled airplane theory isn't?

       Good point, however I still don't think they would reveal what was found on the voice recorder so soon. I could be wrong, but it doesn't seem right to me, especially when a man's reputation is on the line.

       You're right, it isn't. What's likely is that he meant to overpower the other pilot, but rather took advantage of an opening for an easier alternative. Improvisation.

       Sorry, but this article makes no sense to me. Why would they hide it if he was actualy related to islamic terrorism? History has shown that rather the opposite is the case. People who are muslims are often labeled as islamists although the connection is rather uncertain. If there was any possible connection to islamists we would have know for sure even moments after the crash.
