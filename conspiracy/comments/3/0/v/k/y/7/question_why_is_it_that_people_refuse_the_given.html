       This isn't some passive aggressive post, but why is it that SOO many people refuse to believe the events that aparently happened (How they happened) on 9/11?
      </p>
      <p>
       Was it an event so spectacularly impossible that it's almost impossible to think some random ARABS could have conducted this, or is it just the human mind at best by simply refusing to believe?

       Conspiracy theories are becoming shunned and made into thoughtcrime more and more frequently. Social and educational programming are guiding all citizens to discredit all theories that oppose the status quo. Conspiracy theorists are matched with

      <p>
       With 9/11, most Americans will either question "why you would think that the government would murder 2700+ citizens?" or "Why do you care? It was 14 years ago." Patriotism has become pure stockholm syndrome, all thoughtcriminals are treated as Jihad/terrorist-sympathizers.

       I think my fellow commenters don't understand your question. I believe you are asking why someone like me, who doesn't believe the government's version of events about 9/11, thinks like I think. If I have this correct, allow me to answer. It is because the facts do not add up. I read a post recently, by a person who thinks like I do, who called those people believing the official story 'coincidence theorists'.  There are way too many coincidences. There was reluctance (actually resistance) by George Bush, Dick Cheney, etc to actually have a formal investigation into the biggest crime in the history of America. Evidence was carted away and destroyed, which is against the laws that govern criminal investigative protocols. There is building 7, which initially fell for a number of seconds at free fall speed, which is to say at the acceleration of gravity. That is the same rate of acceleration an object would experience in open air. This is not possible in a building collapse unless, somehow, the resistance of the building below was artificially removed. Explosives take weeks to prep in a controlled demolition. So these are a very few of the reasons I do not accept the governments official conspiracy theory. I do not know why what happened on 9/11 happened. There needs to be a real investigation into the mass murder of the people that died on that day.

       Anywho, it's one of those things that just seem unlikely. The people who have made your life possible are the very people set out on killing nearly 3000 innocent Americans.

       If all these un-provable theories are true, I'd honestly kind of be glad. Sure many life's where lost, but if you where a rich white guy on capital hill, wouldn't you love to trick the people of your nation to an advantage, that in the end, benefits your nation?

       You are seriously misled. Stick around here for a while, read some comments. There are plenty of highly intelligent people in this community with a great amount of knowledge. The Government doesn't make our lives possible, by any means. And most of the prosperity that this nation possesses is at the cost of millions of people in less "powerful" countries than ours. Our prosperity comes from slave labor. You have a lot of research to do.

       Also. Capitalism is a system based on greed and control. It values $ over people. The system itself it corrupt, hence the rampant corruption. There are better ways to go about living on this planet. Check out The Venus Project.

       Cui Bono  -  to whose benefit  (from the ancient Romans). In modern times this is an integral part of all criminal investigations  -  follow the money.  Funny thing, every war America got into after 9/11 benefited Israel. And before 9/11 there was a group called 'Project for a New American Century' that sent a letter to Bill Clinton in 1998 stating America needs to take over the "low hanging fruit" oil in Iraq. However, it would be hard to start a war in Iraq without a major event, like a "New Pearl Harbor". These facts are easily accessible on the net. BTW, the members of PNAC were people in and out of government, the majority of whom are American Jews or dual citizens of America and Israel. Simple math.

       Bonus Question:
Did you know that according to the official version of events 2 of the planes that day were turned into vapor. The reason that there is no evidence of them is that for the first time in history the fires from a jet crash were enough not to melt steel beams but rather to completley vaporize aluminum.

       I don't think anyone (or at least only a very few) is telling you not to believe your eyes on that day. OP is talking about the who. Unless you actually spotted the person piloting one or both of those planes, your eyes aren't the answer here.

       I think most people believe there was a plane, also.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the motivations behind the attack, who carried it out, and whether or not the fire that collapsed the towers was caused purely by the impact of those planes

       I stopped believing the official story after I read the issue of Popular Mechanics that was supposed to "debunk" the conspiracists. In that issue they say the reason there is no plane at the Pentagon or in Pennsylvania is because the intense heat vaporized the fueselage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm asking you to tell me what you think the official story is in your own words because I bet you've never really thought much about it or looked into it. I bet you can't string together a cohesive, rational timeline.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're condescending us for not believing a story that you haven't even really heard. Tell me what you think happened or look it up and tell me you still buy it.

       There seems to be a constellation of reasons. The video below (please see link) hosted by Woody Harrelson is pretty interesting. It casts too dark of a light on capitalism, in my opinion, but it's still highly informative in touching on driving forces that might have to do with resistance against those who doubt conventional 9-11 explanations.

       What kind of outreach is the 9/11 truth community doing to the Green Party? Any idea?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it might be fruitful for them to attend the Green Party convention this summer and do some convincing. I really do not understand why the Green Party avoids 9/11 truth. I think embracing it would do them a whole world of good.

       One of the videos aired on BBC or CNN I forget was proved to be CGI altered. A part of the wing of the aircraft went behind a building when it should have gone above, or something on those lines. That gives it away as being doctored. Why was there need to doctor the video evidence one would wonder. Wouldn't you?

       There was no alleged flight 97 involved in 9/11.   Google searching shows flight 97 is a pair of Air Jordans.

       If anything the FED govt was implicit in that they allowed 911 to happen (possibly trained/financed the terrorists).
      </p>
      <p>
       This allowed the Patriot act, which we are just seeing SOME of the implications now. It led to a PHONY war, where there was extreme profit by a select few. I could go on, but im on a phone.

       Mob mentality.  Most will follow what most think, out of fear they will be singled out.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fear.  This is why they are so hard on the topic.  This is why they always resort to name-calling.  They are terrified of becoming an outcast.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they don't know is they are already an outcast of sanity, truth, and, most importantly, humanity.  Over 500,000 children have been murdered from this lie, and as long as these deniers exist, there will be more.

       I tend to believe a retired Major General over a bunch of lying politicians and corporate owned propaganda news outlets.

       You're not here to learn anything. You're only here to cover your eyes and ears and mock. The information is readily available. No one here can convince you if you don't wish to be convinced.

       A big part of the reason is that there isn't an "official" alternative version. There are ideas with thermite and mini-nukes and drones and whatever, but none of those have a large enough consensus to sway many others.

       Any high school physics student should be able to watch the videos of the towers collapsing and figure out that the bottom and insides of the towers had to be collapsed first, meaning it is obviously a controlled demolition.   The official fairy tale is a blatant violation of both the 1st and 3rd Newton's laws of motion.

       I don't think anyone (or at least only a very few) is telling you not to believe your eyes on that day. OP is talking about the who. Unless you actually spotted the person piloting one or both of those planes, your eyes aren't the answer here.

       Describe in your own words what the official story is as handed down by the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Include:
      </p>
      <p>
       *what happened
      </p>
      <p>
       *why it happened
      </p>
      <p>
       *and how it all worked
      </p>
      <p>
       Bonus Question:
Did you know that according to the official version of events 2 of the planes that day were turned into vapor. The reason that there is no evidence of them is that for the first time in history the fires from a jet crash were enough not to melt steel beams but rather to completley vaporize aluminum.
