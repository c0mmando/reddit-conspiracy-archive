    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy theories are becoming shunned and made into thoughtcrime more and more frequently. Social and educational programming are guiding all citizens to discredit all theories that oppose the status quo. Conspiracy theorists are matched with <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a49/1227842/">biased/skewed/unsupported &quot;debunking&quot;</a>, mockery (Jet Fuel can&#39;t melt Dank Memes, etc.), or just blatant ad hominem attacks.</p>

<p>With 9/11, most Americans will either question &quot;why you would think that the government would murder 2700+ citizens?&quot; or &quot;Why do you care? It was 14 years ago.&quot; Patriotism has become pure stockholm syndrome, all thoughtcriminals are treated as Jihad/terrorist-sympathizers.</p>

<p>Narrow-mindedness will be the death of rational thought. That&#39;s okay though, we won&#39;t need it in about fifty years. </p>

<p>I think my fellow commenters don&#39;t understand your question. I believe you are asking why someone like me, who doesn&#39;t believe the government&#39;s version of events about 9/11, thinks like I think. If I have this correct, allow me to answer. It is because the facts do not add up. I read a post recently, by a person who thinks like I do, who called those people believing the official story &#39;coincidence theorists&#39;.  There are way too many coincidences. There was reluctance (actually resistance) by George Bush, Dick Cheney, etc to actually have a formal investigation into the biggest crime in the history of America. Evidence was carted away and destroyed, which is against the laws that govern criminal investigative protocols. There is building 7, which initially fell for a number of seconds at free fall speed, which is to say at the acceleration of gravity. That is the same rate of acceleration an object would experience in open air. This is not possible in a building collapse unless, somehow, the resistance of the building below was artificially removed. Explosives take weeks to prep in a controlled demolition. So these are a very few of the reasons I do not accept the governments official conspiracy theory. I do not know why what happened on 9/11 happened. There needs to be a real investigation into the mass murder of the people that died on that day.</p>

<p>Anywho, it&#39;s one of those things that just seem unlikely. The people who have made your life possible are the very people set out on killing nearly 3000 innocent Americans. </p>

<p>If all these un-provable theories are true, I&#39;d honestly kind of be glad. Sure many life&#39;s where lost, but if you where a rich white guy on capital hill, wouldn&#39;t you love to trick the people of your nation to an advantage, that in the end, benefits your nation?</p>

The Government doesn&#39;t make our lives possible, by any means.

<p>Cui Bono  -  to whose benefit  (from the ancient Romans). In modern times this is an integral part of all criminal investigations  -  follow the money.  Funny thing, every war America got into after 9/11 benefited Israel. And before 9/11 there was a group called &#39;Project for a New American Century&#39; that sent a letter to Bill Clinton in 1998 stating America needs to take over the &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; oil in Iraq. However, it would be hard to start a war in Iraq without a major event, like a &quot;New Pearl Harbor&quot;. These facts are easily accessible on the net. BTW, the members of PNAC were people in and out of government, the majority of whom are American Jews or dual citizens of America and Israel. Simple math.</p>

<p>Bonus Question:
Did you know that according to the official version of events 2 of the planes that day were turned into vapor. The reason that there is no evidence of them is that for the first time in history the fires from a jet crash were enough not to melt steel beams but rather to completley vaporize aluminum. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone (or at least only a very few) is telling you not to believe your eyes on that day. OP is talking about the who. Unless you actually spotted the person piloting one or both of those planes, your eyes aren&#39;t the answer here. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the motivations behind the attack, who carried it out, and whether or not the fire that collapsed the towers was caused purely by the impact of those planes</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stopped believing the official story after I read the issue of Popular Mechanics that was supposed to &quot;debunk&quot; the conspiracists.

<p>I&#39;m asking you to tell me what you think the official story is in your own words because I bet you&#39;ve never really thought much about it or looked into it. I bet you can&#39;t string together a cohesive, rational timeline. </p>

<p>If anything the FED govt was implicit in that they allowed 911 to happen (possibly trained/financed the terrorists). </p>

<p>This allowed the Patriot act, which we are just seeing SOME of the implications now. It led to a PHONY war, where there was extreme profit by a select few. I could go on, but im on a phone.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fear.  This is why they are so hard on the topic.  This is why they always resort to name-calling.  They are terrified of becoming an outcast.</p>

<p>What they don&#39;t know is they are already an outcast of sanity, truth, and, most importantly, humanity.  Over 500,000 children have been murdered from this lie, and as long as these deniers exist, there will be more.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone (or at least only a very few) is telling you not to believe your eyes on that day. OP is talking about the who. Unless you actually spotted the person piloting one or both of those planes, your eyes aren&#39;t the answer here. </p>

<p>*what happened </p>

<p>*why it happened</p>

<p>*and how it all worked</p>

<p>Bonus Question:
Did you know that according to the official version of events 2 of the planes that day were turned into vapor. The reason that there is no evidence of them is that for the first time in history the fires from a jet crash were enough not to melt steel beams but rather to completley vaporize aluminum. </p>
