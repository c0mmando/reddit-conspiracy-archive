But I worry who controls the mass surveillance and how it is used.  Just because we stop the government from doing it, doesn&#39;t mean other people aren&#39;t doing it themselves.  That people aren&#39;t hacking into baby monitors and calling little girls sluts, which is happening.  My point being, there are <em>far worse</em> people out there who are going to do these things, and maybe if the government does it as well, they can prevent, or counter-balance people of criminal elements such as organized crime or foreign nations, from infiltrating our own country and using the information they&#39;re seizing to control various positions of power from top to bottom.  I think some very powerful people are upset, because this mass surveillance has been putting a prick in their sides and hampering business as usual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The internet, for one thing.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I completely agree with you on how dim our history is.  But there&#39;s a thing in philosophy called the Fallacy of Induction.  Deduction works because we take things that have already happened and draw conclusions.  Induction on the other hand, is taking what already happened and drawing conclusions about events that have <em>yet</em> to happen.  It is a Fallacy because there&#39;s no concrete evidence for the Induction, and so it fails to pass rigorous scrutiny.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example: We believe concretely that when we wake up tomorrow morning the Earth will still be rotating around the sun.  We derive this belief from what the laws of physics tell us, and from the countless millennia that came before in which the Earth has never once stopped or drastically changed its motion through space.  But these are <em>past observations</em>, both our scientific testing and our general observation of the movement of the Earth.  We <em>Inductively</em> assume that these observations are valid and guarantee a continuation of what has come before.  But in reality, <em>nothing</em> we know about the <em>past</em> can <em>entirely</em> determine what will happen in the future.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t to say we should strap everything down tonight, but as a thought experiment it describes the Fallacy pretty well.</p>

<p>Anyway. Just because humans have been fighting humans for a long time doesn&#39;t mean that that trend will continue in the future.  That is an Inductive assumption.  The violence that has come before us doesn&#39;t <em>have</em> to be what is in store for our children.  And humanity is waking up to the fact that this is so.  The internet is helping with this a lot.  People in every country in the world flock to the internet every day to commiserate about how shitty war is, and to witness the spectacle that is human debate over the issues.  We&#39;re a social people, and memes are not just cat pictures; they&#39;re ideas that spread socially.  Sooner or later there <em>will</em> be a global peace movement spurred by real human beings and not OWG-types.  It might not happen until processor power and technology is so dirt-cheap that a smartphone costs a dollar and everyone in sub-saharan Africa is engaged in the conversation, but that is a <em>when</em>, not an if.</p>

<p>I just hope it happens sooner, rather than later.  I&#39;m on board, instantly and wholeheartedly.  But there&#39;s only so much one person with a job and school and a car payment can do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Induction isn&#39;t a fallacy in itself.  Many mathematical theorems are proven using induction.  The fallacy is that our model of human nature and/or nature itself is not exact and that is where induction fails.  There are always additional variables that we cannot accurately model.</p>

<p>However, in the social sciences and humanities, Induction is <em>always</em> a fallacy.  Math and certain math-based sciences get a pass because they are so tightly constructed that induction doesn&#39;t cause problems.  Philosophy and Politics, on the other hand, are terribly dis-serviced by Induction, which in every instance is a Fallacy.</p>

<p>This was the intent of my post, not to bring up the nature of induction in math.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i just want to say that the reason (my belief) why many civilisations didn&#39;t go by in peace is due to colonisation--essentially, the fault lies at the hands of the bourgeois who reap the benefits of &quot;non-peace&quot;.</p>

<p>before the anglo-centric takeover, the rest of the world was doing quite well. i know that the south american natives had wars among themselves, but many of these were ritualistic and the only &quot;imperialist&quot; action that happened (in aztec[?] history) ended up failing. the south american civilisations were mostly isolationist with controlled and established trade, with traces of successful communism. </p>

<p>native american tribes would raid each other but would hold annual feasts of forgiveness where they would recognise their enemies as friends.</p>

<p>you can read the upanishads (the bhagavad gita specifically) for an indian view of war and why it must happen. russia--the old slavic tribes--were doing fine, as far as i know, until prince vladimir&#39;s genocide of all pagan peoples in favour of christianity (even though he adorned his capital with idols of slavic war-gods).</p>

<p>i don&#39;t know much about asiatic history but in looking at their ancient religious philosophies you might observe similar perspectives to india. african tribes were extraordinarily diverse and they had their own tribal-nation systems. some tribes, i&#39;m sure, emphasised aggression, but this was mostly ritualistic perspective.</p>

<p>from what i understand the entire process of profit from war and human suffering is from the conception of slavery, which in its true form began in the mediterranean (indentured servitude existed in ancient societies, but afaik never slavery)--namely, places which were fertile enough that people could get wealthy from having a surplus of goods. so you combine wealth with an attitude of entitlement (owing to zoroastrian/hermeneutic tradition), and you get colonial imperialism.</p>

<p>i&#39;m not saying intra-ethnic discrimination and conquering didn&#39;t exist prior to the expansion of europe, but if you observe the unbiased histories and literature which exist about non-european cultures, you&#39;d see that there were many systems in place which were supported by a similar religious/philosophical understanding--that everyone comes from the same place, and that balances exist to promote the life cycle, with respect to the sources of life. resources were bountiful. many non-european peoples, i believe, recognised and appreciated this bounty and never saw the need to want for more than what they had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually that&#39;s not true.  Many researchers believe that there was a long period during the hunter gatherer phase when no organized violence between groups of humans was taking place.</p>

<p>OP is wrong though.  Mass surveillance is inherently wrong and evil and it must be stamped out and prevented from ever happening again.  The transhumanist techno future is not a solution to our problems, it is the dark path.  If we have any hope of achieving peace among the species we will have to take a serious look at what aspects of the modern world are not necessary, and not conducive to good lives for human individuals.</p>
