       History is written by the victors. Off the top of my head:
      </p>
      <p>
       The American Civil War was fought over slavery. Abraham Lincoln wanted to free the slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Federal Reserve Act was created and approved by Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       The USA won the Vietnam War and Iraq conflicts/operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iraq had WMD's. Syria has chemical weapons.

       The english just did what they did with every other country. Let themselves be "ousted" so they didn't have to cover the cost of direct leadership, and just gave kickbacks to the peoples' "chosen" folks-of-power. Like... your face, their voice, sort of approach. The US does the same thing, because... y'know... democracy?

       Because... you know... royalty wasn't an incestuous clique or anything all playing their collective hands against their populaces, even though it seemed like they were fighting each other. Like the banks are pitting the peoples' of dictators on good terms (with each other) against each other (people vs people).

       They're an "incestuous clique" to deter the possibility of war. Sadly, it's not a particular effective strategy.
