        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>“I told you, Winston, he said, “that metaphysics is not your strong point. The world you are trying to think of is solipsism. But you are mistaken. That is not solipsism. Collective solipsism, if you like. But that is a different thing; in fact, the opposite thing. All this is a digression,” he added in a different tone. “<strong>The real power, the power we have to fight for night and day, is not power over things, but over men</strong>.” He paused, and for a moment assumed again his air of a schoolmaster questioning a promising pupil: “How does one man assert his power over another, Winston?”</p>

<p>Winston thought. “<a href="http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/study2014/sscistudy1.pdf">By making him suffer</a>,” he said.</p>

<p>“Exactly. By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse">Power is an inflicting pain and humiliation</a>. Power is in tearing human <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes for your own choosing</a>. Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the old reformers imagined. A world of <a href="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2009/09/dhs-threat1.jpg">fear</a> and treachery and torment, a world of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lCHioHaznw">trampling and being trampled upon</a>, a world which will grow not less but <a href="http://harvardpolitics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/boston-police-marathon-bombing.jpg"><em>more</em> merciless</a> as it refines itself. Progress in our world will be progress <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkkLUP-gm4Q">toward more pain</a>. </p>

<p>The old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love and justice. Ours is founded upon hatred. In our world there will be no emotions except <a href="http://crooksandliars.com/files/imagecache/node_primary/primary_image/15/01/fox_terrorism.jpg">fear</a>, <a href="http://christianculturecenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IslamicJihad.jpg">rage</a>, <a href="http://www.thenation.com/sites/default/files/bush_mission_accomplished_uss_abraham_lincoln_reuters_img.jpg">triumph</a>, and self-abasement. Everything else we shall destroy – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw">everything</a>. Already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Benjamin_Franklin_-_Join_or_Die.jpg">Revolution</a>&quot;</p>

<p>We have cut the links between <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/see-something-say-something">child and parent, and between man and man, and between man and woman</a>. No one dares trust a wife or child or friend any longer. But in the future there will be no wives and no friends. Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/eliseknutsen/2013/01/28/israel-foribly-injected-african-immigrant-women-with-birth-control/">Procreation will be an annual formality</a> like the renewal of a ration card. <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/">We shall abolish the orgasm</a>. Our neurologists are at work upon it now. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-23kmhc3P8U">There will be no loyalty, except loyalty toward the Party</a>. </p>

<p>There will be no love, except for the love of Big Brother. There will be no laughter, except the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tit9MMLg-t0">laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy</a>. There will be no art, no literature, no science. There will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasure will be destroyed. But always – do not forget this, Winston – always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video">sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless</a>. </p>

<p>If you want a picture of the future, imagine a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku42PPzYEqs">boot stamping on a human face</a> – forever.</p>

<p>-1984 [George Orwell, pg 266-267]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks buddy. I know we have waaaay more lurkers here than even I think (and I think we have a lot - I lurked for <em>years</em> before jumping in) and appreciate any and all comments.</p>

<p>And not to harp on this anymore, but if you appreciate the content (which are more often than not self-posts around here), I&#39;d state that while upvotes are appreciated, just posts stating &#39;thanks&#39; or &#39;I agree&#39; may be against reddiquette, but I feel this sub is one of the only subs that still resembles the reddit I fell in love with years ago and are appreciated.</p>

<p>The content here is (more often than not) very doom and gloom, and I know some posters here are sometimes really down in the dumps and these little pick-me-ups make all the difference. I was really far down a rabbit hole or two and was very depressed for a few months, even enough to go seek some help. And a combination of that and these comments have re-energized me, and I&#39;m going to be even more active and am going to start really pushing some things.</p>

<p>My point is, I doubt you&#39;ll get downvoted here for replying with &#39;this&#39; or &#39;thanks for posting&#39; moreso than the defaults and the bigger, heavier modded subs.</p>

<p>And for a personal story - I&#39;m <em>this</em> close to being banned from worldnews as of today for simply stating that someone is &#39;lacking in critical thinking skills,&#39; because that&#39;s apparently an attack on a user. Sorry for the rant, and while not all of us agree here with the mod team, I&#39;d like to thank <a href="/u/mr_dong">/u/mr_dong</a> and the team for keeping this place the way it is. </p>

<p>This place has kept me sane (and sometimes made me go off the deep end and you guys keep giving me life jackets) and a big part of it is their help.</p>

<p>Long days &amp; pleasant nights, <a href="/u/dopeedits">/u/dopeedits</a>. It is appreciated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You bring so much value and thought into our lifes - with your work you deserve the longest days and pleasant nights to enrich us with more thoughtful posts of yours. I have never read 1984 (yet) unfortunately, I would have totally missed this interesting piece of information if you didn&#39;t post it. </p>

<p>To me, thats worth so much, and because of that I&#39;m incredibly thankful that I found places where people like you hang out. And, of course, that great minds like you exist! :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read this in high school (it wasn&#39;t mandatory, I picked it off a list of 30+ books) and never fully understood the magnitude of the forebodings leaping off each page. I recently saw the film (from 1984 with John Hurt) for the first time and  it was nice to see it all in action. The similarities to modern society really are absurd and disgusting. This is the novel that has become Totalitarianism 101 for the NWO. </p>

<p>Thanks for the post, your embedded examples are doubleplusgood. I plan on rereading this very soon and continuing on with Orwell in the future. </p>

<p>Thats when you know you have crossed the line from fascist to psychopathic sadist.</p>

<p>I dont think we have crossed this very line, yet. But it is possible that down the road, at some point, we might. But i personally believe it must progress, first, into the &quot;fascist&quot; phase before the latter phase. </p>

<p>Right now i believe we (in america) are living in a <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_despotism">soft-depotism</a>, which in my mind is the step before fascism, making all this that much more concerning.</p>

<p>The goal may not yet be only pain and suffering, but if we continue the many trends of today, we will continue laying down the tracks towards that path, tacitly granting permission.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this begs the question: was Orwell a prophet or was he an insider?  Was <em>1984</em> a warning or was it a promise?</p>

<p>I too was struck by how frighteningly accurate and poignant some of the scenes in it are when I re-read it earlier this year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His Homage to Catalonia is interesting as well - and I bring it up because this book was more of a warning (methinks) of the perils of war and power and human nature in general. I mean, O&#39;Brien sums it up pretty well with</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you take into account the legitimate accounts of senior US officials admitting that no real intelligence was gathered from the torture program, one has to ask - why did we have Room 101s in the first place?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason I said what I said is that British social engineering programs/think tanks/psy-ops are very sophisticated and we know how the elite have always loved to hide things in plain sight.</p>

<p>Aldous Huxley, for example, was the grandson of Thomas Huxley - one of the founders of the Rhodes Round Table Group.  He was also a member of the &quot;Children of the Sun&quot;, a friend of Crowley, and had ties to both British intelligence and the CIA and was heavily involved with their activities in California which resulted in the flooding of the US with LSD and other drugs - essentially one of the forerunners of the manufactured/co-opted &quot;counter-culture&quot; movement.</p>

<p>Orwell was a lifelong friend of Huxley, went to Eton College (which has produced close to 20 British PMs and is a long-established &quot;elite&quot; college), and was a member of the Fabian Society.  And the Fabian Society was founded in which year?  1884.</p>

<p>Point being: things are often more than what they seem at first glance.</p>

<p>My current speculation is that Orwell became disillusioned with the Fabians for whatever reason and 1984 was sort of an &quot;exposé&quot; of their plans.  This might explain why (reportedly) the Fabian Society now controls the copyright to 1984 as well as the rights to Orwell&#39;s estate and archives after his wife&#39;s death some years ago.</p>

<p>Yep he was.  He knew Allen Dulles personally and was working alongside many who were either in the CIA or were involved with the CIA when he lived in California (such as Timothy Leary).  The LSD &quot;counter-culture&quot;, &quot;psychedelic living&quot; that he helped to promote was CIA/MK-Ultra all the way.</p>

Maybe he hasn&#39;t had a chance to read a book his random uncle gave him for Christmas (dude&#39;s a stud athletically and about to enter high school - I wouldn&#39;t have touched these books yet if the roles were reversed and I wouldn&#39;t blame him), but figure if he has questions he knows I&#39;ll be around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a dream.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had it many times before, but it was always a variation of the same theme: Nothingness.</p>

<p>This time? This time it was different -- You were in it.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know it was you though, since there were many vague faces. All plain and all the same. Except this time there was a voice, and it said:</p>

<p>&quot;We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.&quot;</p>

<p>It seemed barely an audible whisper, but it was there, and it was loud enough to rouse me from some remotely imposed slumber. Even during the day, dreaming as if lost in some recurring cycle of cognitive dissonance, always distracted and never having enough time. However, making sure to always dutifully report to the telescreen for my next regularly scheduled reprogramming.</p>

<p>No more, I say. NO MORE!</p>

<p>I have seen that beacon upon the horizon in the night, in the absolute black and stifling darkness, and it was you. It was you that guided me to, and now from, this place, this enlightened place illuminated beyond even shadowy encroachment. A place built upon a foundation of Faith, Hope, and Trust becoming an indestructible pyramid of blindingly white TRUTH.</p>

<p>Reader,
I leave you with this:</p>

<p>Here I scribe in an effort to convey that which is being made our most heinous crime: Free Thought. So, from those places we retreat to, those places we goto to hide from the screens, the little, spying eyes, the capitalists and the conformists, and their Big Brother too. And from those intangible places slated for rectification, those places that if found functioning outside of strict regulation within one&#39;s person will be cause for, and made celebration a permanent  state of unperson via vaporization,</p>

<p>I thank you.</p>
