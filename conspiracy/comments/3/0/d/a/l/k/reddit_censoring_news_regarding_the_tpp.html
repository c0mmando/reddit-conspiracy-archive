       Hello, I'm sure most people who frequent this subreddit are familiar with the TPP(Trans Pacific Partnership), but for those who aren't a simple google search will give you as much information as the rest of us have because it is being negotiated in secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       This trade deal will consist of 40% of the worlds economy, the negotiations for which started in March of 2010. There has been a complete media blackout regarding the TPP for the last 5 years, or at least extreme negligence given the magnitude of such agreements. Now the censorship has come to reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       One moderator, maybe more have decided to remove posts about the TPP from
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       , labeling it as "not appropriate subreddit". I'm hoping that this community will understand that when somebody is trying this hard to keep something secret it means we need to try even harder to spread the word.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have linked the post, and taken screenshots with timestamps of the
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       new feed, and the post at the time of censorship. The first comment on the post is mine, and it is my theory on the conspiracy for why the TPP is being negotiated in secret, and censored in all forms of media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit, another
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/30dgsy/wikileaks_releases_today_the_investment_chapter/">
        post
       </a>
       regarding the TPP has been removed.

       They intentionally use vague rule to eliminate discussion of topics they deem taboo.  For instance, r/TIL has a rule saying you can't post about a political topic if it happened in the last 8 years, yet they also say you can't post about something if it's somewhat related to a topic in the last 8 years.  This came to my attention

       The TPP will solidify and make worse what's already happening.  Most of the western "governments" are run like corporations as it is (some of them literally are corporations) and even the ones that aren't show heavy corporate interest/involvement/collusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       As always, the "elite" like to work within the confines of the law - the caveat being that they write the law and interpret it as loosely as possible.

       I messaged the mods, my guess would be that a sub-section of the mods are performing this censorship, and that if there was a dedicated effort to inform the mods that it was occurring they could make sure it stopped.
Maybe I'm wrong and it goes even deeper, but at least for now I'm a look on the sunny side kind of guy.

       I cannot fathom how having two prominent news outlets openly discussing the issue could possibly be called "censorship."

       This issue has been occurring on this sub for a while now, but because this was the first time I was able to capture it with screenshots it was the first time I brought it to someone's attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since then I have messaged the mods, and asked others to do the same, I would hardly consider the press release originally banned an opinion article, but I'm glad that these two post are going to be allowed to stay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong though, I still think this is a worthy topic for
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , after 5 years in the making you can hardly find someone on the street who know even knows what this is or what it is supposed to do. Only extremely recently has the mainstream media even begun to mention it, and I think it's extremely conspiratorial that everything is being kept so secret the only sources on the topic come from places like wikileaks.

       I just tried to submit a link on world news regarding TPP and just as OP said it would it was deleted saying "Not Appropriate Subreddit". This freaks me the fuck out, Reddit isn't what I thought it was, I have been so blind. I suggest you all test OP's claims for yourself, 100% real.

       A worldnews mod took notice, and has openly approved of two submissions, and a third has yet to be removed.

       is the post, and the following are the three links still available for us to make visible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first one has the most traction, join, vote, spread the word, I don't believe all mods on
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       support censorship, hell it may even just be a single rouge, but if we draw enough attention to improper behavior I believe we can still share news in a setting more free than anything you can find on network television these days.

       What we really need is to spread the word, you should be able to talk about the TPP with your neighbor, people on the street should know about the TPP and the TTIP, and know how it's going to affect them. The same as we know about Afghanistan, Iraq, or Ukraine.

       "conspiracy" doesn't mean "imaginary" or "fictitious", or even "lacks proof". I know you are on the side of the good guys, but a lot of brainwashing went into the whole "people who talk about conspiracies = wacko nutjobs" and we need to end that way of thinking since some/many/most of the time history proves them right.
