    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been there for a few months and it&#39;s ok but you can see the culture is already very &quot;fat midwestern housewife who just wants to be nice and have fun on the internet :)&quot;.  There&#39;s tons of Reddit hating and some topics that are off limits on Reddit (like GMOs for examples) can be discussed more openly, but if we want it to continue to be a place for alternative points of view, it&#39;s important that free thinking people move to the site NOW and comment, vote, and post frequently to shape the tone of the site so that it appeals to the right kind of users as it gets more popular.  Downvote the <a href="/r/aww">/r/aww</a>, <a href="/r/some">/r/some</a>-meta-bullshit, <a href="/r/my">/r/my</a>-90&#39;s-bullshit, etc., that is already taking hold there and post as much alternative political content at every relevant sub as possible.  </p>

<p>Honestly, there should be a sticky on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> encouraging users to go be active on Voat.  </p>

<p>Also, create your own alternative subverses and advertise them here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and other alternative subreddits.  Many manipulative Reddit mods have already taken over important subverses (e.g. JF_Queeny already has modship over /v/gmo).  Any subverse moderator that has not interacted with their sub in over 30 days can be requested to be removed by messaging the Voat admins.  They are, so far, very willing to allow you to take over dormant subs.  Take over any important sub you can, even if you don&#39;t know if an inactive mod is a shill or not, you know you aren&#39;t a shill.  </p>

<p>Take control now before it becomes impossible.</p>

Mod cliques, shadowbanning, rank manipulation, vote manipulation, etc. could all be stopped by an admin who cared to stop it. So far, it seems like the Voat admins are being honest about their commitment to free speech.   </p>

<p>They have actually listened and done something about addressing ploblems there, as simple as you having to reach a certain level to down vote there.  They also show how many things  you down and up vote there, on your user screen.  Making trolls easy to spot.  </p>

<p>Its not perfect, but they have the right attitude there, are trying to learn from the mistakes here,  and have actually done something other that talk about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about there is its not perfect by any means, but the ones running it are proactive to prevent what has happened there that happened here.  </p>

<p>The good thing about its size is you can pinpoint who any troll voters are and obvious manipulaters of the story placement.  Also mod activity is closely monitered and any terrorist mods, are quickly weeded out.</p>

<p>Truth of the matter, even with the low numbers there, I get the same amount of intelligent conversation there as I do here.  Minus the idiot factor.   I would call it the reddit for people over the age of 21 or an IQ over 115.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I use Reddit like an RSS reader.  The only way you can hide something is by voting on it.  But I like the variety of articles on the front page.  It&#39;s still my go to site for &quot;pNews&quot; because it&#39;s way faster than inoreader or any other rss reader</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is one of the advantages of reddit, the sheer number of people posting.  I do often see posts here that dont  make it there.    </p>

<p>You do actually run into posts there, that aren&#39;t seen here, because of the manipulation from who ever that gets it buried.  That would be the advantage there.</p>

<p>Some thing that gets buried here, will often be on the front page of the sub there.</p>

<p>I split my time between the sites.  Again, for the numbers here, you would expect more quality responces and comments from here based on the numbers alone, however, its not the case.  </p>

<p>You get more comments here, but the intelligent ones are the same amount, and I totally stand by that.</p>

<p>Basically it just comes down to quality v quantity.  </p>

<p>Like Dennis Miller said in an old stand up show about the 2 for 1 sales at Kmart.  2 of shit is shit.  If they really wanted to fuck you, they would give you 3.  This has basically become the corporate money driven monster like Walmart or Kmart.</p>

<p>It comes down to if you want numbers, there are more at Reddit, but the majority is crap.  If you wanted actual intelligent counter points  and respectful conversation and debate that doesnt immediately degrade into name calling and insults, than the other site is for you.  </p>

<p>People over there have the understanding that you can disagree with some one, and still have mannors in doing so.  Its as close as old school you will find in this day and age. </p>

<p>The one risk you run is the same anyone does using TV or MSM for your information without looking into different sources.   That is being a genius, that is full of shit.  Much like the 911 supporters of the official story.</p>

<p>I would recommend checking it out.  Its growing slowly but steadly, but more importantly its adding quality with its growth.  </p>

<p>You dont have the variety of subs there, but again, that will happen, its just a matter of when.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not here for numbers.  I&#39;m here to learn something and share a little of what I&#39;ve learned.  I&#39;m here for a laugh and here for a little fun.  If I can&#39;t vote, I&#39;m not going to waste my time on a site.  It&#39;s why I stopped going to GLP (I originally went for a laugh, that site is a joke), they started banning any IP that didn&#39;t log in.  It became a chore to go there so I stopped.  </p>

<p>As I said, I don&#39;t give a shit about Karma.  I just like to learn and share.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, Im here for pretty much the same thing.  But, what if the info your learning from here is bs?  Not saying it is, just saying there is a greater chance of that here with the good majority of people being,......... how do I put it,.... not too b ....   r .....   i .....  g .....   h .....  t.</p>

<p>If you remember Bill Cosby&#39;s take on cocaine, in his comedy routine Himself...   He asked a guy why he did cocaine, to which he replied, &quot;it intensifies the personality&quot;   to which Cosby said, &quot;yes, but what if your an asshole?&quot;   </p>

<p>Im all for education and learning, but if the info your learning from isnt the most accurate, I can see where that Cosby analagy applies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s an aggragator, no more no less.  You have to be able to read between the lines.  There are very few journalists/researchers I trust.  James Corbett is one of them.  His agenda seems to be fairly open, although I did wonder at the fact that he took a very long time to open up about his personal history/timeline.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>fair enough.  That is what I tell people often  when I hold up mt ring, index, and middle finger. Read between the lines.  Not directing that at you, it just reminded me of that when you wrote it. : )</p>
