    <div class="md"><p>One theory has it that by convincing the world that manmade climate change is a thing, they subsequently make bookoos amount of money. It follows, that they pass legislation, setting up a carbon credit exchange. Companies that do not comply with the new set of emissions rules get charged a penalty. Companies that meet or exceed those limits receive these carbon credits, relative to how much they exceeded the expectations. The &quot;good&quot; companies can then trade those credits theyve received for tax credits via the exchange. The &quot;bad&quot; companies that have not met the limits can purchase credits ffrom the exchanges. And as a lot of money would be flowing through the exchange, whoever runs the exchsnges take some percentage of profit.</p>

<p>I do not know the verifiability of any of this, whether it is a thing or not, or if it was all made up. I havent invested enough research into this particular theory to come to any real conclusion myself.</p>

<p>As for the question of anthropogenic climate change, i believe we are jumping the gun. It is too soon to tell for sure. Yes, we have a correlating set of data that relates carbon dioxide with warming temperatures. But what we do not have is a control set. </p>

<p>We have data from ice cores that show us further correlation between carbon dioxide levels and global temperatures, but again, correlation does not prove causation.</p>

<p>There is an argument for ACC that claims the global temps have risen since the beginning of the industrial revolution, and they use this to support their statement that humans thusly are causing CC. Yet, we have data that goes far beyond the industrial revolution that shows global climate is cyclical, to an extent, and that CO2 levels naturally rise and fall. </p>

<p>Next, we come to another fork in the road, as water vapor makes up the vast majority of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. Although a certain amount of water vapor can only remain in the atmosphere for a relatively short period of time (whereas CO2 remains much longer), the volumes we are talking about, in terms of water vapor at any given moment vs CO2, are dramatically one sided, in that at any given moment water vapor is the vast majority of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere.</p>

<p>IIRC, water vapor accounts for about 3/4 of the greenhouse gases. CO2 is somewhere around 1-2%, of which humans are not fully accountable for.</p>

<p>So, for brevity, humans only account for roughly less than one full percent of attributabke greenhouses gases, when compared to natural sources. </p>

<p>I find it difficukt to believe that we can really affect the entire globe at these ratios. </p>

<p>Furthermore, i dont really see any proponents of ACC talk about water vapors role, despite it being the majority player. The ones that mention it downplay its role without offering any real explanation. </p>

<p>Then theres the correlation to CO2 and water vapor. This seems to be the closest argument ive found in ACC, wherein the increase of CO2 due to human activity has subsequently caused a large increase in water vapors role. Yet i have not seen any evidence set forth to prove or disprove this idea.</p>

<p>When it comes down to it, i am not a climatologist, and the complexities of global climate is convoluted even for the &quot;experts.&quot; </p>

<p>Thus, my only position is that we do not know for sure. Hence, i do not believe it is ethical nor moral to install broad regulations based on data that is not conclusive, in which the lives of each individual on the planet may be affected. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably, but that market is pretty saturated and everyone needs a buck ;) I think I recently heard the climate change industry is a billion dollar industry, so it&#39;s not chump change.</p>

<p>For the record I&#39;m pretty sure climate change is a real issue and that man does have an impact on it, even if it&#39;s tiny. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure the solutions offered by the government are the right ones though. And, as people who have enjoyed the benefits of living in the first world, who are we to tell industrial nations what they can do?</p>

<p>Right. As air traffic has increased year after year, we should have expected more contrails. Not sure why it&#39;s surprising. </p>

There has been some sound science indicating that the fluctuation we are seeing is climate both during periods of apparent warming and periods of apparent cooling are normal and not being caused by the activities of men. However there seems to be an effort afoot to squash or shout down any conversation contrary to the argument that fluctuation in climate is due to any other cause than the activity of men.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You gotta do better than say false.. Simple observation is that the models predicting runaway increases in temperature are false.  There has been no significant warming in more than a decade despite model results to the contrary. Furthermore it has been revealed that historic temperature data has been tampered with to make it seem that warming has been occurring.  So don&#39;t just say &quot;false&quot; without explaining why observations have not matched model predictions and why it was necessary to tamper with historical data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It gets exhausting dealing with people at your level, which is low like the floor.</p>

<p>For one thing, you are referring to &quot;models&quot; which is a grandiose way of saying &quot;computer program simulations of physical reality.&quot;</p>

<p>Take a look at physical reality.  Everywhere on the planet, the weather is extreme and the wind is strong.  Storms have more energy in them, ocean currents and winds have more kinetic energy in them, and the iciest parts of the planet are melting.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s a fact: the climate is getting extreme.  Or, as Bruce Sterling wrote, we are experiencing heavy weather.</p>

<p>On the flip side of that, you have the activities of man.  Man has quadrupled the CO2 in the atmosphere.  Go find the number on total amount of oil man has pumped.  Then go calculate what fraction of that is burned.  The answer is around 0.6T barrels.</p>

<p>Once you realize the stoichiometry of that situation, you either know global warming is true, or you&#39;re crazy.</p>

<p>Go read Heavy Weather by Bruce Sterling and get a clue.  Meanwhile, the rest of us will watch the Clathrate Gun go off this summer while actual warming in 2015 is what was projected for 2100.</p>

<p>This is false.  The reason I write &quot;false&quot; on your posts is that you are a liar with an agenda.  There isn&#39;t much more to say about what you write than to say that you are spreading falsehoods.</p>

<p>The recent &quot;revelations&quot; are meaningless, the changes to records are not sinister and do not refute global warming when reverted.  The fact is that weather stations have to be replaced, repaired, and sometimes moved.  The corrections to measurements you refer to were done carefully, by comparing new machine to old over time, and do not invalidate the science.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the best thermometer for the earth&#39;s temperature you could ask for would be the earth itself.  Both poles are melting.  Greenland, Alaska, and Siberia are melting.</p>

<p>The ocean floor clathrates are out-gassing at ocean-saturating rates in the North Atlantic, NW of the Bering Straight.  The tundra is releasing methane from underground high-pressure reserves.</p>

<p>The amount of methane released from melting clathrates last summer is on the order tens of megatons.</p>

<p>THOSE are the real revelations you should be paying attention to.</p>

<p>The &quot;revelations&quot; you speak of are hogwash and if you keep talking about them I will consider you a liar with an agenda who comes here to spread disinformation.</p>
