       I don't remember saying anything about outrage, you can go back and quote me though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your attempt to muddy the waters won't work. Specific types of conversations are not the issue here at all. For example this is Conspiracy so we don't talk about specific types of things like 'Old Time Radio' unless there is some kind of conspiracy. The example sighted in this case was that in a forum dedicated to world history the mods were actively censoring a discussion about.... world history.

       Right, so calling rules like this

        analogies about segregation

       when discussing them doesn't mean you're outraged. Got it.

       The rules of r/conspiracy specifically do not allow certain types of conversations about conspiracies, conspiracy theorists, and the sub in general.

       So yes, the same as the world history sub.

       If we can't ask questions, we won't find out. And if
       <em>
        we
       </em>
       don't find out, we can't spread the info along. 2 generations down the road, kids will have no clue about the Balfour Declaration, what it is, or what it stands for.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the Age of Information. Any knowledge we could ever want or need is at our fingertips. I'm not saying it's our destiny, but we are headed for a police state, so absorb all that you can and hold on to it. We have finally entered an era where transparency is a
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       for a successful gov't, given how easy it is to find information online, and also that the mainstream media is no longer the one and only source for civilians to hear news.

       Imagine you'd asked a black person why they keep trying to drink out of a white persons water fountain when it's clearly against the law...
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you don't see a problem with what the censors are doing
       <strong>
        implies
       </strong>
       that you assume it is ok.

       Or I realize subs are ran by diffrent groups and you gotta know where speech ain't free. That said, I get your point. It's a form of protest. So you're protesting censorship and then presenting the fact you were censored here because it's a zone that won't silence your attempted protest of the other sub. Is that closer to the mark?

       I won't speak for OP. But i don't think it is a sign of protest so much as it is using the subs for the purpose they were intended. There really shouldn't be anything radical about posting about the Belfour declaration in world history. It shouldn't
       <strong>
        be considered
       </strong>
       a protest, I think that is the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alternative I think is to internalize the idea that censorship is OK or that 'speech ain't free'. To accept it and move on, which I think is dangerous. Thinking like that will condition you to eventually limit your thoughts, let alone your words. "Why bother saying anything, they'll just ban me?" really quickly turns into "why bother thinking about it, I can't talk about it."
      </p>
      <p>
       I think posting about it here is because this is a sub dedicated to people who are against those sorts of tactics of censorship and open discussion. It's a kind of group therapy for people who don't think asking questions should be denied and censorship should be accepted.

       The truth is because the Jews sold Germany out to the allies. They made a deal with England. In return for American involvement, England is to promise the Jews the land of Palestine. This deal is known as the Balfour Declaration. Germany was winning the war and was calling a truce, as well as an agreement that no one pays reparations. The only problem with that is the Jewish bankers are financing this war and they need the reparations paid to make money. The Lusitania sinking was confirmed to be a false flag attack 80 years later.

       Edit: Just want to state that these 'jews' are not really Jews, but hide behind the Jewish faith.
They call themselves Jews but they are not, but are of the Synagogue of Satan.

       No they weren't. Germany was exhausted, undermanned and out-equipped by the final years of the war. Britain had managed to create a modern army who took full advantage of the concept of combined arms. Germany's stalwart defense and strong military tradition gave way to modern technology and advanced combat doctrine. A three-year naval blockade certainly didn't help things either.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason why Heinz Guderian, one of the most brilliant generals of the 20th century studied the British offensives from 1917 onward.  Kesselring and Rommel too studied the combined-arms attacks made by the British during the second half of the war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even on a larger scale, most German offensives through the entirety of the war fell short-mostly ending in strategic or tactical defeat. When Von Hindenburg was been placed in charge in 1916 he immediately began drawing up plans for a large scale withdrawal.

       Calling a truce doesn't mean much other than "stop pummelling me". Calling a truce makes no statement towards your posture or future considerations.

       i'm familar with rev 3:9. And thank you for that, yeah, between Satan and your responses, I would have to wonder why it couldn't be spoken about. It's weird how much mystic surrounds all those moments in history. Like a fog. If it's believed it will be used to incite hate, and repeat the past, they forgot the way we avoid repeating the past is by remembering it as to not repeat it.
       <em>
        shrugs

       Plus, ppl aren't haters like back in the day, most realize that there's a diffrence between the jew living in Israel (or abraod) and the Rothchild banking cartel.

       It is because the victors write the history. History as taught in school is propagandized, glamorized bullshit. This type of speech is not to incite hate, but like you said, to prevent us from repeating the past. But these criminals are doing everything to censor history. If you have yet to read that book, I highly recommend it.

       How would you know what I saw or did not see? I bet you are the type of person who asks someone their name, they would say Jon and you would be like, 'really, Jon? I thought it was Mike, are you sure it is not Mike?'. Those people are annoying.

       It's amazing, isn't it? We white people are responsible for
       <em>
        all the ills and abuses throughout human history,
       </em>
       according to the leftists and the Jews, yet strangely enough, the Jews never did anything wrong. What about that? I mean, what were the chances? Not one bad thing done by the Jews in four thousand years.

       They were kicked out of cities close to 180 different times in the past few hundred years. Because anti-semitism. Anti-semitism my ass. How arrogant can you be when you blame everyone else instead of yourself. This shows you how corrupt these people are.

       Are the Jews the smartest group of people or the dumbest group of people, or both.  I mean they're so obtuse that they were kicked out and killed through 2000 years, and yet they didn't learn to act normal?

       You can convert to the religion sure. I don't see why anyone would ever do such a thing.

       But if you have a Jew background, you certainly are not one of us. It doesn't mean that we have to hate each other, but respect each others boundaries.

       This was my comment:

       The truth is because the Jews sold Germany out to the allies. They made a deal with England. In return for American involvement, England is to promise the Jews the land of Palestine. This deal is known as the Balfour Declaration. Germany was winning the war and was calling a truce, as well as an agreement that no one pays reparations. The only problem with that is the Jewish bankers are financing this war and they need the reparations paid to make money. The Lusitania sinking was confirmed to be a false flag attack 80 years later.

       Edit: Just want to state that these 'jews' are not really Jews, but hide behind the Jewish faith.
They call themselves Jews but they are not, but are of the Synagogue of Satan.
