        UPDATE: WITHIN 30 HOURS OF MAKING THIS POST, I WAS SITE-WIDE SHADOWBANNED "ACCIDENTALLY", I AM NOW UNBANNED (See *new
       </em>
       point #14 for details) _________
      </p>
      <p>
       1)
       <strong>
        The first thing they did was take away r/reddit.com.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This took away the only tool for communicating
       <em>
        with
       </em>
       reddit
       <em>
        about
       </em>
       reddit. If you had any concerns about the website as a whole, you could address them through r/reddit. Taking that away was the first step.
      </p>
      <p>
       2)
       <strong>
        The power now resided in individual subreddits, obviously the most popular ones. There was a power grab to become moderators of these subreddits.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember as the upcoming election loomed, all of a sudden, r/circlejerk (one of the old default subreddits) became completely obsessed with bashing Ron Paul. I am not even a RP supporter, but that was definitely orchestrated, and NOT by some kids trying to be funny. Also, it coincided perfectly with this highly suspicious
       <a href="https://archive.org/details/HowTheGovernmentAndMediaCheatedRonPaulDocumentary">
        campaign to filter him out of the election
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       3)
       <strong>
        Once the default subreddits were controlled, drastic changes began to occur.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember when r/IAma was open to anyone and the popularity was decided by voting. Now it is nothing more than a cheap place for celebrities to whore out their products and you need to be "approved". Someone named
       <a href="https://engage.vevent.com/index.jsp?eid=3110&amp;seid=111">
        Victoria
       </a>
       is involved and how does that makes any sense whatsoever? Celebrities have entire teams of branding/PR/social media teams that work for them. Why do they need to be at reddit HQ and/or required to have a reddit rep? Because these AMA's are extremely organized and sponsored with money.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of subreddits that are now covertly controlled.
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/22yewf/i_have_identified_a_list_of_keywords_that_are/">
        Check out this post which was pushed into r/undelete for identifying a list of keywords banned from r/technology.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       4)
       <strong>
        The appearance of shills soon became VERY apparent.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       All of a sudden new accounts started popping up out of nowhere. Cue the birth of r/HailCorporate. "Feel good" military posts started appearing, like a soldier coming home to his dog. New users entered AMA's to lob softball questions
       <a href="http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/lisa-mr-burns-runaway-train1.jpg">
        "Mr Burns, your campaign has the momentum of a runaway freight train, how does it feel to be so popular?"

        Anyone who tries to convince you that shills don't exist is either grossly uninformed or a liar.
       </a>
       <strong>
        Protip:
       </strong>
       the big political subreddits can’t seem to keep the seal on the circlejerk during weekends, almost as if an entire team of manipulators is suddenly on weekend hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       5)
       <strong>
        Now we have blatant censorship on r/news, r/worldnews etc... saying that X site is not allowed.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       What ever happened to letting people vote on the content of this website? Trash tabloids constantly go viral on political subreddits due to sensationalized headlines and the fact that most Americans are unaware of different overseas publications.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the fact that default subreddit rules are now completely refined, sophisticated and purposely worded to allow maximum mod-interpretation. Honestly, someone with a law degree with a proud.
      </p>
      <p>
       Major politically-charged subreddits now insist on exact titles or quotes because that stops users from being able to post the important point summary of the article as the title . Using only official titles from only approved media has turned reddit into mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       6)
       <strong>
        Speaking of voting, they changed that too.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We now have an entirely new way to view upvote/downvote scores. A user used to be able to see their score. But now, everything is fuzzed. For example, if you made a semi-controversial comment before, but many people agreed, you may have a score like (47/45), leaving you with a -2 next to the comment. Now you just get a -2 and nobody knows if
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       agreed with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       7)
       <strong>
        Hey guise, us nerds who run reddit have decided to shuffle all of the front-page subreddits, tee-hee we are so random
       </strong>
       <sup>
        ‿^
       </sup>
      </p>
      <p>
       No more r/circlejerk, that pesky subreddit hits too close to home. Lets add 2X to the mix, (even though they wanted to remain an anonymous sub), fuck them, we need to show our shareholders we represent the female demographic. Lets also add a bunch of subs that we can use to share propaganda like r/nottheonion.
      </p>
      <p>
       And speaking of the female demographic and "gender discrimination" being represented, that happened around the time
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/search?q=ellen+pao&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all">

        You are posting too much, please wait...
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It now doesn't matter if you have confirmed your email, or been posting on this site for years. If you anger the wrong mod/admin or your posts aren't doing "well", then you get benched.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or you can always just have your comments deleted. You will not even know your comment is deleted. You will still see it. Only you. The only way to know is to be inherently suspicious, and sign out of your account after clicking on the permalink of the comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       A sneaky tactic, but hey, at least it is only your comment and not your whole account. Isn’t it great that we have

       The front page is not decided on merit. Different subs are given different algorithms. There is a behind the scene ranking system that gives certain content a "head-start". As we have learned at r/conspiracy, if they don't like our sub, then we are banished from the front page, forever. Just like we were banished from r/bestof, after this

       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to the now rampant censorship on the site, users took it into their own hands to bring the truth into the light. They created a part of reddit where users could see what was being deleted.
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2m6fsl/on_the_takeover_of_rundelete_and_the_subsequent/">

         Now we are seeing a new site-wide trend that is designed to make it even harder to call out shills.
        </a>

       Which is interesting considering that nobody seems to care when the accusations are sponsored by the mob: “This guy is a Putin-bot! Everyone must think the
       <em>
        exact
       </em>
       same way about complex geopolitical events.”

       <strong>
        All of the proper "checks and balances" are now in place.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       R/worldnews has become the ultimate modern-day version of the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Minutes_Hate">
        Two-Minutes Hate
       </a>
       from George Orwell's 1984:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        a daily period in which Party members of the society of Oceania must watch a film depicting the Party's enemies and express their hatred for them.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But when we really want to drive a point home, the entire front-page gets in on the action!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Look what happened in the immediate aftermath of the Boston Bombing, while users were pooling resources,
       <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/19/reddit-ddos/">
        the website was DDos attacked to stop the momentum
       </a>
       . Good thing to, since moments later, our honest government said “Hey everybody, these two guys did it!” For arguments sake, despite anything that followed, it should be extremely alarming that millions of people suddenly decided they were guilty based on nothing more than a picture, the government’s word, and the
       <del>
        manufactured
       </del>
       consensus of their peers. I was on reddit in the exact moment the shift happened and NOBODY could tell me why they suddenly believed,
       <strong>
        without any other evidence
       </strong>
       , that two people attending the marathon with a circle around them was evidence of guilt. And I was gang-downvoted every time I asked.
      </p>
      <p>
       And speaking of the BB, reddit will apparently never live down the fact that someone was wrongly accused. Why should a community be demonized for aggregating information and doing something that has proven to be successful in 90% of cases, particularly disasters? Why? Because the government can’t have people doing their own detective work, that would make their cover-ups way more difficult.
      </p>

       <strong>
        Online guerrilla tactics.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       When reddit changed the voting system and people were on their last nerve with this site, a place called Whoaverse (now
       <a href="https://voat.co/">
        https://voat.co/
       </a>
       ) became popular overnight. It is basically a reddit clone and at the time was run by one guy. He was happy about the surge but mentioned it was going to be hard to keep up with, but was committed to making it happen. Guess what happened next?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you guess: “Thousands of targeted spam attacks to overload and destroy the website”? Then congrats, you now understand how far these fucks are willing to go to keep the herd in their pen.
       <a href="https://independentaustralia.net/business/business-display/rupert-murdoch-and-vice,6483">
        Hijacking a cool brand and using it’s facade to conduct propaganda games is extremely profitable, just ask VICE.
       </a>
       And once you have the customer,
       <a href="http://oursocialtimes.com/70-of-companies-say-its-cheaper-to-retain-a-customer-than-acquire-one/">
        it costs much less to keep them than to acquire new ones
       </a>
       . So we are seeing online guerrilla tactics designed to destroy the competition by any means.

        Shark Shank's Redemption
       </strong>
       (title credit to: u/Iridium777)
      </p>
      <p>
       So I made this post and it went viral on r/conspiracy reaching +3500. I woke up the next day and by accident I signed out and saw my user page could no longer "be found". I then noticed that every comment I had made was stuck at 1. After over 6.5 years on reddit, I had received my first shadowban.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I made a new account and made
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/30hy5r/i_wrote_how_reddit_was_destroyed_and_it_went/">
        this post
       </a>
       about it, it also went viral. I was given advice to message the reddit admins about my shadowban, I eventually received this message:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It looks like you got caught up in a vote brigade, but upon further investigation it looks like you were not part of it. Thanks for writing in so promptly. I've unbanned your account.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I have no idea what "vote brigade" I would have been a part of and you don't have to believe me but I have never been a part of anything that even vaguely resembles a "vote brigade".
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, the whole thing stinks to me. Like a canned response. The admin version of "yeah, our bad". Multiple years on reddit and I get my 1st shadowban "accidentally" within a day and a half of my most viral "How Reddit Was Destroyed". 
…………………………………….

      <p>
       It wasn't always like this. A few years ago, there were just as many disagreements and differences of opinion on reddit, but they were REAL. And the site was still a democracy. People voted and things swung from side to side, everybody learned in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have a completely one-sided mess that pretends to be democratic but is quickly becoming the Fox News of the internet. They designed a system that would take advantage of the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September">

       The people who run reddit are not the "cool bloggers" they try to portray themselves as. There is a head running things, and it is sinister and they are making A LOT of money, and have A LOT of power, and A LOT of influence.

      <p>
       And they know it. You should too.

       There was significant distance between reddit and Aaron just a few months after they were bought.  His death seems only symbolically linked, in my opinion.

       Why be a troll?  You can't stop money/progress/etc and the powers that be are blaming the trolls for destroying the site.  Therefore, trolling Reddit and its employees just brings closer the demise of the Reddit you're fighting to keep.  Learning to compromise (pro tip: know the game, first) would yield spectacular results.  Call me a shill and downvote me, wutev, but consider the obvious: the world you think exists or believe should exist isn't ready to exist.  Technology may one day change it, but for now capitalism reigns (when did it not, really?) and idealism is owned by it.

       you think its limited to the US government? Dude its an international zionist conspiracy man. Im not fucking kidding. The western media, banking and governments are almost entirely run according to jewish interests. Freemasonic Talmudic Satanists run the key levers of power in most nearly all of the western world. The only exception is the internet right now and thats obviously why they're coming for it so hard

       Remember, the internet is made up of people. If you see something on the internet, you can download it and save it. I have archives of data "4+TB's" worth of information that would have been deleted years ago relating to games that are barely being kept alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       All it takes is 1 person to make a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Relating to the internet, you can always host the data yourself. People have been doing it for 1000's of years when it comes to books, the only difference is that they could only carry 1 book with them easily. With a 1TB hard drive, you could carry centuries worth of information in your pocket.

       I've seen Google remove results.. If you know someone with a unique name it's easier to check.

       Older games, like Sourceforts. You used to be able to find tons of information about the game, and user made content was plentiful. Now it's far in between.

       Romantic notion, but flawed and false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like Wikipedia, Reddit's own popularity and growth was it's own "demise." Starting around 2007/2008 when the US government really ramped up it's information warfare campaigns on the public Internet is when shit started to go down.  Any site as popular as Reddit is going to be hotspot of attention for information operations. Think JTRIG for example, operation earnest voice, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       These days the front page of Reddit is just a 24-7 propaganda engine and subreddits are run like the fascist shitholes that they are. Fine, who cares about the subreddits? Everyone with their eyes open knows /⁣r/⁣netsec is run by NSA sympathizers. Whatever, fuck it. One thing to remember is that the agents and shills are really just cheerleaders.. it's the masses of useful idiots who really amplify them. Without a user base this website, like all other social media including Wikipedia, is just an empty shell. It's the user base that makes these sites what they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       These days everything on the Internet is touched by information warfare and those in power are more emboldened and arrogant than ever. The enemies making advances? Have one of your cells stage a terrorist attack.. then coordinate that with electronic warfare, including information warfare, efforts. It's all coordinated now. Kinetic attacks coordinated with electronic and information warfare. You got an agent on standby waiting to make the post as soon as it happen.. Then the army of sock puppets to get the ball rolling. Once that happens, the useful idiots take over and let the data mining begin.

       I only just checked what the current defaults are, since I no longer sub to any of them (except videos), apparently TwoXChromosomes is a default sub now? Christ. Thanks Ellen Pao. Equality does not = making a women's sub a default without also making a men's sub a default.

       It's no coincidence that minutes after Broken Lizard does an AMA we get crowd funding requests for Super Troopers 2. Here is a

        screenshot of a search

       for "Super Trooper 2" sorted by New, All Time. Up to the point of the AMA there is almost nothing relevant, but just

        a few minutes
       </del>
       after the AMA, BAM! crowd funding request.

       True fact; remember the propaganda post yesterday? iSIS meat grinder. In that article it said that the U.S. Runs propaganda campaigns every day in the Middle East. Like putting out new pamphlets. Said that it speaks to the "softer side" of the conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the article says it has used 1 billion dollars on paper pamphlet propaganda.

       We're all part of the information warfare machine dude. And it's primarily funded throught private sources. Soon as you guys start railing off about the government(whose explicit purpose is to enable the rich people and the companies within the state) being the problem, you're raging against the wrong machine.

       I think it would be better to say: you are raging against the machine when you should really be raging against the people who own and operate the machine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The institutions of our world (aka the machine) are inanimate fucking objects and it's of no use to rage against an inanimate fucking object. Doing so will only result in a downward spiral that will inevitably lead to suicide by gunshot next to the dead body of a dwarf on a movie set.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's much more productive to rage against the people who misuse inanimate fucking objects than it is to rage against inanimate fucking objects because people are actually going to feel your rage.   (Edit: Replaced  a "that" with a ":".)

       Yup, had this happen today. Someone was arguing climate chance was a political problem, another was arguing it was a scientific issue and I'm like: "guys, it is an

       problem. They don't want to upgrade so the pay politicians and scientists to wave colored flags of dissent and division. Literally, the Men behind the Curtains.

       It is easy to figure out who is behind something if you use the 'follow the money' mantra. Whats difficult is accepting what you find at the end of that trail.

       Also, what I don't get: Most (minority) language communities could use reddit formidable, as it would be
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       transparent, when somebody would try to game it, at least for the first 5..7 years and also, it would render it much, much harder to manipulate. It would use up much more resources and would be funny if the same notions would suddenly pop up everywhere by accounts with no posting history :D

       In truth, Reddit's death spiral began when the blackhat marketers discovered that they could make money off of posts/comments (so, years ago). A simple google search is pretty damming, and keep in mind there are THOUSANDS of blackhat sites just like this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;amp;q=blackhatworld.com+reddit&amp;amp;sourceid=opera&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8#q=site:blackhatworld.com+reddit">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, upvote clubs made by blackhat marketers to push their links to the frontpage of a sub -

       I would disagree. You find more knowledgeable people at BHW than most internet marketing forums and there is a sense of community. People genuinely help each other in most cases, even if it's just to stay off the literal "Shit List" of people never to trust (yes, it is an actual list).
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're describing actually sounds more like the other big internet marketing forum, Warrior Forum. Again, some good advice and good people can be found but their "Warrior Special Offers" are a joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially they are 99% crap made up by some newbie that doesn't know jack who copypasted an ebook and gave it a title like "Push Button Riches . How I Make $150,000 Per Month Doing - Almost - Nothing!!" that some other newbie copypasted a year ago from some other newbie who got it off a google search from a blogger who had absolutely no idea what they were talking about in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people don't make $150k a decade, nevermind a month, but they sure will sell you a $37 ebook promising just that.

       Reddit is so easy to game though, I've sent quite a few comments and suggestions on how to stop these things to reddit admin, they have never replied. I just assume that they know what's going on and are allowing other people to game the system, so that when they do it, it makes it harder to tell it was connected to the admin.

       heh, I never noticed that google does that.

       I installed opera a month ago and I love it. No more memory eating and painfully slow firefox and no more Big Brother google all up in my business. And since I can install pretty much any Chrome extension too I'm never going back.

       Well, uh, you missed the decade of uber-browsing then. No problem. But I recommend to look on the net what earlier opera versions had as nice features. Nicknames for bookmarks and quick url-bar based searches where there since 2006 :)

       what version of opera are you using? the last time i checked, recent versions of opera use the same engine as chrome and in my experience are just as resource intensive (and are definitely less stable compared with chromium).

       Overall I am coming out better than firefox. I tried firefox light, which was the fastest browser I've ever used, but it had some issues like crashing every time you load flash or a webm or a gifv or look at it the wrong way....

       This build of Opera is essentially the same as Chrome, but I don't like Google all up in my business so I prefer Opera.

       As far as features I miss a few things (like being able to customize my top bar), but I think in the grand scheme of things I'll end up going to

       This shit happened ALL the time during the Digg 2.0 and 3.0 days. It's hilarious to believe that reddit ever had a system to avoid this in place. Hell, it happens blatantly in some meta-subs IRCs all the time.

       me too, it really angers me how quickly people have infiltrated reddit. but don't let the hate block you from thinking clearly. i used to ragequit after i read conspiracy theories, thinking i could take on all these evil people myself. but instead of just fuming, try thinking rationally like this: can we stop this? if so, what can be done to reverse, or at least mitigate this? what are our options? what kind of strategies can we implement to defeat or at least spread awareness of this?

       open your profile in incognito mode to check. I have recently been an ass so If i got shadowbanned for something I would assume that instead of this.
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy

       is a joke to reddit. I would guess no one would think high enough of this place to start shadow banning.

       Are you kidding me? When reddit moved out to San Francisco, Aaron didn't move with them. He simply failed to show up for work for quite some time - IIRC a month or two. When he did show up, he under-performed and was eventually bought out.

       Holy sh-t, I just Wiki'd the his article and it's terrible. This is one of the reasons why I hate academia. (Side rant: Professors read hundreds of fresh papers, straight up plagiarize the ideas, and then guess who has a new $100 textbook ready next semester? Oh, it's a required text for their class btw.)

       I agree with most of what you've said here.

       I've noticed that after many subs started filtering out brand new accounts where age&lt;Xdays/months, suddenly I started seeing 3 year old accounts with 1 day of actual activity which started 1 day ago or hours ago.  These accounts conveniently bypass all attempts to filter out instant trolls and throwaways, but more importantly these accounts are usually very focused on specific topics.

       Wow that's pretty amazing that you noticed the trend. Also would indicate that people have sleeper accounts just waiting for when they're needed. (especially if the account is 3 years old and 'woke up' shortly after the new accounts were getting hit)

       I caught a user a few months ago. The account was a bot that automatically copied a comment from a different user in each thread, and then the bot posted it. I noticed it completely by coincidence and I figured it out because the bot would not copy capital letters, so the comments were always mimicked in all lowercase, even with proper nouns, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       This account ran 24/7 and would get upvoted constantly even though the comment it copied was usually just a few down from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       By using this technique, I watched that account get +20K comment karma. But even more sinister, if you clicked on the account name, it was almost impossible to tell that the comment history was completely forged.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you could run a bunch of these bots, wait until they collected enough time and karma to look legit, then sell them. The new owner would begin to use them for corporate shilling or what have you, and anyone who tried to call them out would see months and months of seemingly legit comments that covered an entire range of topics. Comments that the account had not actually made, just copied.
      </p>

       I used to regularly check in with the user of that bot, and it got to the point where we were even a little bit friendly with each other. I would usually ask questions like "Pretty brilliant system. How much are you going to sell this for?", etc... and I would get replies that implied the owner knew exactly what I was talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if they eventually got caught out, because I was constantly blowing up their spot. But one day I signed in and the account was gone. It was called "timewaitsforsome".
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder how many of those bots are out there, slowly developing a real looking history.

       i caught a user a few months ago. the account was a bot that automatically copied a comment from a different user in each thread, and then the bot posted it. i noticed it completely by coincidence and i figured it out because the bot would not copy capital letters, so the comments were always mimicked in all lowercase, even with proper nouns, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       this account ran 24/7 and would get upvoted constantly even though the comment it copied was usually just a few down from it.
by using this technique, i watched that account get +20K comment karma. but even more sinister, if you clicked on the account name, it was almost impossible to tell that the comment history was completely forged.
      </p>
      <p>
       so you could run a bunch of these bots, wait until they collected enough time and karma to look legit, then sell them. The new owner would begin to use them for corporate shilling or what have you, and anyone who tried to call them out would see months and months of seemingly legit comments that covered an entire range of topics. Comments that the account had not actually made, just copied.

       The bot that I saw was much less sophisticated and I think someone from here caught it. All it would post would be the phrase, "nothing will make a difference," or "nothing will change" over and over. It would do this on topics related to politics, foreign policy, tech (like net neutrality and surveillance)... it was creepy.

       This was a while ago honestly, it is hard to remember specifics.

       But the owner of the bot definitely started seeing our interactions as a game, to the point where we actually started liking to interact. Like a professional courtesy or something. Like the guy working for your competitor, but you get to know each other over time.

       think about this, why is google better at indexing reddit then reddit's own search engine. I'm talking simply about "exact word matching" the simplest of search tools. Any database built in search feature would be better then the current search in reddit but it's crap compared to google even for exact word matching.

       it makes sense. i've seen a lot of what OP is saying. think about this. Reddit describes itself an internet aggregator. hahaha! no, it is a generator, it is where stuff happens on the internet and that 'stuff' get disseminated. it is so much easier to start at the headwaters than manage the river downstream

       Great post, but the one thing I'd like to mention is that Reddit is NOT making tons of money. The website/community has tons of value (~$500million), but do not assume that means they make money.

       I'm glad I saw this. I have felt for a while that there was something different about Reddit. I would read about injustices around the world and it kept me informed. The American media filters so much. Reddit starting feeling filtered, too. There are a LOT of top posts from gaming subreddits. I don't mind, but it seems there a lot more and that other content is just not there anymore. I had subscribed to under eye...and noticed a change, so I unsubscribed.

       It's unfortunate, but I don't think you can. I like the community and information I get from online interaction, but it seems like there will come a day when the combined forces of advertisement and media manipulation will overwhelm most benefit there is to be gained from the internet.

       I can't find any evidence to substantiate the claims about undelete, a forum I frequent.  It is constantly trolled by mods like fritzly, posts are not deleted, and while the two humans on the team mod a lot of subs, those subs seem user-sympathetic.  The only questionable behaviour that I've ever seen from cojoco is friendliness to fritzly, and it's probably in his best interest to be that way for a number of different reasons.

       I'm saying that even at the time the issue seemed contrived and blown out of proportion.  The only two human mods for undelete now do not seem active other than that I know cojoco works on the code that makes that subreddit possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what seems like several months before the described issues, AssuredlyAThrowAway made a big fuss in undelete about IAmAnAnonymousCoward (two people whose names are crafted so similarly that I figured them for the same person) because he was a mod of r/politics.  This is no longer true, at any rate, but what I find so odd about it is that AssuredlyAThrowAway is a mod of r/worldnews and does not disclose this often.

       Magnora is a loon.  He thought theghostofdusty was a snoonet troll and he couldn't get his own subs correct (undeleteundelete vs deletenothing).

       Probably just stalking the "bad subs" (ones that actually call out the bullshit)  and monitoring discussion. I had a discussion with him once. He's openly pro censorship...that means he thinks certain knowledge should be hidden. He's here observing knowledge thats critical of him and the rest of the mods ruining this site. If you can put two and two together, it basically says that he actively monitors his critics and would censor this sub in a second IMO. When I asked him about what he wanted to censor, it was all typical anti-SRS shit. He's at least open about it, but he's still just here to tow the company line. Only mainstream prejudice is to be censored, not prejudice in general. Your typical
 "white males are the worst, and people of color can't be racist" kind of shit...although censorship in ANY form is disgusting.

       While I agree that users should not have the ability to mod so many subreddits and that Kesha may be writing facetiously in the comments you're responding to, you should check the subs they mod.  I can't see any defaults and the rest aren't well-frequented.

       Nice post, but a waste. McReddit is unrecoverable. Its done - finito - charred and burned. They won and they got a biased, synthetic, manipulated, viral ad platform that people still think is organic, open, and honest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nope.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder how much those bastards (like bipolarbear and his ilk) actually helped to bring about these changes thanks to all the bullshit. Almost like the agenda was to break it so they can 'fix' it to their standards...

       Yeah, I mean, obviously we still participate. I just don't get surprised or hurt when something is obviously censored or brigaded - its business as usual TBH. It sucks, but the sooner we accept that McReddit is not ours, is not able to be reverted back to the 'golden age,' and that there exists a large amount of 'official interference,' the better off we can be as the posts here will (hopefully) remain intact.

       Having jewish relatives who died in WW2, it was not like they didn't know and wanted to leave. You needed a lot of money to leave and then you needed a place that would let you come. Knowing is only HALF the battle.

       I understand - and it probably wasn't like the said "leave or you will die." I think it was more "leave or face arrest."

       This is why there are many survivors, people who escaped by any means necessary and who had good luck as well when doing so.

       There are reddit-clones like Voat which have potential, but have the same foundational loopholes that allowed what happened to reddit to recur. Its the anonymity factor: anyone can create one or multiple accounts, inevitably leading to bots, which can be used to misinform, disinform, sway opinion, stifle conversation, and so forth. I wouldn't want to get rid of  anonymity as this is what makes it so attractive (otherwise its just facebook).

       8chan sucks in it's own ways. It has no originality or soul of it's own. Seriously, Reddit is the best place right now, even though it's censored. One good thing is that when shitty subs become shitty, there will always be alternatives. I remember when I heard the main LBGT sub became a shithole, someone made an alternative which is where everyone eventually went to. Good thing, unlike 8chan, it still had the same soul as the original sub that went to shit. The good subs may not be on the default front page and many lurkers will not see it at first, but the good people and subs can always be found here for now.

       How is it that in every somewhat intriguing thread I happen to come across on Reddit, some whiner is complaint about social justice warriors? It's so annoying; I'm honestly considering leaving Reddit because of all the negativity surrounding it. And to top it off, it's incredibly boring.

       Meta-cognition is a sign of intelligence, the kind you get with critical thinking. This sub seems to still have a large amount of honestly inquisitive people - but is certainly not immune from the McReddit curse.

       to do would be to start doing more future predictions as well as list the weaknesses of current technology.

      <p>
       I would love to know who the next president will be based on how much walmart wants him/her to be. I would also find it incredibly entertaining to see what the CIA is going to cause next long before it happens. If predictions like this can be accurate enough it would be entertaining!
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that but knowing and learning how to make conspiracies more costly to do on modern technology would be super useful! All forms of leadership should hold the weight of forced transparency.

       You can take a heavy swing at most of it by taking a book out of SomethingAwful forums and have users pay for accounts (I think it's $5 or $10?).

       It won't get rid of shill mods and manipulation of the rules from the site owners, but it will get rid of a lot of spammers and disinformation.  Unless, of course, it becomes corrupted from within... then you're hopeless.
      </p>

       It may even strengthen incorruptibility because users will be providing the $$$ and not advertisers.

       One thing I enjoy the most about the Internet is the ability to read and discuss real peoples opinions from all over the world (often regarding news and politics in my case), but I'm having a hard time distinguishing shills from real people in subreddits like worldnews, which means I don't really trust any comment there, which in turn means its basically useless :(

       It doesn't help that you find less and less intellectual comments on each post. You could watch a crazy animal video and have unidan explain it, or read an article on R/world news and here both sides of the story in the comments. Now it's popular opinion and people shooting for that really good joke.

       The next step forward is a reddit like system that automates moderating through randomized crowd sourcing to eliminate arbitrary power users. I would also like to see a limited number of upvotes per user and meta-moderation for the automod system.. That coupled with some kind of built in bitcoin tipping system and revenue sharing, I think you have a better mousetrap.

       No this was not sarcasm. It was revealed a couple of months ago that they have paid players on staff. They are "looking for terrorist cells" domestically online. They play games all day. That's their job.

       Not really. They are in control of the subreddit remember? They can throw in the occasional amazon referral post, or similar. Get users to click on it; Then just sit back and collect 10% off of every sale made on amazon by that user.

       I dont want to sound accusing or anything, just curious: do you think you can effectively moderate so many subs every day or was it more of a one time contribution with your CSS skills? Also, how much time do you spend on reddit a day?

       I only do css for 99% of the subs I mod but I do actively mod like 15 subs. I spend probably 2 hours lurking or using the site normally a day and probably 45 mins moderating if I dont have any projects

       I feel like the bigger problem with that one was the crazy influx of super 'edgy' teens that hated their parents and wanted to make fun of them.

       FYI it's just np.reddit.com, without the 'www' subdomain.

       Also, I've noticed that there's a bot user called AutoModerator that almost 8,000 subs use to auto moderate them. Cleaning up posts with bad links and that sort of thing.

       This might sound pretty silly, but isn't that leaving it wide open for the admins (or someone else) to seize the account and get 100% full mod control of the majority of reddit?

       will ban you if they just think you didn't reply nicely enough to someone. You don't have to actually insult them, use bad words or anything, you just have to disagree sarcastically.

       Why? It's clear-cut defamation and/or libel (depending on jurisdiction) if there's no evidence upon which to base such claims. The website would be liable if they didn't remove it.

       While I agree with your sentiment, the website having any real liability for an insult/accusation between two anonymous users is a stretch. They're most likely just trying to keep things civil. Some people would like to call out shilling whenever they suspect it, but this can cause people to shy away from expressing genuine enthusiasm about anything with a price tag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banning does seem excessive but honestly you should have tangible proof or else you just look like an idiot. Then people form a generalized opinion and dismiss accusations like that more freely in the future. Also, I'm sure a lot of those mods have good intentions and would unban you if you apologized for breaking the rules.

       It's hard to get the right message across in this context, glad you know what I'm saying :D.  I think what separates great programmers from good is the desire for constant improvement -- definitely a life-long pursuit.  Having said that, web programming in general isn't exactly rocket science (although security is always a bit more difficult).

       The problem with "real" discussion sites is that you have no way to be truly open while remaining high-quality.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the one hand, if you have selective membership, it will start to become a circlejerk-y, cliquey back-patting society as you exercise direct choice on who is able to join the conversation. The quality of conversation, overall level of knowledge on topics, and adherence to site rules will be much higher, but the overall group will stagnate, or else become a power struggle for site privileges and influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, if you have an open membership model, the there's no need to worry about accusations of elitism, exclusivity or exclusion of any particular type of user. The topics will be fresher as more people contribute, and more topics will be started because you'll have users from more diverse backgrounds. The overall quality of conversation will be lower overall, however, and you'll have a much higher chance for trolls, griefers and flamers to pop up and cause a ruckus. You'll also have a higher userbase, which means mob mentality will be more prevalent; user bullying/brigading are considerations to take in this situation as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making a social/discussion website is a fine undertaking, but it requires a very thorough planning for both format and implementation.

       I don't have enough personal attachment to reddit to feel strongly about this stuff, but it has definitely changed my perspective of what I once viewed as an open platform where everyone had equal opportunity with security measures that did pretty well to keep out the cruft. Most of that is out the window now, but the one thing that really bugs me after all these years is that the community (read "hivemind") has the power to effectively mute people within a subreddit ("you must wait to post") in downvoting comments to below a karma threshold that throws the spam filter. This must have seemed like a great idea at one point, and I admit it sounds intriguing, but with the mob mentality around here it only results in strengthening the hivemind effect, with valid, dissenting all but vanishing from the discussion, generally weighted to the bottom out of visibility, or collapsed/invisible. I personally come to reddit to learn, and I often have to swap my sort to "controversial" and back just to find the information I'm looking for, which is rarely pursuit of confirmation of my own bias, but more often seeking what often goes unsaid or to gain a more objective view on a matter. It's nice that we have tools to conduct this type of browsing, but the comment throttling feature has to stop. Maybe they could reserve it for reported comments, or something.

       I don't really understand why anyone here is surprised by any of this. All reddit's servers take a ton of money to run, and those little ads in the corner just don't bring in the big money that people assume they do. To see the same clips from the same TV shows being spammed all over the front page over and over again, to see the same product placements and ad campaigns being regurgitated over and over and
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       assume that money is changing hands here is utterly naive. Reddit is a business, and people need to think a bit more critically about the content they are consuming here. It
       <em>
        utterly obviously
       </em>
       hasn't been a pure 'meritocracy' in quite a while.

       I'm not sure why you chose to respond to my comment. My initial disclaimer was supposed to serve to detach me from having any emotional investment in the issues brought up by OP's post. I'm really only aggravated by the community itself and I feel it would benefit from Reddit making a few minor changes, but I don't expect it to change because Reddit has been very successful giving everyone the gratification with seeing the results of their punishment enacted on commenters by triggering the spam flag after downvoting them. I understand the main problem at hand is the issue of Reddit's corporate structure and admins and I don't want to denounce any of OP's claims on the basis that I can't personally prove anything either way, but I wanted to add my own personal beef to the list.

       So, basically, if there was another platform created, the visibility should be the exact opposite that of reddit: posts everyone agrees on should be on the bottom by default, posts either "downvoted" or "controversial" should receive most visibility, no?

       Useful? Maybe for trolls. I can't understand why anyone do ascending ordered sorts on ratings, exactly opposite of Reddit's sort. I think that's what you're suggesting. In a way, it would influence people to counter those comments overwhelmed with negative votes by upvoting them to send them back down again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ideally, you'd want to do two lists, with a random selection of one of the comments displaying in a collapsible box with some action buttons, "report", "downvote" and "upvote" at the very top, as you said. User is presented the shitty comment and prompted to perform further action, with an accompanying note, "this comment has getting a lot of negative attention. Do you need to report them to the moderators for violating rules? Is it a horrible comment made by a person who serves no purpose on this earth?" This would give people the opportunity to consider whether someone has been vote brigaded. Perhaps the rest of the remaining comments would sorted normally.

       Holy shit! Reddit answered my feature request and I never even officially made one! I'm thinking this must have been an ongoing problem and they've never actually seen my bitching, of course, but wow! I've only ever received negative attention for every expressing this opinion, so of course you're the first person I thought of. Go to

       and note the default sorting will be "random", aka "contest mode", regardless of whatever your user preference is set to. It's possible this has been around for a while and I wasn't aware of it, but this seems to be a subreddit setting. It's my feeling that
       <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/undelete">
        /r/undelete
       </a>
       and any sub that deems itself to serve the purpose honorability and transparency should set this up as well. It decreases the odds of the hivemind effect, even if indirectly and not ideally.

       I don't have any data on it, but I feel like most of this can be explained by the fact that Reddit has grown multiple hundreds percent over the last few years. Any organization that grows in popularity and revenue is going to become homogenized and have its edges smoothed out. It doesn't take a conspirators effort; it just happens via natural sociological forces.

       Yes, I am very aware of the "standard" excuse for why reddit has declined. It is a conclusion that takes about 5 minutes to come up with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever thought about the fact that literally every person has thought of this rationale and that the people who would have taken over reddit would have known that this excuse would perfectly cover their organized manipulation?

       If you look at any organization that grew from small to large you will see a complete takeover by people in power. Or of course you can just chalk it up to something simple and easy to explain away, which is a defense mechanism of basic human nature when dealing with complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as I already said, that trait of human nature is something that those in power are very well aware of and exploit while using as the perfect cover for anything they were doing behind the scenes.

       Just offering a bit of a different opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit definitely has changed over the years. I joined 6 years ago and lurked for a while. It used to be very intimidating to participate in serious subreddits because comments were extensively backed by personal or professional knowledge, or citations to articles.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were wrong you'd be called out instantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Reddit community was exponentially smaller. Big subreddits had maybe 100K users. Probably less. I can't remember exactly.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there were always dumb jokes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember pun mega threads?
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember the narwhals bacon at midnight?
      </p>
      <p>
       Dumb jokes and dumb behavior was always a part of Reddit. It didn't used to be just an enlightened and progressive utopia.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just feels inaccurate to bemoan the loss of Circlejerk because it was a garbage subreddit for most of its life. It started as a kind of clever satire group and turned into dumb garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same for places like fffffuuuuuuuuu or atheism.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me the death of Reddit is more about a massive influx of young and ignorant people trying to exploit Reddit. Look at my art, listen to my music, watch this video I made.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/music">
        /r/music
       </a>
       had to make rules against self promotion because it was so rampant and annoying.
      </p>
      <p>
       same with
       <a href="/r/wearethemusicmakers">
        /r/wearethemusicmakers
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That's exactly what's happening now is exploitation for self gain. It's more sophisticated but that's because there's more to gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is nothing more than an ad site. Everything is fake and everyone is selling something.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah of course corporate interests are trying to get in on it, but everyone else is, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's lots of dumb people and lots of advertisers ruining the site. There may be some evil forces influencing parts of the site, and government agents of all kinds monitoring and steering discussions when they can.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we're having this discussion in the open and uninterrupted so everyone needs to chill out about Reddit being taken over and destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not all destroyed, because we can still organize and talk to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "mass media" subreddits like
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       or politics have always been a joke so who cares. Go build up a good community in
       <a href="/r/worldpolitics">
        /r/worldpolitics
       </a>
       or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/moosearchives">
        /r/moosearchives
       </a>
       is also a place to direct people to if they want to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit may be getting worse but we're all already here and can make parts better.

       I don't think so. Now that the admins are selling seminars on how to market on Reddit, the happy times are officially gone. Reddit is done. Reddit is DIGG, Reddit is Facebook, Reddit is Twitter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the best thing we can do is stop empowering Reddit with our posts, content and attention. Let the marketers, shills, and troll have this place.

       Wait what, by and large those are exactly the kind of people that we need. Censoring them has been a massive problem. The main issue is the voting system is not being embraced. An aggregator that has a filtering system driven by people should never have manual censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is the primary problem with all of this. The second you take out filtering methods or make them useless is the second you destroy what the site is really about.

      <p>
       I disagree with that statement. The fact is that there are subreddits that are allowed to exist as 'quarantine zones'. These discussions are going to happen no matter what but it's in every way in reddit's interest if they're allowed to happen ON REDDIT. It keeps things highly manageable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like this post for example had to happen here in r/conspiracy, where else would it not get instantly deleted? By it being posted here the discussion automatically loses credibility both because of the usual conspiracy theory insanity and because people like you can go and say 'well here we are talking about reddit on reddit so it can't be all bad'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have to consider that if this sort of discussion was forced off reddit they'd start to lose pageviews and would lose any influence they had on the discussion. They don't want that happening, they want everything here on reddit where they can see it going on and intervene when necessary. Prime example is gamergate being almost sitewide banned with the exception of r/kotakuinaction. The dissidents get their corner to talk about things while the 'mainstream' portions of the site are kept on the agenda.

       This is so true. Reddit has such fucking potential and in the beginning, so many amazing things were achieved by the users working in unison. I can vividly remember this website single-handedly leading to the closure of the Elan School, a place that abused children and was open for over 40 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit bitch-smacked that place within 24 hours and then it closed and all the children were released.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now look at what we have. Its a crying shame really. Such fucking wasted potential.

       Is it just me or have I seen a staggering amount of racism among other things popping up more frequently as well? I'm not talking about the aggro people talking about "SJW hug boxes" and shit either, but the real subtle stuff - the kind of stuff that silently creeps into a readers mind as "plausible" because it's not overtly offensive.

       You can add the 'no calling shill' rule to the list.
And I get it, people call other people shills too often, do we really need to start banning people over it though? Why not call them out when they accuse someone of being a shill without any proof?

       This.  We have shills getting paid to shill with American tax dollars.  If the site owners (not just Reddit, they're all over the net) can't stop or spot them, who is going to?  They completely ruin free exchange of ideals, and that is exactly what they intend to do.

       I'd love to sue the US gov and some of these corporate shills and even have them prosecuted for what they're doing, but hey, I'm an American.  We are worthless when it comes to making our government and companies behave.  Sorry, world.

       We could develop a tagging system, just like askreddit has a [serious] tag. People could tag self-posts with something that implies they are only looking for a discussion with people who are willing to entertain the basic premise the theory is built from.
      </p>
      <p>
       So someone could actually have an in-depth conversation about an aspect of, for example, WTC7 without being flooded by arguments that refuse to even acknowledge that it was an unusual thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, people here want to discuss some conspiracies with other people who have read up on the conspiracy. A lot of those threads are destroyed by people who come in just to argue that the mainstream media explanation is sound and anyone who thinks otherwise is stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to sit there and explain to people that I have already registered the mainstream reasons in my mind, but that I am now PAST that point and want to have a discussion with other people who are PAST that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess that would be the best way to describe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that there are a ton of creative ways that we can at least TRY to build a better subreddit and we don't need to be politically-correct to the point where we let every baby who cries "OMG, dats censorship" ruin this sub from evolving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people are not going to like the new rules. Thats just life and they will have to deal with it. Too many times the mods in this sub try to placate everyone and make everyone happy. The intentions are correct, but in practice this has helped to ruin this place.
      </p>
      <p>
       And obviously when we try out a new system, it would just be a test-run. I NEVER see test-runs of new systems in this subreddit. Its like we aren't even trying.

       This is good because it's so damn true. Someone the other day posted a link to their comment in worldnews and someone responded "how much does the Kremlin pay you to post this stuff" and the guy had 10 upvotes.

       I actually received an interesting message from a worldnews mod.
      </p>
      <p>
       First I got a PM saying I was banned for shill accusations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I got a PM a few minutes later saying "Sorry, we misread your comment, your ban has been lifted".
      </p>
      <p>
       My comment was a little sarcastic and Poe's Law-y so I do not question that they genuinely misinterpreted it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do find it interesting that in a Russia/Ukraine thread where all of my comments were essentially trying to advocate actually reading the article and not just knee-jerking, the mods jumped at the chance to ban
       <em>
        me
       </em>
       while simultaneously choosing to ignore loads of other comments calling out "Putin-bots", ending insults with "comrade", or implying that "Russia was paying them to post".

       Yeah that's the biggest problem with all of these rules, selective enforcement. It's the same way they write laws in ways that can be open to interpretation so they can abuse them later.

       1)
       <a href="/r/reddit.com">
        /r/reddit.com
       </a>
       was removed to prevent confusion. Plenty of other subreddits exist for discussing the community:
       <a href="/r/metareddit">
        /r/metareddit
       </a>
       , for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Believe it or not thousands of Redditors are happy to have an opportunity to ask famous people questions. There's no money involved in coordinating these threads. Any celebrity could host one for $0.00. Should they be banned from hosting threads? Well now that's the very censorship you claim to oppose. Obviously threads get exploited (albeit rarely) for commercial purposes, but so does everything else in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) "Eglin Air Force Base = Reddit's most addicted city" "most addicted" as in "highest number of visitors per capita" this is due to the fact that this "city" has an extremely low population, and that it functions as an IT training center even for non-government-associated persons. and believe it or not, a high percentage of people with interests in IT visit reddit. Even if this were some "secret shilling operation" were going on there, why the fuck would they be using Military IPs for it? You really think they would be that reckless?
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Yes censorship does happen there, I agree with that, but it's rare for threads to get removed for illegitimate reasons.  I frequent
       <a href="/r/undelete">
        /r/undelete
       </a>
       , and at least 80% of threads are deleted for legitimate reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       6) The vote fuzzing exists to prevent the very same shilling you claim to oppose. Those fuzzing rules are what stops me from creating 10 new accounts through proxies and voting myself up.
      </p>
      <p>
       8) Again, prevents the very same shilling you claim to oppose. If this limitation were lifted, what stops me from spamming my products everywhere? People will catch on and downvote, but this restriction prevents spamming from getting out of hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       9) I don't think
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is banned from the front page but please correct me if I am wrong. As for ". Different subs are given different algorithms." - do you have a source on that? Create a sub and tell me how exactly to implement that function. Must be kind of hard, since it doesn't exist anywhere in the reddit source code.
      </p>
      <p>
       11) Rule was implemented for many reasons, the primary being that "shill" has become a buzzword to attack anyone with opinions that do not coincide with your own. Abused to the point where at least 95% shill accusations are just plain incorrect.

      <p>
       1) r/reddit was a major subreddit that made the front page almost daily. r/metareddit is an obscure subreddit that gets no play on the front page. There is a BIG difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) you can believe the official story if you want, and I will continue to believe that AMA's are done for profit (profit made by reddit). Of course any celebrity could just sign in, but then they would have to compete with the sponsored AMA's that are set up strategically where the largest stars get the best peak hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are celebrities doing AMA's from reddit HQ? Why do all major AMA's need a person named Victoria? These are valid questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Englin Air Force Base would not have been caught at all if not for someone at reddit not getting the memo to leave it out of the stats. That is my personal theory and that would explain why they didn't need to hide their IP's, etc... Because they were assured that they would not get caught and once the mistake was made, it was too late to back-track because that would have brought even more attention to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) The "legitimate" reasons that posts are deleted are based on the interpretation of rules that are intentionally written so that they can be abused and selectively enforced. Every con has a cover story. All you are saying is "those post broke the rules so they ended up in undelete". Congrats, you are buying into the system they designed for the sole purpose of giving every deletion a reasonable cover story.
      </p>
      <p>
       6) You are absolutely wrong when it comes to new voting system. I actually find it insulting that you think you can rationalize that to me when I was on this site for over 5 years using the other system and I am more than capable of understand the differences between then and now. They changed the voting and it has made manipulation easier. It has made manufacturing consensus easier. It has made it easier for them to vote-brigade. It was a brilliant move on their part actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       8) Those rules only enforce mob mentality and this can be witnessed every single day on subreddits like r/worldnews. They further the echo-chamber mentality and nothing more. It is disgraceful.
      </p>
      <p>
       9) r/conspiracy is banned from appearing on the page 1 on an unsigned-in front page of reddit. This is how a large majority of users view the site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Proof of different algorithms is explained in the link I provided.
      </p>
      <p>
       11) I have no problem with rules as long as they are not selectively enforced. Calling someone a shill in now not okay, but calling someone a
       <em>
        Russian
       </em>
       shill is perfectly acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       And once again, if you actually click on the link provided under that number, you will see the issue is not about calling people a shill as much as it is about the mods creating a system where you are unable to do anything because their rules created a catch-22.

       I have to unfortunately agree with you on is the voting system and how much easier it is to get a hive mentality.  That in itself is scary stuff because we all know too many people get a easily caught up in a herd mentality and don't take a question first.  I am guilty of this just as much as anyone.  Although I do hope for the benevolence of the admins and staff who run this site.  I understand they have to make money and will sell the website in a way that it can, and there is really no stopping the Democratic circle jerk because of the majority of the age bracket who visit this website.  But right now I still do enjoy the hilarious GIF's and everyday meme's even though 90% of them are probably fabricated or lies.  Still makes me smile which in some ways is worth more.

       the bottom line is they are now hiding numbers that were always incorrect to begin with. Any  "Sense" you used to make out of them was a lie.

       You are really missing the point here. I understand that the upvotes/downvote were only a representation, even from the beginning. But showing that representation added a new dimension to a comment that is now absent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at these two comments:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        -5
       </strong>
       : (45/-40) Wow, I really hate it when people do that!
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        -5
       </strong>
       : Wow, I really hate it when people do that!
      </p>
      <p>
       The first comment reflects a controversial opinion, but one that many people agree with. This is clear from the visual representation, regardless of whether or not the numbers are
       <em>
        exact
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The second comment is begging for downvotes. People will knee-jerk downvote it because they won't even try to understand the logic behind it. This is human nature 101.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are facts of human nature that have been backed up by scientific experiments and trials.

       I'll disagree with rarely based on purely anecdotal evidence, because most of the AMAs I see mention the latest movie/project/charity that the famous person supports and that benefits someone. I don't really have a problem with that, but everyone should be allowed to do the same. (I'm still kind of pissed that the OAG girl was denied an AMA a couple of years ago.)

       I'm curious about #9 since I found this post via
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       . Not the front page of course but it's not like I had to do anything but browse
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The links I'm suspicious of are those persistent posts that follow you through pages and pages of
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       . I wonder if they would still follow you after you click on them once. Hmmm, that would be very easy to script...

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       about reddit censorship or reddit mod conspiracies makes the first page on
       <a href="/r/all">

       . As long as reddit itself remains the venue of choice for those discussing censorship on reddit, I find it hard to take such complaints very seriously.

       is not a default subreddit so no, you have not seen links on the front page or the second page. That would only happen if you are logged in to an account subbed to that subreddit. If you're complaining about it not being a default and it is being buried, that is a whole different argument because you could make the argument that any non-default sub is being buried.

       What you are saying is incorrect. Default subreddit are not the only ones allowed to make the front page, unless reddit recently changed that system as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT
       </strong>
       : You could be correct actually. But I don't believe it has
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       been this way. Maybe it has something to do with point #9 and the fact that different subs are now given different algorithms.

       It has worked the same way for as long as I have visited reddit, but I rarely visit while logged out and it could have changed. Default subs show up on the front page, this is why you can make an account and pick your subreddits that you want to see on your front page. That was always the point of the default subs unless I am mistaken. Non-default subs will only show on All.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone can provide a link proving me wrong, feel free, but from my understanding, it makes sense that non-default subs are not shown on the front page, otherwise  what would the point of All even be? I just opened reddit while not logged in and all of the posts for the first few pages were from the defaults, so that small test seems to indicate this is the case.

       The front page is not only for default subreddit, it is for any posts from any subreddit that reach a certain score within a certain amount of time. That is why obscure subreddits like r/twitchplayspokemon were hitting the
       <strong>
        front page
       </strong>
       when that concept went viral and the userbase was large enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the biggest problems is that it has now been proven that not all subreddits are created equal because reddit admins have essentially started rigging certain subreddit to more easily reach the front page and others to have a handicap in reaching it.

       It doesn't happen all the time, but "default" subs do reach the front page. Or at least they did up until recently (the last year).

       The TPP posts were all over
       <a href="/r/gaming">
        /r/gaming
       </a>
       as well. I don't visit the main front page enough to dispute you fully, but I would imagine that crossposting to the larger subs is why stuff like that can surface. I followed TPP closely and don't recall any front page posts from that specific subreddit, but is it also not possible they whitelisted that sub temporarily to allow it on the front page and gain some traffic? I have no idea if they can even do that, but I think that would be a much more reasonable explanation if possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd really like to see if it is actually happening, but I can't say I have ever seen a non-default on the main front page. Unless you can show proof, it is entirely premature for you to say it was proven.

       Indeed, which is why I said "first page of r/all" instead of "front page of reddit." You don't have to log in to see the first page of
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all

       Not totally disagreeing with you,but just because something is not in the app side source code doesn't mean it can't happen. Plenty of data crunching occurs server-side or even at the DB level that isn't found in the app source code.  At least in every app I've worked with.

       The length of existence of an account is completely irrelevant, obviously. Do you think I was born 1 month ago? Do you think I have never been to reddit before the start of those 30 days? In this community its almost a necessity to create new accounts because of people like you who go into other's profiles looking for something to criticize.

       is just a meta jerk where they repeat whatever memes are popular on that particular sub.  I never see anything that questions the politics or perspective of the hive.  They mostly just talk about how comcast is a bunch of nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, you mention that we get a lot of military propaganda- pictures with soldiers and dogs.  You'll never see anything like that on r/circlejerk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Infact, they spend a lot of time mocking 9/11 Truth, which hasn't been popular on reddit in about 5 years- other than in this sub.

       I can remember when circlejerk used to regularly get it right. For every viral 10 posts that were joking nonsense, maybe 3 of them would hit the nail on the head and correctly satirize whatever current circlejerk reddit was on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now almost every major sub has become a circlejerk and a post that points it out will never go viral and to the front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I see your point and I really believe that there was a moment when r/circlejerk went from a bunch of free-wheeling jokers to what it is now. It was taken over. Probably around the time that the Ron-Paul-jerk started, during the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you click on the video I linked, it is insane to believe that this coordinated media campaign was happening simultaneously with the Ron-Paul-jerk on reddit. And I am not Ron Paul fan and never was, though I am not against him or anything. And I get that reddit really was circlejerking over him at the time, but there was a definitely a point where it suddenly went from a joke to a coordinated campaign.

       The anti-paul brigade were what brought down digg, as far as I understand.  Though that history seems to have been re-written to make it look like the Ron Paul supporters were in fact the digg patriots bury brigade.

       Super users also greatly contributed to Digg's death. The top hundred accounts had massive amounts of followers and controlled the content that became popular using the "share" megaphone which broadcasted submissions to their followers.

       I wasn't here before they changed the voting.  I wondered as soon as I saw it who was responsible and why they didn't show us upvotes and downvotes so we'd know.  It seemed so silly and it still does.

      <p>
       The military base activity is terrifying and we Americans should be able to sue our government for engaging in this behavior, if not prosecute criminally.  If enough Americans had any sense, we would do so at once.  I apologize to the rest of the world, we're mainly media celebrity gobbling idiots.  But hey, did you hear something or other about that whatsits chick who got famous for two seconds for taking off her clothes in an Ohio mall?

       I wouldn't compare reddit to foxnews.  At least not just yet.  But I suppose in a way it could become worse.  What's worse than censorship?  Highly skilled manipulation of perception so that people don't even say what the powers that be feel should be censored to begin with.  It isn't just Reddit, though.  Not by a long shot.  Been seeing this stuff online for over a decade now.  Everything from silly advertising to dead serious political stuff.  Complete with personal attacks on everyone who doesn't toe the line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for confirming something I've seen other sites do and wondered if this one did:  Disappearing posts but letting the writer of the post still see it as though it's actually there.

       Makes me wonder why more independent sites similar in layout to Reddit and other forums (Huffpo and Democratic Underground, for example) don't seem to get anywhere.  The biggest sites for politics have all pissed me off one way or another.  But there are no viable alternatives.

       thats the problem. any good alternative quickly gets the Reddit treatment, like hell anyone with money to lose is going to ignore a +150 million user site. and like facebook, it's "too big to fail". i hate facebook, but i wouldn't know anything about half of my social circle without it. and same here. how am i suppose to find a social group for all of my interests? for example Cities:Skylines. +60k users in two weeks. that's a resource i can't ignore. no way the Steam or Paradoxplaza forums can compete with the layout of Reddit.

       i find myself just unsubscribing from anything that is on the default list and isn't a direct hobby, like r/fishing or r/paradoxplaza

       Hiding the upvote/downvote counts is a measure against vote manipulation, and the resistance to it was mis-timed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Waaay back when...
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Reddit had an API for querying exact up/down counts
       </li>
       <li>
        Reddit start using a "fake" vote system, where up or down votes would be added via an algorithm. This was an attempt to balance out vote spamming: silent upvotes were added to comments that were brigaded, and silent downvotes were added to comments that were getting spammed up.*
       </li>
       <li>
        Reddit Enhancement Suite started using the API to add the counts to the UI.
        <strong>
         But
        </strong>
        , those counts were not always accurate: If the fake vote system had touched a comment, then RES would not be able to get the "true" tally of which votes were placed by users.
       </li>
       <li>
        Reddit removed the API, since it was giving misleading 
information.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       *Admins claimed that even while the vote counts for a given comment were silently adjusted, the overall total of (up count) - (down count) was still true. I fail to see how that's possible, but that might just be misunderstanding on my part.
      </p>
      <p>
       At no point did Reddit itself ever display up/down counts. At no point was anyone able to see
       <em>
        true
       </em>
       up/down counts. The upsetting part should not be that they shut down the API, it should be the obfuscation around the votes in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP has a lot of good points, but there is always misunderstanding around the vote count issue.

       They need to be in jail for doing this.  It's a direct threat to freedom of speech, association, and our ability to participate in a democratic society in a meaningful way through exchanges of ideas online as well as face to face (haha as though we ever had a democratic society to participate meaningfully in!  But this sort of thing is meant to ensure we never will.)

       Isn't this exactly what some Snowden documents have showed?
Atleast that the NSA work for manufacturing consent on the web?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also:
Whats the alternative?
Is anybody gonna start using Voat immediately?
How do we protect and give space to the open voices on the net, if all that happens when users change space is that space subsequently being invaded?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ps. You opened my eyes man, i remember the more open times too but but i cant put a finger on WHEN it became like this, i guess thats the danger. Now that you explained it i understand whats new/weird about the voting system, i had noticed but couldn't put my finger on it

       We need to have a site-wide campaign to have EVERYONE sort by NEW.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then everyone will SEE the suspicious bullshit that i always point out...
      </p>
      <p>
       Like 2 hours into a post with a guy in uniform getting licked by his dog that i can reverse image search in seconds and find from a news article two years ago somehow has 2000 upvotes and 120 comments.. mhm... if everyone was on
       <a href="/r/new">
        /r/new
       </a>
       everyone would see that things arn't right.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also need to change reddit to force people into the comment section when they open a link...i don't know but it would help if the comment section was somehow forced on people lol.  A big problem is just the sheer number of lurkers.

       You know, when I first discovered reddit, it was like the Wild West of the Internet, but I mean that in the best possible way.  Content was user determined, shills were few and far between, and you could tell when someone actually disagreed with your statements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the past few years, I have seen things take a tragic change,  I can no longer depend on r/news and R/worldnews to deliver real news, and this sub to an extent has even changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there another "reddit" circa 2011, out there?  If so, point me in that direction and I will leave this site forever.

       There isn't and there never will be. It's not in the cards. Just like there will never be another Facebook.

       New sites will be ignored. If they somehow gain traction, they will be bought out or spammed/DDoS'd/litigated in to nonexistence. Reddit has become a media/marketing oasis, a mecca.

       I generally agree with OP, I'd just like to point out that the common factor behind all of the listed changes is control over how politics is discussed on reddit.  The admins decided that they didn't want anything truly controversial on the front page, and they made changes to make that (mostly) happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to don a thin layer of tin foil, I suspect that certain organizations desire to curtail reddit's crowdsourcing abilities - such as when we helped to stop SOPA.

       Did any of you see that "Steve Buscemi" AMA the other day? Photoshopped picture bullshit. No one said anything about it not a single mention despite the complete similarities to the Morgan Freeman 'shop. That was my last straw, I am just waiting for something else and parking here but I have no more doubts Reddit is fucked.

       There's a bit of information but essentially this image was resaved at least once with 25% of the data being lost.  This isn't like save from the internet to my computer. This is open in an editing program and save it after changing things.  The ELA data is a little harder to determine but most puctires will have a uniform look throughout the picture but you can see the note is a different color blue than any of the other blues AND if it was really there it would actually be a bit brighter as well as more uniform.

       Well said.

       Removing the vote-counter was the "last straw" for me. Before that I was able to shrug off the propaganda subreddits and  admins blatantly facilitating PR interests(obviously for profit).

      <p>
       But such a malicious injury the users as intentionally obscuring the votes was what ended any benefit of the doubt I could possibly give the pieces of shit who run this site.

       The scary part about this all is every single person (when you type "how reddit was destroyed" in the search bar) absolutely ignores the severity of all of this and just make jokes. It's really bizarre. Not one of them tries to have an intelligent discussion but instead just mocks... So sad.

       The first thing they did was create sub-reddits... reddit without censorship or subreddits is a really neat tool.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is... there is an uncensored version of reddit... but it is not for you.  They can do math to see how fast an article accelerates before they remove it, or +4k it.  And, they keep it for themselves.

       Reddit is controlled by the media to show what it wants to show, to monopolise content, to manipulate content, to push an agenda (feminism is the biggest one so far). Yep, its all going to shit.

       I'll connect with a throwaway just to give you an upvote. Not really useful but hey.

       My main account was banned over an issue with JIDF. I don't really remember the exact topic, it concerned Israel though. Now i'm not really antisemitic : half my family has disappeared for being jew in WW2 (am french), a stepsister has married a jew (and became herself jew), plus for 10 years now I study geopolitics and macroeconomics as a hobby (because why the fuck not, it's like game of throne in the real world). So we had a discussion, obligatory JIDF shills appear, so fucking obvious we were like 10 to call them out. Then we see they open a r/conspiracy topic linking to our discussion so we also call them out here. Wrong move fuckers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I lost my 3 year old account that day. I was banned from several subreddit, including r/conspiracy, and little by little it went from banning to doxing. Deleted everything in a hurry. Of course reddit staff was contacted, but you know? I was the bad guy, because I'm a fucking antisemitic conspiracy tard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is dead indeed. Went from "4chan with clever discussion" to "witch hunt and marketing tool". Move on, it's over.

        We now have an entirely new way to view upvote/downvote scores. A user used to be able to see their score. But now, everything is fuzzed. For example, if you made a semi-controversial comment before, but many people agreed, you may have a score like (47/45), leaving you with a -2 next to the comment. Now you just get a -2 and nobody knows if anyone agreed with you.

Nothing critical/real anymore. Just opinions I saw on Fox News and the German 'Bild' magazin already. This sucks.

       Preventing it is definitely an uphill battle and it will only become more sophisticated as one tries to prevent it. But like anything in life, it is worth it to slow down and deter the problem, even if it will inevitably come back.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think an even bigger issue is why we are doing NOTHING to prevent it while actively making it easier for them to manipulate the site. This website seems to be great at destroying checks and balances instead of evolving them.

       i dont understand what is so wrong with having a flare that says you're officially representing someone or thing. it is awesome in gaming subreddits, great to see developer interaction. of course, the only one who stands to lose is that division of corporate who want anonymity and shadow influence. that fact that subreddit communities can't do this (make community generated flairs for 'shills' or otherwise detracting accounts) just shows me how reddit is just Reddit

       Thats a good point, there are probably plenty of people who would love to be able to talk with mainstream representatives of various products or companies.

       It is just one more example of corporate sneak-ery shooting itself in the foot. An obvious side-effect of greed.

       Does anyone have any ideas about what we can do? Also, I am amateur web programmer but I'm thinking that it might be good to make a website that tracks certain things on reddit, or allows people to put un-delete stuff there rather than on reddit... But I'm not sure if I'd get in trouble for hosting reddit comments on my site.. Any input?

       Also on that same note, in the years following 9/11 there was plenty of open-mindedness on differing theories of what really happened, was or wasn't it a conspiracy, and so on. Try that now on reddit and you will be ignored, mass downvoted, or ridiculed.

       Some of my favorite puff piece propaganda comes from Europe.   The once a month front page posts idolizing the queen.   Some silly photo of the queen with her in all her glory pops up once a month on the front page.   I always scratched my head as to "why" and made an off the cuff remark about her and was banned from the sub.  It wasn't even that bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I believe much of the influence is geared towards monetary gain as opposed to government control,  there are some posts that come along that leave me scratching my head.   The creepy utah daycare being one of those posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe everything is a conspiracy,  but I do believe reddit has become riddled with agendas and is sensoring like crazy.   Be it government,  corporate,  or mod with an agenda,  I will probably never know.   I bet if Snowden tried to use reddit to expose the NSA he would be promptly banned before anyone could read it.  He's only allowed to post now because the cat is already out of the bag.

       <a href="/r/science">
        /r/science

       started banning "climate deniers". No legitimate criticism of any study or conclusion derived therefrom was allowed that disagreed with reddit's position on global warming. It could have been the worst, most contrived, error ridden study in existence, but oh well you're banned!

       I've only been on Reddit for a year and a half, and I see all these things. To me, its just what happens when a website starts to profit. They realize they wont be around forever and have to bleed out every cent they can get. So whoever "donates" the most cash, controls what people get to see. Just like ever "news" channel on TV.

       I think reddit is still useful if you unsub all defaults and sub stuff like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .  Reddit is still extremely valuable for me to decipher the truth from the lies.  Sure, we aren't reaching people who aren't already sympathetic to the cause but it is still very useful for those who are.

       Just to clarify, I shared how uncomfortable I was with the glorification of army men sob stories on the front page and how irrational it seemed to me as a Western European. I was expecting retaliation -I'm not new to Imgur or  Reddit - but not like that. It's definitely gotten more sinister than last year.

       As someone whos been on reddit less than 2 years I can say that even in that time frame I've noticed mind boggling changes for the worse. Defy popular opinion? You're fucked. Not an SJW? You're fucked. Not a political/corporate shill? You're fucked. Speak out about karma whoring or any other karma conspiracy? You're fucked.

       I'm also sick of the restrictive rules in the news subs. I've gotten shit for too many legitimate posts about timely news. On top of that, I can't tell if 4 or 400 people like my contributions. Frustrating.

No, I didn't make shitty comments. I made comments that didn't coincide with popular opinion which is what Reddit runs on.

       It seems to me this subreddit isn't controlled in the same way the more mainstream subreddits are. I think they reserve disinformation campaigns for r/conspiracy. This combined with the hearty natural dose of nonsense makes navigating here a treacherous affair. It's dangerous mental space if you don't exercise extreme prejudice. But I stop by to check for grains of truth. Your post is a pretty big grain.

       I havent experienced the issues you have, but you have some good ideas on how to make Reddit completely open.  The Admins shoud read and take notice.  Also, you should not have been deleted -- consider this post a protest on your behalf.

       I read everything and the first thing that came to mind was Digg. There was so much hate for it in my day and I never once jumped on that bandwagon. Funniest thing was I kept telling myself that Reddit is Digg and that one day, users will abandon it in droves for something better.

       no it's not.  They often take things out of context and take offense to any minor thing.  Sometimes people say fucked up shit but a lot of the times, shit on that subreddit is way overblown and people overreact.

       But I think your post is really one of Reddit's gems. The Forever September thing got me thinking about how online communities are actually not that open... everyone conforms to a preformed netiquette.

       I have seen a metric fuck ton of censorship here. Mods will regularly delete a comment they don't like (usually criticizing the mods or calling them out on some other censorship) and then put a note saying it was something entirely different. There really very much needs to be a move, this
       <strong>
        is not

       the reddit I joined 6 years ago anyway, that reddit has been dead for a while.

       4chan can just be a little much for some people or at certain times. Like the unavoidable gore, titties on the front page. It's always in NSFW/L mode.

       Eglin as one of the largest military bases, thus having one of the largest amount of civilian personal in defense contracting and technical positions, does not surprise me too much that they goof off on the dime of their employers.

       But since you are talking about shilling, a legitimate point is that calling out shills in the comments is banned in some subs where you are now supposed to talk to the moderators yourself.  Those same moderators say the program is working and shills have been found.  But you don't know for sure what is happening, if they were the legit shills, if they were banned, etc...

       While not required, you are requested to use the NP domain of reddit when crossposting. This helps to protect both your account, and the accounts of other users, from administrative shadowbans. The NP domain can be accessed by prefacing your reddit link with np.reddit.com.

       Not only Reddit, RT news as well on their youtube and home website ever since the Ukraine affair from last year the number of them rose dramatically.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shills just like the USA are doing the bidding of Israel. There is no patriotism about it although patriotism might be the catalyst of the bodies involved to get shills in the first place. Interestingly the shills are very very close to uncovering what their bosses are hiding from them. Not to mention the high stress that the shills experience from all the abuse the receive and the paranoia of being found out by the forums. Which as a result many would call quits.

       How can you be sure it will remain that way if nobody sees it if it's been banned? Or are you saying it's important to

       If all you say is true, then how does this post exist and what makes it trustworthy? I'm not disagreeing, just shocked to have come across this 2 days after posted. Explains a lot of shit that's happened to me and really turned me off about reddit.

       I like a lot of the niche subreddits which is why I still visit daily, but I was thinking about unsubscribing from
       <a href="/r/news">

       ,
       <a href="/r/politics">

       ,
       <a href="/r/worldnews">

       and pretty much ever other default sub except maybe
       <a href="/r/videos">
        /r/videos

       . This post put me over the top. voat.co is where I'll be getting my news from now forward.

       So what can we do?  I'm not being incredulous, but genuinely asking what it is that we can do.  I'm glad to find that I'm not the only one who feels this way.  I've been a long time lurker on reddit since the very beginning and have witnessed its growth from obscurity, it's fall from grace, and now its homogenized, easily manipulated, hollowed out husk of a current existence.  At one time it was a great source of communal education.  If we look at our human history we see that each new information technology has its early adopters who use it as almost a sounding board for advancing intellect - a communal mind.  We are more intelligent as a group than as individuals.  The difficulty is in the fact that as it grows you risk pedestrian over saturation that fosters abuse and draws the attention of those who would control us.  Old business models have adapted more readily to internet marketing than we like to admit and I believe that it has occurred so subtly that we have been trained not to see it.  Even in the early days of publication, radio, movies, and television there have been those who would use media to manipulate the masses and sell not only a product but a lifestyle of easy persuasion and indifference to government control - corporations and the government have vested interests, shared goals, and are ultimately so reliant on one another as to be one and the same.  We have more than reached that point here on the internet, we have found ourselves struggling to keep from drowning in the middle of it.  The internet is no longer a disconnected jungle of unbiased information, it is a well collated collection of propaganda.  So what do we do?  Is the darknet going to be viable? I don't believe that simply cloning reddit is going to be the answer - it could just as easily be an outright deception from the beginning or eventually corrupted in just the same way.  It's also hard to get people to adopt a new-but-similar "product" when one that is already established and enormously popular is available.  Reddit is a household commodity worldwide now and I believe it is the main mechanism of control being perpetrated against our internet loving generation.

       I don't think there's a conspiracy here...Sure it makes sense to put your rant in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       because there are fewer rules here than the rest of Reddit and the mods are generally great guys.  There's a shitload more "democracy" in this subreddit than the rest of the site!
      </p>
      <p>
       But what I'm saying is, this is just one of the swings of the site...it's going way to the right now and will probably go this way for a couple more years before it swings back the other way.  I should know, I was here when it first started...I learned about it from a FARK link for chrissakes, back when Mike Arrington had just started Techcrunch as a blog...do you guys remember when there was a forum on that site?  With conversations about startups and great new social media sites.  Those were the days!
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit used to be this tiny FARK imitation site where you could vote, share and discuss any fucking thing you wanted without moderation, kinda like 4chan, but with a better setup.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess some of us are waiting for the next thing, but for right now, we got
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and that's good enough for most of us :)

       There is a constant manipulation to takeover important subreddits, and those "mocking" subreddits are how they do it by gathering support from an ignorant mob.

       So if Reddit is too far gone, what's the alternative? Is there even another open source sharing site out there? Maybe something decentralized? 
Don't be part of the problem, let's be part of the solution.

       What we need is an open source reddit clone.  Something where anybody can deploy it and fork it to their heart's content, but it will remain transparent.  I'm not sure how you would handle the spam issue the other reddit clone faced, but  I'm sure the community would be able to devise a way.

       I left digg when it had become an obvious public opinion manipulation tool. I've tolerated reddit, not because it hasn't, but because I don't know of any alternatives just yet. However, there will be some decentralized, merit based, options, eventually. As soon as I identify them, I won't waste my time with this nonsense anymore.

       This is because when you accuse someone innocent of being a shill, 9/10 they get doxxed. Their post history is scoured through, every thing they've ever posted gets googled to try and find more about this person. It's an invasion of privacy. Granted there should be a reasonable waiver of your privacy on here, but people post things with out thinking sometimes.

       "this subreddit is archived and no longer accepting submissions." r/reddit.com is essentially just history, that what he meant by taken away.
"Only reputable sources are allowed" these "reputable" sources are heavily biased, most likely to what the elites support.
"You are posting too much, please wait..." referring to the post limit which would more often than not, lead people to leave the site before posting the two comments they wanted to post. Keep everything controllable *wink
"Their post history is scoured through, every thing they've ever posted gets googled " well how the hell else are we supposed to know if what they post is based on endorsing a single topic (different to being relevant to topics). Patterns are looked for, and if right ones (or wrong ones) are found, then it will be known whether they're shills or not.

       It would seem that algorithms could be written to eliminate a lot of this.  You are posting excessive,  don't act like a human,  etc,  you are gone. Take everything with a grain of salt,  even Reddit.  You want to see the swarm,  say something negative about Israel or the F-35 and watch what happens.

       Can someone please explain how this works? How can a mod restrict a post on another sub? Exactly how does this work? I have noticed in the heat of a debate on some subs - just when I was ready to put the dagger in on 4 or 5 self-appointed police - I get the "please wait" message. Usually followed by a ban.

       If yall are the future of the conspiracy movement, well, it's fucked.  Because this is the most weak sauce bubble gum bullshit I've seen in a really long time.

       This is bullshit hand waving.  What's it even suppose to mean?  NEW ACCOUNTS STARTED POPPING OUT OF NOWHERE?  You're trying to give this the air of mystery.  It's been one of the hottest sites on the net for a long long time now.
      </p>
      <p>
       New accounts have always showed up en mass since the digg migration.  It's a social media site, that's exactly what happens.  It's not some secret exclusive invite only site with a special hidden url.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people create accounts
       <em>
        just to share that one story, or ask one question
       </em>
       .  Just because it's softball or feel good doesn't make it fake.  I've made many comments people considered HailCorporate but it was really just that I
       <em>
        really really
       </em>
       liked that service, the company had been really good to me or something (massive credits to a bill, great customer service, etc).

       You listed like one thing, and it wasn't even that drastic.  One subr decided to become a lot more organized.

       All in all this is a boring ass conspiracy.  Over zealous asshole mods have been a thing since IRC.  That's basically what you're describing here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy should be embarrassed to have this as a stickied top post.

       If anything destroyed reddit it's the money (potential).  All good things are ruined by money.

       tl;dr - OP is 17 and everything is really really exciting.

       prediction : I'll be called out as part of the conspiracy, a liar, and so on.  /Conspiracy can't stand when people disagree.

       edit : /reddit was taken away because it was a catch all and there was a better place to discuss whatever the topic was.

       I saw this post on front page, it was about 1h old. Stated reading it, got distracted, got back to reading the post whereby I accidentally quit this post and reloaded front page. Tried to find my way back to This post but it was a goner. Felt like the whole front page exploded with exceptionally interesting content in just 30 minutes from first reading your submission.
Was that all a fluke or just a way for some one to flush you out from front page I wonder?

       Yea, and this is what you said: "We don't allow shill accusations from anyone. We can't tell who is a shill and who isn't, and people are entitled to express their opinions without being impugned in that way. Upvotes are not a reflection of the validity of a claim. We have very little tolerance for new users who break the rules of the subreddit."
      </p>
      <p>
       I read the rules, I didn't break any by saying "itt: paid russian commenters". Maybe had I said "you are a paid russian shill" to a specific person, you could maybe stretch that into breaking the "personal attack" rule, but since my comment wasn't directed to any individual, that can't be considered a violation of the rules
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not see how fucked up it is that you cannot even mention the presence of shill accounts? Especially since everyone knows they exist in huge numbers?

       Good, read and so true. 
So many of these subs are ran by the shills. Just look at the names. For example
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/about/moderators">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/steam
       </a>
       by several of the real
       <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/discussions/moderators">
        Steam Community Mods
       </a>
       with their own agenda of towing the company line, and quickly curtailing discontent, of the service and the products, with stupid rules and bans just as they do in their own real
       <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/discussions/">
        Discussions
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine some other corporate shills run other Reddit subs, but are not as so blatant to use their real names / alias. 
This is where its hard at places like Reddit or anywhere on the web to decipher who is who and real motive.

       While not required, you are requested to use the NP domain of reddit when crossposting. This helps to protect both your account, and the accounts of other users, from administrative shadowbans. The NP domain can be accessed by prefacing your reddit link with np.reddit.com.

       You raise some good points, but I will have to disagree with you on most of it. You've only been a user for 7 days, not sure where you got your information from but a lot of it is flat out wrong.

      <ol>
       <li>
        <a href="/r/reddit.com">
         /r/reddit.com
        </a>
        was a very difficult subreddit. Getting to the front was pure random and the topics of discussion were everywhere. There are still plenty of places to hold meta discussions about reddit without having to worry about signal-to-noise.
       </li>
       <li>
        The admins moderated almost nothing to
        <a href="/r/reddit.com">
         /r/reddit.com
        </a>
        , the big moderators
        <em>
         always
        </em>
        had that responsibility. And the big topics were about how Ron Paul was being ignored in the media, which is why
        <a href="/r/circlejerk">
         /r/circlejerk
        </a>
        made fun of it.
       </li>
       <li>
        The subreddits were always controlled by a small handful of moderators, some of which got jobs working for reddit. And
        <a href="/r/IAMA">
         /r/IAMA
        </a>
        simply changed. It's a thing that happens to communities when they grow.
        <a href="/r/casualiama">
         /r/casualiama
        </a>
        is
        <a href="/r/IAMA">
         /r/IAMA
        </a>
        circa 2010.
       </li>
       <li>
        Shills exist, but the extent that people call out others for being shills is utterly ridiculous. Remember, the vast majority of people on reddit are regular users. Shills have to post things that are already popular with redditors to get any traction. And if they are posting something objectional, that doesn't mean that they're a shill. They may simply have a difference of opinion. There's a reason this subreddit banned usage of the word, see rule 10. OP of this post,
        <a href="/u/shark_shank">
         /u/shark_shank
        </a>
        , is only a 7 day old account, that's enough for people to call him a shill.
       </li>
       <li>
        I see nothing wrong with banning sensationalizing and opinions. There are other subreddits for that.
        <a href="/r/worldnews">
         /r/worldnews
        </a>
        used to be a cesspool, filled with memes and titles that don't even match the content. I remember an experiment where a headline titled "NSA Listening Devices in Aborigine Huts: Snowden Leaks Reveal" on an unrelated article was the top news story.
       </li>
       <li>
        The scores were
        <em>
         always
        </em>
        fuzzed. The admins simply got sick of everyone asking why all stories had 66% upvotes so they did away with the old system.
       </li>
       <li>
        A wide variety of view expressed in a wide variety of subreddits. Front page is still the same.
       </li>
       <li>
        Nothing new. This has been a part of reddit for at least 5 years.
       </li>
       <li>
        subreddits only get the boot when the build a reputation for vote manipulation by subtly hinting to users to vote a certain way on a different subreddit.
       </li>
       <li>
        A guy made a tool, turns out they guy was a tool. Nothing to do with reddit itself.
       </li>
       <li>
        Again, a year ago you couldn't post a dissenting opinion in
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        or
        <a href="/r/politics">
         /r/politics
        </a>
        without being called a shill. The mods had to stop that because it meant that there was no discussion.
       </li>
       <li>
        "The IQ of a mob is the IQ of its dumbest member halved." -Terry Pratchett. You call it "collective investigation" I call it "mobbing".
       </li>
       <li>
        No evidence, just accusations. Reddit deals with tons of spam each day, only no one except the mods ever see it.
       </li>
      </ol>

        It wasn't always like this. A few years ago, there were just as many disagreements and differences of opinion on reddit, but they were REAL. And the site was still a democracy. People voted and things swung from side to side, everybody learned in the end.

       How does that take power from users? Things still get upvoted and downvoted based on popularity, the ranks are still the same. Literally the only thing that's changed is the number next to the karma on the top of the comments page, which 99% of reddit ignores anyway.

       Only a very slight difference. Certainly unnoticeable on a site used by millions. First off, if something doesn't get a 75% or greater upvote ratio, it will be ignored. So an example such as 45/-47 will probably never happen as things disappear off of the front page after a few downvotes and few upvotes. Second, most users don't use Reddit Enhancement Suite so they wouldn't even see the downvotes (which again, are inaccurate) unless they are already reading the comment page and specifically looking for it. A very small percentage of users are voting based on number of ups and downs.

       Ok fine, the old system was a little better for the user. Still not sure why that's such a big deal. Like I said, the vast majority of users voting on comments didn't even see the downvotes because they didn't have RES or any of the Greasemonkey plugins. Even then, the majority of controversial stuff was outright ignored due to being near the bottom of the page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heck I don't think I recall ever seeing a single comment that had less than 10 karma but more than 10 downvotes so even if something did hit 45/-47 it's incredibly rare.

       Also, a good amount of your feedback is just flat-out wrong. I could sit here and make another list that responds to your incorrect corrections, but I have better things to do with my time today.

       One final tip: making a new account is very easy, you should try it sometime. It allows you to shake the chains of the point system. So the number of days by my account name has very little to do with how long I have been here. But that should have been obvious by my correct analysis of changes made many years ago on this website.

       I've seen your points posted many times before. You didn't think much of them either, as they are all pretty much copied and pasted from various threads that hit the front page here like every week. I've never actually had a proper discussion over them as every time I post a rebuttal, someone like you comes in and tells everyone to ignore it.

       These are all my own points, I didn't pull them from older threads. I have yet to have a proper discussion about them. Seems people would rather just call me a "shill". That's the right way to end an argument, yeah?

       A point to point bullet list of counterpoints isnt the best way imo to have a discussion. Especially when it doesn't seem like you are willing to say " on this number you seem to be on to something".
      </p>
      <p>
       For me the hiding of the votes (on comments) is when I knew the system that was reddit was being changed behind the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       Individual subs should have the power to choose the new or the older system. That site wide implementation made reddit a much worse place. From my standpoint

       Just my two cents on you two guys exchange.

       I almost agree with you, but obviously SOMEONE is reading this on Reddit still, so it's not quite done.  The final nail in the coffin will be when no one reads it at all, because they've moved on to voat.co.  It's is still in alpha, but shows it is better managed than Reddit so far.

       I'll give you a brilliant example of how much sellouts this site is. For those not informed about GamerGate and what happened at 4chan here is the short version. Gamers uncovered a lot of corruption ultimately leading towards the discovery of a mailing list. Jewt (Formerly moot) head of 4chan sells out and bans any discussion of this. This results in 2 of main boards there leaving. Several other boards have left as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as his site should lose all views
       <a href="/r/4chan">
        /r/4chan
       </a>
       becomes a main subreddit. Yep to save Jewt's site, reddit made 4chan's subreddit a default. Doesn't seem to be working though, Jewt up and quit his site leaving only his shill moderators in charge.

       </p>
       <p>
        When reddit changed the voting system and people were on their last nerve with this site, a place called Whoaverse (now
        <a href="https://voat.co/">
         https://voat.co/
        </a>
        ) became popular overnight. It is basically a reddit clone and at the time was run by one guy. He was happy about the surge but mentioned it was going to be hard to keep up with, but was committed to making it happen. Guess what happened next?
       </p>
       <p>
        Did you guess: “Thousands of targeted spam attacks to overload and destroy the website”? Then congrats, you now understand how far these fucks are willing to go to keep the herd in their pen. Hijacking a cool brand and using it’s facade to conduct propaganda games is extremely profitable, just ask VICE. And once you have the customer, it costs much less to keep them than to acquire new ones. So we are seeing online guerrilla tactics designed to destroy the competition by any means.

       As many people have pointed out that it takes a lot of money to run such popular servers.  I wonder if there's a way to calculate near actual costs each user creates by using such site.  I'm not suggesting that users be required to pay but it could bring in more donations if everyone saw how much it costs to make a post, or click on a link.

       I understand the lamenting of something that was better (or had elements that at the very least weren't horrible), but I have a genuine question: why not go elsewhere/start your own site? I feel like this is so obvious that it's probably been asked before and even asking it probably brands me a shill. But I genuinely want to know, if Reddit is so broken, why stay?

       said it before - people make a one hell of an effort to complain about reddit. Make a new website or forum away from this place, off this site. And then put your energy in to that. I'm down to help. But I get the feeling that too many just want to complain rather than do anything about the problem. Prove me wrong reddit users. Again, I'm willing to help anyone who wants to make a new place where we can converse freely. @JakeArsenal1 on Twitter

       step 2 is when the jews took over control. Dont believe me? look at who owns this site.

      <p>
       They sent in jidf and then when they realized they couldnt derail the anti israel libertarianism on reddit they moved in to take it over officially. Aaron was the main opposition. The got their buddies to go after him with everything AND the kitchen sink. "SUicided" him so to speak...

       I won't sit here and disagree with the majority of these points because several are spot on and backed by hundreds of separate posts across the site with substantial evidence, and as a whole, I agree with the idea that there has been a secretive and conspired attempt to limit content posted on this site.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, a week-old account doesn't exactly establish the credibility of a long-time user who has single-handedly witnessed these changes. Moreover, within the first few points you mention a "conspiracy" to block and defame Ron Paul on
       <a href="/r/circlejerk">
        /r/circlejerk
       </a>
       . Let me make this clear for the umpteenth time: Ron Paul's downfall on this site was a direct result of his batshit insane beliefs, lack of bipartisan support, and extreme supporters, not some inside job to limit his exposure. In that one point alone you've lost most of your credibility to me.

       Whether votes matter or not is not the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is that a comment with a score or 45/-47 will make a person pause before reacting.
      </p>
      <p>
       A comment with just -47 will invite a person to knee-jerk downvote. See: manufactured consensus.

       Interestingly, that and the ensuring drama actually led to that sub being removed from the defaults by the admins. That filtering was removed immediately and the mods involved were removed. So it's like the opposite of what you claim.

       I've been on Reddit since 10 years, since before it had subreddits or even comments, and I have seen quite a few things come and go. Virtually none of the things you mentioned are some sort of conspiracy and mostly result from a few subs having a few bad mods.

       Even if technology is no longer compromised, the reality is that is was. That shows a conscious effort of multiple people to manipulate a large subreddit and that is the definition of conspiracy theory.

       It wasn't compromised, there were simply too few mods to deal with a 5 million sub with constant brigading by bitcoin, Tesla enthusiasts and they set up the auto bot in order to lessen their burden without needing to manually go through each article. It was a genuine but misguided attempt to keep the front page from being 100% bitcoin, Tesla and Snowden. They ended up paying the price for it.

       I have noticed a big difference, but it's more easily explained by big changes in the nature and numbers of the userbase rather than some mod or admin conspiracy. Take a sub with 10k subscribers, add a few million overnight, how could there be not a huge difference even if the mods are the same?

       The difference between believing this all happened naturally and believing that a hidden hand orchestrated it comes down to your particular worldview.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that money and power corrupt and that reddit represented both of those things and that people noticed.
      </p>
      <p>
       You believe that it happened organically as part of human nature and a number of other theories that I also believe in and understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe that many of those theories would act as the perfect cover for anyone who did want to come in a manipulate the site on a large-scale level. People are always going to explain things away rationally, it is human nature. If people came in to manipulate the site, they would also understand this.

       How does that take power from users? Things still get upvoted and downvoted based on popularity, the ranks are still the same. Literally the only thing that's changed is the number next to the karma on the top of the comments page, which 99% of reddit ignores anyway.

       Yeah, I mean, obviously we still participate. I just don't get surprised or hurt when something is obviously censored or brigaded - its business as usual TBH. It sucks, but the sooner we accept that McReddit is not ours, is not able to be reverted back to the 'golden age,' and that there exists a large amount of 'official interference,' the better off we can be as the posts here will (hopefully) remain intact.

It's a direct threat to freedom of speech, association, and our ability to participate in a democratic society in a meaningful way through exchanges of ideas online as well as face to face (haha as though we ever had a democratic society to participate meaningfully in!

       Looking at their history/ comments they have 3k comment karma but you can't see any comments that would account for it.
edit: not saying they have fake upvotes just that its odd that deleted comments even count.

       We're all part of the information warfare machine dude. And it's primarily funded throught private sources. Soon as you guys start railing off about the government(whose explicit purpose is to enable the rich people and the companies within the state) being the problem, you're raging against the wrong machine.

       True fact; remember the propaganda post yesterday? iSIS meat grinder. In that article it said that the U.S. Runs propaganda campaigns every day in the Middle East. Like putting out new pamphlets. Said that it speaks to the "softer side" of the conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the article says it has used 1 billion dollars on paper pamphlet propaganda.
I guess my point is...dis shit cray

       Overall I am coming out better than firefox. I tried firefox light, which was the fastest browser I've ever used, but it had some issues like crashing every time you load flash or a webm or a gifv or look at it the wrong way....
