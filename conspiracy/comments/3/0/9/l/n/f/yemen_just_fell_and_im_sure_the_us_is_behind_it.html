       Copy and pasted from a post I made where someone asked me to explain the situation to them. Incidentally it's the Iranians who are behind this.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       The Shi'ite Houthi militia is not a CIA creation. This is the Iranians making a big (and successful) geopolitical play which is why it's not receiving much attention in Western news.
      </p>
      <p>
       This stuff is occurring in an increasingly complicated context, so this post might get lengthy -- ready? If you're not up on your middle eastern geography, you might want to open a tab with a map.
      </p>
      <p>
       To start you have to know that Yemen is very important in geopolitical terms. Whoever controls Yemen also controls the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bab-el-Mandeb">
        Bab-el-Mandeb strait
       </a>
       , which sits between the flow of trade from the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean. About 4% of the oil sold on the world market
       <a href="http://www.eia.gov/countries/regions-topics.cfm?fips=wotc&amp;amp;trk=p3">
        travels through this chokepoint
       </a>
       . I'm sure you've heard of the Suez Canal and it's strategic importance; most of the oil that goes through the Suez also has to travel through the Bab-el-Mandeb, and vice versa. For comparison, about 16% of the world's oil travels through the Strait of Hormuz, which is arguably the world's most strategically important strait.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Bab-el-Mandeb is shutdown then all of that oil has to be shipped all the way around South Africa, like the East India Company had to before the Suez was constructed, basically quadrupling transport time and costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Americans will tell you that Yemen is important for them because of the War on Terror, which is true. The US has a large and hush-hush special forces base directly north of Somalia, in Djibouti. The CIA has a base inside Mogadishu. The whole region is littered with intelligence assets and green berets doing some pretty dirty shit. This is where the CIA recruits terrorists for special missions in in the Middle East and elsewhere -- like the Charlie Hebdo attacks in France.
      </p>
      <p>
       But frankly I suspect that this is part of a much larger operation to gain control of the strait and the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_of_Africa">
        Horn of Africa
       </a>
       . Here is a
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_of_Africa#mediaviewer/File:Red_Sea2.png">
        map
       </a>
       for reference. So you can imagine that the Pentagon is very upset about this news of a Shia rebellion backed by Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yemen is also religiously divided. It's about a
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Yemen#mediaviewer/File:Yemen_ethno_2002.jpg">
        40/60 split
       </a>
       between the Shia and Sunni Muslims, and they don't like each other at all. So there are basically three groups fighting it out right now: the government (Sunni), al Qaida (Sunni), and the Houthi militia (Shia).
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I'm aware al Qaida does not engage the government extensively, they mostly fight the Shia militias. The United States and Saudi Arabia are backing both the government and al Qaida with weapons, money and training to act as a bulwark against the Shia insurgency. Conversely the Iranians are backing the Houthi militia, as I mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I said this is a big geopolitical play is because it looks like the Iranians are trying to break US control over the strait. Certainly the Saudis -- who are the traditional enemies of Iran -- are very unhappy about this. The last thing the US and Saudi Arabia want is Iran gaining leverage in the war over oil. So this was a bold move for the Iranians. I'm almost certain that this is being coordinated with Russia as a retaliatory move against what the Saudis and Americans are doing in Syria.

       We can paint this as

       Houthis just like the

       in order to ramp up military action.

       Yemen was a big buddy for us regarding drone strikes, so this probably isn't the best for the US short-term, but we've got a majestic propaganda arm to gear the Americans up for intervention (it is the base for *AQAP, after all...).

       I know we (The US) had carte blanche to launch drone strikes (anywhere in Yemen), from the guy who just hightailed it out of the country on a boat.  Not sure how much that plays into the recent events, but I would have to believe it factors in.

       In December 2013 I sat watching a local news channel in the middle east with an Arab friend who translated for me that Yemen was in civil war &amp; the country had split. He lived very nearby and was friendly to the rebels, not the government. He said the rebels were a minority religious group being persecuted by the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this ever hit western media (I watched for it) and nothing came of all of this at all until recently. No idea why. I would really like to ask my friend what the real story is (according to what he's heard locally) but all communications in/out of that area are recorded &amp; monitored, so he would not be able to to respond honestly. I will have to wait until I see him in person.

       You can't give the U.S. government that much credit. They actually fail at attempting to control which rebel group takes power a lot more than they succeed. The middle east is a very complicated region and the U.S. is only one player in the area.
