       I know this may be against the rules of this sub and people may not want to share their personal political interests but I would like to know who you would vote for in the upcoming presidential election? If you have an opinion explain why or why not you would vote for that politician.

       It isn't a total impossibility to use the system against them... but it's extremely unlikely being so divided :(

       One intent, one purpose that we could all back is the only hope in repairing capitalism. Then again, would we want to?

       Nothing is impossible, but improvable isn't as high a bar.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, if we are going to flush the old system, there is no "ism" that's gonna "fix" the problems, we gotta come at this thing at an entirely new angle. I don't know 100% what that angle is, but it does intail caring less about the small things and being more a humanity and not a human race.
      </p>
      <p>
       competition breeds innovation, so i'm not saying we become docile, but there are better ways compete, and humanity has proven that with things like ligitiment sports and intellect competitions, without anyone having to suffer ptsd from the conquenicies of losing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I'm taking the soft pitch, here. But with all the us vs. them and the election cycles picking up and currently ww3 peeking over the minute hand on the doomsday clock, it seems that maybe we need to work on how we handle ppl that disagree with us, while finding a fair and just system to insure that not the popular madness reigns, but the true moral north is held while proceeding forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it sounds hippy crazy, but the longer we accept the current system, for all it's flaws as well as promise, the harder transition will be to make.

       It's been amazing watching the establishment try to test one presidential candidate after another with the reddit crowd over the past few months. The American people are starting to wake up and don't trust any of them anymore; none of their empty pandering has been very popular this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not buying any of their false hope now, so how are they going to convince us to keep watching their circus?

       Wow I never made that connection... Since all presidents(except for one) have been blood relatives of one king then if one candidate is a distant relative and the other isn't we should be able to say the odds are overwhelming in favor of the relative winning =).   We know jeb is related... Is Hillary or is it just Bill?

       Any candidate who supports the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       A reduction in military spending (hardware, not staffing) and funnel that money toward infrastructure and public education improvement. I think we can do with a couple less F-35s and thanks every year, which cost
       <em>
        billions of dollars
       </em>
       , and still maintain am elite military. And by infrastructure, I mean improving roads, bridges, and giving communities high-speed Internet that other countries enjoy without having to deal with Comcast/etc who have de facto monopolies I'm municipalities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, think of how much the average teacher makes in this country (although it's not all about salaries) - and how much even a 5% reallocation can go. It would be fantastically dramatic, and you would garner the support of most who value quality education, as well as teachers in general, who used to be a very united voting block.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would vote for anyone who pledged to not vote for any AUMF with legal loopholes such as the current ISIL AUMF proposed, with no geographical limits. Violence begets violence, and anyone who has in the past two years voted for sending arms to Ukraine (for an example) has to understand that these types of actions will not de-escalate conflict, but will surely increase the rate of other people dying, of which roughly 25% of my earned income
       <em>
        every day
       </em>
       goes to support.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would vote for anyone willing to state that the intelligence apparatus in this country is out of control, and has ideas on how to reign in the NSA and all of surveillance we have been hearing about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would vote for anyone willing to abolish the program which allows local police departments to purchase used military equipment and significant discounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would vote for anyone who vows not vote for a budget (or any other significant legislation) without an amendment to drastically revamp the campaign financing laws in this country (the old adage of getting money out of politics).
      </p>
      <p>
       I would vote for anyone willing to work to overhaul the health care payment system in this country and bring it into the single-payer world with many other first-wirld nations instead of the gifts to the pharmaceutical industry (Medicare Part D, thanks GWB) and the insurance industry (thanks, Obama).
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried as best I could to hit points that aren't wedge issues used to divide and distract, but issues that affect a huge swath of demographics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing I haven't touched is the banking and student loan problem, of which I have propositions for but would double the length of this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR - I'm not voting for anyone I'm the current establishment. Because the system currently benefits them, and they won't change (history has shown this). So I'm waiting for my age demo (18-34 and some older folks who can see through propaganda and bullshit) to wake the fuck up and challenge some incumbents in primaries, regardless of the D or R near their name. Or maybe a legitimate third party dedicated to reducing the size and power of the federal government, and the only way to do that is to elect some People to do it, because they obviously won't do it themselves.

       I wouldn't vote for a single Democrat. My ideal is a strict constitutionalist libertarian, however those are hard to come by because of how the two parties and elections work. However, because the ideal isn't always possible, I would vote for Cruz, Rubio, or Paul. Paul being my first choice, then Cruz, then Rubio. Otherwise I may just not vote for the President on principle, or just do a write-in.

       Still waiting on the dark horse that's gonna win it all, so until then, i'm placing my bet on Paul. He's lil mix of everything politcal wise and just moderate enough to bring in both sides. His anti-war style will be a breath of fresh air to war worn dems and all the while no R is silly enough to fall for that old, "We're not in the buisness of empire building" line, and will vote for him anyways, cause there's an R next to his name. Republician party is entirely too polorized, and this upcoming election won't help. They'll think of it as confirmation that ppl want the GoP when really if Paul makes it, it's because ppl are now desperate for anyone that might actually give a fuck about the middle class in an unbias mannor.

       I have almost no doubt there's pretty much one of three paths if Paul is
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       1: He suddenly turns into a liar and ruins his reputation of integrity, maintaining the offices puppet agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       2: He attempts all the things he's said he'd do but shot down, unanimously, by legislative and judicial branches in all the things that matter the most.
      </p>
      <p>
       3: He dies shortly after (or even before, if it looks like he stands a chance). Who knows if he was killed or not, hell, it may even be old age. We'd never know for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       One seriously unfortunate consideration is that most the older population was hypnotized into believing Paul was "unelectable" during the 2008 and 2012 campaigns. For what reason? Well, he was unelectable! Wait, why again? "HE'S UNELECTABLE, DAMNIT!"
      </p>
      <p>
       *Edit: That being said, not having looked into 2016 candidates (other than brushing off the familial dynasties of Clinton and Bush) I'd vote for Ron.

       We actually have a chance of at least throwing a wrench in the spokes if we vote in the primaries.

       Funny, isn't it? We constantly hear everyone should vote but it's been explicitly confined to the final election. If they really wanted us to make an impact, they'd be pressing that we
       <em>
        at least
       </em>
       vote in the primaries.

       Voting isn't rigged. Candidates are owned. That's how they maintain control while granting the illusion of freedom of choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       And by that token, if everyone wrote-in "Elizabeth Warren" (or "Jessee Ventura" or "Bob Dylan" or whatever), that's who the President would be. But they won't, because they're too conditioned to select Choice A or Choice B, when the only difference is the rhetoric A and B spew about abortion.

       I would, too. But they won't run. They're not owned so they know they can't win the Presidency. Their best bet to actually do some good is to stay in Congress and keep making noise.
