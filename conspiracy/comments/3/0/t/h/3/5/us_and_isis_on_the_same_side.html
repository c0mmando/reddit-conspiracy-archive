Not even whole garlic cloves can stay the desert-dwelling men in black ski-masks and gloves away from their mission of attacking and destabilizing Israel’s neighbors (coincidentally, of course).

No weapons had been handed over. ‘We have had some new boots and jackets,’ he said with a snort. ‘That’s all.’"

        The US had supposedly been training 'moderate' rebels in Jordan, why is it that the main opposition leader in the FSA is claiming otherwise? And let's not ask the Northern commander of the FSA because we already know he wants a government based on Islamic Law
       </a>

      <p>
       Additionally, a western diplomat makes the startling revelation that the vast majority of Syrian rebels are Islamist thugs:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The official was his government’s main conduit to the Syrian rebels. I asked him what percentage of the rebels western countries could support: what percentage were not jihadis, not committing human rights abuses, looting or kidnapping — and were militarily effective?"
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9041901/assad-now-has-the-enemy-he-wants/">
        "There was a silence. Finally, he said: ‘Thirty per cent.’ It was a devastating admission. Then he paused and said he had been considering only the first three criteria. Adding in military effectiveness, you would have to say the West could support only 10 per cent."

       Hassan Aboud of Soquor al-Sham and Abu Ayman of Ahrar al-Sham, another Islamist group, said that whoever was vetting which groups receive the weapons was doing an inadequate job.

       As far as the suicide bombing, it was likely someone working on behalf of one of the many US/Saudi/Qatari backed groups. Anyone who has been paying any attention, knows history, and cares about the truth said this was the case as soon as the attack took place. Unfortunately, those voices are marginalized by the pro-Saudi, pro-Murica ciclejerk.
      </p>
      <p>
       The following is a brief overview of the brutal oppression that lead to the Yemeni uprising.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Houthi's in the video chanting down with America and Israel have been the target of politically motivated drone strikes for a decade.
      </p>
      <p>
       The previous Yemeni government was incredibly corrupt and was using US drone strikes to kill the tribal socialist political opposition. The attacks radicalized them, (as they would any sane person) and they reacted by overthrowing the government and hating the US, as they are entirely justified to.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Amid an absence of transparency, there is wide speculation in Yemen that drones — and the intelligence from Yemen that at least partly informs targets selected by the CIA or Pentagon — are used as tools of politics and convenience."

       As for how the drone strikes are being used politically in Yemen

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Not long ago, the south of Yemen was an independent country run by a democratic socialist government. The north and south unified in 1990, but it was not a popular decision. In 1994 civil war broke out and former leaders of South Yemen attempted to secede. Since then there has been ongoing conflict and perhaps another full-scale war on the horizon.
       </p>
       <p>
        The south of Yemen is very resistant to a central authority. History has shown that tribes eventually rise up when they lose their autonomy. The Yemeni government in Sana'a is extremely unpopular in the south. They're seen as overreaching and authoritarian, and people worry they are being stripped of cash for their local resources.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is where AQAP has its stronghold. They've taken advantage of the instability and claim to fight for the south's independence, though leaders of the popular resistance movement don't accept AQAP as allies. Still, extremists are able to meaningfully prey on the fears of the rural population.
       </p>
       <p>
        But these drone strikes and military support for the central government Sana'a give more ammunition for their propaganda and allows them to access a greater portion of the pool of disgruntled citizens.
       </p>
       <p>
        On top of this,
        <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/22/foreign-wars-america-fighting-yemen">
         the UN and Human Right Watch has evidence that the US has hit members of the popular southern resistance, not connected with AQAP
        </a>
        . And there aren't enough details to know whether or not non-AQAP resistance were targeted in this most recent operation.
       </p>

        <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/operation-scorched-earth-a-us-hand-in-yemen-s-civil-war-a-732734.html">
         leaked cable
        </a>
        from Washington does suggest that US operations go beyond AQAP:
       </p>
       <p>
        "The net effect ... of both the American and Yemeni 'iron fist' unleashed at the same time in Yemen will be a clear message to the southern movement or any other party interested in generating political unrest in the country that a similar fate awaits them."
       </p>
       <p>

        <a href="https://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/developing-policy-options-for-the-aqap-threat-in-yemen">
         Combating Terrorism Center
        </a>
        at West Point has a study that warns of blowback resulting from the current US policy in Yemen. The article supports much of what I said above and provides further analysis for anyone interested.
       </p>
       <p>
        Edit: Another reason it's questionable to back the horse of the Sana'a government is that it's embroiled in an ongoing Shia rebellion in the north. Even with the current level of US support, Yemen can only fight two (or three if you include AQAP independently) wars for so long. A better strategy may be to seek ways to appease the south, either by offering greater autonomy or full independence. This way resources can be concentrated against AQAP and the Shia rebels, who really don't stand a chance of independence as long as the Saudis remain in play. Yemen is an important geopolitical region, and the US does not benefit from enduring instability.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Drone strikes were quite possibly the stupidest policy imaginable if they were intended to create stability in the region as has been proven and warned about years before the overthrow of the Yemeni government.

      <p>
       Nabeel Khoury, deputy chief of mission in Yemen from 2004 to 2007, says that for every al-Qaeda operative killed by a U.S. drone, another 40 to 60 new enemies are created as a result of this strategy.

       Anyone watching the videos out of Yemen should see that something's up. Mosque with Yemenis chanting "death to America, death to Israel" - boom, "ISIS" attacks. Thousands upon thousands of protestors in the streets chanting "death to America, death to Israel" - boom, Saudi air strikes in the name of "Sunni" Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a sectarian war. Don't let them fool you. They fucked up with this last aggression because they didn't even bother to properly hash out a narrative in the media. They've demonized Israel for weeks due to Netanyahu brushing aside Obama and human rights violations. They've demonized Saudi Arabia for weeks due to the "28 pages" and ISIS support and comparisons. Now the U.S. joins these two countries in a war against a third?

       ISIS = CIA
      </p>
      <p>
       CIA = US?  NEVER.
      </p>
      <p>
       What have they ever done besides work as the secret service for the military industrial complex and the FED.  And the international private group of bankers interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       If ISIS has anything to do that benifits the US, its because it benifits the MIC and FED more.  Its just a side effect the CIA can act like they were actually doing the right thing for once.

       Welcome to the conversation. You see how profits can be gained from endless warfare against distant nations, against ideas such as terrorism, or substances like drugs, and in these wars, the lines between who is the enemy and who are good people are blurred. You watch as the congress ( the puppets that direct where our tax dollars go) shoves more tanks down the armys throats. Watch as they pitch toxic ideology to the masses to keep us fighting over the red team or the blue team leading us to the grave. I Digress, there is much to despair about, but yes. We play the people around the world, sometimes they are our enemy, sometimes they are a friend, sometimes they are behind the scenes. Think professional wrestling, just less muscle brained monologues.

       Well, we're in a semi-cold war (probably soon to be a hot war) with Russia over Crimea, but are collaborating extensively with them in our space program.  We are not the brightest bulb in the lighting store, are we?  We have a bad habit of arming and buying "friends" that we find ourselves later compelled to blow up.

       Whelp I hope not to get downvoted but lol..... How can the u.s. be blamed for the gulft states supplying arms and munitions and money to Isis? These people had no idea who they were funding. I read all of the articles in this sub I'm still not convinced America is supporting wahhabi terrorism. We're training 5,000 or 3,000 rebels with Turkey that will most likely flop and sell they're guns. Let's face it the people we are supporting to fight Isis... Usually quit when Isis rollls through or sells their weapons to them. Y'all act like it's impossible for Muslims to pretend to hate one another for treats to share with one another. We have no allies in the middle east. Saudi Arabia is looking out for sunnies and that's that. Iran shias. This is a proxy war all the way. I really do not believe the United states of America is supplying military support to Isis or intelligence. I do believe we are infiltrating if we haven't already. This is what happens when your pull out troops prematurely in Iraq. The majority of the hardcore of Isis is former baathists from Saddam. So all of you believe we're supporting Isis to keep Iran in check? Seriously that sounds rediculously stupid. The way I see it is gulf states supplied and nurtured in the beginning of the Syrian civil war to topple Assad. When they saw Isis invade Iraq they knew they Ducked up. You see all the gulf states coming together to create a United Arab army to fight the houthnies but guess what they didn't do shit when Isis invaded Iraq. Isis = proxies of the gulf states not Americas creation. We spent too much money too much blood too many sacrifices just to waste it by attempting to supply the new "mujahdeen" comments appreciated. Sorry I'm on mobile.
