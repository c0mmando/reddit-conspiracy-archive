       There is lots of stuff out there that is purposely insane in order that- when real information does come out- the important and tangible evidence can be easily piled in with the nonsense. Thank you. (Thanks for approving this post, I appreciate the work of those behind this page and all who contribute to it.)

       EDIT: Tried to give r/conspiracy a chance to stop being a bunch of lunatics who make shit up that allows paedophilia and death to continue under a fog of bullshit stories..... Have now been accused of paedophilia and am basically being pitchforked away because the leaked documents reveal too much about the nature of the bollocks these people have commited to so deeply. OOH: UPDATE! The person who started this slanderous attack
       <a href="/u/damndirtylies">
        /u/damndirtylies
       </a>
       (aimed at the material of Edward Snowden....) is mod of an insane sub likely set up by the security services (as most of the websites of this nature are)
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/OccultConspiracy/">
        http://www.reddit.com/r/OccultConspiracy/
       </a>
       that basically exists to detract and distract from the serious problems happening in the world. Those who have a weak mind can simply enter this subreddit and talk about hand symbols and the likes while the world is destroyed by well known multinationals. So yeah... I know now why he doesnt want tangible evidence based claims flying around his "gaff".... What a shill. He can falsely call me a pedophile sympathiser all he wants, and Im sure his JIDF friends are gna be here to upvote/ downvote for him. But it doesnt take from reality.

       First glance, this article was written Feb. 2014 and stands to remind us all to be vigilant, no matter what we're reading, no matter who authors a
       <em>
        piece
       </em>
       . So to this articles author, I first question his motives, his true intentions, as it pertains to any Files/Documents that Snowden fled with.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to
       <em>
        the validity and reputation of this sub
       </em>
       ...
       <em>
        the insane piled in with the nonsense
       </em>
       ... I personally do not recognize your user name and would sincerely ask where I might recall your positive contributions over the past two plus years?
      </p>
      <p>
       To the pederast events you seem to discount and lump in as
       <em>
        insane and nonsense

       postings; I have my own family story that involves Hollywood. Of course, you're welcome to dismiss me as a nut job.

       For a mental health nurse you sure do throw around the term "insane" and "loon" like an uneducated idiot. Almost as if you don't have a background in mental health at all, and are in actuality just a pedophole sympathizer who is here to muddy the discourse.

       Another from this guy: "You mentioned that there are such things as government flooders who saturate the truth with this kinda story of satanic ritual (or at least diluted the truth about it) in order to distract from the tangible problems that actually exists.... I cant handle that yopuve done more research than me, so I'm going to publicly call you a paedophile. Id actually try to counter your heavily evidenced claims, but I dont work on evidence because Im either a child raper of some sort of agent myself looking to continue the spread of this bullshit and help the real bad guys get away with it."....

       For a campaigner against child abuse you aure do throw the term paedophile around loosely, even using it to silence someone who is telling a truth that you dont want others to hear- And that leave only two motivations: Youre working for the flooders and youre helping spread this bullshit and therefore helping to rape and murder victims (which makes sense when we look at what subs you moderate.... ;) ) . Or you're a confused idiot who lacks the capability to understand basic reality so needs to distract yourself with fairy tale stories and accusing people who have done much more than you of being a paedophile to satisfy your jealousy.

       I'm aware that I'm likely not dealing with people who suffer form mental health problems here. Apart from that I would say you are likely suffering from something considering your continued loose use of the term paedophile sympathizer after I have repeated my stance over and over and even verified that I am not entriely discrediting all ritual type incidents.... and you do this while claiming to want to help victims...

       And also this is Reddit, not my place of work.

      <p>
       Finally, you have speculated, make threats, assumptions and attempts at bullying someone for no other reason than your delusion overtaking any logical reasoned response that doesnt fit in with what you believe you know. I'd argue that could potentially point towards an underlying mental health problem.

       You should consider quitting your day job and seeing if NAMBLA will take you on full time. And what are you talking about slander? I'm just trying to identify your ideological beliefs. And perhaps you forget that this is an internet forum, you don't have an identity to slander. Unless you'd like to provide it to me in which case I would gladly contact whatever institution you work for to let them know how you speak about the "insane" and other "lunatics" during your free time. After all we live in an age where employers ask for your Facebook password; there are standards to be upheld in certain professions, yours especially.

       Oh really? Because this subreddit looks like a GCHQ flooders notepad from where I'm sitting.
      </p>
      <p>
       One example that is easily identifyable for most is anything to do with child abuse and how- in reality- it is being used by big business interests (with the help of the security services of many nations) to control any influential figures through a twisted, but fairly straight forward, paedophilic blackmail system.... A system that many people are missing because of the diluted stories and fake websites that obscure this obvious and well documented truth and talk of SATAN, checkered flooring and hand symbols instead!

       Just trying to figure out if you're another satanism/pedophile sympathizer I need to add to my fucking list. They've been swarming this sub like flies to shit since the Hampstead story broke, and they ought to be swatted for their bad behavior. Anyone who agrees that pedophilia occurs at high levels in the government but dismisses eyewitness testimony of satanic ritual abuse as "moral panic" or something of that nature is suffering from some pretty severe cognitive dissonance, or has ulterior motivations.

       No.... You dont know- you never did know that- and THIS is your problem and the problem with people like you...
I'm not sure of inidividual cases and I despise people who dilute these issues with completely unsubstantiated data and story-stuff that replaces tangible evidence as the "top word" on what is happening, but either way I dont think you need to bully people over the internet for their hard work and rational investigation into such a serious issue. 
Im very aware of flooders and all manner of GCHQ of five eyes alliance operatives who use these techniques and even have the public unwittingly commit to such practices with a sort of quasi religious faith... Ignoring solid evidence for stories of spells and wierdness that is more emotionally triggering and curious by nature.
If you failt to understand the main motivation of insitutionalised paedophilia then that is your problem, but please do not start throwing around insane under-hand accusation that are very suggestive and almost slanderous.
For the third time- People with lots of money and power use the security services in a game of political blackmail, centered around a culture of high-up paedophilia, in order to continue their persuit of profit by having absolute control of any major influential figures.- Get used to
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       and investigate
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       . Stop wasting your time and doing harm to the victims of this political mess.

       I don't see anything wrong with bullying pedophile sympathizers, personally. In any case, that's not what I'm doing here. I'm just trying to pin down what you believe.

       You're saying that the allegations of satanic ritual abuse, the rape and murder of children and infants in the name of the devil, are made up to distract us? Simple question based on what you said.

       Dont you fucking dare suggest such a thing. you must be lacking so much to see someone who obviously does research that you couldnt be fucked to do yourself and then accuse them of being a paedophile sympathiser simply for blowing your fairy tale beliefs- that you obviously invested so heavily in rather than do proper research- out of the sky! That is so weak.

       For what? That's such a twisted accusation. You're a confused and pathetic little person. I'm literally a compaigner who works with victims of these crimes, get fucked will you? You disgust me, people like you who go on these sites without proper revision and help to silence the victims with your silly stories are insane. Youre so loose that you're now accusing a campaigner of beind a paedophile sympathiser.... You're a fucking loon.

       Maybe I should calm down, but it's the validity of this entire scandal that is at risk here. and for him to throw around accusations of paedophile helping is insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       No I dont believe that they are
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       there to discredit. I am well aware of many different groups who perform these acts, however to confuse that side of it with the political blackmail and power grabbing side would be to miss the cause of all of this entirely. The roots of all this is political blackmail, so naturally the focus should be on that and with it not on that this whole thing continues to exist. People need to do proper research and when they do all of this will become very clear.

       I read his/her comment's and there is no accusation of you being a pedophile sympathizer. I think the text got misinterpreted, because this is a text forum. I agree that political black mail is what is behind this.
       <a href="/u/damndirtylies">
        /u/damndirtylies

       is just saying that there is/could be  a satanic element to this or at least an occult element. If there is, than that is 2x's fucked. If the politicians practice this shit, it's more enraging than just black mail. Think of the implications of that. I love your energy and am glad you are an activist. I just think we all need a cool head when discussing this. This is some crazy shit we are trying to expose. Real sick twisted stuff goes on in this world. This shit is prevalent and goes into the realms of evil (not that pedophilia it's self isn't, but sacrifices, ceremonies, etc etc). Continue the good work, but also realize that there could be a satanic/occult element to this. I think this is what they were trying to get across. Just my thoughts, cheers!

       <em>
        some

       hopelessly confused individuals or groups within this movement who innocently think they are doing good while in reality they are doing a great deal of harm.

       is just asking a question and trying to gauge you. Your post, does come off a little weird. I know we need to investigate it, but you cannot say satanism isn't involved. We simply don't know and it could be. Which is why we need to investigate every aspect. What is worse, a black mail attempt or a secret society that fucks and eats young children? What would do more to wake people up. The sex trade is already known, but if the elites are doing this on a spiritual level, that's ground breaking and will fuck our known reality.
