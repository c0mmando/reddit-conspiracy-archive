        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So there is this video, <a href="https://youtu.be/47SVNOp-s_k?t=7s">[link to video in Russian]</a> it is of a separatist basically saying that the current cease fire between Ukraine and the rebels is a bunch of horse crap. He says that Ukraine is amassing a very large amount of tanks, equipment and heavy artillery in a city called Berdyanske, near a larger one called &quot;Shirokino&quot; <a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Berdyans&#x27;ke,+Donetsk+Oblast,+Ukraine/@47.0867262,37.7770286,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x40e6e9a65ea9c60f:0x8ec22bff53cbf8e0">[Google map link]</a></p>

<p>Here is a photo from Separatist UAVs. Ukraine was supposed to pull back equipment and artillery from the front lines. They, breaking the Minsk agreement are actually digging themselves in: <a href="http://vk.com/strelkov_info?z=photo-57424472_358160677%2Fwall-57424472_52580">[Photos]</a></p>

<p>This is a weird area to amass Ukrainian troops in since it is quite far from any large rebel controlled cities (Donetsk, and Luhansk)</p>

<p>Here is a map of what the rebels currently control: <a href="http://voicesevas.ru/img/b6d0e583f612b030051df49eb63df41e.jpg">[Map link]</a></p>

<p>Shirokino is the south western part right near the sea. West of Shirokino is Mariupol, where Ukrainian troops are now stationed.</p>

<p>Today, on their way to Shirokino, an OSCE convoy with a Russian general with them who is supposed to also look over the cease fire was shot at by a Ukrainian sniper and a machinegun, forcing them to turn back: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_t2qszkHM&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=0ZBhtNJVeNI&amp;annotation_id=annotation_2034727627">[Video]</a></p>

<p>OSCE is going to hold some sort of talks between the two sides in Shirokino...</p>

<p>What is the point of amassing Ukrainian artillery, tanks and soldiers on some far away position away from anything?</p>

<p>Either Ukraine is waiting for the separatists to make a push into Mariupol - which is west of Berdyanske, which is why they are fortifying those positions. But then why would they fortify so far East of the city? The separatists can just come in around them from the north.</p>

<p>Or they are waiting for a false flag. Ukraine can bomb that huge encampment of Ukrainian soldiers, maybe even hit the OSCE observers - blame Russia and the separatists - since Russian ships could be anywhere in those waters, and get themselves an excuse to get USA / NATO troops into Ukraine, maybe even start ww3...</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s this: <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/03/u-s-v-russia-even-stephen-cohen-starting-speak-truth.html">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/03/u-s-v-russia-even-stephen-cohen-starting-speak-truth.html</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post has always, turdovski. </p>

<p>Ukraine is certainly a prime chessboard piece, and for the longest time I thought operations there were punishment for Putin&#39;s diplomatic intervention during the &#39;chemical weapons&#39; issue in Syria two summers ago.</p>

<p>Of anything - the six-week cycle hits around tax time, and coincidentally, I recall vague timetables from the Pentagon about a showdown with ISIS/ISIL/ETC in Mosul in early April.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they happen back-to-back, serve as great distractions, and we finally try for Bashar or something crazy.</p>

<p>But the more I think about it, it seems Ukraine is meant to embroil the EU and the Russian Federation, while ISIS/ISIL/ETC is an excuse for the continued Balkanization of the Middle East to get a new LNG pipeline going to sell to Europe. </p>

<p>I see posts about NATO exercises and Poland working towards conscription again, and fear that they might, just might, take the bait. I don&#39;t know any more. </p>

<p>Who ever is running this seems to be pretty incompetent. These plays used to be much smoother, although I guess time will tell.</p>

<p>Great Cohen link by the way. He&#39;s great.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possible sure, I just haven&#39;t seen anything to convince me of that.  How can you be opposed to globalist organizations like the central banking cartel (centered around the BIS), or the UN, or the IMF when you&#39;re a member of all three?  It doesn&#39;t add up.</p>

<p>If he and Russia were truly an enemy, they would&#39;ve been expelled from these groups already or would have actively removed themselves.  I think the fact that neither of those things has happened speaks volumes.</p>

<p>I do agree with you though when you say he &quot;may be working towards a global system&quot; as this is totally in line with how I see it.  I think Putin, BRICS, and Russia are the &quot;antithesis&quot; to the thesis of the west and its central banking cartel, the end result of which will be a world currency and world government.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How can you be opposed to globalist organizations like the central banking cartel (centered around the BIS), or the UN, or the IMF when you&#39;re a member of all three?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they exist and Russia has to deal with that reality. I think it&#39;s really that simple. For instance, the UN. It was going to exist with or without Russia, so they joined. They even have a lifetime seat on the security council and I believe are one of 3 nations about to veto anything.  But my point is, there are benefits for Russia by being members of those organizations. And if you believe that they have their own globalist agenda, which I do, then it makes even more sense for them to be members.</p>

<p>I think of it this way, it&#39;s like a corporate board. All the people on the board have various other business interests, so it&#39;s like they are working together in this way, but are competing with each other otherwise.  If a member of the board starts to have serious issues with the direction the company is going, it could get to the point where they decide to leave and go start their own company doing the same thing. Looking backwards at their actions, I don&#39;t think you would say, &quot;How could they be opposed to company X when they were on the board?&quot; Those kinds of decisions don&#39;t ever happen quickly, and on a global scale it would have to take forever to manifest.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t how things would work for a legitimate enemy - they wouldn&#39;t have been allowed to join if they were.  And if they were an enemy now, they wouldn&#39;t be allowed to remain a member.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Exactly, I agree with you here.  Only in this case their &quot;business interests&quot; are enslaving and controlling the majority of the world&#39;s population and they are working together to do so.</p>

<p>And what you just described above is a far cry from the &quot;east vs. west&quot;, &quot;Putin is Hitler&quot;, &quot;Russia is evil&quot;, &quot;Russia is directly opposed to western hegemony&quot;-type propaganda we&#39;ve all been seeing.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re essentially saying exactly what I&#39;m saying: that they have competing interests here and there but ultimately are working together towards the same goals when all is said and done.</p>

<p>TL;DR:  I don&#39;t think any of this does or will benefit people like you and I.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The amount of false flags have been so astonishing already that it&#39;s hard to believe they&#39;d go for yet another one. Many must be rolling their eyes by now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been following this issue since before there were even protests in Kiev. Was seriously very close to living in Donetsk. Then this shit started.</p>

<p>I am of the belief that the only way we would have a direct war with Russia would be due to a false flag scenario. No one in Russia wants a war with America. In what world does that even make sense?</p>

<p>Also consider the following: the snipers in Kiev shooting the protesters were most likely anti-Russian forces working for the US, yet that was blamed on Russia (false flag),  and the the downing of the passenger jet, so many weird things about that, which was blamed on Russia when it almost couldn&#39;t have been them (false flag), so why wouldn&#39;t expect them to do the same thing they&#39;ve been doing the whole time...again?</p>

<p>So it&#39;s worrying for me to realize this, mainly because I have a close friend in Donetsk, but sometimes the truth sucks, and the truth is, a false flag in this scenario is incredibly likely.</p>
