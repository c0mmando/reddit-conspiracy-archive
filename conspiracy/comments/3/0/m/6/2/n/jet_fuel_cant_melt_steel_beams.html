        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams, so why was there molten metal at the WTC collapse sites?</p>

<p>NIST claims that WTC 1&amp;2 collapsed due to jet fueled fires (just normal offices fires for WTC7) which were not hot enough to produce molten steel or iron, but also claim that if there had been molten steel or iron in the debris afterwards, it would have been irrelevant to the cause of the collapses. The evidence of molten steel or iron cannot be called “irrelevant,” given the fact that the building fires, as NIST pointed out, cannot explain it.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Physical Evidence</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf">Early in 2002, Barnett and two WPI colleagues published an analysis of a section of steel from one of the Twin Towers, along with sections from WTC 7, as an appendix to FEMA’s 2002 World Trade Center Building Performance Study</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html">Their discoveries were also reported in a WPI article entitled “The ‘Deep Mystery’ of Melted Steel,” which said:</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Steel – which has a melting point of 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit – may weaken and bend, but does not melt during an ordinary office fire. Yet metallurgical studies on WTC steel brought back to WPI reveal that a novel phenomenon – called a eutectic reaction – occurred at the surface, causing intergranular melting capable of turning a solid steel girder into Swiss cheese.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html">Stating that the New York Times called these findings “perhaps the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation,” the article added:</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>A one-inch column has been reduced to half-inch thickness. Its edges – which are curled like a paper scroll – have been thinned to almost razor sharpness. Gaping holes – some larger than a silver dollar – let light shine through a formerly solid steel flange. This Swiss cheese appearance shocked all of the fire-wise professors, who expected to see distortion and bending – but not holes.</p>

<li><p><a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2005/1165/508OF05-1165.html">In 2005, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) published a report entitled “Particle Atlas of World Trade Center Dust,” which was intended to aid the “identification of WTC dust components.” Among the components, it reported, were “metal or metal oxides” (which could not be distinguished by the USGS’s methods). “The primary metal and metal-oxide phases in WTC dust,” the report said, “are Fe-rich [iron-rich] and Zn-rich [zinc-rich] particles</a></p></li>

<p><strong>Testimonial Evidence</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Testimony from Firefighters:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQyIN6OTMyY">New York Fire Department Captain Philip Ruvolo said: “You’d get down below and you’d see molten steel, molten steel, running down the channel rails, like you’re in a foundry, like lava.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fallenbrothers.com/community/showthread.php?2062-Recovery-worker-reflects-on-months-spent-at-Ground-Zero&amp;p=2948">Joe O’Toole, a Bronx firefighter who worked on the rescue and cleanup efforts, reported that one beam lifted from deep below the surface months later, in February 2002, “was dripping from the molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_G21B2qiQM">New York firefighters recalled in the documentary film Collateral Damages, “heat so intense they encountered rivers of molten steel.”</a></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Testimony from Other Professionals:</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjmHqES_lto&amp;t=40s">Leslie Robertson, a member of the engineering firm that designed the World Trade Center, said 21 days after the attack: “When we were down at the B1 level, one of the firefighters said, ‘I think you’d be interested in this,’ and they pulled up a big block of concrete and there was a, like a little river of steel, flowing.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060909104247/http://www.seau.org/SEAUNews-2001-10.pdf">Ron Burger, a public health advisor at the National Center for Environmental Health who arrived at Ground Zero September 12, 2001, said: “Feeling the heat, seeing the molten steel, the layers upon layers of ash, like lava, it reminded me of Mt. St. Helen’s and the thousands who fled that disaster.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/Publications/Special/Welch.htm">In late fall 2001, Dr. Alison Geyh of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health reported: “Fires are still actively burning and the smoke is very intense. In some pockets now being uncovered, they are finding molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130730103131/http://911encyclopedia.com/wiki/index.php/Publication:20121014014812">Joe Allbaugh, the Director of FEMA, said in an October 2001 interview on CBS: “It’s just too hot for rescuers to get into [some] areas. So we do not know yet what’s in those areas, other than very hot, molten material.”</a></li>
<li>Dr. Keith Eaton reported in Structural Engineer: “They showed us many fascinating slides . . . ranging from molten metal which was still red hot weeks after the event, to 4-inch thick steel plates sheared and bent in the disaster.”</li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060818074723/http:/pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nydailynews/87451160.html?did=87451160&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=FT&amp;date=Nov+1,+2001&amp;author=GREG+GITTRICH+DAILY+NEWS+STAFF+WRITER&amp;pub=New+York+Daily+News&amp;desc=FIRE+MAY+SMOLDER+FOR+MONTHS">Don Carson, a hazardous materials expert from the National Operating Engineers Union, said six weeks after 9/11: “There are pieces of steel being pulled out from as far as six stories underground that are still cherry red.”</a></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Testimony from Other Credible Witnesses:</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://gcn.com/articles/2002/09/09/handheld-app-eased-recovery-tasks.aspx">Greg Fuchek, vice president of a company that supplied computer equipment used to identify human remains, reported that “sometimes when a worker would pull a steel beam from the wreckage, the end of the beam would be dripping molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/sasalum/newsltr/summer2002/k911.html">Sarah Atlas, of New Jersey’s Task Force One Urban Search and Rescue, arrived at Ground Zero on September 11 and reported that “fires burned and molten steel flowed in the pile of ruins still settling beneath her feet.”</a></li>
<li>Tom Arterburn, writing in Waste Age, reported that the New York Department of Sanitation removed “everything from molten steel beams to human remains</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>The fact that the rubble contained steel or iron that had been melted shows that the buildings were destroyed by something other than fire and airplane impact.</p>

<p>When all of this physical evidence is combined with the testimony about explosions from many types of professionals, the claim that the Twin Towers were brought down by nothing other than the airplane impacts and resulting fires is simply not credible</p>

<p>No, otherwise why didn&#39;t the lower steel melt when the building was standing, there is no evidence that the potential energy of the building could melt steel, the hypothesis is in fact ludicrous </p>

<p>If the claim is that the fires within the towers couldn&#39;t be responsible, then what is? </p>

<p>Thermite doesn&#39;t work because it only keeps metal in a molten state as long as the reaction is occurring, almost immediately afterward the slag hardens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Electronics for example can burn pretty hot. What I don&#39;t get is why are people so fixated on molten steel. Steel loses a lot of its integrity at lower temperature, and will definitely start warping and bending. It seems plausible that many of the people who claim to have seen molten steel might have mistaken bent and twisted up steel as being molten.</p>

<p>Molten Aluminium
/ water explosions
risks and prevention</p>

<p>In the late ‘50s, George Long, working
at Alcoa’s
Research Laboratories said</p>

<p>“A
violent explosion occurs when a thin
layer of water is trapped under a sudden
rush of molten metal and can be avoided
by greasing or painting the bottom of the
water container”. Long’s research findings
led to further studies that showed organic
paints could be applied to aluminium
production equipment and materials to
prevent these explosions and the first used
was
t
arset
s
tandard, a bituminous coal tar
pitch. When this product was removed
from the market due to health risks, Wise
Chem
e
-212-F, a two-part epoxy, became
the standard.
p
yrotek’s Joe
r
oberts, Global
p
roduct Manager, Wise Chem, fills in some
of the background.
i
n the aluminium industry the term “pop”
is often heard, being used to describe a
non eventful splash of liquid metal.
t
his
is actually a Force 1 explosion as defined
by
t
he
a
luminum
a
ssociation who has
categorized water / molten aluminium
explosions into three levels.
a
Force 1 explosion is also referred to
as a steam explosion.
t
his occurs when
molten aluminium traps water which is
then quickly vaporized to steam.
t
he metal
is shot up to 15 ft (~4.5 m) and normally
involves less than 10 lb (~4.5 kg) of metal.
t
ypical incidents occur for example with
damp moulds, wet starting blocks, or water
on the casting table top.
i
n these cases
injuries are minor and often involve minor
burns.
a
Force 2 explosion results from a violent
steam reaction. Metal is ejected 15–50 ft
(~4.5–15 m) and involves much more than
30 lb (~14 kg) of metal. Metal can often be
seen on the inside roofs and walls of the
casting area as a result of these explosions.
s
erious injury and fatalities can result from
these incidents.
t
hey are a result of wet
scrap, improperly preheated sows, massive
bleedouts, or molten metal being drained
into wet or contaminated moulds.</p>

<p><strong>a
Force 3 explosion is a catastrophic event
where a large volume of metal is projected
more than 50 ft (~15 m). Fatalities often
occur along with near total destruction of
the immediate area.
a
Force 3 explosion is
identified by the extent of destruction and a
white powder (aluminium oxide) covering
the area.
o
ne pound of aluminium in a
Force3 explosion is equal to 3 lb (1.4 kg)
of
tnt</strong>
.
Molten aluminium can also explode as
a result of violent reactions with certain
metal oxides, such as iron, lead, copper and
bismuth.
s
ome of these oxides also have
attached waters of hydration which makes
the situation even worse. Most people are
aware that rusted iron or steel will react
when in contact with molten aluminium.
However, one major aluminium producer
experienced a Force 3 explosion in the
furnace without any water at all in the
area.
t
his was on a Monday morning after
a weekend shut down.
o
n Friday, the furnace was charged and
alloy additions made to produce 2014
aa
.
t
he furnace was then adjusted to low fire
for the weekend.
a
lloy 2014 contains
high amounts of copper and during the
weekend, the chopped copper wire alloy
addition oxidized. When the roof was
removed and the crane started the stirring
process, a large chunk of dross containing
a large amount of oxidized copper was
pushed against the furnace wall.
t
he
oxidized copper could not alloy into the
melt and a Force 3 explosion resulted
when the liquid aluminium came into
contact with the oxide.
t
his was all caught
on video from a surveillance camera.
n
o
one was injured, but safety procedures in
the plant were modified accordingly.
a
n
a
lcoa paper titled “Molten
a
luminum
/ Water
e
xplosions” published in 1979,
points out another problem.
t
his was
a test to evaluate various coatings.
i
t
involved the standard 12 x 12 x 12 in box
half full of water into which 50 lb (~23 kg)
of molten aluminium is dropped and an
impact hammer hits the side to initiate the
explosion.
v
arious coatings are tested this
way.
i
n one test,
r
ed
r
ustoleum was used,
but before the explosion could be initiated
it went off by itself.
r
ed
r
ustoleum
contains large amounts of iron oxide,
which reacted with the molten aluminium
and caused the explosion.
t
he experiment
was stopped and the aluminium industry
was made aware of this problem.
With the advent of new technology, new
explosion sites have been identified and
these will require attention.
t
he latest
involves the pit beneath tilting furnaces
and the hydraulic cylinders that tilt the
furnace.
o
nly the bottom 36 in of the
pit requires coating but the appearance
is enhanced if completely covered.
t
his
improves housekeeping and does eliminate
a potential explosion site.
o
ne coating will
last for years.</p>

<p>Because the videos you linked only prove that Aluminum doesn&#39;t always explode in water, they are not evidence for whether or not the molten metal in ground zero was aluminum or steel - And presumably we will never know because as you say; NIST claims to have never tested it. </p>
