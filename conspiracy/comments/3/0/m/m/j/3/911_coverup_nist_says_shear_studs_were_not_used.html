        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><em>The National Institute of Standards and Technology has committed fraud by releasing this unscientific report. Here is one of the many examples into the agency&#39;s coverup of 9-11-2001 and the link to <a href="https://www.ae911truth.org/images/articles/2014/11/twenty-five-points-10-19-14-3.pdf">24 other provable
points which clearly demonstrate that the reports produced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on the destruction of the World Trade Center (WTC) were unscientific and fraudulent.  <strong>Therefore NIST itself–including its lead authors, Shyam Sunder and John Gross -
should be investigated.</strong></a></em> </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Technical Statement:</strong></p>

<p>NIST&#39;s draft WTC 7 report said,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Most of the beams and girders were
made composite with the slabs through the use of shear studs. Typically, the shear studs
were 0.75 inches in diameter by 5 inches long, spaced 1 to 2
feet on center.”  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>However,  in the final WTC 7 report, NIST says shear studs were <em>not</em> used on the girders. The significance
here is that they claim the 13th floor A2001 girder was pushed off its seat at column 79 by
thermally expanded beams from the east side of the building. <strong>If shear studs had been used
on the girders, it would have been impossible for the beams to push the girder off its seat
with the column.</strong> No drawings are shown in the final report to substantiate this new claim.</p>

<p>In their WTC 7 model, NIST does not heat the concrete, only the steel. The implication is
then made that the shear studs in the beams are broken due to differential expansion of the
steel and concrete, allowing the beams to freely expand and force the now non
-shear-studded girder off its seat at column 79, causing floors 12 and lower surrounding column 79
to collapse, leaving the column without sufficient lateral support and causing it to become
unstable and to buckle. Concrete has nearly the same Coefficient of Thermal Expansion
(CTE) as steel and would expand and contract at almost the same rate when heated or
cooled. There is no analysis or any attempt to justify the position that the steel would have
heated up to a greater degree than the concrete and produced a differential expansion. No physical testing was done to investigate the actual behavior of the materials involved; only
computer modeling was performed without increasing the temperature of the concrete at
all.</p>

<p>(<em>Here&#39;s an interview with Kamal Obeid, C.E., S.E., a 30-year structural engineer, explaining how NIST&#39;s analysis actually disproves it&#39;s own theories on how WTC Building 7 collapsed, thereby confirming the use of controlled demolition:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WCcSHpvAJ8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WCcSHpvAJ8</a>)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The official government conspiracy theory in regards 9/11 and subsequent reports, are scientifically impossible, completely ridiculous and based purely on fantasy.</p>

<p>I implore all American patriots to go read and research this stuff, even at the most basic level, then make your own conclusions, away from any MSM propaganda.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxl06jxfgRk">WTC 7 went into free-fall (click for a compilation)</a>, literally gravitational acceleration <a href="http://i.imgur.com/N23Y89K.png">(the official reports even admit this)</a> which is impossible in a steel framed building, there is nothing in science or engineering that would explain how every single supporting column would disappear within mere fractions of a second, the only explanation, within the realms of science, is explosives of some description, taking out the columns in a timed sequence.</p>

<p>This violates basic Newtonian physics, IF, you choose to believe the official report that fires caused the collapse, obviously it is impossible for a building to go into freefall in any other scenario, this explains why NIST refuse to release there data for independent validation, the only relevant documents that support their theory that fire brought down a steel framed building (first time in history, still to this day) <a href="http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">are classified for public safety</a>, they will not even release them to a <a href="http://cryptome.org/wtc-nist-wtc7-no.pdf">licensed NYC architect in regards a FOIA request</a></p>

<p>Why are they hiding this data? Likely because it is not based on any known science and engineering principles, if we have to go on what they have released so far, <a href="http://rememberbuilding7.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/NIST-collapse-model-building-7.jpg">a collapse model that bores no resemblance to the observed collapse</a> </p>

<p>Thus their findings cannot be replicated or falsified due to the withholding of data and so if anyone outside of NIST believes what they say, they believe it on pure faith. </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/QyTbq5P">Page 3 and the architect&#39;s appeal over the remaining 3370 files</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>The acceleration of gravity in New York City is 32.159 ft/s2. WTC7 had 2.25 seconds of literal freefall, this is equivalent to approximately 8 stories of fall in which the falling section of the building encountered zero resistance. The collapse was complete in 6.5 seconds. Free-fall time in a vacuum, from Building 7&#39;s roof is 5.96 seconds</p>

<p>For any object to fall at gravitational acceleration, there can be nothing below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance. If there is anything below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance, then not all of the potential energy of the object would be converted to motion and so would not be found falling at gravitational acceleration (where did every single structural supporting columns go, instantly, at the exact same time?)</p>

<p>There&#39;s no exception to that rule, those are the conditions that must exist for gravitational acceleration to occur for the entirety of the duration of the time it occurs, this is basic Newtonian physical principles.</p>

<p>You either agree with this very basic concept, or you need to start making a case for a new realm of science that has never been witnessed before.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltP2t9nq9fI">Remember also that the BBC even reported that the building had collapsed 20minutes before it had</a>, remarkable.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/YmynBCH.jpg">The tilting of the south tower,</a> just before collapse.</p>

<p>According to Sir Isaac Newton’s law of the conservation of momentum, it should have kept tipping over, but it didn&#39;t, it fell through the path of greatest resistance. The top was tilting at approximately 20 degrees or so, how could it be exerting a uniform, symmetrical pressure on the floors below? it didn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nhsn9w9Vg">Watch a compilation of the collapse</a> what you are observing is approximately 30 upper floors begin to rotate as a block, to the south and east.They begin to topple over, not fall straight down.The torque due to gravity on this block is enormous, as is its angular momentum. But then  this block turned mostly to powder in mid-air! How can we understand this strange behavior, without explosives?</p>

<p>[Video evidence also shows that the lower sections of the Towers do not even begin to start collapsing until the upper sections are completely destroyed]([Imgur](<a href="http://i.imgur.com/Ag88tNY.jpg%5C)">http://i.imgur.com/Ag88tNY.jpg\)</a>) This is an impossibility if we are to believe the official reports </p>

<hr/>

<p>NIST&#39;s global collapse theory, in regards the complete collapse of two 110 story skyscrapers violates Newton&#39;s laws of motion.</p>

<p>It is scientifically impossible and completely illogical that these two buildings, which had an upper block exerting a force of only 36% of its static weight, could crush the larger, stronger, undamaged lower section of the building
to the ground, when the building, at any level, was designed to support several times the weight above
it,  while it maintains its downward acceleration. </p>

<p>The persistent acceleration of the top section of the building is
direct evidence that some other source of energy was used to remove the structure below it, </p>

<h2> Videos show that the section of the building above the plane impact point was the first section to disintegrate</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most compelling evidence in favor of the demolition theory is that the NIST WTC Reports, which took up to seven years to produce, exhibit all six of the characteristics of politically motivated pseudoscience</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lack of experiment - NIST performed no physical experiments to support its conclusions</p></li>
<li><p>The results of experiments were ignored or contradicted in the conclusions - steel temperature tests performed on the few steel samples saved suggested that the steel reached only about 500 degrees Fahrenheit. This is more than a thousand degrees below the temperature needed to soften steel and make it malleable—a key requirement of NIST’s hypothesis</p></li>
<li><p>There was no peer review and public comments from peers were ignored - NIST published its own WTC reports and therefore its work was not subject to peer-review as is the case for all legitimate science.</p></li>
<li><p>The findings cannot be replicated or falsified due to the withholding of data - NIST will not share it computer models with the public. A NIST spokesman declared, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, that revealing the computer models would “jeopardize public safety.”</p></li>
<li><p>False conclusions are supported by media or marketing propaganda - NIST’s pseudoscience was fully and uncritically supported by the mainstream media, many journalists have since stated they were under pressure from management to not report 9/11 stories if they were critical of the official narrative.</p></li>
<li><p>Hypotheses that are supported by the evidence were ignored - Throughout its seven-year investigation, NIST ignored the obvious hypothesis for the destruction of the WTC buildings—demolition</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To conclude, the WTC reports produced by NIST represent the most obvious example of politically motivated pseudoscience in history. The physical experiments NIST performed did not support its conclusions. The reports were not peer-reviewed and public comments that challenged the findings were ignored. NIST will not share its computer models (the last supposed evidence that supports its conclusions) with the public and therefore its conclusions are not verifiable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s absolutely 100% wrong that cell phones didn&#39;t work at 30,000 feet in 2001. They certainly were not meant to, and the tower operators and plane operators both discouraged it for various reasons, but it definitely worked. Plane operators were worried that it would disrupt electronics, tower operators were worried that the rapid switching between towers would cause a lot of congestion on sensitive parts of the network (ss7 signalling).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is ZERO evidence or a even hint of evidence that they collapsed via controlled demolition. A controlled demolition that *requires specifc beams and columns to be pre-cut - columns and beams that were not accessible and were covered in fire-protecting foam. The &#39;free-fall&#39; collapse is perfectly acceptable as well. The mass of the floors above was so immense that the compromised steel structure below did nothing to slow it down. To compare at home, get a pencil and hang two or three hammers on the middle - supports it just fine. Now, tape those hammers together and drop them from 12ft onto the pencil and see how much that pencil slows their decent. We didn&#39;t even have to shave or burn parts of that pencil.
WTC7 had MASSIVE damage in the southern corner. This building is 47-stories tall with a trapezoid footprint. That southern corner had huge transformers that exploded (accounts for the explosions everyone heard) as well as literally, tons of diesel fuel for backup generators. ALL of this exploded at various points wiping out 30% of the base. First responders saw all this damage and pulled out the rescue teams from WTC7 and made a collapse zone because they felt collapse was imminent - low and behold, it collapsed as predicted. Not a single element of this collapse violates any physics, nor is the collapse in any way shape or form &#39;anomalous&#39; from a structural engineering standpoint.</p>

<p>WTC 7 collapsed due to the tallest building in NY falling on it, and uncontrolled <em>fires</em> that were raging in it for hours. Its pretty simple.</p>

<p>People usually respond with </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;oh never in the history has a building collapsed due to fires&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In all the history of high-rise fires, not one has ever been hit with a plane traveling 500 miles an hour and had its fire proofing removed from its trusses.
In all the history of high-rise fires, not one has ever had its steel columns which hold lateral load sheared off by a 767.
In all the history of high-rise fires, not one has ever been a building which had its vertical load bearing columns in its core removed by an airliner.
For Building 7, in all the history of high-rise fires, not one has ever been left for 6-7 hours with its bottom floors on fire with structural damage from another building collapse.
Most of the buildings the nutjobs point to are steel reinforced concrete buildings or have steel reinforced concrete cores. Others are constructed with a steel web evenly distributed throughout the building. These buildings are not a &quot;tube in a tube&quot; design. The WTC towers were steel without concrete. The towers perimeter steel walls were held in place by the trusses and those trusses were connected to the perimeter columns by small bolts.</p>

<p>It is scientifically impossible and completely illogical that these two buildings, which had an upper block exerting a force of only 36% of its static weight, could crush the larger, stronger, undamaged lower section of the building to the ground, when the building, at any level, was designed to support several times the weight above it, while it maintains its downward acceleration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s do some <em>simple math</em> here since your probably not involved in engineering, so I want to make it as simple as possible for layman:</p>

<p>Lets make some conservative assumptions;
Weight of the plane ~ 150 short tons</p>

<p>Velocity of the plane ~ 400 mph</p>

<p>Conversions:
150 short tons = 136078 kg</p>

<p>400mph = 179m/s</p>

<p>Kinetic Energy in Joules:
(1792 * 136077) / 2 = 2180037599 Joules</p>

<p>Simplification:
2180037599 Joules = 2.18 GigaJoules</p>

<p>Comparison:
1 Metric Ton of TNT = 4.1GJ</p>

<p>Words:</p>

<p>Based on some pretty conservative assumptions, the impact of a plane into a tower in a scenario similar to 9/11 would carry the kinetic energy comparable to a half ton of TNT. This does not take the <strong>potential chemical energy</strong> present in the jet fuel itself into consideration. It certainly seems like a half ton of TNT&#39;s worth of energy could compromise the structural integrity of some buildings like the WTC.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was no peer review and public comments from peers were ignored - NIST published its own WTC reports and therefore its work was not subject to peer-review as is the case for all legitimate science.</p>

<p>NIST&#39;s draft WTC 7 report said,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Most of the beams and girders were made composite with the slabs through the use of shear studs. Typically, the shear studs were 0.75 inches in diameter by 5 inches long, spaced 1 to 2 feet on center.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>However, in the final WTC 7 report, NIST says shear studs were not used on the girders. The significance here is that they claim the 13th floor A2001 girder was pushed off its seat at column 79 by thermally expanded beams from the east side of the building. If shear studs had been used on the girders, it would have been impossible for the beams to push the girder off its seat with the column. No drawings are shown in the final report to substantiate this new claim.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The WTC 7 debate revolves around an individual named <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/first-responder-fights-back-after-losing-foot-to-9-11-accident.html">John Feal,</a> whose bio says he is a &quot;Demolition Supervisor&quot; so what the Hell was he doing at WTC Ground Zero in New York September 11, 2001 in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His explanation he was there to &quot;help out,&quot; is unconvincing in the light of other evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZduP7HTM3cg">Barry Jennings and Michael Hess</a> were ordered to proceed to the Emergency Management Room on the 27th floor of WTC 7, after everyone had evacuated, after being warned by then New York Mayor <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arVPrp5OzVs">Rudolph Giuliani,</a> that the Towers were going to come down.</p>

<p>As well Giuliani is the only one with sufficient authority to have given such an order, Hess and Jennings were trapped on the 8th floor, after explosions took out the stairwell as they attempted to exit the building.</p>

<p>The explosions they witnessed were the detonators that were to have set off the main charges, that had been built in during construction according to NY artist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_3ScRx9gvc">Paul Laffoley,</a> who was with the architectural firm that designed the buildings.</p>

<p>Conjecture all three demolitions were to occur simultaneously at 10:00 am, however Murphy&#39;s Law saw to it that while the <a href="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/oMQqI7h8J5k/hqdefault.jpg">South Tower</a> turned to dust on time, the North Tower and Bldg 7 were still on their feet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>It took Feal nearly an hour working frantically in the toxic dust, until he set off the charges were to have brought both remaining structures down.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Down came the <a href="http://www.prlog.org/10260429-tower-turns-to-dust.jpg">North Tower</a>, however the main charges in WTC 7 had still not gone off, meant Feal had to bound across and work furiously by helmet lamp for seven hours.</p>

<p>Going from floor to floor resetting the timers and fuses, eventually <a href="http://www.sxolsout.org.uk/DavidWatts_files/image001.gif">razing the structure</a> at around 5:00 pm on the afternoon of the same day.</p>

<p>As well as conventional explosives that had been built in during construction, thermonuclear demolition charges were positioned in both Towers, those same micro nukes embedded in the collapse material..</p>

<p>Still had enough potency to <a href="http://media.farsnews.com/media/Uploaded/Files/Images/1391/04/28/13910428000540_PhotoL.jpg">wipe out</a> the top nineteen floors of WTC 3 the Marriot Hotel, all but the North Wing of WTC 4, and to leave the <a href="http://www.oeppa.com/images/9-11/USE/wtc6-aerial.jpeg">gaping holes</a> in WTC&#39;s 5 &amp; 6 when it came into contact with them! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, the kicker is that they start their post</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The so called 9/11 “Truth” movement has been infiltrated and is ultimately controlled by the same criminal group who masterminded the attacks, &quot;if you want to control the dissent, you lead it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And now I doubt everything!!!! This being the first time I&#39;ve heard of mini-nukes at the WTC tho. It fails to explain the thermite tho it does explain how the charges avoided the fires.</p>

<p>Berry interesting. OP! You&#39;ve encountered this story before? In all good faith could you as briefly as possible explain how you concluded that this is disinfo?</p>

<p>Edit: that Laffoley makes some pretty heavy artwork. I suggest anyone interested in fluxons give him an intrepid google.</p>

<p>This (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI5DcHJZMuc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI5DcHJZMuc</a>) isn&#39;t it.  If anything, this looks like a carefully crafted cover for what he said previously.  The video I am thinking of doesn&#39;t have a reporter question him, but a member of the public.
