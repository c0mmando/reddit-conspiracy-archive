<p>Respectfully, please clear that up. I&#39;m very confused.</p>

<p>Turns out challenging &#39;the front page of the internet,&#39; not a specific user, is rules for deleting posts.</p>

<p>The only reason that that person&#39;s comments would have been removed is if rules here were violated in the process. Quite often people here make great comments only to finish them off with &quot;you&#39;re an idiot&quot; or &quot;you&#39;re a shill&quot; or some other type of personal attacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, absolutely.  Judy Wood&#39;s statement&#39;s should be subject to the same scrutiny as anyone else&#39;s.  She does seem to have some kind of protective aura that prevents questioning her, and most likely she is disinformation.</p>

<p>1)  What specifically that Judy Wood states do you believe to be untrue?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can challenge anything you like, but it works much better if you debate points rather than just labeling things as disinformation campaigns here to discredit the subreddit without any points to back it up.  The very fact that you think that there are conspiracy topics that exist simply as a campaign against this subreddit shows your lack of perspective.  Everything discussed here is discussed in other places as well.  There is a lot more internet out there.</p>

<p>When it gets right down to it, controlled opposition is massive.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves.― Vladimir Ilich Lenin </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of what is posted on here is sourced from controlled opposition, there is truth mixed with lies in just about every subject.  What you seem to be looking for is a place where only things that you consider to be true are allowed to be discussed.  You can have that if you make your own discussion forum.  You can create your own subreddit or use something like proboards.  But then you will just be in an echo chamber and will gain no new understanding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Listen to everyone, read everything, believe nothing unless you can prove it in your own research.&quot; William Cooper</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we look through your post history and see how you approach issues, you aren&#39;t interested in debating actual points.  You have made up your mind already.  Try thinking differently.  It is ok to debate the points of a subject without accepting its conclusion.  No one is trying to force things down your throat, but you seem to be genuinely offended by discussions about subjects where you reject the conclusion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.  - Aristotle</p>

<p>edit:  The Chomsky quote you posted makes no sense in the context of what you are saying.  You are the one trying to limit debate, or avoid it completely. </p>

<p>Then why do I post physics information about the controlled demolitions in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and not <a href="/r/911truth">/r/911truth</a>? I need no echo chamber. I welcome dissent, which is only allowed in comments, not OP titles. The house makes the rules...</p>

<p>I welcome all to challenge Newton&#39;s laws of motion in an open discussion almost daily. </p>

<p>If I were looking for an echo chamber I&#39;d post to <a href="/r/911truth">/r/911truth</a>.</p>

<p>I challenge nano-thermite just as much as Judy Wood, both disinformation campaigns against the 911 truth movement. </p>

<p>Newton&#39;s laws of motion prove controlled demolition. </p>

<p>The usual disinformation &#39;truthers&#39; always tout nano-thermite, as if it leads to a bigger conclusion. It only leads to people being distracted, which is what a good disinformation campaign does.</p>

<p>I entertained each and every idea, and guess what? Most of them are bullshit. Gotta spend time wading through disinformation.</p>

<p>Pentagon</p>

<p>Shanksville</p>

<p>no planes</p>

<p>Judy Wood</p>

<p>nano-thermite</p>

<p>Israel</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia</p>

<p>The problem is these all point away from the bankers who had the most to gain from this event. </p>

<p>The other issue is the defense stand down. Israel didn&#39;t operate Able Danger.</p>

<p>9.11.01 was carried out by the people you never hear about being held responsible: the shadow government, in collusion with the bankers; kind of an oxymoron come to think of it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to have spent a lot of time on the topic of 9/11.  While it is certainly important, may I suggest that you branch out?  9/11 is just one event and it can&#39;t be properly understood without the larger context.  </p>

<p>Two things that I suggest: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The history of Freemasonry and the Jesuit Order.  You have used the term &#39;shadow government&#39;.  It is important to see the groups that important figures throughout history have been affiliated with to understand the power structure of today.</p></li>
<li><p>Mass psychology and social engineering.  Edward Bernays was a nephew of Sigmund Freud and worked for the administration of Woodrow Wilson during World War I with the Committee on Public Information.  He has been called the Father of Public Relations.

<p>proof of your claims</p>

<p>What is the claim that you are attributing to me that you would like proof for?</p>

<p>Why do you promote bunk science without proof, making you look like a distractor not a contributor?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really?  I am asking you for the claim that you are attributing to me that you would like proof for.  You decline to answer that question and then claim that I am dancing?  In the other thread where we had a discussion I asked you several questions on various topics to try to get an understanding of your world view.  You ignored them all, and now you claim I am dancing?</p>

<p>And now you are calling me a debunker?  What statements have I made that you are labeling debunking?  </p>
