       I myself went threw that dilemma and I can say that it was an honest test I put my consciousness through. I discovered that I don't believe the world is flat after all; but I sure wouldn't be surprised if it was. I'm just saying not everyone who was on that bandwagon was a cointelpro agent. I m not one. I am a regular dude. You have to ask yourself "why" that became such a popular topic so fast.

       I'm just saying; it's possible that the world is much stranger than we CAN even imagine. I see no reason to rule out the flat earth, the concave earth, or perhaps virtual reality as explanations. I've seen some compelling evidence. However, the official story is impressive in itself; thus I choose not to "believe" any of these things. I "accept" all of them.

       And I was just stating that its sad that people are convinced years of reproducible science and math are wrong because of a YouTube video.  I see a lot of reasons to rule out a flat or concave earth, and they are every day observations like ships dipping over the horizon, a sunset, or an eclipse of the moon.

        Ship "dipping" over the horizon can be explained by your eye sight. Take a telescope and look at that same ship, it'll still be there.
       </li>
       <li>
        Sunset could be explained by the FE map and the real distance of the sun (hint: it's closer in their theory).

       All-in-all, they raise good questions. I'm not a "believer", but I'll entertain the idea, like I do with other things.

         It definitely will not, it is not a perspective issue.  A ship headed over the horizon does not shrink in size until gone, it disappears from the bottom up.

         The Sun "spot light" does not work that way. If its still above the surface, you could see it on a flat plane from anywhere regardless of where its directed.

        That is completely false. I've personally observed this and many others have also. There are also videos of it, but people like you "wont waste your time".
       </li>
       <li>
        That's not true. The is still massive land mass, no one is saying it isn't. If the Sun is smaller and closer to Earth, and if it's passing over Europe, the US would be dark (what it currently is now).

         Incorrect.  If its above Europe (or anywhere), youd be able to see it from the US(or anywhere) on a flat earth, this is all basic geometry.

       Then you shouldnt make assumptions about what I have or havent done when the proof is a click and a scroll away.  I know more about the FE ideology than you apparently do, and have been disproving it long before this thread.

       Thats the proof? Its not even over the horizon.

       And yes Ive seen that model of the "spotlight" sun.  Thats like saying you cant see a light shining directly down on the end table from the other end of the table.  Seriously?

       The ship is clearly over the horizon, because with the naked eye, it cannot be seen anymore (unless with zoom). Your table analogy is pretty weak, because how many miles across is earth? I'll give you an example: New York to Russia is, 4681 miles. If it's above Russia it would not be above the US. Not sure how that is so complicated for you.

       Nope. The ship was visible the whole time, without zoom.

       This may be a hard concept for you, but light travels really far.  If you can see stars just above the horizon, you should be able to see the sun in the flat earth model.

       It doesn't make any sense to get mad about people posting flat earth related material. You have to allow yourself to question anything and everything. The line of thinking is actually logical when you consider nasa lies about a lot of shit and we have no idea what is really in outer space or what's the real deal with the moon. I'm not convinced about flat earth but I'm not totally convinced on sphere earth. I see problems with each model but am not really too concerned about which is correct or what an alternative would be. Anything that causes you to think, use your brain or be skeptical has a place. To get pissed about flat earth posts here is to close your mind.

       I looked into the claims. I made up my mind b/c all flat earthers do is write paragraphs with "open your mind" and other esoteric bullshit. No verifiable facts are ever reported.

       Did you just edit your post and quote your edit to me? As for sticking to the topic, I was only responding to the only thing your comment said when I replied, which was you quoting the parent comment and saying "calmer than you."

       I've actually looked into many of the FE claims, and find most if not all of them to be baseless. Still, it was a useful thought experiment for me, causing me to rethink what had been axiomatic assumptions in my worldview. My questioning spherical earth did lead to some interesting anomalies about NASA, especially

       I'm not here to disrupt and perhaps you're right that I was  projecting. 
I have seen other similar posts where it seems peor are genuinely frustrated or angry or whatever. I'm only pointing out that this sub should be open to any topic. Even topics that you think are a waste of time. If you don't want to read about the topic don't click the thread. If you don't like what a poster has to say don't read what they've written.

       This is important: Even if you disagree with something someone else is saying/said, you need to at least support their right to say it. The first amendment for all.  If you silence one person/group...then eventually we do not all have freedom of speech, press, etc.

       I got into an argument with a flat-earth guy a couple of weeks ago.  He seemed to sincerely believe that bullshit.  It is usually ultra religious people who read the bible and believe it literally.   It's an easy enough theory to prove.  Just go west.  Keep going.  If the earth is flat you'll come to the "ice wall" or whatever they think is there at the edge.  I've never heard anybody explain how in a world with land, sea, and air travel and billions of people not a single one has ever seen the "end" of the world.

       on a flat earth map "going west" would be going around the north pole in a circle, so no you would not get to the "icewall" by doing that.

       Well then hop in a plane and go any direction.  Continue that direction.  Doesn't matter which way you want to go.  If the Earth is flat from your starting point you can head any direction in a straight line and you would have no choice but to reach the edge.

       It is a legitimate objection.  What would keep you from reaching the edge of a flat earth?  Their theory as to why it can't be done is absolute horse shit.  They make up rules of travel that have no basis in reality.  If "going west" would just go around the north pole in a circle they can go ahead and head west and prove that.  They won't prove that because going west won't take them around the North Pole in a circle.  That would end their dumb theory.

       The treaty has nothing to do with barring travel.  more than 40000 people go there a year on vacations.  There are a lot of rules and regulations about protecting the wildlife and preventing military presence or claim to the continent, preventing damage to the ecosystem, etc.  You just need permits and permissions due to the treaty involving the 50 or so nations, and they want to know who is there and what is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rules are very different for this continent because there is no native human population, and it is a unique ecosystem of wildlife.

       Seems
       <em>

       are the one taking word of mouth without personal research.

       Yes I have looked into it.  But I would think some of you flat earthers would want to prove this and re-write history.  It's 2015.  Crowd source the project and change the world.  None of you will do it because it is horse shit.  It would be the easiest thing in the world to prove and for some reason nobody wants to prove it.  It is one of the most retarded fuckin theories that somehow still exists.  You refuse to believe pictures taken from outer space.  If you ignore every single piece of evidence and call it a government conspiracy to make the earth round (for some reason the entire world would want to come together to lie about this) then sure, you can say the earth is flat.  It is just mind boggling that of the billions of people on the planet not a single fuckin one has stumbled upon the edge of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can watch videos on youtube of the world record sky dive where a guy jumps from low earth orbit and you can see the curvature of the earth from the camera he is wearing.  Of course, when I showed this to another flat earther he said the footage was doctored with camera trickery.  There is no proving a theory wrong to somebody who won't believe anything.

       i can easily afford to do it, you know why i dont? i dont want to get shot out of the air or water on the way there, which is exactly what would happen, which you would know if you looked into it as you claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       so basically you offer conjecture and an appeal to authority to trust pictures from nasa and some dude jumping from high up filmed with a fish eye lense as proof in 2015.... never mind the camera inside before he jumped out shows a flat horizon which is at eye level, which should not be possible on a globe.

       Yeah I do think that.  If you think you will get shot for heading west you are insane.  Any one of you can head west and you won't be anywhere near the North Pole so you'd have nothing to worry about.  The entire world didn't embark on a grand conspiracy here.  You don't even need to trust nasa.  You can launch your own weather balloons with cameras on them to photograph the earth from a height that will show its shape.  You can watch the sky diving video which doesn't involve nasa.  You can pick a direction and travel there and not get shot.  You have to ignore so much shit to hold this theory it's unbelievable.

       I know what the flat earth map says and I'm telling you that if you go west you won't run into Antarctica and that will prove the map wrong.  People travel east and west all the time without hitting Antarctica.  You are using excuses to make it seem like there is no way to prove your theory right or wrong.  Buy a weather balloon and put a camera on it and send it up and take pictures of the Earth.  I bet you it is curved.  You won't do that though.

       Dude you are dodging way harder than i am.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a flat map if you follow a compass west, it will take you in a circle around the centre back to where you started. The same way on a globe it will take you around the globe back to where you started.
      </p>
      <p>
       So i am saying that argument is defunct. Even if the earth is a globe that particular argument is meaningless drivel.

       If the earth is flat you'll hit the edge (which as you said would be Antarctica/an ice wall).  If the earth is a globe you'll return to where you started.  I'm telling you you'll never reach Antarctica going west so that will prove the "Antarctica is at the edge of all sides" map wrong.  And what is wrong with the weather balloon and camera?  You can take your own pics so you won't need NASA.  You'll see the curvature of the Earth.

       I'm thinking more like this where you have a wide lens so you can actually see enough of the horizon to see that it is curved.  Don't just cherry pick pictures that work for your theory... that is being intentionally dishonest.  Besides, you'll want to do this experiment yourself since you think every picture can just be doctored.  I suggest you launch your own balloon.
