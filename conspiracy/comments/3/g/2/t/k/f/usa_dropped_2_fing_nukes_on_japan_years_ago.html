       USA dropped 2 f***ing nukes on Japan years ago. I just started pondering that and it began to really sink in. Let's discuss it. Imagine how brainwashed you have to be to rationalize it.

       It's ok to criticize White Americans for killing the Indians, for enslaving the Blacks, or for keeping Uncle Schlomo out of the Presbyterian golf club. Or not saving
       <em>
        enough
       </em>
       Jews in World War II. Or not bombing enough of Israel's enemies in the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's not ok to criticize America for dropping nuclear weapons on men, women, and children in Japan. You see, Americans killing Germans and Japanese = good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans forcing Blacks to work or displacing Indians = bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's simple, it depends on whether the victims are "kosher" or not that determines the moral righteousness of the action.

       Right, then you would be accusing the US of wiping out Japanese culture with the atom. They bombed as close to military and industrial complexes as they could, they also choose a place to demonstrate the bombs power.

       Would you rather the extermination of the Japanese? That's what invasion would have led to.

       I am not accusing anyone of anything..just how wars happen. Military had/has intel on where leadership lives..but used to target civilians...today's strategy sort of changed..but still the civilian population gets the short end of the stick in most cases, not the leadership of the country being attacked.

       Now wrap your head around this.  By some estimates, we have killed twice as many people in Iraq and Afghanistan using bullets, bombs, rockets and mortars.

       It was an extreme move.

       In reality, the nukes we dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were tiny compared to what we have now.  Modern nukes range from 1,000 to 2,000 times more explosive energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       We could conceivably create more explosive force today with conventional explosives.  Fat Man was a mere 21Kton bomb.

       It was estimated had we actually invaded Japan, that the number casualties would have been in the millions. Was it the right thing to do? I don't know, but at the time they felt it was the right thing to do.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In fact, the casualties from the U.S. strategic conventional bombing campaign greatly eclipsed the number of individuals who died from the atomic bombings. The March 1945 firebombing of Tokyo alone killed some 120,000 Japanese. A ground invasion would have resulted in nearly immeasurable more casualties. As one scholar who studied the U.S. invasion plan, Operation Downfall, notes: “depending on the degree to which Japanese civilians resisted the invasion, estimates ran into the millions for Allied casualties and tens of millions for Japanese casualties.”

       All of those screaming self-righteously now should get an education before they say any more

      </p>

       The Japs are guilty of unspeakable atrocities and the worst part is -- they enjoyed it. They got off on it.  They boasted about it

      <p>
       Then they reaped the whirlwind.  They knuckled down after that and began producing half decent consumer items.

       That's where the Japs belong -- under the thumb of power.  Leave them to their own natural inclinations and there'd be more of their inhuman behaviours

       Read up on the firebomb campaigns that were being employed in Japan to spur a surrender, as well as the other strategies condidered and the predicted statistics pertaining to them (estimated casualties, infrastructure damage, etc).  US openly admits continuing them would have been catastrophic for the Japanese, bordering on one of the greatest tragedies of war, and decided to drop the bombs instead to bring it to a quick conclusion.  Choosing the lesser of two evils to save countless lives, it's a situation that very few can handle.

       I'm not mishandling the situation. What happened was atomic bombs were dropped on CIVILIAN populations. The justification is that it prevented more casualties. You CANNOT predict that with certainty. You are simply spewing from the machine, think outside the textbooks.

       That's not what fuck means it's an old myth.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the English fought the French the French would cut off the plucking fingers of English longbow men so they couldn't "pluck" them off anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the English pretty much would taunt the French by holding up their middle "plucking" fingers while saying something to the affect of "I can still pluck you". The French pronounce shit weird and fast forward to today and we hold up our middle fingers while saying " fuck you" and then excusing our "French".

       The term "fuck" means "to strike" and it comes from German or something. You know, "to strike" as in "I'd hit that."

       No,
       <em>
        that's
       </em>
       a myth. The truth is that nobody knows what the etymology is of the Modern English word "fuck" because the word was too taboo to be included in dictionaries in the early modern period. We have no clear analogue of the word in Middle English (though there are some hints of it in doggerel and such) and there's no apparent ancestor of it at all in Old English.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there is a German word
       <em>
        ficken
       </em>
       which means "to copulate" and is vulgar, but it's a modern word, not the ancestor of our word.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        One guy
       </em>
       tried to connect our word to the Middle English
       <em>
        firken
       </em>
       meaning "to beat," but it doesn't work. The chronology doesn't fit. So we know for sure that's not it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In truth, it's likely that nobody will
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       know where "fuck" came from. Its origin is lost.

       There was no need to bomb them, at the time Japan was looking to surrender (they already lost). We merely wanted to teach them a lesson and test out our new toy and to show the Soviets.

       Yes, they were. Japan made many attempts to declare defeat. The US bombed them, merely to test out the nuke on civilians. Why did we not nuke Nazi Germany and teach them a lesson?

       Because Nazi Germany surrendered in May. We did have the atomic bombs ready at that point.

       They wanted terms, we demanded an unconditional surrender, we got it.  The Japanese did so many horrible things during that war that crying over two cities is almost monstrous.

       I suppose I'm just one of the (apparent few) people here that does not see mass civilian casualties as necessary, or that dropping nuclear warheads was the only option.

       , just say the 10000 lb bombs (or whatever size to achieve the point) were filled with nothing more than a biodegradable non-toxic colored dye (like paintballs) and no more explosive than necessary to disperse it.  They are detonated at a similar height (approximately 1500ft) and subsequently mist several square miles with colored speckles.  Immediately afterward, notification was given to Japan that they could have easily been nuclear bombs, and everything the speckles touched would've have been leveled &amp; vaporized.  Would we have gotten the same result?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems to me that illustrating the potential on a large scale would be more than adequate.

       You're implying that I lack knowledge on the subject? That "reading up" would lead me to the obvious conclusion that it was a necessary action? The BBC is so very unbiased...
