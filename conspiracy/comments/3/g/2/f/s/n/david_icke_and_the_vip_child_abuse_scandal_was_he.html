        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This has been on my mind for some time and I haven&#39;t had the chance to discuss it with anyone who is genuinely interested, I thought I would discuss it here.</p>

<p>It now seems that David Icke was right (to some degree) about wide spread child abuse happening within the corridors of power in the UK Government and elsewhere within celebrity life in the UK. However, for Icke, it doesn’t end there, beyond that lies ritualistic and satanic abuse as well, not to mention that the perpetrators of these crimes, according to Icke, may not even be human, rather human-reptilian hybrids.</p>

<p>With that in mind, do you think that Icke has simply casted such a wide net over the past three decades that he was bound to catch something (prominent VIP child abusers)? If not, what else is he right about in relation to this scandal?</p>

<p>Also, another difficult question I want to pose is simply, why? I cannot understand why public figures would be carrying out ritualistic abuse with an emphasis on Satanism and the like (particularly because I’m an atheist and don’t believe in any hocus pocus nonsense). I know that more often than not, politicians and other public figures are totally and utterly morally bankrupt and completely detached from normal life, but why this specifically? I’m still struggling to come to terms with how something like this could happen.</p>

<p>All comments welcome. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe Icke uses reptilians as a metaphor (two bloodlines). It&#39;s not Satanism per se, it&#39;s occult/esoteric and it&#39;s completely different than what you think Satanism is (hence the two bloodlines, above). The Serpent and God are completely different than what mainstream religion identifies them as (to them). They believe in esoteric history and this goes all the way back to the mystery schools of ancient times. These teachings have been passed down by various societies. </p>

<p>Why do they do it? Most are a part of secret societies and the occult teachings/rituals are at the heart of it. Just because you are atheist and do not believe in this stuff, doesn&#39;t mean it does not exist. These people believe in this stuff. Now, I do not believe most politicians are a part of all this. They may be in the secret society, but those are compartmentalized. the lower members have no idea what the higher ups are really doing. Politicians are on the lower end (imo). </p>

<p>As for the abuse, well I consider it like a street gang or the mafia: &quot;blood in, blood out&quot;. Which means you have to do something illegal to get in (prove your loyalty/have blackmail material) and the only way out is death. Get where I&#39;m going with this?</p>

<p>Anyways, this is getting longer than I had planned to type. Hope I&#39;ve helped a little.</p>

<p>IMHO: Politicians are power grabbing, money hungry <em>freaks</em> on steroids and they get <em>juiced</em> then get <em>trapped</em>.</p>

In one of them he describes the probably paedo Ed Heath, and in it he describes his behavior in detail, along with a vivid description of how his eyes turned black.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting, but also could be a reference to drugs. Certain drugs can dialate your eyes, into looking all black. I think this could be another way to cover his ass. I smoked pot once in HS and my GF at the time, told me my eyes were completely black ( I think that shit was laced, got it from a shitty hood rat). What was in that shit? IDK, but this can be explained with drugs. You must look past the shit, and read between the lines. I&#39;m not sticking up for Icke, by any means. But if you know what he is saying, you get it. If you can see past the metaphors and nonsense, you will see. Which is why I think he is not dead, yet. People write him off as crazy, that&#39;s brilliant for TPTB. But if you listen and look in between the lines, you will see something. 95% of the people wont. IDK</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s another idea. Is there any chance that Icke talks about some of the more &#39;far out there&#39; stuff to protect himself? If the establishment thinks he&#39;s crazy or not being taken seriously, then he becomes harmless. But if it seems like he IS being taken seriously then surely that would give &#39;them&#39; (whoever they are) real motivation to get rid of him?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit to being one of the people who never took the guy seriously until the other week when, stuck for something to watch, I found the &quot;...at the Oxford Union&quot; video on Netflix. And I&#39;ve got to say, I was pretty surprised at just how many of his theories I actually agreed with. I&#39;ve kind of got a newfound respect for him after watching that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me..Carl Sagan&#39;s observations on claims such as these makes the most sense. To icke they might be completely real, he can&#39;t really prove they exist...but we can&#39;t really prove they can&#39;t exist. It&#39;s a useless argument, much like god. Useless to fight over because we haven&#39;t a breath of knowledge to go about finding these things. I think it&#39;s best to keep it on the shelf and let it collect dust with the other outlandish theories...while focusing on what is tangible and we can readily understand right now and maybe just maybe that will lead us back to those dusty ideas. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my theroy:</p>

<p>Icke got really close the truth many years ago and was gaining credability. TPTB saw this and got scared they devised a plan to discredit him. They planted informants around him, one or more gained his trust by telling him the truth.</p>

<p>When they had him hook line and sinker they fed him the reptilian shit in such a way he believed, once he started talking publically about the Lizards he discredited himself along with everything else he believes. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter if he finds the truth and tells the public. The public simply say</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Icke? the guy who bleieves in Lizard overlords, he is a fucking loon. He has no idea what he is talking about</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A simple plan played by TPTB, expertly executed. Job done.</p>

<p>There maybe some merit to the thought of, if you throw enough shit some of it will stick, but I don&#39;t sign up to this theroy as much</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like Icke but I feel that he&#39;d be more effective if he reined in the talk of reptilians, etc. I think he&#39;s on the money with the rampant paedophilia in the upper echelons of British (and American) society. He doesn&#39;t seem too afraid of ripping into the Zionists either, which Alex Jones absolutely won&#39;t do, so fair play to him for that.</p>

<p>With regards to the reptilians, though, there&#39;s an interesting anecdote in <em>Trance Formation of America</em>, in which Cathy O&#39;Brien is told by George Bush that he is an alien: &quot;Claiming to me to be an alien himself, Bush apparently activated a hologram of the lizard-like &quot;alien&quot; which provided the illusion of Bush transforming like a chameleon before my eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what to make of that.</p>
