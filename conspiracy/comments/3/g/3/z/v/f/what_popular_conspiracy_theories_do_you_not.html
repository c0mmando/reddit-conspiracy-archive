<p>Yes, they had done drills before. Again, you realize that also implicates the hundreds of emergency medical staff that were simply at the marathon because it was a marathon? I&#39;m asking if you&#39;re saying everyone there was in on the act. The first responders, the spectators, etc.</p>

Are you saying that there were thousands of people in on it being a drill and no one was injured, rather then saying the brothers were aided by a higher power? Yes or no. Link me to something. Prove something.</p>

<p>I can show you pictures of people who lost limbs before that day with said limbs. That immediately implicates everyone in their lives as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would it be necesary to have thousands of people in on it.  Your question makes no sense.   A few dozen, maybe a hundred or so.  The rest are compartmentalized and never interact with Strategic Operations moulage or victims.  </p>

<p>If you look at the flickr photostream the application of moulage and staging of the scene is VERY OBVIOUS.</p>

<p>The brothers?  There&#39;s no good evidence they plotted this in secret.  more the opposite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your last point is my point. Wouldn&#39;t it be easier to just send the brothers out with bombs to hurt innocent people? Why involve any more people. It makes absolutely zero sense. </p>

<p>A few dozen? No. There are tons of medical professionals at the marathon (as there is at every marathon) who ran over to the scene that would spot fake injuries and blood. The &quot;Look! They&#39;re spraying fake blood!&quot; bullshit would&#39;ve immediately been noticed by them. They know what blood looks like. They know what injuries look like. They would&#39;ve seen the fake limbs. Then there&#39;s the medical staff at the hospitals that treated the injured. They&#39;re in on it too? What about family members? Friends? Coworkers? Doctors? Dentists? You&#39;re saying everyone has remained silent, or the actors kept the loss of their limbs so quiet so they could be fake bombed that no one knew? With every person you&#39;re saying had &quot;fake&quot; injuries you&#39;re implicating everyone else in their life that knows them. What about the three that died? They never existed? They&#39;re on a private island now?</p>

<p>Flickr? Are you talking about the guy in the hood and the black lady supposedly hooking up blood and Bauman&#39;s fake injury? Are you seeing a staging because that&#39;s what you WANT to see? Or are you seeing it because you want to see it? There are pictures of Sydney Corcoran and her mother with perfectly healthy legs before the marathon. Did they quietly lose them and keep it a secret as well?</p>

<p>that&#39;s not a point, it&#39;s speculation.  clearly we have evidence that it was staged, so your quetsion is pointless.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so you have nothing to prove it? All you have to do is link something that says what you&#39;re trying to say. You&#39;re saying that Bauman, the Corcorans, the many others who lost limbs, the people hit by shrapnel, the three dead, their friends, their family, their coworkers, their neighbors, their teammates, their doctors, their dentists, etc. etc.,  the first responders and medical workers there that day, the hospital staff are all in on it being a drill and keeping silent. All it would take is one person saying &quot;Uhh, I saw [insert name of actor here] a week before the marathon, and he/she definitely had both legs.&quot; Or &quot;Yeah, I went to grade school with Bauman, he was missing his legs back then.&quot; But no. It&#39;s much more believable to say a massive drill took place and everyone remained silent to fool the rest of the country. What a brilliant theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve answered all these before, but these supposed &#39;slam dunk&#39; debunking responses still think they got us.</p>

<p>We had the technology to bouce back radio waves and even stronger signals (like the lasers of today), way back in the 50&#39;s and early 60&#39;s. Mirrors are unnecessary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>National Geographic Vol. 130 No. 6 December 1966</p>

<p>&#39;The Lasers Bright Magic&#39; by Thomas Meloy</p>

<p>Page 876
&quot;Four years ago (1962) a ruby laser considerably smaller than those now available, shot a series of pulses at the Moon, 240000 miles away. The beams illuminated a spot less than two miles in diameter, and were reflected back to Earth with enough strength to be measured by ultra sensitive electronic equipment.&quot;</p>

<p>Many types of signals can be bounced off the Moon, even without any type of reflectors. In the 1950s, Moon-bounce was used to communicate around the curvature of the Earth. If you were in the military and wanted to talk with someone in Hawaii from California, you would bounce your conversation off the Moon.</p>

<p>What kind of difference did you have in mind? Because entering the skull and exiting the skull isn&#39;t much of a difference, the bullet didn&#39;t experience a substantial enough loss of speed. </p>

<p>That&#39;s... My initial point. </p>

<p>What I was referring to now was whether the bullet encountered any different resistance from the entry, to the exit - Which it didn&#39;t. Into skull, out of skull. </p>

<p>So nothing between the skull? No brain tissue, no fluids? 
Even though the old fmj rounds didn&#39;t mushroom like a hollow point would, there was still deformation of the bullet after entry. The exit hole would be larger than entry, even assuming there was no resistance from one side of the skull to the other. </p>

I think the benefit of vaccines and GMO food outweighs the negative.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to think of these things as being bad when you are in an industrialized nation where starvation and disease are less likely to impact you and your family in a huge way.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, though. Farming practices have changed in a terrible way due to these other advances. It&#39;s not a good idea to saturate your crops with Round Up just because you can.
And it&#39;s not to say that vaccines don&#39;t have side-effects. All medicine has side-effects. It&#39;s a moral dilemma I guess.</p>

<p>What if vaccines caused even 10% of recipients to have Autism or some other disorder of equal impact? That&#39;s still 90% that have a significantly lessened chance of catching Rubella or Polio or what have you. </p>

<p>Aliens.  So much of what they&#39;re supposed to be doing make no effing sense.  You&#39;re going to travel billions of miles to have sex with rednecks and steal the naughty bits of cattle?  We can clone with somatic cells, we don&#39;t need sexual organs.  And killing the cows leaves obvious evidence that would make any natural behavior studies difficult.  We can spy via satellite and so on as well, why do they need to go low enough to be seen?</p>

<p>9/11 is tricky.  I believe that the actual hijackers did what the government says, but that the government allowed it because it happened to match what they wanted.  So more like Pearl Harbor, the government let it happen to get into the war, but they didn&#39;t do the deed themselves.  Of note is that while the various terrorist groups want to do another major attack, now it doesn&#39;t work.  </p>

<p>Atlantis doesn&#39;t really make sense to me.</p>

<p>The alien psyop does many many things. It makes the world think the USA has mysterious technology from aliens to fight the USSR with. Essentially divine weapons. </p>

<p>It discredits and derails legitimate spiritual experiences. People don&#39;t see faeries any more they see aliens. Sleep paralysis becomes abduction.  </p>

<p>I do think the universe is massive enough to have life and great technology humanity will never imagine. But, we are in the middle of nowhere galactically. A galactic backwater. We are in the outer rings. If any species was going to come here it would be a one way trip. Time and the massive expansion of space makes travelling to this tiny rock a bad investment. Why enslave us when there are entire systems with ten earth like planets. Earth just is not that significant to any beings besides the ones the earth created. </p>

They had only 9 months to develop a module to get them safely to the moon [and more amazingly] back again.</p>

<p>Nowadays the space program is halted because apparently it takes 10 years to develop the module and sort out the whole shebang.
Why? Just use the old one and pep it up a bit with modern computers...</p>

<p>What I am saying is that humans have been to the moon and back, only not the first time they said. </p>

<p>To add the theory that makes no sense to me, it&#39;s so called &#39;Chemtrails&#39;.
I hate it, none of the things brought forward ever pan out. Contrails have existed since planes existed and even though it would be really easy to lay to rest with simple sample testing, it has never been done...because it would show that they are contrails. There.</p>

<p>You&#39;re missing the point. I don&#39;t even think you&#39;re responding to the right person. </p>
