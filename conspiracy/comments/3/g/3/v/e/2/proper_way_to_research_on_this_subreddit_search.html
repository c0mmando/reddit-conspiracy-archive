<p>This is absolutely not to say that the reverse is true either: Simply because it&#39;s heavily downvoted means nothing to its veracity. </p>

<p>Being that you&#39;re a guy spamming the Flat Earth Theory here, it&#39;s no wonder you&#39;re directing people to the downvoted trash like it. Those kinds of assertions revolve around a complete and total denial of all things scientific: That&#39;s why they&#39;re downvoted. That&#39;s why you&#39;re telling people to go looking for downvoted stuff: It&#39;s a lot of <em>your stuff</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edit: Fair enough, you don&#39;t spam flat earth, you just interject when it is brought up. I concede that. You still get downvoted for it, even on your own sub. So it makes sense that you&#39;d tell people to focus on the downvoted stuff: most of your stuff is there.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>the fact that you assume downvotes is bad info is very telling...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Telling of what? I&#39;m curious.</p>

<p>Fact is I don&#39;t assume downvoted == bad info. The fact that you&#39;re putting words into my mouth is telling of how you like to argue: In extremes. </p>

<p>See, because if downvotes == bad info, I&#39;d be filled with it: I get a <em>lot</em> of downvotes. Doesn&#39;t stop me, doesn&#39;t mean what I have to say is &#39;bad info&#39;. </p>

<p>But then I don&#39;t assume the opposite either, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1ycg4b/nsa_chief_charged_with_murdering_3yearold_son/cfjh011">and you absolutely do.</a> That&#39;s a total fallacy. That is paranoia on par with I don&#39;t know what: You honestly believe the world is as upside down as it can possibly get. </p>

<p>When a post asserting the earth is flat gets downvoted to hell, that&#39;s not an indication of a bunch of paid-downvotes, or some over-arching conspiracy to &#39;shroud the truth&#39;. That&#39;s an indication that people think you&#39;re either a troll or otherwise, completely outrageous and not worth listening to. </p>

<p>There is no one paying people to dissent on Flat Earth or similarly bogus theories. If they are, they&#39;re terrible at managing money, as it&#39;d be a complete waste. There are more than enough reasonable, normal, non-shills willing to tell you their honest opinions on your pet theory. Just happens that those normal people think you&#39;re crazy. Go figure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s salty? I&#39;m just talking. No name calling, no vulgarity. I asserted that some people think you&#39;re crazy - true, some people do think that - but I never said &quot;you&#39;re crazy&quot;. I&#39;m genuinely intrigued.</p>

<p>Regarding banning.. what? Who&#39;s talking about that? Elaborate please.</p>

<p>Stalking - I didn&#39;t. I opened your history, sorted by Controversial, and that was on page 1. Apologies that it was so far back, but you <em>did</em> say it. You can sort that way yourself and see it there. </p>

<p>Not sure what this means, you have some egregious typos:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you your shill tmor subreddit and dont harass other subreddits like you guys do on conspiracy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you calling me a shill?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>wow you are creepy you went through a years worth of my history?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I viewed your profile, sorted by Controversial, and it is the third most controversial comment you&#39;ve ever made. I spent less than a minute finding it. But you immediately assume I just read <em>years</em> of your history in just a short time. You see how you&#39;re not thinking very rationally? You&#39;re very quick to jump to these extremities of paranoia. </p>

<p>Edit: You&#39;ve also got a tremendously bad habit of calling people shills. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This happened to me, just last night, but the funny thing is that the user who was in turn shadow banned, <a href="/u/LaughingatIdiotz">/u/LaughingatIdiotz</a>, was supporting Flat Earth Theory. When I opposed it, he downvoted every post I&#39;d made over the last week or so. Three times. Within minutes of eachother. I reported him to Admins, he was shadowbanned within an hour or so. </p>

<p>You&#39;d think those &#39;robot accounts&#39; would be after, ya know, the <em>legitimate conspiracies</em>. But no. There are shills on all sides here, and even those people who fear the legitimate theories getting traction are supporting the crazy, illegitimate theories. Because they make <em>all the real stuff look worse for wear.</em> They also distract the scientifically-minded from paying attention to more legitimate topics, because they serve as low-hanging-fruit to debunk. </p>

<p>OP here, he&#39;s another Flat Earther. He&#39;s trying to distract people by spinning everyone around. He&#39;s directing people to downvoted posts <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/OurJesuitPaymasters/submitted/">because many of them are his own.</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish more people used the Report function. When someone calls you a shill, it&#39;s a blatant violation of Rule #10. </p>

<p>Calling someone a shill is meaningless, except to derail the argument. The most shilly of them all would be the person who goes about asserting everyone is a shill, for they would derail the most conversations by doing so. </p>

<p>Alleging someone is a shill is a 100% unprovable allegation. Further, it&#39;s irrefutable: I can&#39;t prove I&#39;m <em>not</em>. I&#39;d love to hear ideas on how I could. For this reason, Rule #10 exists. Declaring someone is a shill is the biggest detriment you can do to a discussion in this subreddit. It serves no positive function, at all.</p>

The fact that you feel the need to try to silence opposition rather than discuss the points coherently shows your true face.  So does deleting posts that refute your ideas rather than discussing or disproving them openly.</p>

<p>There is no need for shills when you&#39;re opposing an overwhelming majority of observant, educated people, its odd you can&#39;t understand that.  But then again it seems you don&#39;t understand the definition of the term.</p>

<p>I tagged him &#39;Psyops&#39;. That&#39;s the most generous assumption I can make of him: He himself is the shill here, trying to lead people down the wrong trails so they&#39;re not busy discussing those crimes which are legitimate and real. He&#39;d rather offer the low-hanging fruit of &#39;the world is flat!&#39; to keep those scientific-oriented folks among us busy debunking that silly theory, rather than apply that rationality elsewhere and discussing the real issues of the day such as terrorism and world banking. </p>

<p>It&#39;s either that or he&#39;s without a doubt the dumbest single person alive that I&#39;ve ever encountered. Again, I really hesitate to call him a shill – I fucking hate it – but he&#39;s already gone off the rails, and I&#39;m saying that is the most generous thing I could assume of him. </p>

<p>It might be more likely that he&#39;s just incredibly paranoid and stupid, but for someone that paranoid, he sure seems to be totally okay with running his little campaigns on the internet. Does paranoia really lend itself to his kind of tenacity? </p>
