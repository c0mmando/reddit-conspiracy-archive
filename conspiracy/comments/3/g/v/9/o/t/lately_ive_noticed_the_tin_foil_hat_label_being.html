       No, I don't think that they ban if you call someone a shill and if they obviously seem like a shill. lol. I've seen others call people shills and I've indirectly said it, but nothing has happened. So iono.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see what you mean though, but it's probably just because the shills get all crazy about it when they get accused and cry out to be protected.

       Being called a shill is definitely not a banned action. There are entire posts dedicated to Reddit shills and I've personally been called one before. Also, if you're being called a tin foil hatter by conspiracy theorists, you're probably really fucked up.

       You don't have to use the label "shill".  It lacks nuance anyway.  I just encourage people to take a look at the post history of the person I am calling out so that they can judge for themselves what that person's motivation is.

       You decided you needed to make a new post just for this?  Is there anything specific in my post history that you think means I am a 'bullshit artist'?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think I am here to disrupt?  Is it because questioning the shape of the earth is so ridiculous that I must be?  Have you actually looked for yourself at the arguments being made on the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I've stated previously, the standard flat earth model being proposed doesn't work.  But the topic does pose some problems with the official spinning globe model.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps you should branch out a little bit from 9/11, there is a lot more going on out there.  9/11 is just a small piece of a much larger picture.  Investigating NASA is a prerequisite to thinking about the shape of the earth.  If you believe them, then obviously we are on a spinning globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me ask you, do you believe that NASA engages in fraud or do you believe the material they produce to be genuine?  Do you think man has landed on the moon?

       I'm really not aiming to disrupt.  I'm curious to know what topics you have researched and what your point of view is on them.  As I said, 9/11 is a single event that should be viewed in a much larger context.

       Would you mind answering the questions I asked:  Do you believe that NASA engages in fraud or do you believe the material they produce to be genuine? Do you think man has landed on the moon?

       Stick to the topic, you're here to disrupt and can't form a coherent retort against those who call your flat earth nonsense out.

       We could discuss the topic of the shape of the earth specifically, but I don't think you are in a place where you can consider actual arguments.  You made this statement in your new thread:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        No verifiable facts are ever reported.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That is just patently untrue.  There are actually a huge number of points to consider on the topic.  Try thinking about it this way:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.  - Aristotle
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You don't have to get so mad and defensive just because someone is bringing up a topic to discuss it.  The only thing to fear is that your own mind might get changed.  The real topic we are discussing here is human psychology.  People resist looking at things because they don't want their world view to change.  You can see this with 9/11.  Surely any thinking person who takes even the most cursory look at the evidence regarding 9/11 would know that the official story is bullshit.  But then they are faced with answering the question of why it was done and that can be very uncomfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you actually want to look, I can provide you with points to consider on the topic of the shape of the earth.  I should note that my own position on the matter is that the standard flat earth model does not work.  So I am not arguing for it.  But in the topic I have seen enough that my current opinion is that the official spinning globe model does not work either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you want me to provide you with things to consider or would you rather not look?

       So you've posted this on the other thread:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        still waiting for verifiable evidence from those claiming to believe flat-earth. No proof or evidence in 26 comments yet. Who will be the first flat-earther to show their work?

       And yet you don't respond when I ask you "Do you want me to provide you with things to consider or would you rather not look?"

       I wouldn't call that stalking you through multiple threads.  You decided to call me out as disinfo, then made a new thread to talk about how anyone who talks about the shape of the earth must be disinfo.  You refuse to engage me in any actual conversation when I asked you about your thoughts on other topics.

       The very idea that people speaking about the subject are here to "disrupt" this sub shows your lack of perspective.  This subreddit is a very small part of one website, there is a lot more internet out there.
