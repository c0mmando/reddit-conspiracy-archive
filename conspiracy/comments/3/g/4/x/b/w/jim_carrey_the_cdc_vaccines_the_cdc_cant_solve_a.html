       Follow Jim Carrey as he transforms from talented actor and comedian to conscious voice for medical choice. With 15 million Twitter followers, Carrey has become a major threat to pharmaceutical corporations attempting to influence the politics and truth around medical freedom and vaccine safety. However, it appears Carrey has been on target all along with Congressman Bill Posey's

       This is very similar to the history of [
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis%5D(Semmelweis)">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis](Semmelweis)
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who do not know, Semmelweis discovered that women who came to hospitals for childbirth were dying of "childbed fever" at incredible rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       He tested and found a solution: Surgeons to wash their hands between births.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because this would have forced a lot of doctors to face the fact that they had been killing women by telling them to come to the "experts" in the hospital for their births, Semmelweis had to be destroyed, destroyed, destroyed.  He was literally driven out of medicine, and into an insane asylum.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is playing out again.

       Semmelweis is equivalent to the brave expert doctors today who work around the clock trying to warn of the dangers of vaccines, such as
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oYAVLDyR6Y">
        Dr Tenpenny
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFQQOv-Oi6U">
        Dr Humphries
       </a>
       and the outstanding doctors who attend
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW_3ykt68GF9dmOyus-OeXw">
        The Vaccine Safety Conference
       </a>
       and give presentations on their latest groundbreaking research on the dangers of vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's hope we don't have to wait another 100 years for this vaccine madness to be stopped, we know that powerful people are trying to protect their reputations, the same problem which Semmelweis battled back in the 1800's.  The system profits from vaccine damage, drug sales would be cut down to a quarter of their current size if vaccines were stopped, as there would be nowhere near as many autoimmune disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really hope that something can be done within the next 10 years to put an end to all of the unnecessary vaccine-induced death and disability.  Will we get to see this in our lifetime?  The big danger is if Pharma manage to force vaccines for all, as then there will be no control left in the study, to show that the unvaccinated are far healthier than the vaccinated, this is of course the true reason why Pharma push to take away your freedoms, because your healthy unvaccinated child is proof of Pharma's crimes against humanity.

       With a few difference:
      </p>
      <p>
       Semmelweis was a trained doctor and based his suggestions off of actual evidence. Jim Carrey is an actor and is basing his view off of anecdotes and feelings.

      <p>
       Semmelweis was found to be correct. jim Carry's assertions about vaccines have not- despite numerous studies looking to find a link- any link- between vaccines and autism.

       Did you know Semmelweis was not proven correct for a hundred years?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots more women were allowed to die.  Basically, the people whose reputations mattered when Semmelweis was alive had to all die off, along with their immediate heirs, before it could be corrected.  Whether he was a doctor, or correct, or anything else, didn't seem to matter as much as the continued legacy of the Important People of the time.

       I think it's playing out again.

       Edit: Also, a doctor is just a person with papers that a bunch of other people with papers decided should be given papers.  There are surely a few geniuses, but doctors don't become magical angels when they get their diploma.  They are still human beings subject to all the sins of vanity, pride, greed, etc, that the rest of us are subject to.
      </p>
      <p>
       And worse, as bureaucracy grows, geniuses get filtered out, and the whole system becomes one of past-worship and inertia.

       i don't have a link but my understanding is that it's not even a concern about direct autism connection, but because of controlling genes that get passed on to your child, two vaccinated people have a much higher likelihood of having an autistic child. they are suppressing information about these same compounds and how they relate to cancer cures. it's called "GCMAF" and there are many threads about it here on this subreddit.

       I think it is very healthy and necessary to continue debating all medical practices. However for me the fundamental issue comes down to the fundamental human right to control what goes into my body, or the bodies of those under my care.

       Also, for example, how are the long term effects of the flu shot on humans tested when it is a new version each year? I'm very skeptical of this idea that giant pharmaceutical corporations and governments are infallible and only have our best interests at heart.

       That article is related to a specific type of vaccine. I hadn't seen it yet, but once I have more time I'll give it a good in-depth read. (A cursory glance at their charts makes something in the "that don't quite look right" part of my brain tingle, however.)

       edit: So looking into it, the study was funded by a "right to life" a.k.a. anti-abortion group and allegedly found that

       That would be Tylenol- not the vaccine- that shows that potential effect.

       It's the combination of Tylenol aka Paracetamol and the vaccine, keep in mind the CDC recommends taking Tylenol with the vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tylenol suppresses the immune system, then the recipient is injected with 3 live viruses (MMR), Measles, Mumps and Rubella, this is a recipe for hell, even at the best of times, never mind when then immune system virtually switched off.

       Same paper finds no increased risk with aspirin.
      </p>
      <p>
       So:
      </p>
      <p>
       vaccine + tylenol: increased risk
      </p>
      <p>
       vaccine + aspirin: no increased risk
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems the takeaway here should be "don't give children tylenol" not "don't vaccinate."

       It's the combination of MMR and Tylenol, the two together, not just Tylenol on it's own, parents don't report of their child regressing into Autism after Tylenol, it's after MMR, and it's the children who are on Tylenol who it's happening to.  The health agencies are recommending to parents to give Tylenol with vaccines, this recommendation needs to be stopped and instead turned into a warning given out by every doctor.  No child on Tylenol should be vaccinated, easier still just ban Tylenol all together, it's given us the biggest liver transplant list of all time.  It almost got banned a few years back, it's not a safe product to have on the market.

       And they don't even use real controls in their studies, just comparing with other vaccines, incredibly weak science, vaccine science wouldn't get through high school science exams.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other huge problem with their so-called science is that they don't follow up for mid or long-term after vaccination, instead they just check if the recipient is OK for a few days, while an autoimmune disease can take 2 months or a year to appear post-vaccination, that's not going to show in their 3 day study.  If a vaccine recipient dies after vaccination they often strike them off as 'coincidence', removing them from the study, so as the vaccine still gets to market with no history of the vaccine-induced death.

       Many countries have found the link, it's just the mainstream media won't talk about it and as you've seen it's been admitted that the CDC threw all the studies which proved vaccines cause Autism into the bin.  Keep in mind the CDC used to freely admit that vaccines could cause Autism, it didn't used to be a secret, and then the cover-up began.

       Its such an easy argument to win. By dismissing mainstream media, all government research and frankly any research that you disagree with you don't even have to think. You can really on shitty blogs set up to push a single agenda. We can't have a discussion on this. I refuse to believe people who are not qualified and you think everything is a coverup.

       The data is available- just look at vaccination rates, compare it to autism rates. If autism rates go up as vaccination rates go up- then we have something to look closer at. If not, well...

       Sadly -- and in all seriousness -- it's become all too easy for critics to be silenced, nowadays (especially in the wake of social media).
      </p>
      <p>
       Carrey is already viewed as being "crazy" by a large portion of the public, so all that they would need to do is to get one or two people to publicly announce allegations of impropriety or other highly questionable/unethical/criminal behavior against him...and then sit back and watch the masses tear him apart, until he is driven out of the public eye, in one way or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       [Just to clarify: I am not implying that every one of the scandals involving public figures is contrived -- just that it is a tactic that would very likely be successful.]
      </p>
      <p>
       Since he has struggled with depression and other issues, in the past, my feeling is that his opposers might attempt such a further assassination of his character (thus potentially causing him to experience a mental breakdown, of sorts), first. However, you may be right: They could likely just have him "killed under mysterious circumstances", as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a sick world that we're currently living in, I guess. :(

       The CDC is a genocidal machine that has withheld the truth about vaccinations, chemtrails and diseases like Lyme and Morgellons for too long for the benefit of Big Pharma. Vaccines are murder, we have to get the word out. If I were in charge Tom Frieden would be tried and prosecuted as the war criminal and DOG that he is.

       I can't watch the video, but I can say the CDC is quite upfront about the shortcomings of vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, this idealized vision of perfect vaccines solving all disease does not come directly from the CDC, which (even if you ultimately disagree with their conclusions), certainly doesn't sugar-coat how inefficient and unnecessary vaccines are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to it's scientific nature you have to read between the lines and estimate a bit of math, but ultimately the informed reader will come away with the strong impression of "I should not give my child at
       <em>
        least
       </em>
       half of these vaccines".
      </p>
      <p>
       The CDC is a great source for converting rabid pro-vaccination sorts if only you do your research to share with them properly.

       The son of one of Jim Carrey's ex-girlfriends is autistic, and they used to be extremely close, it appears. I believe that this is (at least a part of) the reason why he is now speaking out about safety issues related to vaccines.

       He also has skits where he makes fun of the illuminati that is a agenda a lot of people are made to do to make it sound crazy. If he wasn't in the club he would get his career ruined for doing such things. Just because he's talking about vaccines don't be fooled

       I do biomedical research for a living. It is funded by the US government. I assure you, we are not making chemical weapons. Please find some better sources. There are fights that need to be fought, this is not one of them. Big pharma is big business, but their ability to cover up research is a lot weaker than you may believe, especially with vaccines. Vaccines make almost no money compared to antidepressants, cancer drugs, diabetes drugs, heart medications, etc. Seriously, think about it. They are super cheap compared to most drugs and you only need them once! Big pharma could stop producing vaccines tomorrow and see no dent in their profits. Stop making Valium and it would be a different story.

       Vaccines are making big money, Flu vaccine takes over $1 Billion per annum, as does the HPV jab, vaccines are also a growth sector with a huge predicted growth over the next 10 years, the pharmaceuticals are protected from being sued when their vaccines go wrong, that means there's no risk for them so vaccines are the direction of choice for the industry.  This is the reason they want your freedom of choice removed, as they don't want you avoiding their toxic jabs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, the vaccine sales are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to money, the real money is in the lifelong vaccine-induced autoimmune diseases which make you into a Big Pharma customer for life, dependent on treating your vaccine-induced symptoms with their expensive drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the reality is rather disturbing when you think about it, but that's what money does, people profit from war too, from selling weapons and then rebuilding the countries they profited from destroying.  When you think about that it shouldn't be too much of a surprise to realize that people are also profiting from intentionally inducing disease, as the science shows.

       have deafness, long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness, and or permanent brain damage.

       Here is some more mild stuff, again,
       <em>

       : 
Seizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (about 1 out of 3,000 doses)

       Temporary pain and stiffness in the joints, mostly in teenage or adult women (up to 1 out of 4)
       <br/>
       Temporary low platelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder (about 1 out of 30,000 doses)

       Again, it's not about giving YOU autism. It's about the fact there is a ton of science proving they inhibit genes you PASS ON TO YOUR CHILD, so if two people have certain vaccines that inhibit the compound GCMAF, its more likely their child may have autism.
