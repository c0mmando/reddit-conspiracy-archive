      <h2>
       I just read this post in another thread and wanted to repost here to see what
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       makes of this. Are there any plastic experts or scientists here out of the 330,000 users? So Los Angles County just dumped 96 million black plastic balls in the open air water reservoirs around LA. So far, they have been in the water in other reservoirs for at least 6 years. Most people in LA have no idea about this when you ask them. So war about 90% of the college educated professionals and locals had no idea. Some of the staff at Orange Products who make the plastic HDPE balls don't even know that these are going in drinking water for 5 years. LA county just dumped a few more million. Clip from yesterday:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YGQGn-u8lM&amp;feature=youtu.be">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YGQGn-u8lM&amp;feature=youtu.be
       </a>
       . Many people around the world have the question will these 96 million plastic High-density polyethylene balls break down in the sun over 5 years? If so, besides synthetic estrogen created, what other health effects would the people drinking the water experience? We know that synthetic estrogen in women increases breast cancer, and extra estrogen in men can effect their behavior and children's grown. RT NEWS covered this yesterday:
       <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/312219-shade-balls-california-drought/">
        https://www.rt.com/usa/312219-shade-balls-california-drought/
       </a>
       . To top off the list of shady things with this story, 6 years ago they put the balls in the water to "stop a chemical process" or to "stop bird waste". Now the county is saying "they are doing this because of the drought". So which one is the real reason at this point? Watch what you drink.

       I saw a blurb on the news this morning about the balls. It made no sense to me that they would be black instead of white if they were used to prevent evaporation... Black absorbs sunlight and heat and it makes sense now.

       The black is from carbon pigment added to stabilize the plastic from the degrading effects of UV light.

       And hot balls surely give off more chemicals/decompose more quickly. I'm not very conspiracy minded or whatnot, but it seems really dumb that they aren't white....

       Maybe they don't come in white.  Most plastic doesn't. You might have noticed that your computer case started out light gray, but over the years turned darker and yellowish. That's why most cases come dyed black now, so you won't get the color change. They probably got the dark colored balls so over the years they wouldn't look dirtier and dirtier and more disgusting and freak people out. So they decided on something that didn't look bad, without considering if they leached out harmful chemicals.
      </p>

       I just posted an article today about how DuPont has been hiding, for decades, how toxic many of their products are.
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3gqj0j/dupont_has_knowingly_poisoned_us_for_decades_for/">

       So the people who choose them might have had no idea they might be toxic.

       The thing that doesn't make any sense to me is that the balls are black.  If you wanted to reflect the energy from the sun, then you would be using white balls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if they are using an IR reflective pigment (very expensive), white would still be the optimal choice.

       You are right. But it is still the same that white are indoor and black are outdoor and HDPE is a Food safe product. Think the Blue drums FDA aproved.

       I'm not sure how I feel about HDPE but if I recall correctly I thought it was considered pretty stable and food safe, and is commonly used in food production eg. greenhouses, farms, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do totally get that just because it's considered food safe doesn't mean that it actually is; it may be for example that most of the studies over the years focused on new HDPE and not HDPE exposed to chlorinated water in the sunlight for long periods of time. It's good to question things,

       I suppose that's why there are papers written on degradation of HDPE in exposure to heat and UV radiation?
       <a href="http://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/41165(397)211">

      <p>
       (pdf link below - who uses parentheses in urls anyway, jeez)
      </p>
      <p>
       HDPE geomembranes have low puncture resistance and low multi-axial extensibility, and are therefore, considered to  be disadvantageous in applications  where these properties are desirable, for example, in landfill cover applications (Simpson and Siebken 1997; Scheirs 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Exposed geomembranes  are highly susceptible to degradation by  UV, oxidative, and thermal mechanisms
       </strong>
       (Koerner et al. 1990, 2005). At a given time, more  than one degradation mechanism  can  take place and the resulting
       <strong>
        synergistic effects can accelerate the degradation
       </strong>
       processes. Of the degradation  mechanisms, UV degradation is the  most harmful for an exposed geomembrane (Qureshi et al. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Suits and Hsuan (2003), photons with similar or higher energy than the energy  of the polymer chemical bonds cause a series of reactions to polymers that are exposed to sunlight  and liberate free radicals which cause bond scission in the polymeric structure  and  eventually  makes  the polymer brittle and susceptible to environmental stress cracking. For instance, the chemical bond strengths  of C-C and C-H bonds are 420 and 340 kJ/mol, respectively. On the other hand, the energies of 300 and 400 nm  photons (in the UV range) are 390 and 300 kJ/mol, respectively (Suits and Hsuan 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Therefore, UV radiation has adequate energy to break the polymer bonds.
       </strong>
       To retard the UV degradation, carbon black or other chemical-based light  stabilizers are normally  added to a polymeric geomembrane.  However,
       <strong>
        the stabilizers in the geomembrane are depleted with increasing exposure time.
       </strong>

       I mean these shade ball postings seem to be stirring up a new rage on the internet. Why would casual users go into a raging frenzy over these... it's clear to most people that black balls in the sun for 5 years are not a healthy idea.

       No I have met people with access to the water pits. They have brought back the HJPE plastic balls and you can see over time they wear down like if you leave an HDPE piece of trash in the water for 5 years it breaks down in the water. Bad stuff.

        They want the balls to absorb the heat, not reflect it. The balls likely have a higher specific heat than water. Meaning they will absorb more heat and stay cooler than water would. This means less heat to evaporate water.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That makes absolutely zero sense.  I make my living working with polymers.  If your goal is to prevent water from evaporating, then you would want to introduce as little heat as possible to the water, thus why you would not want them to absorb heat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the conductance of heat from the water to the plastic balls would not be dependent on the color.

       I posted a few hours ago a very similar link on this.  Some of the articles I read are that they are concerned about bromide which is created when chlorine and bromine are combined together and exposed to sunlight.  These articles say the balls are to cut the light out to control the bromide since bromine is a naturally occurring element and chlorine is used to disinfect the water.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Swapped bromine with bromide and bromide with bromine.

       They went and bought 96 million balls. You know they charged at least a dollar a ball. They couldve used a fraction of that money and just tarped it with something clever. Instead, they dump a bunch of black plastic balls right into the water supply. In the california sun. Are you fucking kidding me? Is this why Bruce Jenner is Caitlyn now? This is just absolutely ridiculous and pure evil. Pay no heed to their bullshit, these black balls are out to cause some serious damage to the populace. Black plastic with sunlight is a no no in the agriculture industry and I'm not just taking these money worshipping assholes' word for it when it comes to the safety of what theyve invested in.

       Black plastic breaks down and leeches chemicals into water and soil. Thats why they dont use black plastic for reserviors, hats why they dont use black plastic nursery pots outside, they use clear and blue food safe plastic and they use cloth pots or nursery beds. Black plastic is cheap and it is to be avoided where heat and water are concerned. Ask any horticulturalist. Fuck your strawberries.

       They charged a dollar a ball because the guy selling them probably lobbied for the purchase of them in the first place, the government doesnt give a shit how much things cost, and the seller knows it.

       BRO THEYRE PUTTING FUCKING BLACK PLASTIC BALLS INTO THE WATER SUPPLY IN BROAD SUNLIGHT, THATS SO FUCKING STUPID IT HURTS. AND THEN YOURE GOING TO TAKE THEIR DUMB ASS WORD FOR IT ON ITS SAFETY?! HOW FUCKING SLOW CAN YOU BE????
      </p>
      <p>
       LIKE, FORGET ABOUT THE DEGRADATION FOR A SECOND AND LOOK AT THE SOLUTION THEYVE COME UP WITH. IT COULDNT BE ANY MORE RIDICULOUSLY RETARDED IF THEY TRIED TO. AND YOU VEHEMENTLY DEFEND IT LIKE YOU CAME UP WITH IT. YOURE A FUCKING MORON.
      </p>
      <p>
       YOU NEED A SOURCE TO KNOW THAT PLASTIC AND SUNLIGHT DONT MIX, WHAT YOU REALLY NEED IS SOME GODAMNED SENSE.

       Im gonna go ahead and go with the scientific consensus and not the man wearing a tin hat typing IN ALL CAPITALS. Do you even know the purpose? Its to reduce evaporation
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       to stop algae from growing in the reservoirs. Yes, the plastic is safe, and no it will not cause more evaporation. Hot water does not evaporate until it gets hot enough, which it wont do, even with these
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       this lowers the surface area for water to evaporate from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, some plastics like BPA don't mix with water and sun, but we run most of our water through PVC and we're fine. HDPE plastic is perfectly safe in temperatures up to 260 degrees before it even begins to think about degradation. On top of that, California has some of the strictest water standards in the country, if there was anything dangerous in the water it would be shut down before your dog could take a shit. Please, do tell me a solution that will save 300
       <em>
        billion
       </em>
       with a
       <strong>
        B
       </strong>
       gallons of water from evaporating and prevent algae from growing in the drinking water.

       Cool man, they found a way to put black plastic in the water supply and for you to be cool with it. Have fun being gullible as shit. There are a million other ways to prevent algae, this is the first Ive seen black plastic balls as the solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want a solution? I dont know, maybe a cover or tarp of some sort? Are you seriously saying trillions of black plastic balls are the most logical solution here? Seriously? Because if so youre not very smart and youre going to have to stop replying to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       WTF do you suppose they plan on doing with all of those balls once theyre done with them? Looks like a bunch of manufactured garbage. Instead of making one thing, they broke it down into billions of little things. That's always the right direction isnt it? Its so fucking stupid I cant even keep clowning on it. With a stable cap or covering, nothing gets into the water at all. Little plastic balls? Everything under the sun. Doesnt matter, no algae I guess.

       Ok LA gets hail now. Either way, you know what prevents algae? Darkness. That's it. That's all it takes. Darkness. Algae needs sunlight to grow just like any other plant. Any shade will stop algae, you dont need 35 million dollars worth of plastic balls. Whoever got rich as fuck off of this is laughing at you right now.

       Your "Suggestion" is not scaleable, it can not be retracted or expanded with increasing water levels, which happens in reservoirs at a much higher level, unlike dams and ponds which are generally stable throughout the year. They started worrying about algae now because of new water standards. You have a lot of confidence in yourself for someone that I assume hasn't talked to a legitimate friend in days, because of your schizophrenia. I also suggest that you learn to reply ones to a comment instead of staying up all night replying to the same comment over and over when you realize "hey, I might be wrong! Lets just bombard this guy with half assed suggestions and personal attacks to try to prove my point"

       Come to think of it, the shade balls were rolling in for a while before they hit water. That tells me the water level is low. What happens when it fills up again? The balls will then be covering only the center while the rest is uncovered as it fills in. Better get more shade balls. When does it end? How in the hell do those reserviors get filled to where they are by the falling rainwater directly above it alone? Surely it comes from other places... And what did they do to prevent algae before shade balls happened last week? Why did it take them this long to care about algae prevention?

       Yes, youre going to want to get them to stop chemtrailing the fuck out of the west coast so that the rain can go back to normal. Until then all the little black plastic balls in the world wont stop the evaporation. And quit being so goddamned gullible, defensive and stupid while youre at it.

       Because you know damned well that's not water but you deny it so you can sleep at night hoping it magically goes away. Its not going away because youre too busy denying it. The more people that face reality and realize what it truly is and whats truly going on the sooner itll stop. Meanwhile theyre killing the nation's food supply so we can get to be dependent on someone else.

       Can anyone find some postings and publications showing the formulaic breakdown of black HDPE plastic in the sun over 5 years? I can't find it - maybe it doesn't exist.

       This may be, but it still goes thru a water treatment center first. So most of the bad would be filtered out, and plus I'd be more worried about parasites in the water, last I heard it was a bad idea to drink LA water.

       Second, so much plastic trown out in nature.. makes me think theres a company that needed to get rid of useless matterials that they probably weren't allowed to dump elsewhere anyway.

       Just because you can afford to sit on your butt on a cruise ship watching TV all day doesn't mean people in LA know that their water is being polluted by HDPE plastic balls that release estrogen activators and other known carcinogens into the water.

       What if they put the balls in there to absorb sunlight and heat so water doesn't evaporate, and they change the balls out before the sun has enough time to break them down? Highly doubt they are going to leave these things there for years and years. (edit: looks like they will be changed after 10 years. Seeing as I don't know how long these take to break down, I can't comment on whether that is too long or not)
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, are there sources that indicate how long these take to break down and what compounds they break down to, or are you just assuming?

       The balls have been in there for 5+ years and no one at any level is publishing the effects of the HDPE breakdown. "Sounds like a good idea"... are you an engineer or scientist? The idea sounds like someone that spent too much time in a McDonalds ball pit.

       What you've linked talks about how long it takes biodegradable plastic to completely decompose. For plastic to enter the water, it doesn't have to completely decompose only partly before it could become harmful.

       This is not a question of "preventing evaporation" this is a question of a county perpetuating chemical warfare against a USA civilian population. This entire act is no less than criminal. There are already people talking about filing a class action.

       Right let's unleash chemical warfare against our citizens with playpen balls.  We'll leave the evidence to float around for 10 years and have our city officials dump 'em in so that we can forgo all deniability once Satoshiforpresident uncovers the plot.  Brilliant.

       The black UV protection is discussed and they address how the increase in temperature is outweighed by the excellent UV protection of the carbon black.
      </p>
      <p>
       UV is what degrades HDPE so protection against those frequencies should eliminate the theat.

       I'm not sure how I feel about HDPE but if I recall correctly I thought it was considered pretty stable and food safe, and is commonly used in food production eg. greenhouses, farms, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do totally get that just because it's considered food safe doesn't mean that it actually is; it may be for example that most of the studies over the years focused on new HDPE and not HDPE exposed to chlorinated water in the sunlight for long periods of time. It's good to question things,

       Your "Suggestion" is not scaleable, it can not be retracted or expanded with increasing water levels, which happens in reservoirs at a much higher level, unlike dams and ponds which are generally stable throughout the year. They started worrying about algae now because of new water standards. You have a lot of confidence in yourself for someone that I assume hasn't talked to a legitimate friend in days, because of your schizophrenia. I also suggest that you learn to reply ones to a comment instead of staying up all night replying to the same comment over and over when you realize "hey, I might be wrong! Lets just bombard this guy with half assed suggestions and personal attacks to try to prove my point"
