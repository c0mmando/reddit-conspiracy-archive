    <div class="md"><p>Nowhere will that stench be greater than on the cable MSM news media outlets. CNN, MSNBC, Fox &quot;News&quot; and the like will be on full time 9/11 official story review making sure the story stays the same through out the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Even the History channel and the Discovery channel will be employed to air propaganda that will reinforce the brainwash in their viewing audience as well. Gut wrenching stench indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 is a red herring at this point.  Everyone who is open to questioning the media knows it was BS, which is probably the majority of the population at this point.  But aside from knowing it was BS and possibly having evidence implicating Cheney or some other small players, the deed is done, and the evidence is long ago burned.  The people who actually masterminded 9/11 got off scot free, and by now their trail must be completely erased, making it literally impossible to actually prove the guilt of the 9/11 top orchestrators.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, TPTB have done a lot of other really fucked up shit in the 15 years since, but everything is commonly overlooked in favor of 9/11.  It might be the most disturbing conspiracy, but at this point it actually steals focus away from more current crimes have not been so thoroughly covered up as 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your username and comment history show a clear theme of 9/11.  The majority of your energy on reddit seems to be promoting 9/11 truth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile very little discussion is given to the illegal campaign of global murder by drones, nuclear re-armament, propaganda campaigns promoting wars with Iran, China, and Russia, bankruptcy of Purto Rico and the plunder of that US colony to come, ongoing US efforts to destabilize regions and overthrow leaders in countries across the globe and replace them with non-democratic regimes, US military support of war crimes in ever country in which we bring about a &#39;regime change&#39;, the loss of civil rights--very notably the right a fair trial which is voided by the NDAA, child sex scandals in the governments of the US and UK, abuses of central banks and the IMF, etc.</p>

<p>I suppose I just feel that 9/11 truth is given a disproportionate amount of time and energy by the people here.  I&#39;m not optimistic that he 9/11 truth movement will accomplish much more than it already has, whereas attention given to these other current subjects might actually help to bring about change and end some of these abuses.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been shining a very bright light on 9/11 truth for 15 years now.  There&#39;s other shit I&#39;d prefer to shine that light on at this point.  There has been no official government policy changes made in response to 9/11 truth.  Perhaps the might actually be some change in these other arenas if they were given the same attention to raise awareness as we do for 9/11.</p>

<p>Rather than convince strangers to stop their passions, stop bitching and be the change you want.</p>

<p>You wrote 4 paragraphs and mainly said 911 is talked about too much while not spending much time at all on your abuses of the government.</p>

<p>Be the change you desire.</p>
