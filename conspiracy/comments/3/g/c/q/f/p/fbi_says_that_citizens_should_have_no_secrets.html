        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/050653_police_state_national_security_FBI.html">Source</a></p>

<p>The police and surveillance state predicted in the forward-looking 1940s classic &quot;1984&quot; by George Orwell, has slowly, but steadily, come to fruition. However, like a frog sitting idly in a pan of steadily-warming water, too many Americans still seem unaware that the slow boil of big government is killing their constitutional liberties.</p>

<p>The latest sign of this stealth takeover of civil rights and freedom was epitomized in recent Senate testimony by FBI Director James Comey, who voiced his objections to civilian use of encryption to protect personal data – information the government has no automatic right to obtain.</p>

<p>As reported by The New American, Comey testified that he believes the government&#39;s spy and law enforcement agencies should have unfettered access to everything Americans may store or send in electronic format: On computer hard drives, in so-called i-clouds, in email and in text messaging – for our own safety and protection. Like many in government today, Comey believes that national security is more important than constitutional privacy protections or, apparently, due process. After all, aren&#39;t criminals the only ones who really have anything to hide?</p>

<p>In testimony before a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee entitled &quot;Going Dark: Encryption, Technology, and the Balance Between Public Safety and Privacy&quot; Comey said that in order to stay one step ahead of terrorists, as well as international and domestic criminals, Uncle Sam&#39;s various spy and law enforcement agencies should have access to available technology used to de-encrypt protected data. Also, he believes the government should be the final arbiter deciding when decryption is necessary.</p>

<p>What could go wrong there?</p>

<h2>Government, at all levels, is responsible</h2>

<p>During the hearing, TNA reported, technology experts warned the panel that giving the FBI limitless access to the personal electronic data of Americans would open it up to exploitation by &quot;bad actors.&quot; But Comey was having none of that.</p>

<p>&quot;It is clear that governments across the world, including those of our closest allies, recognize the serious public safety risks if criminals can plan and undertake illegal acts without fear of detection,&quot; he told the committee.</p>

<p>&quot;Are we comfortable with technical design decisions that result in barriers to obtaining evidence of a crime?&quot;</p>

<p>So, in essence, Comey – like many before him, especially since the global war on terror was launched – believes that, in the name of national security Americans ought to give up more of their individual and constitutional rights because that&#39;s the only way we can be adequately protected.</p>

<p>Perhaps realizing that his Senate hearing testimony was public, Comey gave the Constitution a passing glance, noting that the government should respect the &quot;requirements and safeguards of the laws&quot; and the country&#39;s founding document. However, as Americans now know, spy agencies during the past two presidential administrations have been tasked increasingly with conducting warrantless, unchecked surveillance of Americans&#39; electronic data and communications.</p>

<p>But all of this is not on men like Comey and Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Congress bears its share of responsibility, too.</p>

<h2>This is the way it is – shut up and take it</h2>

<p>When such activities of the National Security Agency were exposed in 2013 by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, many in the media and among the American electorate were quick to blame the agency, as if it was somehow acting out of rogue instinct.</p>

<p>The reality is, however, that the agency is tasked to perform its duties– either by statutory law (think the USA Patriot Act) or by presidential directive (think Bush&#39;s order after 9/11 to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/bush-lets-us-spy-on-callers-without-courts.html?_r=1">conduct warrantless surveillance</a>).</p>

<p>&quot;We are not asking to expand the government&#39;s surveillance authority, but rather we are asking to ensure that we can continue to obtain electronic information and evidence pursuant to the legal authority that Congress has provided to us to keep America safe,&quot; Comey said during the Senate hearing.</p>

<p>What does all this mean? It simply means that at every level, government considers its own citizens hostile.</p>

<p>Oh, and <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/039307_Supreme_Court_surveillance_government.html">there&#39;s nothing we can do about it</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Only when enough people have had enough. When enough people are willing to put aside their own differences and stand to a ruling class of the few. Only when people realize the dream has become a nightmare. But to many people are deluded with entertainment and petty issues to see we need a huge change. Until we get a tipping point where a large enough amount of people are willing to get upset there is almost no point. What we can do is inform people who don&#39;t know and try and help them see that this is all a show to keep us distracted while they rape and pillage us while we are hypnotised with flag issues and who is marrying who.</p>

<p>The Euro is currently falling apart, and it won&#39;t be long until the rest of western civilization starts feeling the effects. This is part of a global sovereign debt crisis that&#39;s been brewing ever since transactional banking replaced relationship banking. The worse things get the easier it will be to wake people up, and the harder it will be for politicians to lie.</p>

<p>This process is called creative destruction, it&#39;s why the free market works. The systems the statist&#39; build destroy themselves eventually, they want to control and manipulate everything because they are afraid, but it&#39;s a self fulfilling prophecy. Their fear propels them to seek power, they have no faith in their fellow human beings.</p>

<p>You have to tear down old systems to make room for new ones. The free market is like the force (star wars).</p>

<p>Think of the free market as the alpha predator, who always wins in the end no matter how bad things get (even if it means humanity has to be destroyed). That&#39;s how intelligent life evolves, the universe is designed for intelligent life to spread throughout it. We were meant to reach for the stars, it&#39;s our destiny. If we just let go and trust in our fellow man, we&#39;ll make it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the difference between direction taxation and consumption taxes. Income tax is a direct manipulation of private society by government, while sales tax are simply the modern equivalent of paying respect to your tribal elders (the society you live in).</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>why do we have to elect one of these idiots?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because nobody knows what&#39;s going on, it&#39;s all based on Keynesian economics. Well guess what, here&#39;s what John Maynard Keynes said on his death bed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just before his death in 1946, Keynes told Henry Clay, a professor of Social Economics and Adviser to the Bank of England that he hoped that Adam Smith’s “Invisible Hand” would help Britain out of the economic hole it is in: “I find myself more and more relying for a solution of our problems on the invisible hand which I tried to eject from economic thinking twenty years ago.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keynes had too much faith in the government to understand what they were doing, once they got a taste for interventionist policy making they were hooked. This is why career politicians should be outlawed, they have no real world experience and they are easily corrupted. Reddit is right when they point out that congress is the real problem, the U.S. can have presidential elections every year but until congressmen start losing their jobs the rest of them won&#39;t feel any pressure to make serious changes. Most Congressmen vote in whatever way benefits their own career.</p>

We allow ourselves to be divided on lines of race and sex.  We have been convinced to be offended by everything and nothing. Determined that terms like intolerance and racism are one way streets. Convinced entire populations of people that they are victims instead of  empowering them. Have been convinced to be ashamed of the bad but ignore the good of our culture.  Hell, some professor even stated reason is racist. Fuck, can&#39;t we all just get along?  Can&#39;t we take ownership of ourselves?  Can&#39;t we stop worshipping &#39;authority&#39;?

    <div class="md"><p>The best case scenario in a true &quot;shit has hit the fan&quot; revolution, would be that the military defects to help their fellow citizens.  It has precedent, the military has turned against dictators in other countries (with the risk of leading to a worse situation, military coup, and a long painful slog back to stability).  Since military training in the US consists of teaching soldiers that they are the defenders against all enemies foreign and <em>domestic</em>, it wouldn&#39;t be shocking to see the armed forces fight with the people, if the government went full tyrant (like rounding dissenters up in to fema camps or some crazy shit like that).  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the government is very aware of this &quot;flaw&quot; in the system, so they play their cards slow and carefully in order to avoid becoming the enemy, aka they don&#39;t want to incite panic and an uprising.  Everyone has to stay calm and distracted so they can slowly ratchet up the control.</p>

<p>Now the police departments, government agencies, and maybe the national guard are trained with a very different &quot;us vs them&quot; mentality, so you can probably count on seeing the majority of them fighting the populace.  At least that would be my guess.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting, and somewhat terrifying, hypothetical situation.</p>

<p>&quot;We are not asking to expand the government&#39;s surveillance authority, but rather we are asking to ensure that we can continue to obtain electronic information and evidence pursuant to the legal authority that Congress has provided to us to keep America safe,&quot; Comey said during the Senate hearing.</p>

<p>What does all this mean? It simply means that at every level, government considers its own citizens hostile.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What?  What the fuck is this on about?  He was talking about FISA.  You know, in the context of obtaining a warrant and the hoops FISA presents.  You know, for real criminals, like pedophiles or something.</p>

<p>This is sensationalist at best, I mean, his testimony is like 12 pdf pages. Not much too it really, read it yourself <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/07-08-15%20Yates%20and%20Comey%20Joint%20Testimony1.pdf">http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/07-08-15%20Yates%20and%20Comey%20Joint%20Testimony1.pdf</a></p>

<p>Honestly, anyone who goes around touting what he said in this context should be ashamed of themselves, it&#39;s a pretty terrible interpretation.  </p>

<p>The rest of the hearing is pretty fascinating</p>

<p>I really liked what this guy had to say </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I hear ya, I&#39;m making a point that surveillance goes beyond &quot;nothing to hide&quot;, it&#39;s a matter of principle, and the government is not looking out for your best interest - and what you do or say may not be illegal <em>now</em>, but tomorrow it could be a different story. The fourth amendment exists for a reason. If they want information - have reasonable suspicion and a warrant.</p>
