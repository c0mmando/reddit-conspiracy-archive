        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://digwithin.net/2015/08/08/fourteen-facts/">Source</a></p>

<p>As the 14th anniversary of 9/11 approaches, it’s important to remind people that we still don’t know what happened that day. </p>

<p>What is known about 9/11 is that there are many incredible facts that continue to be ignored by the government and the mainstream media. Here are fourteen.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>An outline of what was to become the 9/11 Commission Report was produced before the investigation began. <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a0303outline#a0303outline">The outline was kept secret</a> from the Commission’s staff and appears to have determined the outcome of the investigation.</p></li>
<li><p>The 9/11 Commission claimed sixty-three (63) times in its Report that <a href="http://digwithin.net/2011/10/30/no-evidence/">it could find “no evidence”</a> related to important aspects of the crimes.</p></li>
<li><p>One person, <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=shayna_steinger_1">Shayna Steiger, issued 12 visas</a> to the alleged hijackers in Saudi Arabia. Steiger issued some of the visas without interviewing the applicants and fought with another employee at the embassy who tried to prevent her lax approach.</p></li>
<li><p>Before 9/11, the nation’s leading counter-terrorism expert repeatedly notified his friends in the United Arab Emirates of top-secret U.S. plans to capture Osama bin Laden. These treasonous leaks <a href="http://digwithin.net/2014/02/02/real-clarke/">prevented Bin Laden’s capture</a> on at least two separate occasions.</p></li>
<li><p>Former National Security Advisor Sandy Berger was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/04/books/chapters/1st-chapter-commission.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">caught stealing documents</a> from the National Archives that had been requested by the 9/11 Commission. The Commission had previously been denied access to the documents but the White House reluctantly agreed to turn them over just as Berger was trying to steal them..</p></li>
<li><p>The official story of the failed air defenses on 9/11 was changed several times and, in the end, paradoxically exonerated the military by saying that the military had lied many times about its response. The man who was behind several of the changing accounts was a <a href="http://digwithin.net/2013/08/21/political-warfare/">specialist in political warfare</a> (i.e. propaganda).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://911proof.com/9.html">Military exercises</a> being conducted on the day of 9/11 mimicked the attacks as they were occurring and obstructed the response to the attacks. NORAD commander <a href="http://digwithin.net/2013/01/12/eberhart/">Ralph Eberhart</a> sponsored those exercises, failed to do his job that day, and later lied to Congress about it (if the 9/11 Commission account is true).</p></li>
<li><p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mamvq7LWqRU&amp;feature=youtu.be">third skyscraper collapsed</a> late in the afternoon on 9/11. This was WTC 7, a 47-story building that the government’s final report says fell into its own footprint due to office fires. The building’s tenants included U.S. intelligence agencies and a company led in part by Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney. <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/05/donald-rumsfeld-demolition-wtc-7.html">Meetings were scheduled</a> there to discuss terrorism and explosives on the morning of 9/11.</p></li>
<li><p>News agencies, including BBC and CNN, announced the destruction of WTC 7 long before it happened. One BBC reporter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mxFRigYD3s">announced the collapse</a> while viewers could see the still-standing building right behind her in the video. Years later, after claiming that it had lost the tapes and then found them again, BBC’s answer to this astonishing report was that everything was just <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2007/03/part_of_the_conspiracy_2.html">“confusing and chaotic”</a> that day. Of course, one problem with this is that the news agencies predicted the exact building, of the many damaged in the area, that would collapse. Another big problem is that no one could have possibly predicted the collapse of WTC 7 given the unprecedented and unbelievable official account for how that happened.</p></li>
<li><p>Construction of the new, 52-story WTC 7 was completed two years before the government knew what happened to the first WTC 7. In fact, when the new building was completed in 2006, the spokesman for the government investigation said, “We’ve had trouble <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/16464/index6.html">getting a handle</a> on building No. 7.” The construction of the new building, without regard for how the first one was destroyed, indicates that building construction professionals in New York City did not believe it could ever happen again.</p></li>
<li><p>Ultimately, building construction codes <a href="http://www.ctbuh.org/News/GlobalTallNews/tabid/468/EntryId/4500/Are-Tall-Buildings-Safer-After-NIST-WTC-Report.aspx">were not changed</a> as a result of the root causes cited by the National Institute for Standards and Technology for destruction of the World Trade Center (WTC) buildings. This fact shows that the international building construction community does not believe that the WTC buildings were destroyed as stated in the official account.</p></li>
<li><p>AMEC, the company that <a href="http://digwithin.net/2012/01/01/a-small-world/">just finished rebuilding</a> the exact spot where Flight 77 was said to hit, was put in charge of cleanup at the WTC and the Pentagon. The man who ran the company, Peter Janson, was a long-time business associate of Donald Rumsfeld.</p></li>
<li><p>The response of the U.S. Secret Service to the 9/11 attacks suggests foreknowledge of the events in that the agency <a href="http://digwithin.net/2012/04/08/secret-service-failures/">failed to protect the president</a> from the obvious danger posed by terrorists.</p></li>
<li><p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission notified the FBI of suspected 9/11 insider trading transactions. That evidence was ignored and the suspects were <a href="http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2010/11/18/evidence-for-informed-trading-on-the-attacks-of-september-11/">not even questioned</a> by the FBI or the 9/11 Commission.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are, of course, many more incredible facts about 9/11 that continue to be ignored by authorities and much of the media. </p>

<p>Let’s hope that the next major terrorist attack results in legitimate reporting and unified calls for truth before fourteen years have passed.</p>
