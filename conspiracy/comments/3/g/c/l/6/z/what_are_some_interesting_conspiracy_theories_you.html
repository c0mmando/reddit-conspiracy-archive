       Circumstantial theories, just your own personal theories, I want to hear an interesting theory redditors on this subreddit have concocted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have this loose one that's been floating around my head, what if Obama knows war is coming abroad, and he's making sure all the #blacklivesmatter stories are being spun right, so he can incite a Civil War just as the next World War starts? This would completely fuck the US military up, and would more than likely result in a loss or inability to fight in the inevitable war that's coming. It would be a war on two fronts, and the US military would theoretically be split in half.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thoughts? Your crackpot theories that will probably be called stupid or oblivious on this sub? Let's hear me all!

       Bitcoin. If there is indeed a conspiracy to create a cashless, one world government, something like bitcoin would be perfect for them. That's why it's imperative to not allow bureaucrats to intervene in its production or use.

       What would be the disadvantage of having a say, "Earthly Empire" though? If that government was like today's government, then it would be hell. But if we were all unified there would be no war, all trade would be internal, hell with the right people in power the economy of such a government wouldn't even need trade. Just playing Devil's Advocate here. Why are you opposed to a single government across the world? It would dissolve more boundaries between human beings, I think, and would lead us towards enlightenment if we could stop killing our own species for our own selfish agendas

       I mean if it's constantly ran from behind the scenes while the people in power pit the citizens against one another, it's bad. But if we were all one government under Earth, I don't see how it would be bad. Nationalism is fucking stupid. It just separates from one another as a species. We are the highest level of life on this planet, why the fuck are we constantly trying to hold eachother down and step on eachother's backs?

       A central worldly government does not necessarily entail absolute power, just one governing body for all. If that governing body is not corrupt, then in theory, a government of Earth would not be a bad thing

       The drugs are just a cover up for the real tech to stay hidden and yes but it's all classified. Think it's a crackpot theory though. That way the tech will work on you if they need you.

       Not much conspiracy theory, but a hypothesis I love: since mammals can be cloned with an egg cell and a mammary cell, and since the AI singularity always seems to be "looming", someday the human raced will be comprised by female cyborgs.

       I'm pretty strong agnostic. I don't know, and as it is I don't reckon I CAN know. I presume human understanding and reasoning is limited, so it seems pretty audacious to claim understanding or knowledge of god or even the totality of science really. I like to think I'm open to whatever might come up either way.

       Fair enough. Well, I believe that the integration of man and machine would hinder the use of the pineal gland, and would not be good for humans as a whole.

       I think that this jaden helm thing will assist our  country through an economy collapses this September just as the "operation"is suppose to end ( everything will be set in place by then cause this is just prp time for them).I believe that the Chinese are going to be given land as payment for the debt they hold of ours, possibly in the more Hispanic populated areas of the Jaden helm area. With China and Russia being allies and the building and expand of an island base in the South China Sea as well as Russia's now expanded and resume  Cold War era flights (carrying bombs) along the U.S. Coast line . Don't forget anytime a country decides it will not buy oil in dollars than the U.S. Is going to come after you. That's what China and Russia did 2013 two years later the stock market is about to crash and probably from curroption by the U.S.  China now wants that money mor than ever now an we can't give it to them.

       I can't help but think Hollywood, the fashion industry, the music industry are plagued by prostitution. Maybe even mass pedophilia, like

       Second theory : celebrities' tattoos could be a sign telling the wealthy elite which celeb is available, etc.

       One that I think is rather interesting but not concrete is the potential Magic Johnson HIV hoax.  The general thesis is that he received a large sum of money that was originally offered to Sugar Ray Lenard which he rejected, in order to become the HIV spokesperson.  The idea was to encourage testing, help remove the stigma and seemingly "foreign" nature of the virus, and subsequently increase the use of drug based treatment.

       Wouldn't surprise me one bit. I wasn't alive at the time but it seems to me like Magic Johnson was more famous than Sugar Ray during that period. But then again boxing was bigger than basketball at that time, atleast that's my understanding. Nevertheless, it makes sense that they have a famous HIV spokesperson to further an agenda with medicine, as people with HIV have a weak immune system as it is thus making them more susceptible to whatever they're putting in the drugs
