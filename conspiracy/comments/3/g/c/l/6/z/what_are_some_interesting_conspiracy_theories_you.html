<p>I have this loose one that&#39;s been floating around my head, what if Obama knows war is coming abroad, and he&#39;s making sure all the #blacklivesmatter stories are being spun right, so he can incite a Civil War just as the next World War starts? This would completely fuck the US military up, and would more than likely result in a loss or inability to fight in the inevitable war that&#39;s coming. It would be a war on two fronts, and the US military would theoretically be split in half. </p>

<p>Thoughts? Your crackpot theories that will probably be called stupid or oblivious on this sub? Let&#39;s hear me all! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What would be the disadvantage of having a say, &quot;Earthly Empire&quot; though? If that government was like today&#39;s government, then it would be hell. But if we were all unified there would be no war, all trade would be internal, hell with the right people in power the economy of such a government wouldn&#39;t even need trade. Just playing Devil&#39;s Advocate here. Why are you opposed to a single government across the world? It would dissolve more boundaries between human beings, I think, and would lead us towards enlightenment if we could stop killing our own species for our own selfish agendas</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean if it&#39;s constantly ran from behind the scenes while the people in power pit the citizens against one another, it&#39;s bad. But if we were all one government under Earth, I don&#39;t see how it would be bad. Nationalism is fucking stupid. It just separates from one another as a species.

    <div class="md"><p>I think that this jaden helm thing will assist our  country through an economy collapses this September just as the &quot;operation&quot;is suppose to end ( everything will be set in place by then cause this is just prp time for them).I believe that the Chinese are going to be given land as payment for the debt they hold of ours, possibly in the more Hispanic populated areas of the Jaden helm area. With China and Russia being allies and the building and expand of an island base in the South China Sea as well as Russia&#39;s now expanded and resume  Cold War era flights (carrying bombs) along the U.S. Coast line . Don&#39;t forget anytime a country decides it will not buy oil in dollars than the U.S. Is going to come after you. That&#39;s what China and Russia did 2013 two years later the stock market is about to crash and probably from curroption by the U.S.  China now wants that money mor than ever now an we can&#39;t give it to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One that I think is rather interesting but not concrete is the potential Magic Johnson HIV hoax.  The general thesis is that he received a large sum of money that was originally offered to Sugar Ray Lenard which he rejected, in order to become the HIV spokesperson.  The idea was to encourage testing, help remove the stigma and seemingly &quot;foreign&quot; nature of the virus, and subsequently increase the use of drug based treatment.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wouldn&#39;t surprise me one bit. I wasn&#39;t alive at the time but it seems to me like Magic Johnson was more famous than Sugar Ray during that period. But then again boxing was bigger than basketball at that time, atleast that&#39;s my understanding. Nevertheless, it makes sense that they have a famous HIV spokesperson to further an agenda with medicine, as people with HIV have a weak immune system as it is thus making them more susceptible to whatever they&#39;re putting in the drugs </p>
