       , there, that rule 10 protects conspiracy theorists from being accused of shills as much as it protects shills from being publicly identified.

       It isn't difficult to discern a false claim from a real one with a simple peek into the accused's history.

       By the same token, most everybody here recognizes the trolls/shills without someone having to point it out. Also note that the rule applies to

       personal attacks, not just troll/shill accusations.

       It's not against the rules here for anyone to "have an agenda". PostNationalism is one of the users here that has every single one of his submissions reported, regardless of whether they break any rules or not. Clearly, the person/people that report them (and a couple other user's every submission too) also have an agenda.

       I haven't followed how loosely the rule is being enforced, if it even is being loosely enforced. But there are many mentally weak people here who call "shill" as soon as they meet any resistance, as soon as they are asked to back up their claims, or if someone doesn't believe in the same conspiracy theory as them.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example: I believe it's plausible that there was some foul play at the Boston Bombings. However, I don't believe the victims were actors who weren't injured. I've been called a shill for this. I've been called a shill here because I think the flat earth theory is shit, because apparently this is what the government wants me to think. The word is used loosely. Others are very careful not to use it, but imply it instead with comments like "who do you work for?" or "are you getting paid for this?" We don't need to fucking circle jerk over every goddamn conspiracy out there.

       I enjoy it when I remove a troll/shill's comment calling a conspiracy theorist a shill and I regret it when I have to remove a conspiracy theorist's comment calling a shill a shill. The rules have to be enforced equally.
      </p>
      <p>
       It;s those kinds of personal attacks that give credibility to trolls/shills and, sadly, too many people here don't realize that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: There are subreddits specifically set up to track and name trolls/shills. This is not one of them.

       Lame excuse is lame.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, how does publicly identifying shills give them credibility?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or how does allowing shills to call others shills give them credibility?
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither of those things give shills credibility. Shame on you for acting against your moral compass to enforce someone's immoral rule. That's shameful.

       Example: You've called other people in this sub "shill" 5 times in the past hour. You may consider this your only warning. Next time will result in a ban. (Now I'll be able to sleep just fine.)

       Good riddance! Oh, where would we be with out rules? For rules protect us from ourselves. Under anarchy, we'd all be left at each other's mercy. Control would be lost. Knowing this, we need rules. You cannot deny this. Or else you must be dangerous. Unaware of the threat you pose to others. Rules must be obeyed. So long as they're obeyed, we will all be safe. Everyone knows this. Lest we fall victim to each other. Freedom should be constrained.

       We have and enforce our rules to prevent threads from devolving into dozens/hundreds of comments that have absolutely nothing to do with the posted topic. Do you like seeing a post about something you want to discuss and having to go through dozens of comments like "you're an asshole" and "you're an idiot" etc? Do you like making a comment and have to read through dozens of personal attacks before you can even find a comment addressing yours?

       The rules aren't here to "protect" anyone. They're here so that reasonable discussions can happen. And they're also here to prevent the Reddit admins from banning this sub.
