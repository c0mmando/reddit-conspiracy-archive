    <div class="md"><p>But what point exactly does saying what you said serve when the information itself that Natural News is giving in this case is actually 100% verified and backed up by the very person they&#39;re reporting on?  It actually negates the point you&#39;re making because, in this particular case, NN is actually 100% <em>correct</em> about what they&#39;re saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The point I was making is that I dont like sites that make claims without evidence, which they often do, this case is differnt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But since this case <em>is</em> indeed different, then your saying that you don&#39;t like sites that make claims without evidence falls flat, as this isn&#39;t one of those sites.  That statement - &quot;I don&#39;t like sites that make claims without evidence&quot; - is an unqualified universal statement, which means that all it takes is one counterexample to prove it entirely false - and the OP is one <em>definite</em> counterexample.  As such, you are simply incorrect in claiming that NN is a &quot;site that makes claims without evidence&quot;.</p>

<p><em>Sometimes</em> it might...but obviously, sometimes it DOESN&#39;T, and the OP is a case in point.  As such, one simply doesn&#39;t look very intelligent if and when they make a broad, unqualified, universal statement like you have here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Im in no way trying to devalue the information, just pointing out that I dont like natural news. thats it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But your pointing out what you&#39;re pointing out in <em>this</em> particular case DOES in fact devalue the information because what you&#39;re pointing out DOESN&#39;T APPLY IN THIS CASE and is, therefore, a thoroughly unnecessary comment that adds nothing to the conversation other than showing that you didn&#39;t think things through very thoroughly.</p>

<p>Okay…but you should be concerned what you think about your <em>own</em> intelligence…as it’s proving not to be very good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You obviously are too attached emotionally to this story, since you are throwing acusations around.</p>

<p>What?  What accusations am I throwing around?  I literally QUOTED you.  You SAID what I alleged.  It wasn’t like I made it up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I brought up the point because I thought I was important, I&#39;m sorry it isn&#39;t to your liking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But why did you think it was important?  I mean, again I say, it doesn’t MATTER who gives the information if it’s actually CORRECT, right?</p>

<p>Look, I apologize for coming across as too much of an asshole.  I can do that sometimes.  However, you came here immediately disregarding the information simply because you didn’t like the package it came wrapped in.  That is simply <em>not</em> good thinking.  It shouldn’t matter WHERE information comes from IF IT’S VALID…and the point here is that big pharma sending folks out to hurt and intimidate individuals who expose the truth about shit vaccines IS A REALITY.  Who cares who says it or exposes it?</p>

<p>Here.  What about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3gq474/former_merck_rep_says_mandatory_vaccination_is/">this presentation here</a>?  Would it make you feel better if you read it from <em>that</em> website?</p>

<p>You have a right to voice your opinion. If I spent my energy on thoughts about someone else&#39;s label of my intelligence, that would probably drain me of energy and cause me to focus on an aspect of self-importance. Since I am working on removing aspects of self-importance from my life, that would probably backfire for me. </p>

<p>No1113. you are taking what I said way out of context. you are making this about me criticizing the content, from my point of view I am bringing up an issue I have with that particular website. Im sorry if you feel it marginalizes the message. I don&#39;t agree with you that it makes me unintelligent because I brought up an important issue about that website however off-topic it is.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I does matter because I wonder about the reason why they are choosing to report on that particular subject as I feel they use legit information to further an agenda they may have however ambiguous it is. &#39;Why&#39; Is more important than &#39;What&#39; for me, because it leads me to the truth behind the actions of organizations that I suspect as not being legitimate in the truth movement. Focusing on &#39;Why&#39; also leads me to the core truth behind dis-info campaigns that are springing up all over the place now that people are search and finding truth.</p>

<p>Some people use lies to tell the truth, and some people use the truth to tell lies.</p>

<p>If it bothers you that much I can delete my post, no problem. Im interested in maintaining peace.</p>
