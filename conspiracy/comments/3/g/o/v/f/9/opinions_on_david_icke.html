    <div class="md"><p>The best advice I can give anyone on Icke, IMO, is to READ his early work (truth vibrations, the biggest secret, children of the matrix), digest his material for yourself. </p>

<p>If you think he&#39;s crazy, fine. If you think he&#39;s controlled opposition to make conspiracy theorist, fine. If you think he&#39;s profiting off of truth seekers like Alex jones, fine. If you think he has valid points, fine. </p>

<p>The one thing I find consistently about David Icke is that most criticisms are by people that don&#39;t know too much of his ideas and writings. Most people know just the extreme parts (reptilians, holographic universe, etc) of his views, without much context or background. </p>

<p>Again, whatever opinion you would form I respect. But only if you have actually digested his material. Not short clips on YouTube or summaries you read on that blog over there. </p>

<p>I find many people won&#39;t even delve into his work deeply because of the stigma. Again, just my opinion.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries, and yes (sorta). He is speaking in metaphors. When he says reptilians (imo), means two blood lines. This dates back to the story of Cain and Abel (occult/esoteric teachings). They had the same mother, but different fathers (Serpent and God). Cain killed Abel for a reason (jealousy/hate). It&#39;s a story, but there is truth to it, and most occult societies believe it. This may blow over most people&#39;s heads, but if you know what he is poking at, you&#39;ll get it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not know the man personally, I have listened to him while studying other topics, and I&#39;ve concluded he is speaking in metaphors. Which is why he is still alive. People laugh at this/him, but if you really knew what he was saying, you&#39;d awaken and see it. This is all occult/esoteric. He relies on the people to do their homework to see it. TPTB rely on people not doing their homework and laughing him off as a buffoon/looney. Look into, then re-watch what he is saying. It&#39;ll be clear as day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t exactly call it religious dingbattery. The idea that we&#39;re all connected - Carl Jung hypothesised it as a collective un/subconscious - as just expressions of infinite consciousness is hardly the worst of new age stuff we&#39;ve had.

<p>Nothing wrong with advocating for love and compassion but when it comes to the lizard people he is either a liar or crazy. If he is a liar, then he doesn&#39;t deserve anyone&#39;s attention. If he is crazy, maybe we at <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> can practice some of that love and compassion, raise some money, and get him some professional help. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. This is what I was thinking... assuming the reptilian stuff isn&#39;t true, beyond lying (because he made it all up) or being crazy (because he believes it despite the lack of evidence) what else is there? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you read his books he provides evidence of how he reached his conclusions... It could most certainly be faulty. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe he is lying, but there is no way either of us could know either way. </p>

<p>This is an assumption so excuse me if I&#39;m wrong, but it seems from your comments in this thread that you haven&#39;t read too much of what David Icke has written... Which might explain why you see it as either him lying or being crazy, without the possibilities that a) he is convinced of it himself based on what he perceives as valid evidence, or albeit a far less likely outcome, b) he is correct or close to being correct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct. I must confess I have only watched some interviews, watched a documentary about him, and read through &quot;reptoid&quot; wikipedia page. He seems like a very nice guy (which is why I lean more towards crazy and not a liar).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d agree with you, that I don&#39;t think he&#39;s lying. I think he&#39;s genuine. </p>

<p>I would strongly suggest to start off by reading The Biggest secret first. I downloaded a free pdf of it (and a couple of his other books too). I would suggest torrenting it or getting it somewhere online for free. I couldn&#39;t tell you it is definitely worth the money because I didn&#39;t pay for it myself. But I did read it in entirety and IMO that is his best work. Also, it gives you insight to a bit of a different Icke than the one you see all over YouTube. This book was written very early on in his career. </p>

<p>What&#39;s great about his books is that he cites his sources of information, so you can check out those sources for yourself after/while reading. </p>
