    <div class="md"><p>Rabid atheists attacking the islamic belief at every opportunity they get whilst making 360 degree fedora spins sourcing all the information they can get from Hasbara fronts?</p>

<p>Yup, one of the many traps engineered by the zionist cabal. Honestly, if you live in the West, it is very difficult to make it through childhood without getting affected by any of their deployed propaganda. It is literally infused everywhere, from Nickelodeon up to the daily newspaper your dad reads. The average atheist will fervently refuse this to be true ofcourse, thinking that his thoughts are original and not influence by any external factors. Nobody likes to think of himself as a product of a malicious design.</p>

<p>I personally chose to diversify my sources of knowledge by reading literature of those that are not relevant in the current paradigms of modern society(and as such, &quot;unimportant&quot;). This includes the works of many ancient philosophers of the Oriental and Arab world. Recent works that contain truth are rare, although I do recommend the works of Naom Chomsky/George Galloway and probably Ron Paul once he retires his political career. Still, my advice is to go back to forgotten books, as common knowledge is rare in this world filled with empty books.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The overall purpose ofcourse is to fragment, deceive, ruin and to corrupt. </p>

<p>Think of how terms lose their meaning(gender/sexuality), alliances are vilified(male/female marriage) and men and women refuse to fullfill their roles which they are naturally inclined to(feminism). These are just a handful of many degenerate strategies deployed on every level, on every field that matters in order to influence culture.</p>

<p>Do you know what beauty is? Beauty is art, skill and dedication merged as one. To create a pale reflection of that which is divine.
This term lost its meaning as it became vilified, nowadays art is about degradation and shock-factor. Draw a turd on a wal and be funded by rich zionists broadcasting your &quot;work of art&quot; to the impressionable public.</p>

<p>This holds true for national identity as well. Mass integration? Without a shred of a doubt a Jew is behind it, calling for tolerance and acceptance. Do they want mass integration in Israel? NO! It&#39;s holy land, it must remain pure. 
The same can be said about the banking system, where it is all interest-based. Have you ever played monopoly? There is always one winner, the game used to be a critique of capitalism, as power eventually reaches a single entity. Well, consider the world to be the board-platform, and the zionist cabal the frontrunners in the game. Working like a tightknitted machine, pushing for acts and laws that extend beyond the realm of nations in order to aggregate their power. The more divided people are, the more fluent this transition of power will be.</p>

<p>The exact purpose is to dominate. We are the goy, ought to serve the Jews according to their man-made script called the Talmud. Being a Jew doesn&#39;t mean you are religious, but that you belong to a particular race of people ought to rule the world. The hypocrisy of terms like &quot;atheist Jew&quot; is truly ridicilous. There is a whole lot of stuff to write about Kebutankie, but to save my fingers i&#39;ll just refer you to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. It&#39;s the most &quot;debunked&quot; piece of inside-knowledge you could have. In fact, the literature is so damaging that they outright called it a fabrication, despite the content of the book to be completely true if you care to do an assessment of the situation. Just make sure you get an unedited edition, as they have taken great effort in order to &quot;correct&quot; it.</p>

<p>If you need literature on an academic level written by intellectuals, I strongly recommend the trilogy called the &quot;Culture of Critique&quot;. It focuses on corruption and manipulation by the zionist-Jews in acadamic world, and is brilliantly logical and unassuming. There is ofcourse much more, but that is for you to find out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before we ask that question, what exactly <em>is</em> a Jew?</p>

<p>Judaism comes in flavors, but the most malicious of them all is the Hasidic sect, which rules Israel with an iron grip. This whole &quot;illuminati&quot; thing is their work, as they are steadfast practicioners of extremely obscure rituals hidden from the public eye. They understand the concept of sacrifice more than anyone, as they routinely engage in a practices too demonic to detail at the cost of human lives.</p>

<p>The Jews are well aware of these practices and are okay with these atrocities taking place, but those that act on behalf of justice are few in numbers(BT Selem). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They did tests on labrats keeping televisions on 24/7 and see how they react in comparison to another control group, a group of rats that had no distractions whatsoever.</p>

<p>The result was shocking, as the labrats that lived a life full of distraction had an extremely short attention span, and difficulty forming thoughts that would have saved them from predators. As such, they inhibited risk-seeking behavior by ignoring instinct and going for a nugget of cheese by sprinting towards it in a linear fashion.</p>

<p>The other control group, which had no distractions whatsoever, was much more cautious in approaching the nugget of cheese. They made tactical use of crevices and hiding places and approached the bait in a non-linear fashion.</p>

<p>We have much to learn from the animal world, and as such, I advice you to be aware of the &quot;tl;dr&quot; thing as being detrimental to your mental fortitude. It is a result of the culture of distraction we live in today, where everything has to be sumamrized and tl&#39;dr-ed. Back in the old days, you had debates going on in a very calm manner. Nowadays, debates are crappy oneliners filled with special effects and acrobats making backflips out of nowhere. Our attention span is severely affected, and I believe this to be done <strong>on purpose</strong>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6j4f8cHBIM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6j4f8cHBIM</a>), as it prevents us from making connections and digging to find the truth. It makes it easier to just go with the huxleyan flow of every-day activities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because a culture filled with distraction and scientific advancement are not mutually exclusive from each other. It&#39;s like being a nuclear scientist that heavily endulges in false consumerist desires. He still produces scientific advancement, as calculations and permutations are to be made ad infinitum. </p>

<p>On a personal level however, there is a large spiritual void that not even the shiniest phone can fill. Scientists are bound to fill this gap. Despite the atheist demeanor, many &quot;sciencey&quot; institutions take occultism as leading tenets in what they do. It&#39;s funny in an ironic way, considering how triggered many neckbears are when you dare to remind them about Allah. </p>

<p>I for one can&#39;t wait for that movie called &quot;Symetry&quot; CERN will publish. It&#39;s basically satan worship with an edgy twist around it to make it appealing. As usual, the signs are there, but you just need to &quot;see&quot; it. </p>
