       Edit- for those who say the quote isn't right... I read it right out of the book I have and thought of y'all.  on page 190... The whole paragraph reads as follows.
      </p>
      <p>
       "In time of rapid social change there are bound to be conspiracies, both by those in favor of change and by those defending the status quo. The latter more than the former in recent American political history. Detecting conspiracies when there are no conspiracies is a symptom of paranoia; detecting them when they exist is a sign of menial health. An acquaintance of mine says, "in America today, if you're not a little paranoid you're out of your mind."  The remark, however, has global applicability.

       We may be predators in behavior but anyone with half a brain stem can see that humans aren't physically built to eat other animals. I love when people point to our teeny tiny canines as if that somehow proves we are omnivores. Rabbits have bigger, stronger canines than we do... lol. Rabbits.

       People get sick and diabetic from consuming too much processed sugar and carbs, not meat.  This has pretty much been proven as fact.  Meat and protein has been part of our diet for hundreds of thousands of years.

       There can be absolutely no doubt that humans are physically built to eat other animals. Do you know how I know? Because I can live off it.

      <p>
       I actually get sustenance from it. I can live for a very long time eating ONLY meat.

       This means that I'm "built" for eating other animals. I can and it works.

       Meat is a vital source of protein for humans. Too much of anything is harmful. Our brains developed the way they did because we started cooking meat and made it easier to digest. Cooking meat lead to growing food and we need both. People can survive without eating meat but our species would not have developed this way if we didn't eat meat. We are animals and we are omnivores.

       All fruits and vegetables have ample protein and actually have nutrients, which meat lacks. Just stop pushing this bullshit that bought-and-paid for researchers have made up for the meat and dairy industries. You can eat the crap all you want but please, don't tell me, a person who hasn't eaten meat or dairy or animal products in I've forgotten how long that I'm an omnivore. I'm healthier, more fit, and leaner than any "omnivore" I know. If I was an omnivore I'd be dead, period. If we can survive indefinitely without eating anything but fruits and vegetables then, by definition, we are not omnivores.

       I'm not pushing anything, you need to calm down. I mentioned how we are natural predators and we have eaten meat our entire existence. I never said it was better than fruits or vegetables. A healthy, balanced diet can and IMO should have both or you can can be a vegetarian or vegan. It's a choice. Early Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens didn't have much of a choice and they ate meat. We evolved from them and so meat is and has been vital to our development. Feeding people is hard, especially when we multiply to over 7 billion individuals. Not everyone has the luxury of having so many choices of what to eat.

       Here is some of the bs research you were talking about I guess. Might as well push it now.

       We eat meat as a species.The fact that a person can live without eating meat doesn't change the fact that meat developed our ancestors bodies and brains into what we are now. It aided our evolution.

       I don't eat a lot of meat, but when I do it is humanely raised on small farms.  Much of the mass produced meat today is full of hormones and glyphosate from the GMO grain and soy the animals consume.  I notice a lot of the macho meat eaters have symptoms of PMS 9 out of 10 times.

       I agree. Even raising animals such as goats and chickens can provide quality proteins through their eggs and milk.  Goats are also great at eating unwanted vegetation.  I'd love to homestead but can't convince the wife.  Likes her Facebook too much.

       Start small, a backyard garden is a great way of beginning liberation from the food supply. I live in a very liberal state that also happens to have a large farming community and i try my best to drive out to the markets out in the valley and over the mountain passes. The first step is always deciding that we are done participating in our own illness.

       It's been designed this way. This will sound like nonsense most likely but EVERYTHING, from the mindset that it's natural to be eating meat and abusing animals to the mindset that children are playtoys to be raped is related. Fear lends power from the fearful to the feared.
      </p>
      <p>
       From a book I am writing: "The reason that people feel discomfort when presented with information to their belief's contrary, is because they feel an emotional attachment to those beliefs as they give comfort of mind. Ultimately, this is completely illogical. The temporary comfort that may come with a soft view of reality will eventually give way to pain and sadness. As a cigarette smoker who refuses to quit will die of lung cancer, and a drunk driver who refuses to see reason will die or sit in prison, a society that condones and encourages violence will die of war and infighting. Those refusing to observe the true nature of their reality will continue the cycle of death and sadness. "

       The irony is that Sagan was the heir apparent to PTB-employed resident ET debunker J. Allen Hynek.  Difference between Hynek and Sagan, however, was that while Hynek eventually woke tf up and realized that there
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       in fact ample evidence indicating that the planet Earth is being visited by ETs - causing Hynek to subsequently become one of the most ardent ET proponents - Sagan remained a PTB debunker shill, employed to poo poo on any idea that ETs are on and around this planet and solar system, and went to his deathbed continuing to sing the song of his masters.

       Let's put it this way:  J. Allen Hynek was -
       <em>
        of his own admittance
       </em>
       - in the employ of higher ups in the government and other secret organizations specifically tasked with downplaying and negating the importance of all the evidence that
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       indeed exist and pointed toward there being ET contact on this planet and in this solar system.  He went on record stating that his job was to make sure and use a marginalizing modus operandi to discount data that he later publicly acknowledged
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       actually exist and constitute significant evidence on behalf of this planet being visited by ETs and ET craft.
      </p>
      <p>
       Carl Sagan's m.o. fits the same profile Hynek had of being 1) a well-respected scientific figure that the public trusted and believed, and he also happened to 2) use pretty much the same, flowery, long-winded, very "scientific sounding" language that Hynek did to discredit the existence of ETs and ET craft on and around this planet.

       Read "the demon haunted world" by carl sagan in which he describes everything he's done in the search for ET's both for the government and without and how badly he wishes they existed.

       I've read literally every single book that Carl Sagan ever published.  That's why I say what I say with the confidence that I do.  In DHW, he goes to great lengths to establish his own credibility and, as you stated, purport to "
       <em>
        reeeeaaally
       </em>
       wish they existed", and then he summarily turns around and blissfully ignores the evidence that existed even during the time that he published that work - to say nothing of what came out in the decades after its publishing while he was still alive.

       I'm personally pretty damn pissed at him, because I
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       liked me some Carl Sagan.  You don't dedicate a year of your life pouring over an anthology of every book he published without having a great deal of respect and admiration for him.  That's why I was so utterly pissed when I started really understanding the extent to which he - a supposedly "objective, critically thinking scientist" - was out and out ignoring valid data and spending his life poo-pooing relevant data on the subject.  Then I researched Hynek and the m.o. he was employed to act out in being the "resident debunker"...and I realized that he and Carl Sagan were following the
       <em>
        exact
       </em>
       same script.

       You couldn't be more wrong about that.  "Spearheaded" implies that someone was responsible for influencing the
       <em>

       of a phenomenon.  The topic has been around and documented LOOONG before any Rockefeller even existed.  This is bigger and far beyond any Rockefeller person regardless of whether they've put money into it in an attempt to create any disinfo about the topic one way or the other.

       Basically people who suffer from paranoid delusions are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories because they think the world is out to get them. Their frame of reference is off, so they start looking for conspiracies to explain everything, even when there is nothing to explain. Anyone who tries to discredit it is "obviously" a shill in on it trying to cover up the conspiracy, which only reinforces their paranoia and isolation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second half of the quote is in a similar vein as the first, but dealing with the opposite effect. Someone who is in a healthy psychological state and thinking rationally might see some really shady shit going down and think maybe something is wrong. Someone who is not will look at events that seem really suspicious and think nothing of it.

      </p>
      <p>
       There must be a balance between seeing a government conspiracy because there is evidence and believing in a conspiracy because you assume it was. Like I think 9/11 was a government led conspiracy but I don't believe in the moon landing hoax or holocaust denial
      </p>
      <p>
       I think some people in this sub automatically assume that anyone who opposes them is a shill, they take a bit of truth and expand it to fit everyone, when in reality most people are probably just normal people on the internet with opinions.

       I don't think 9/11 was an inside job. But I do think that the Bush administration exploited the fuck out of the tragedy to push through the Patriot Act and either lied or deliberately misled the public into the Iraq War. I guess that technically qualifies as a conspiracy if they talked about coordinating what they said to mislead people.

       For a conspiracy to exist, it must take place in a way to affect others.
Its mental health to look into conpiracies that already happened/did damage.
On the other detecting bad things before they happen, attempting to foresee or prevent such things, is paranoia for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, need not worry about the present or the future, just sit back and watch it unfold. You'll probably read about it in a paper someday, when you're old and powerless.
