       If most people dismiss gangstalking as simply 'loose headedness' or 'paranoid schizophrenia', then why are they going into
       <a href="/r/gangstalking">
        /r/gangstalking
       </a>
       and relentlessly downvoting?  Consider this: are people going into
       <a href="/r/bipolar">
        /r/bipolar
       </a>
       and downvoting all those posts because they are mentally ill?  (They are not). I would expect most people would simply leave schizophrenics alone, so what makes gangstalking so threatening to folks they have to actually go there and downvote brigade?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I am on the fence with gangstalking.  I think there is probably some truth to it, but generally from what I've heard, there is a bunch of loose headed irrationality and a lack of understanding of basic physics but I'm not going to try to suppress anyone because I think that makes it worse for those folks in that the suppression itself is self-validating.  It's better that if you think it's wrong, say it's wrong and describe with knowledge how its wrong.  This is the proper means of dialogue--to raise people up instead of beating them down, especially since the basis of their victimhood is one in which they feel defeated by a psychological 'unknown other'
      </p>
      <p>
       What are your thoughts on this?  Is it more neoreactionaryism?

       I think that gangstalking could be real, but I often wonder about the people who claim to be targeted.  I would think that you would have to be pretty important to spend all this time, effort, and money on; and from what I have seen, those who claim to be victims are often....not very important or worthwhile of a target.

       This is a really good point.  Assuming it's real, either it's the case that gangstalking is a form of intimidation by the deep state and cronies (secret societies / gangs), or if the TI's are randomly selected, then it's a kind of 'game' by and for the same.

       Power such as this, the power to control a stable of 'gangstalkers', is not often, or ever, wasted on 'games'.  If it is being done, there is a specific purpose, and most likely more than one purpose, 'they' would tend to be very efficient and detailed in what they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't seen any real compelling evidence that gangstalking actually exists, yet.  I would like to see some, because this is an intriguing subject.

       The element of this you are missing is the money. From all accounts I have read the way this works is a target is "reported" or "selected" by members of their respective community for whatever reason - being violent, not conforming, being a sexual predator or just angering a person connected to the program. These accusations do not need to be true. Being selected for this treatment is enough to the target in the program. Then the disinformation and rumor campaign begins. By the time the perps are done, everyone in the neighborhood will believe whatever it is they are selling. Once that happens, a consensus is taken through petition to put the person in the program. The. The money starts flowing. People are compensated for harassing, spying and torturing the target with DEWs. Those who just follow, spy on and harass are compensated in small ways (a tank of gas, a Target gift card) while those with homes located near the target are compensated more substantially (new cars). The people located near the target allow people into their home for training, observation of the target, host and maintain equipment and to harass and torture the target. They also supply room and board for perps and in some cases go on vacation allowing their home to be used by the perps.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's about the money. Most would not participate were it not for the money. Once these people get a taste of it they are hooked. Some of these perps make their living this way so it behooves them to always have someone in the program that is in their neighborhood. It keeps the money flowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also the hierarchy to be considered. The top perps are put on the payroll receiving regular paychecks, training and other perks. They are made to feel important. These are people with a low standing on the socio-economic ladder who have never had anything in their lives to make them feel important or useful. The impact of all of this is to make those who would otherwise be committing crimes and generally creating unrest feel as if they are heroes for saving the community from the target. In this respect Gang Stalking is a tool to keep subversive sectors of a community in check. It scapegoats the target by demonizing them taking the focus of subversive elements of their socio-economic situation and placing it on the target. So Gang Stalking, from a high level view, is a method to placate dissatisfied members of a community by giving them an object to focus their time, energy and hate on.

       You may be right.  One thing that TI's miss is that the CIA experiements on mind control in the 60s and 70s specifically having to do with cognitive derangment and coercion from electronic sources involved electrode contact--either by nonintrusive measure as in transcranial nerve stimulation or transcranial magnetic nerve stimulation (which is actually being used in a limited way in psychotherapy); or by direct surgery and implants.
      </p>
      <p>
       In either case, it required close proximity.  As in a big machine and implants and operator.  Sure, many decades have passed since the discovery of the lilly wave and things have surely gotten smaller but if there were widespread implants, doctors would have quickly found them on cat/pet and mri scans and it would be a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that you can beam radio waves into someone is the same problem with an AM/FM receiver--the native brain activity is much stronger in terms of raw power than the manipulative radio signal, which also gets stopped or diminished by the skin and skull.  It would have to be such a strong signal to get in that it would fry a person first.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's more likely that the control the state has on people is either by a kind of induction force like binarual beats or just plain ole lies on television.

       It definitely is not something as simple as binaural beats or subliminal frequencies in television although both of these can be use with V2K, the latter by causing RFI in electronics. In one word, maser.

       There is no demological study that substantiates this. Majority of targeted individuals are high value targets: whistle blowers, journalists, plaintiffs, dissidents, activists, researchers, authors, etc. I created a post listing them:

       That's actually correct for the most part, often those kinds of people are picked as targets for experimentation. If they were to do the same thing to rich or influential people they could potentially draw attention to themselves or this program.

       "I would have had a difficult time believing that organized group harassment exists, but it does. I referred to it as "psychological lynching" in my color of law complaint's addendum to the local FBI field office in May 2013. Significantly, I detailed my experiences well before reading about it online. I agree with the site - fightgangstalking.com - that most posts and websites and many comments in discussion groups are disinformation to discredit the few truly legitimate posts. (A Snowden document, for example, revealed that the British equivalent of the NSA - GCHQ - uses this technique). My website - systematicpoliceharassment-pinellascountyflorida.com - details my experiences. I had to end my practice of law (divorce attorney in private practice) in Pinellas County because of hacking and systematic harassment against me. I dated the divorcing wife of the fourth highest member of the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office from 2003 until 2011. Because the extensive police harassment against me didn't stop me from dating, organized group harassment (or call it what you will) began. I have been falsely smeared with the worst possible smear - being a pedophile - always behind my back or anonymously. Of course, the police in Pinellas County always denied harassing or smearing me. Read the detailed allegations of gangstalking (or call it what you will) in the lawsuit filed in 2013 (about a half year after I submitted my addendum) on behalf of a well paid private contractor working for the federal government, Jeffrey Kantor. The fact that his lawsuit was eventually dismissed in federal court for insufficient evidence, doesn't diminish the veracity of his allegations."

       'Gang stalking' was used in COINTELPRO, in Germany by STASI, by the Nazis, by the KGB in Russia, it definitely exists. The question is, is it happening to the people making these claims? It can be exceedingly difficult to prove as the entire MO is such to make it nearly impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Electronic harassment, more properly torture, can however be measured and it's a pity more victims aren't doing this. People often say to victims, "you're nobody, why would they do this to you?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, look at MKULTRA. The CIA ran radiological, pharmacological, psychological, etc. experimentation on numerous civilians. Who were they? Nobodies. You don't do something like this to people who are powerful, who have money or influence. You do it to someone no one cares about and who can do nothing about it. That's not to say they wouldn't still use these kinds of things to attack people who they are genuinely concerned about, activists, politicians, etc., e.g. Fred Bell after Jesse Ventura's Brain Invaders (or was it Death Ray?) episode aired. He died immediately afterwards. Another gentlemen who was on that show, a 'targeted individual' who claimed to experience V2K, an ex-police officer, had an attempt made on his life some time after, a man chased him on the highway and fired several shots at him from inside his vehicle wounding him.

       That said, I think there is a large amount of disinformation in the communities and equal parts mental illness but I do believe there are very real victims struggling amongst them and these elements make it extremely difficult for them to do anything about what's happening.

       Great perspective on this issue. It's always good to hear folks POV who aren't in the program. If more people took this stance on Gangstalking we might actually abolish it. I know you're on the fence infinity, I can tell you without reservation that Gangstalking is as real as it gets. I have never been diagnosed with any mental disorders. At my age (fifty something) to suddenly become afflicted with dozens of them would seem unlikely. The fact of the matter is, it is impossible to have acquired, suddenly, all of the disconnected maladies necessary to produce the phenomenon I experience on a day to day basis.

       There is no "cure". If I thought for a second that taking a pill would make all of the pain and torture (physical as well as mental) go away, I would do it in a heartbeat. The caveat is going through the health system only gets you involuntarily committed. Once that happens you lose any credibility you once had. I have purchased meters of all types to measure various frequencies and energies in my home. All I can say is that the levels I find are far above what is safe according to the World Health Organization. The hot spots are located in areas where no power lines, cables, devices or anything else exist.

       In my case, it started with organized crime. Drug dealers who had an axe to grind with me started by mobbing and stalking. Later it turned into full blown Gang Stalking. I cannot prove it but feel that the local Fusion Center, Citizens on Patrol, and the local government are all part of it. The amount of money going into this must be in the millions. A complete waste of money. I am not a criminal however the people that put into the program are. It's a very twisted logic that drives the program.

       I hope I've given you some food for thought. Maybe even helped you decide to believe. TIs need the general public to understand what this is and how they are funding it. The welfare for spying and torturing citizens needs to end. These people ultimately doing the dirty work for criminals and creeps.

       This is a really good point.  Assuming it's real, either it's the case that gangstalking is a form of intimidation by the deep state and cronies (secret societies / gangs), or if the TI's are randomly selected, then it's a kind of 'game' by and for the same.

       The element of this you are missing is the money. From all accounts I have read the way this works is a target is "reported" or "selected" by members of their respective community for whatever reason - being violent, not conforming, being a sexual predator or just angering a person connected to the program. These accusations do not need to be true. Being selected for this treatment is enough to the target in the program. Then the disinformation and rumor campaign begins. By the time the perps are done, everyone in the neighborhood will believe whatever it is they are selling. Once that happens, a consensus is taken through petition to put the person in the program. The. The money starts flowing. People are compensated for harassing, spying and torturing the target with DEWs. Those who just follow, spy on and harass are compensated in small ways (a tank of gas, a Target gift card) while those with homes located near the target are compensated more substantially (new cars). The people located near the target allow people into their home for training, observation of the target, host and maintain equipment and to harass and torture the target. They also supply room and board for perps and in some cases go on vacation allowing their home to be used by the perps.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's about the money. Most would not participate were it not for the money. Once these people get a taste of it they are hooked. Some of these perps make their living this way so it behooves them to always have someone in the program that is in their neighborhood. It keeps the money flowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also the hierarchy to be considered. The top perps are put on the payroll receiving regular paychecks, training and other perks. They are made to feel important. These are people with a low standing on the socio-economic ladder who have never had anything in their lives to make them feel important or useful. The impact of all of this is to make those who would otherwise be committing crimes and generally creating unrest feel as if they are heroes for saving the community from the target. In this respect Gang Stalking is a tool to keep subversive sectors of a community in check. It scapegoats the target by demonizing them taking the focus of subversive elements of their socio-economic situation and placing it on the target. So Gang Stalking, from a high level view, is a method to placate dissatisfied members of a community by giving them an object to focus their time, energy and hate on.
