       I've never understood this argument about 9/11.  I assume experts looked at the video and saw no problem.  This article seems to make sense:
       <a href="http://www.911myths.com/html/freefall.html">
        http://www.911myths.com/html/freefall.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the issue simply one of various people looking at the video and calculating fall times differently ?  There was so much dust and debris that I don't see how you could be very accurate about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if it was explosives, why would that make floors fall faster than free-fall ?  I assume explosives would target the key bolts or connectors, and be far too weak to push entire floors downward.  Just sever the connectors and let gravity take over.

       Sorry, not seeing the relevance to 9/11.  What are you claiming ?  That explosives were planted in such a way to drive floors downward ?  That's not how buildings are demolished, right ?  Why bother, let gravity do the work.
      </p>
      <p>
       And wouldn't explosives between two floors drive the lower floor down, but drive the upper floor up ?

       Let's make an experiment. We need a tower. And we need it to come down.

         It should have at least 20 (twenty) floors.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It should
         <em>
          somewhat

         It should be
         <em>
          somewhat
         </em>
         stable.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It must stand up on its own.
        </p>
       </li>

         You may initiate the "collapse" by picking up the top 1/4 of the tower and let it drop on the lower 3/4.

           amount of Zippo gas, kerosene or Diesel.

          It must not move (non-negligibly) for at least ten minutes.

          radially symmetric

       You are of course allowed to ask help from engineers, architects and experts. Don't bother any of the engineering and science subs, though, the topic is blacklisted on most of them.

       Still not understanding.  If connectors fail, either from fire or explosives, building falls the same way, right ?  So looking at how the building fell doesn't tell you whether it was fire or explosives.

       No,  I am saying that physics does not let a structure fall as if there is no support unless the support is removed.     In other words,   the rate of fall cannot approach free fall speed even remotely unless the structure below is compromised by intentional means.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes,  there was structural damage to the three demolished buildings on 9/11/01.   Yes,  there was fire damage to the three demolished buildings on 9/11/01.    However,   these obverved fall of the buildings,   rate of fall,  and symetry of fall is not consistent with the amount of structure that was remaining at the time of the fall.    The amount of structure in all three structures at the time of fall was very substantial.    The laws of physics would not have allowed for the kind of fall that was observed.    This has been demonstrated in scientific terms repeatedly by use of Newtonian principles.    Yet those who claim the official explanation are valid either have no data or refuse to share it.    Or you could take some of the laughable material that claims planes removed the interior columns,   or other such absurd claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mass slows down or stops the fall of mass unless the mass below is effectively cancelled.    Its that simple.    If the mass below had been more compromised,   or the fall slower,    or the fall partial,   or the fall less symmetrical,   then the obviousness of the official lie might be less apparent.    But the observed collapses obviously do not fit any physics model unless the physics is rigged.

       Here's a web page about this:

        http://www.911myths.com/html/freefall.html

       Seems to say the collapses, or one of them, took 1.5x to 2x the "free-fall" time.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it seems you're saying every floor must have been rigged with explosives, to remove the columns, right ?

       That's part of a section which explains why this is not mysterious; lower supports were completely overwhelmed by enormous moving mass from above.  If you're going to quote this, realize that it refutes your claims, doesn't support them:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The structure below the level of collapse initiation offered minimal resistance to the falling building mass at and above the impact zone. The potential energy released by the downward movement of the large building mass far exceeded the capacity of the intact structure below to absorb that energy through energy of deformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the stories below the level of collapse initiation provided little resistance to the tremendous energy released by the falling building mass, the building section above came down essentially in free fall, as seen in videos. As the stories below sequentially failed, the falling mass increased, further increasing the demand on the floors below, which were unable to arrest the moving mass.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, the momentum (which equals mass times velocity) of the 12 to 28 stories (WTC 1 and WTC 2, respectively) falling on the supporting structure below (which was designed to support only the static weight of the floors above and not any dynamic effects due to the downward momentum) so greatly exceeded the strength capacity of the structure below that it (the structure below) was unable to stop or even to slow the falling mass. The downward momentum felt by each successive lower floor was even larger due to the increasing mass."

       Probably not all of it.  Seems to say "fell at NEAR free-fall speeds, and here's why: when enormous mass gets moving, supports below it are snapped instantly by the enormous dynamic forces, hardly slow down the moving mass at all".  Do I have that right ?

       Exactly. Please, do us ALL, and yourself, a HUGE favor. Each time someone says the towers fell ALMOST at free fall speed, you bring up that braindead debunkster blog that "you assume you think seems to make sense to you" and proves that a bowling ball cannot fall through earth's atmosphere at FREE FALL SPEED, only ALMOST.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't do that. Your attempts at making truthers look stupid makes you look stupid, obtuse, and dishonest, and by now amounts to sheer trollery, forum sliding, and thick-headedness.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you can see,
       <strong>
        NIST themselves
       </strong>
       write in their FAQ that
       <strong>
        the structure below was unable to stop or even TO SLOW the falling mass
       </strong>
       (no slowing = free fall) and that
       <strong>
        the building section above came down essentially in free fall
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       No truther will EVER insist that the towers fell at 100% freefall rate. Nor did
       <a href="/u/rockytimber">
        /u/rockytimber
       </a>
       claim, as you
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3g0sl5/once_newtons_laws_of_motion_are_put_into_place/ctwpqis">
        insinuated
       </a>
       , that the buildings fell at free fall speed, only so you have an excuse to link that stupid propaganda pseudo-pop-science piece from 911myths.com to derail the discussion like only a paid government shill would.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it took the towers 14 seconds to come down, we're still talking about much, much more than 50% free fall. Do you understand that? Does that compute for you? Can you ASSUME that this CLAIM SEEMS REASONABLE and LOGICAL to you? Will you please stop hitting that poor, defenseless strawman each time the term "fall" is used?
      </p>
      <p>
       Make a note: the towers did not fall at a free fall rate. But not even NIST nor ANY OTHER government agency denies that the towers fell ALMOST, ESSENTIALLY, PRACTICALLY, FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES, NEARLY at a free fall rate. Not faster than freefall. Not at freefall rate. But close. WAY TOO CLOSE. Faster than a building can fall from fires alone. This needs to be properly investigated, because it never was.
      </p>
      <p>
       THIS IS THE CLAIM MADE, NONE OTHER, BY ALL HONEST, EDUCATED AND INTELLIGENT 9/11 TRUTHERS. Write it down somewhere. Do not insinuate otherwise. Do not build strawmen. Do not derail. Do not be obtuse. Do not troll. Do not shill.

       Sounds like you're butthurt that I gave the full text of what you were cherry-picking a few words from.  And the full text refutes your claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       NIST seems to be saying that "near free-fall speed" (or whatever words you want to apply to it) has an easy explanation: structure gets completely overwhelmed when large mass starts moving downward.  Structure is designed to support static weight, not upper 1/4 or whatever of the mass moving downward.  So the columns offer little resistance, and the building comes down at "near free-fall speed" (or whatever words you want to apply to it).

       Not saying that such a scenario is not possible in the real world,  for example,  a house of cards,  or a snowman.    This is the kind of scenario where scientists get out their calculators and do the math (calculus),  which in fact has been done,  and disclosed,  showing that there is a mathematical relationship between the rate of fall and the resistance of the mass below.    I have seen the math that debunks the NIST claim.    I have not seen NIST's math.    Or the math that has been supplied had ridiculous assumptions like the resistance of the core columns of WTC towers is not included in resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       So,  given an honest forum,  perhaps we could both agree on a position once a reasonable model of collapse is presented and the details disclosed instead of concealed.    I am willing to go with the physics as long as its not a sham.

       Okay, so now you're saying the NIST model could be right, or some other model could be right, experts on the evidence and the modeling of it would have to analyze the data and the models.  You've seen one model that claims to debunk the NIST model.  You make a claim that NIST didn't account for resistance of core columns in WTC.

       No,  I said that the NIST model has not been properly disclosed,  but that any model I have seen that was not purposely distorting things,  like claiming that the core columns did not exist,  has already been shown to rule out gravity alone as bringing down the buildings at the rate of observed fall,  and also to rule out the symmetrical nature of the fall through the point of greatest resistance.

       Well, sounds to me like an issue for experts.  What is the consensus of building engineers, civil engineering professors, etc around the world ?  There are millions of them.  Are millions of them saying "WTC collapse just doesn't make sense" ?  Are millions of them saying "NIST's model doesn't make sense, I can easily make a model that shows gravity alone is not enough" ?  Seems to me this would be front-page news if it were so clear, so obvious.  Seems to me that the insurance company experts would have been screaming bloody murder about this for the last 14 years.  Experts from inside NIST, experts they consulted would have been screaming about it for 14 years.

       Your claims regarding media reporting or professionals putting their futures on the line are not part of this conversation.     If you want to talk about the psychology of confronting official lies,   then that is another post,  another investigation.    There is a lot to say about that,  but I think you need to finish what you started here,  and recognize that even basic physics are not being dealt with.    In fact there is a huge psychological component of not even facing the physics.    Seemingly at play right now.

       When experts disagree,   reasonable people ask for further investigation,  ask for hearings where witnesses can be cross examined.    Or even look at other factors secondary to the matter,  such as the money trail.    Or political alliances.

       That would be fine if we were talking about some theoretical abstract principle that is on the far reaches of of scientific research.

      <p>
       But we are not.    We are talking about steel framed highrises that exist by the hundreds in the most populated regions of the planet.    We are also talking about the cornerstone of how modern nation states and their media/intelligencia operate.

       More than 3000 people were murdered on 9/11,   and hundreds of thousands have been killed since in the wars that were fought as a direct consequence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reasonable people like the archectects and engineers of 9/11 truth are presenting reasonable arguements to support their position and are getting mostly a bunch of troll like evasiveness in response from institutions and individuals who show again and again a lack of sincerity or even an outright distain for reasonable and conventional means of inquiry and investigation.    Its pretty obvious as time goes on that the questions are being handled in the context of brain washing and propaganda,  concealment and disinformation,   and not science,  the scientific method,   or the rule of law.     The level of non-disclosure and the level of cover-up is so obvious that this alone is grounds for an international tribunal.

       I think "the archectects and engineers of 9/11 truth" are just a fringe who are calling for a new investigation because, heck, it doesn't cost THEM anything to call for a new investigation.  Sure, we should always have LOTS of new investigations, of everything.  Investigations for everybody !

       The bottom line is what though,  besides your silly hunches about this and that?    That you have settled for a world where important questions are brushed off with half baked ill founded opinions?     That you promote the exact kind of rubbish that you are accusing the truthers of?    I see no interest on your part of even seeing a sensitivity analysis for the tipping point of collapse,  or even a care of the consequences of unjustified wars.    What kind of a person does this,  when so much is at stake.    Those pressing for truth are the real patriots,  and those settling for lies are the traitors.    I hope you live long enough for this to come and bite you personally in the ass.

       False. It corroborates the claim that the lower part of the structure provided essentially no resistance, only a little friction, to the fall.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        NIST seems to be saying that "near free-fall speed" (or whatever words you want to apply to it) has an easy explanation: structure gets completely overwhelmed when large mass starts moving downward. Structure is designed to support static weight, not upper 1/4 or whatever of the mass moving downward. So the columns offer little resistance, and the building comes down at "near free-fall speed" (or whatever words you want to apply to it).

       Now back on topic, the Laws of Motion: if structure is designed to support static weight (F = mg) (not even accounting for Factor of Safety), AS YOU AND NIST SAY, how can 1/4 of the mass completely displace the rest, namely, the lower 3/4?

       Um, one floor (or other similar relatively small piece) at a time ?  I know NIST says it wasn't a clean floor-by-floor collapse; instead each floor sort of sagged inward as part of a unit of floor and other stuff.  I didn't quite understand that part of their analysis.  But essentially it was some kind of progressive collapse.

       "NIST’s findings do not support the “pancake theory” of collapse, which is premised on a progressive failure of the floor systems in the WTC towers (the composite floor system—that connected the core columns and the perimeter columns—consisted of a grid of steel “trusses” integrated with a concrete slab; see diagram). Instead, the NIST investigation showed conclusively that the failure of the inwardly bowed perimeter columns initiated collapse and that the occurrence of this inward bowing required the sagging floors to remain connected to the columns and pull the columns inwards. Thus, the floors did not fail progressively to cause a pancaking phenomenon."
      </p>
      <p>
       But perhaps that is because I'm not an expert on building construction, don't know the details of how the WTCs were built, haven't seen their models, haven't seen the evidence.  So I assume not that they're lying and completely wrong, but that there are things I don't know.

       None of that. And you know it. I explicitly denied you when you tried to bully me into speculating and making statements I cannot possibly make with a clean conscience. And I have thoroughly explained to you my motivation to doubt the veracity of the official reports. Repeatedly. You are building strawmen again, you insinuate ulterior motives, and you assume only stupid people are 9/11 truthers. In a debate, you are obliged to counter the strongest possible interpretation of an argument. By not doing so, and worse even, putting words into my mouth, you only prove yourself to be intellectually dishonest, and quite desperate too.

       Good we got that out of the way: a.) You do not completely understand the official explanation. b.) you have not seen their models. c.) you have not seen their evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand: a.) you act as if you understand truther's explanation well enough to dismiss them, b.) dismiss their models because they are not precise 1:1 replicas of the Twins or million-dollar supercluster FEMs and c.) handwave all their evidence away as "coincidences" or come up with some far-out speculative nonsense to explain it away.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are NOT objective. If you were truly objective and skeptical and Socratic, you would give BOTH explanations the benefit of the doubt and try to address both as equally [in]valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did that. For ten long years. I debated truthers and debunksters. I was wrong and I was right.
      </p>
      <p>
       One day, I understood what happens and what doesn't happen when you build a tower, pick up its top 1/4 and drop it on the lower 3/4 and why total, vertical, progressive collapse requires SOME form - not necessarily explosives, mind you! - of additional energy, preparation, premeditation (that is why I
       <del>
        forced
       </del>
       <em>
        invited
       </em>
       you to do the same, by the way. Only through experience and experiment can you gain true knowledge, not by rote learning fancy engineering formulas or gullibly gobbling up everything some expert has to say).
      </p>
      <p>
       It looked like I would have to give up my neutral "I don't know" stance. So I studied all the official material I could get my hands on which all seemed way too complicated to me before. And I found that
      </p>
      <p>
       a.) there is no official explanation for the collapse itself (only up to the initiation), and NIST
       <em>
        explicitly
       </em>
       says, REPEATEDLY, that it failed to meet its prime objective.
      </p>
      <p>
       b.) they never released their models for public scrutiny, which is totally unacceptable when it comes to the scientific method (repeatability/falsifiability/verifiability).
      </p>
      <p>
       c.) they explicitly SAID they never looked for explosives, because they did not think they would find explosives, because everyone saw the planes crash, which is in direct violation of all applicable codes and protocols which EXPLICITLY demand that there be tests for exotic accelerants EVEN and ESPECIALLY if no loud bangs are heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       THAT is how I became a truther, not, as you try to tell yourself, by working from the pre-conceived conclusion "govt is evil" or "govt is lying" you always fall back on, but from the premise "I don't know, but it should be possible to exclude the impossible until what is left is the truth".

       You practically ADMITTED to being a believer, not a skeptic, not a truth-seeker, not an objective, Socratic asker of questions, that your whole conviction stands on the shaky ground of the assumption that these experts you place your whole trust in could not commit such a mistake, oversight, blunder or fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am willing and prepared to be proven wrong, it doesn't hurt me, I can only learn from that. I even told you how to prove me wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       You insist on being right, but by peeling away each layer of what seems to be your conviction, what remains is your steadfast BELIEF that the official narrative is true. You are utterly dependent on that belief. When all else fails, you always come back to "but muh experts". Your logic is circular. More enlightening debates can be had with flat earthers. At least they don't constantly rub their experts under one's nose.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you know what? It's okay. The world is even bleaker when you accept that not only does the government lie sometimes, not only are they lazy and incompetent sometimes, but that it has been subverted by a mafia-like gang that has outright betrayed and sold you out at a cheap price. Keep your youthful, naive innocence. No good can come from being a truther. You just end up questioning JFK, the Moon Landing Hoax and who knows, maybe the Jews were right all along and there IS an almighty God...

       Probably nothing.  Rice is pretty strong, at that scale.  The towers were mostly air, by volume.  The rice analogy would be like a solid-steel WTC tower, no empty spaces between floors, no room for people etc.  You have to be careful when comparing one scale to another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similar example: why can an ant fall 100x its height and be fine, while a human falling 100x its height will die ?  Because material strength doesn't scale linearly or whatever.

       Can you explain, in your own words, why the paper stretched over the loaf pan will not tear under the dynamic weight of the five pennies when the full penny jar stands on the paper and the five pennies drop into it, although the paper will tear if the penny jar does NOT weigh it down and the five pennies drop directly on the paper?

       Certainly not inevitable.  Would depend on what happens and how the building is constructed.  Hour-long raging fires in towers with no concrete ?  The experts say "collapse is perfectly reasonable".

       The implication of what I am saying is that something besides gravity accounts for how the buildings fell.    Sure,  that is an implication.

       But why should we focus on the implications as if it is our duty to handle them?    The physics is the physics.    Lets agree to follow the physics.     It will be up to a proper investigation to deal with the speculative matters,  the supposed implications.    What it takes to remove mass is not a simple matter.    For example,  there are some rather exotic techniques of demolition that do not require every floor to be rigged with explosives.    That is not my expertise,  nor yours.

       Mass is resistance to collapse.   Everyone agrees that structure damage equals a reduction to resistance to collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The disagreement is about the amount of resistance that would have remained in the structures at the time of collapse.    Gravitational collapse at near free fall speeds would require a great deal of structural resistance to collapse to be removed,   or the addition of a great deal of downward force.    No one is claiming that the downward force was added to by artificial means,  not that I am aware of.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be a lot of fun to play with a computerized model,  to alter the force values,  tweaking them until the tipping point is reached one way or the other.     Maybe someone will make a computer game of it.     Probably demolition companies already play around with computer simulations that do this.

       I think you are missing the difference between static and dynamic forces.  Nothing needed to be "removed"; the buildings never were designed to resist force of upper 1/4 of building falling downward onto lower 3/4, and that force was FAR greater than force of upper 1/4 stationary on top of lower 3/4.  See for example

       No,  I am aware of the difference between static and dynamic forces.   Are you suggesting that the dynamic forces were capable of attaining near free fall speed  of the buildings?     I suggest you check you math.    Dynamic forces are slowed by the structures they hit below them.     There is a projected model showing that sufficient dynamic load could in fact cause major damage to the WTC 1,  2,  and 7.    Take a look at what dynamic forces did to other partially demolished structures at the WTC site on 9/11,  there is plenty of evidence

       Agreed,  try catching a 50 lb bag of concrete from even five feet drop.    Yet,   if you are dumb enough to try,  you will still slow it down.     80 floors of slow down will probably still stop a fall somewhere short of total collapse.    It has been modeled.    Its not rocket science.   Who again is not doing their research?

       I have made the same points being made in these articles.    There were dozens of points of resistance on the way down.    Points of resistance that supposedly had not been compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like maybe some people on
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       sides of the argument would rather not see the debate resolved.     I say lets get a sensitivity analysis where we can identify the tipping point,  where the building would have stood,   and where the building would have fallen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Were the three buildings that fell at or near the tipping point for at least minutes before they fell?
      </p>
      <p>
       Theoretically the mass was incrementally less able to hold the buildings,  then  "whoosh",  the buildings fell.
      </p>
      <p>
       So,   if the weakening to the structures had been halted at a certain point,  the buildings would not have fallen in the way they did,  right?   Perhaps we would have seen some deformation.    Perhaps the buildings would have stood for days,  and there would have been a series of stages of crumbling down.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should be able to model that.   It would be very informative.    It might even show that the fall could only be attained by the sudden addition of destructive energy at the last minute.    Or maybe not.    To me it looks like the sudden addition of destructive energy was added at the last instant before implosion.   Look at the videos.    Listen to the audio as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess in the last example of the brick provided above,  you should be able to drop a brick on someones head from a certain height and the brick will pass through their body leaving a hole.

       As I read those web pages, the "points of resistance" were so weak compared to the dynamic force that they barely slowed down the collapse at all.  And the pages seem to say "nothing unusual about that, we don't design buildings to tolerate the dynamic force of upper part of the building falling onto lower part, we design for far lower static forces".
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as "Were the three buildings that fell at or near the tipping point for at least minutes before they fell?" and "if the weakening to the structures had been halted at a certain point, the buildings would not have fallen in the way they did", I think the answers are Yes.  If the fires had been put out before the towers fell, the heat-weakened steel would have cooled and strengthened and not failed, and the buildings wouldn't have collapsed.  But the fires went on and on, and at some point the steel weakened enough that it failed.  I don't think any "sudden addition of destructive energy at the last minute" was needed for that.

       More subjective evasiveness.    Show me the math on what happens to the massive core columns.     Oh,   the models you refer to don't factor them in,  how convenient.

       The fires were mostly above the point of collapse,   the steel below the point of collapse was not affected by heat or any loss of insulation.

       So,  your saying it fell by gravity,  but if explosives were used it would have taken so much explosive material that the logistics of exploding the building must be ruled out?    That is illogical.   If it would have taken massive amounts of explosives,  then that rules out gravity.    Its not my job to explain what happened.    Its my job to make it clear that the official story is a lie.

       I am claiming that physics proves that the rate of fall of the buildings on 9/11 is not explained by plane impact or fire.    Neither plane impact or fire as observed was capable of removing the resistance of existing mass of structure below the point of damage to achieve the observed rate of collapse.     Therefore additional investigation is necessary.    Independent investigation with sufficient disclosure for the public to have access to the models,  etc.    The present investigation is more of a cover up than an investigation.

       Actually, I think many tall buildings are NOT built the same way as WTCs.  Many have concrete cores, for example.

       Although I'm not sure it's right about "columns sheared off by the plane impact".  Is that part true ?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I'm trying to understand the claims.  Do I have this right ?
      </p>
      <p>
       1- Falling straight down is evidence of explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       2- Speed of fall ("free fall") is evidence of explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       3- In both cases, the explosives would have to be on all floors of the building, not just at floor 80 or whatever where the collapse started.

        ...The tubular systems are fundamental to tall building design. Most buildings over 40 - storeys constructed since the 1960s now use a tube design derived from Khan’s structural engineering principles, examples including the construction of the World Trade Center, Aon Centre, Petronas Towers, Jin Mao Building, and most other supertall sky scrapers since the 1960s . The strong influence of tube structure design is also evident in the construction of the current tallest sky scraper , the Burj Khalifa.

        Fazlur Rahman Khan, the father of tubular design, is the most influential structural engineer of the 20th century. He has been called the "Einstein of Structural Engineering" for his revolutionary work which remain fundamental to modern sky scraper construction.[7] His breakthroughs in structural engineering for tall and long-span buildings exerted an unprecedented and lasting influence on the profession, both nationally and internationally. With a career marked by a legacy of innovations that is unpeered, Khan has become an icon in both architecture and structural engineering.[51]

        Changes of structure with height. The tubular systems by F.R Khan are fundamental for super tall buildings. Khan's central innovation in sky scraper design and construction was the idea of the "tube" structural system for tall buildings, including the "framed tube", "trussed tube" and "bundled tube" variations. His "tube concept," using "all the exterior wall perimeter structure of a building to simulate a thin - walled tube, revolutionized tall building design " . The constructions of most super tall sky scrapers since the 1960s, including the construction of the World Trade Center, Petronas Towers and Jin Mao Building, employ a tube structural system.

       That is completely irrelevant to the topic at hand. Most buldings are unique in one way or another. It does not change the fact that all buildings obey the same laws of physics and are built to stand up.

       Interesting. First you say you don't understand and just ask questions. When I offer to help you understand, you refuse to make a simple, well-defined experiment to see for yourself how the Laws of Motion give us insight into the collapse mode of the Twins and instead expect me to debunk each page on your debunkster website. That, in turn, is a game I am not going to play, Bill :)

       It should be obvious: that if you build a tower, pick up its top 1/4 and drop it on the bottom 3/4, it will not exhibit total, progressive, symmetrical top-down collapse - unless you come up with a very complicated mechanism - because the Laws of Motion apply to a skyscraper as much as to a small-scale model.

       Asking you to do
       <em>

       work does not equal asking you to do MY work. You seem to expect all the answers and solutions to be thrown into your lap. Guess what. That happens to few. Most have to put some work into understanding. I am inviting you to do the same. I won't force you, but then you can't expect to magically be flashed by the sudden realization that "9/11 was an inside job!" or something.

      <p>
       A strawman argument, I never decided, said or hinted at the impossibility to make a model that, in its essence, matches the Twin's collapse mode. Quite the contrary, I know how to make a model that collapses straight down through itself from top to bottom symmetrically, progressively and completely - without any explosives even. My claim is that the Twins had to be built like that to collapse the way they did. It is my own personal conspiracy theory, I am its sole proponent, so no matter how many strawmen you build, none will resemble the actual argument I am making.

       You STILL expect things to fall into your lap. You have trouble understanding the concept of doing work, it seems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a different example. You don't
       <em>
        understand
       </em>
       electronics by looking at a picture of me adding a variable clock and a backlight to my Nintendo GameBoy. You'll have to get a soldering iron and some tin and a few potentiometers and fry an IC or two and burn your own fingers yourself, you see? That's how you learn and understand, and what you would actually
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       if really only "understanding" the argument was the real and true purpose of your posting.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are lazy, that is all. You'll become a truther the day the expert of experts comes along and speaks "The Twins were demolished" and you'll claim you knew it all along and those posts you made on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       back then were just you being Socratic.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you'll still not have an
       <em>
        understanding
       </em>
       of the how and why.
      </p>
      <p>
       What exactly is it you want to see anyways?
      </p>
      <p>
       A tower that buckles, leans, topples, shears or breaks off in a distinct sideways motion and as a whole?
      </p>
      <p>
       A tower that arrests the progression of the collapse?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or a model of a tower that completely and progressively falls apart from top to bottom, with a beautiful vertical-axial symmetry, once collapse is initiated?

      </p>
      <p>
       That is stupid, plain and simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how you approach, with all intellectual honesty, the arguments presented for and against a case?
      </p>
      <p>
       You commit another strawman fallacy by assuming I am trying to "convince people". I am not. I am well aware of my limitations. I can only invite them to convince themselves. You repeatedly rejected that invitation and complained that I'm not bringing the party to your house. You have no-one to blame for your intellectual laziness but yourself. I will not chew your food for you. I will not force-feed you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, you are the only one you are fooling successfully.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, I'll type slowly so you can keep up reading: if you build a tower, pick up the top 1/4 and drop it on the bottom 3/4,
       <em>
        at least
       </em>
       half of the tower will remain upright, unless the whole tower leans, topples, buckles or shears as a whole OR you put a lot of effort into specifically engineering a total collapse, which in the end will look like nothing you would want to claim the Twins were engineered like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just for comparison, this is your claim: "there's nothing to say a building CAN'T fall from fire the same way as in an explosion", "If connectors fail, either from fire or explosives, building falls the same way".
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is Newton's claim, a.k.a. the Third Law of Motion: "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction", or, to be more precise: "Actioni contrariam semper et æqualem esse reactionem: sive corporum duorum actiones in se mutuo semper esse æquales et in partes contrarias dirigi" -
       <em>
        To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.

       happen on 9/11 when you know fully well that I don't know, that I can't know, and that the whole point of the exercise is to make sure a new, independent investigation DOES find out what DID happen on 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get it? I'm not claiming anything happened on 9/11. I'm claiming that for a skyscraper like the Twins to come down like the Twins did, it does not suffice to slam a plane into it, you must
       <em>
        prepare
       </em>
       the building, one way or another, preferably similar to how other buildings that come down have to be prepared to come down because coming down from a fire looks vastly different. This difference is measurable in power.

      <p>
       And what was "rapid, orderly and directed" about the fires in the WTCs ?  They burned for about an hour, so not "rapid".  The collapse was orderly because it was directed by the structure of the building; the fires just triggered the collapse by weakening beams or connectors or something.

      <p>
       Nothing, obviously. That is why the rapid, orderly and directed collapse cannot be caused by ordinary fires, because those cause gradual damage, randomly, intermittently, assymmetrical, chaotically.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The collapse was orderly because it was directed by the structure of the building;
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Hear, hear. You are getting closer! So the building itself directed its own collapse downward. That sounds perfectly reasonable and I am sure you will name something else that does direct its own progressive collapse straight downward through itself so that your claim does not remain unsupported, far-fetched and pulled out of a place where the sun never shines.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the fires just triggered the collapse by weakening beams or connectors or something.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And what kept the chain reaction going once the fires triggered it? Why did it not come to a halt, like in most models you thought of before you came to the conclusion it's better to feign ignorance and stage an egg dance around the question on how to model the collapse mode?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't even try to shift the goal posts, old friend. You are the one who is making bold assumptions, far-fetched claims and unsupported statements.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have been given the fires themselves on a silver platter. You are allowed to just pick up the top 1/4 of the tower and drop it on the bottom 3/4 to initiate the collapse and model the fire-induced initiation. You don't have to worry about the fires. You said you don't understand how the Laws of Motion apply/did not apply to the Twins according to truthers' claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       There it is. You try with all your might to steer the topic away from the collapse mode itself and hope that no-one will notice if you just stress enough that the Towers were burning. So what. That MIGHT explain that they collapsed, but not the very specific way they collapsed: from top to bottom, progressively, symmetrically, straight down, instead of buckling, breaking off, shearing, leaning as a whole or just arresting the collapse.

       Yeah, I find little surprising about "structure of building directed how it collapsed".  Seems to be a common thing:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_collapse">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_collapse
       </a>
       And NIST did an analysis that says a similar but somewhat different thing happened in WTC towers; see item 8 of

       You are evading and shifting the goalposts. The progressive collapses on the Wikipedia page, except the Twins themselves, are all asymmetrical, sideways and/or partial and do not violate the Laws of Motion:
       <strong>
        just as I predicted
       </strong>
       . The topic at hand is a total progressive collapse from top to bottom, symmetrical and vertical, sudden and rapid; a collapse mode the NIST FAQ does not explain either, nor does the official report NIST NCSTAR 1, as I have proven in the last discussion we had by quoting from NIST NCSTAR 1 itself, where it explicitly says, twice, that it did not analyze or try to explain the collapse mode AT ALL ("for brevity"):

       You fool only yourself. You have no evidence, only speculation, wild hypothesises and appeal to authority. Nothing, nix, nada, zero, rien to support your assumption that it is normal for a slender thing to progressively fall apart when you pick up is top 1/4 and drop it on the bottom 3/4; and even your assumption that "experts looked at the collapse and found nothing wrong with it" is completely unfounded, because they explicitly SAY they did not look at it: because the Laws of Motion require an equally great action for a great re-action.

       The "experts" were probably told to put together a narrative, any narrative, that didn't involve explosives. Just look at the picture on the  page you linked, that is a picture of an explosion. I don't know if you're a real person and/or your website is just a front, but Building 7 was what convinced me of the truth. Yes, the government presented some scienticians to say there were no bombs, that does not mean there were no bombs.

       What size, according to the Size-Matters-Law, would a model have to have to exhibit a failure mode resembling that of the Twins? At what size and under which circumstances does the buckling/shearing/toppling/leaning as a whole that is usual for slender structures of most sizes transition to a symmetrical, vertical, progressive and complete cascade effect?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because Size-Matters-Law only says "When a physical object maintains the same density and is scaled up, its mass is increased by the cube of the multiplier while its surface area only increases by the square of said multiplier. This would mean that when the larger version of the object is accelerated at the same rate as the original, more pressure would be exerted on the surface of the larger object."

      <p>
       You really don't get it. There is a more fundamental problem. The thing you're quoting from wiki actually sort of explains this ("when the larger version of the object is accelerated at the same rate as the original,
       <strong>
        more pressure
       </strong>
       would be exerted on the surface of the larger object"). It's a bit cryptic because the formulation is very general, but what it means for a building is this: When scaling up a building, the mass increases by the scaling factor
       <strong>
        cubed
       </strong>
       , while the surface area only increases by the scaling factor
       <strong>
        squared
       </strong>
       . This means that at the footprint of the larger building, the pressure per area (and thus the stress on the material the building is made of) increases by the scaling factor. This means that a building made out of any arbitrary material can only be scaled up to the point where the stress on the material becomes too strong for it to handle. In the reverse, like building a perfect 1:100 model of WTC using the exact same materials, means the stress on the material will be 1/100th of the original building. So, even a "perfect" model
       <em>
        can not
       </em>
       behave like the real thing (
       <em>
        unless you put it on a planet with a surface gravity of 100 G's or something
       </em>
       ). You have to know exactly how much weaker the material needs to be, or compensate for the difference by adding mass, before you can even hope of getting a realistic result from your model.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence, in my other comment:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ... to build a model that behaves like an actual skyscraper you basically need to be an engineer, or at least, have a lot of time on your hands, to figure out which materials are both

        </strong>

       A big thing is, depending on the material, more fragile/liquid/brittle/soft than a small thing, so what, build a fragile tower then, it's specifically mentioned that size, scale, density, weight and layout are at the creative mind's leisure to adjust for scale as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may have noted that I require not a "realistic model", just something coming close to the behavior exhibited for, if you think about it, the only first time ever. Things don't do that, that is all. Progressively, from top to the bottom, along its vertical axis.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you internet experts and your "you have to know exactly" - no, you don't, it's about the principle as such.
      </p>
      <p>
       That specific collapse mode is hard to model, and it has nothing to do with Size-Matters-Law. Size does not turn things into Rube-Goldberg machines. Tall things at great sizes fall over, or buckle, or break, or shear or lean sideways as a whole just like small, soft, brittle, fragile, more liquid things.

       because you would have to build it on earth and beam it to that planet with Star Treks transporter system. If you
       <em>
        build
       </em>
       it on that planet, you will have to engineer it to stand up in its gravitation field. Then again, it will fall over/buckle/shear/lean/topple as a whole or arrest the progression and NOT exhibit total progressive, vertical, axially symmetric collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I admit I like your thinking. You could build a tower and put it into a centrifuge (with sufficient radius to minimize Coriolis effects) and thus enforce a straight down collapse.

       Yes, of course. Please, show me the model you built. You tried that yourself, right? So I don't have to tell you that to build a model that behaves like an actual skyscraper you basically need to be an engineer, or at least, have a lot of time on your hands, to figure out which materials are both heavy and weak enough for a small homemade model to behave like a real-life mega-structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can nitpick semantics all you want, but suggesting someone build a model to find an explanation of the argument
       <strong>
        you
       </strong>
       are making is simply braindead. How about some actual fucking answers instead of those smug responses. Maybe something like:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The damage an object can cause on impact is limited by it's speed and it's own structural strengh. For a simple (ideal) example, even a huge asteroid impacting the earth (large and fast enough that air resistance can be ignored) will only digg out a crater about as deep as the diameter of the asteroid. This is the case because the earths crust and a large asteroid have a quite similar density and "structure", and on impact, both sides get equally compressed (and then explode). So such an asteroid cannot compress more of earths crust than it can be compressed itself (assuming equal composition/density/etc). Contrast this to the bullet of a firearm hitting a body: it is much denser than a body, so it can penetrate much deeper into the body it's penetrating than it's own size. A bullet made out of soap (aproximatly the density of a human body) couldn't do that.
       </p>
       <p>
        A similar reasoning should apply to skyscrapers. Since the mass and structural strenght of all floors can be assumed to be roughly the same (if anything, it should be stronger at the bottom), you'd expect that on collision (eg. you instantly pull away a couple of floors somewhere in the middle of the building), for every floor that gets destroyed on the bottom half, another floor on the top half also get's pulverized. And of course, the mass is brought to a halt by the impact, so it no longer contributes in the process with the same strenght as before, because it used up it's momentum for the destruction (and as we see in the videos of the wtc collapse, a huge amount of that mass is blown out to the sides anyways). So on every step of the collaps, both the bottom
        <em>
         and
        </em>
        the top half loose a floor. So in theory, if you cut the building right in the middle, the entire building will collapse and will have
        <em>
         just
        </em>
        enough energy left for the top most floor to destroy the bottom most floor. No more, no less, because Newtons 3rd Law: For every action there is an equal and opposite re-action. Some demolition companies actually exploit that fact by doing exactly what I just describled; blowing out two floors right in the middle of the building [insert link to a video of that french demolition company here].
       </p>
       <p>
        Sooo.. what about the WTC? The collapse didn't start in the middle. Only the top 1/4 or so started to fall down, so you'd excpect that quarter managed to obliterate only itself and another quarter of the building. And that's under the assumption that it actually started to fall straight down, which is quite unlikely outside of a controlled demolition, and we actually have video of the tip of at least one tower falling to the side instead of down onto the rest of the building. To add to this, in such a collapse scenario the top half would actually decelerate while it's bottom floors are ramming into the rest of the building, but instead, we can even see it accelerating, eg it is (at least almost) in freefall. Note that wheter or not what we're seeing is really freefall acceleration is actually irrelevant here. The fact that it is accelerating at all, instead of slowing down, doesn't make sense in such a collapse scenario. So at the very least, something else besides the pancake collapse had to be going on, and you'd think that structural engineers who build thousands of large skyscrapers like this around the world would be very interrested in the why and how of this very unusual event. Instead, the demonstrably false idea that is was simply a pancake collapse like describled above is the accepted explanation. That is pretty weird.

       That is an actual fucking explanation of your argument, and I'm not even sure it is applicable in that case, but so far I'm the only one who even seems to have an understanding of wtf this thread is actually about, because everyone else is just immediatly pointing fingers at people who are asking wtf this thread is actually about, when everyone who understands wtf this thread is actually about should know that it isn't at all obvious without some prior knowledge, and pretending that it is makes you look like some smug idiot who doesn't understand wtf this thread is actually about, or *

       That's obviuosly false. Clearly, a tower
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       take itself apart completely, symmetrically and progressively from top to bottom when it is just tall enough, and
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni70KXe5jPo">
        here is the proof
       </a>
       . Even though no weight bears down on the tower, the collapse, once initiated by an infinitesimally small activation energy, is unstoppable, by virtue of being
       <em>
        tall
       </em>
       , which clearly shows you don't understand vérinages or structural engineering at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems high rise engineering is not as simple as your high school understanding of Newton's Laws of Motion and has only little to do with an asteroid impacting a planet's surface.

       That is correct, you never made an effort to explain either. All I see is you complaining about me not explaining the way you would explain.

       I guess that part also was addressed to someone else, I despise these "shill" and "bots" accusations at least half as much as you do for a quite similar reason and that is why I borrowed the term "debunkster" and like "faither" a lot. I believe these are real people who, deep in their hearts, care enough to expose themselves to the ridicule that should come with the belief in the inevitability of total progressive collapses (I do not see you defending flat-earthers with the same dash and grit). So probably they WANT to be convinced. But I refuse to do that. I want them to convince themselves. This is a free country. You don't force-feed people here. I can only make it as appetizing as possible. I'm doing my best. This debate started because you had to acknowledge I tried at least.

       I am not "refusing to understand".  Your statements make no sense to me, and don't seem connected.  You cite some basic physical law, and order me to make a model, and seem to think those two are connected and explain 9/11.  When asked to state your claims, you refuse or can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until you spell out the steps of the argument, I'm not going to be able to understand what you're claiming about 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried to spell out what I thought was your argument (and maybe that of others here), and you avoided confirming that.  Let me try again, with more details:
      </p>
      <p>
       1- Falling straight down is evidence of explosives.  No building can fall straight down unless there are explosives.  Fire always results in an asymmetric fall, not a straight fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       2- Speed of fall ("free fall") is evidence of explosives.  No building can fall "fast" unless there are explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       3- In both cases, the explosives would have to be on all floors of the building, not just at floor 80 or whatever where the collapse started.  Otherwise, a progressive collapse initiated by a fire at floor 80 or whatever would look just like a progressive collapse initiated by explosives at floor 80 or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I have the claims right ?

       Oh, you understand alright, otherwise, you would not kick and scream and whine and complain so much about the invitation to make a simple experiment to see for yourself how the Laws of Motion apply to a slender structure. And you would not have to try and mispresent what I am saying.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        if you build a tower, pick up the top 1/4 and drop it on the bottom 3/4, at least half of the tower will remain upright, unless the whole tower leans, topples, buckles or shears as a whole OR you put a lot of effort into specifically engineering a total collapse, which in the end will look like nothing you would want to claim the Twins were engineered like. [...] For a skyscraper like the Twins to come down like the Twins did, it does not suffice to slam a plane into it, you must prepare the building, one way or another, preferably similar to how other buildings that come down have to be prepared to come down because coming down from a fire looks vastly different. This difference is measurable in power.

       Yeah, it's perfectly reasonable to demand that people build models to prove their side of a debate, they're not allowed to use existing facts or reasoning.  Happens all the time on reddit, everyone has to build models to support their side of every debate.

        Yeah, it's perfectly reasonable to demand that people build models to prove their side of a debate

      <p>
       Actually, it is. It is called the scientific method. Experiment or GTFO. If it disagrees with experiment, it's wrong. Pretty straightforward concept. You don't get to make things up as you please. Your experiments must be repeatable. Your predictions must be falsifiable and verifiable.

       They are. "Fire-induced building collapses are indiscernible from controlled demolitions" is neither an existing fact nor reasoning, though, nor is the "assumption" that "experts looked at the collapse and saw no problem".

       You are entirely disingenouous. I asked you

       <p>
        What exactly is it you want to see anyways?
       </p>
       <p>
        A tower that buckles, leans, topples, shears or breaks off in a distinct sideways motion and as a whole?
       </p>
       <p>
        A tower that arrests the progression of the collapse?
       </p>
       <p>
        Or a model of a tower that completely and progressively falls apart from top to bottom, with a beautiful vertical-axial symmetry, once collapse is initiated?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You never answered, and I can tell you why.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I say "I built a tower model, picked up the top 1/4, dropped it on the bottom 3/4, and there was considerable crushing and compression, but collapse was arrested and the tower remained half as tall as before", will anyone require proof - or will everyone say "well duh, of course, what did you expect?"
      </p>
      <p>
       If I say "I built a tower model, picked up the top 1/4, dropped it on the bottom 3/4, and the tower leaned/sheared/toppled/buckled as a whole and essentially fell over", will anyone require proof - or will everyone say "well duh, of course, what did you expect?"
      </p>
      <p>
       If you say "In my gedankenexperiment, it makes perfect sense that when I pick up the top 1/4 of the North Tower and drop it on the bottom 3/4, the tower totally, progressively, vertically, symmetrically and at, on average, more than 50% g, falls straight down through itself", then yes, you better build a model or provide an experiment because it makes no sense at all because
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_depth">
        when two things collide, the smaller, lighter and less dense thing cannot totally crush the bigger, heavier and denser thing
       </a>
       , because for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, so every cubic centimeter of the top 1/4 will only be able to crush, at most, one cubic centimeter of the bottom 3/4. You are making outlandish claims and you need to back them up, that is all. You can tell me you have a pink Ferrari in your garage, and I might believe you, but if you tell me it is amphibious and has VTOL capacities, you better post a YouTube video to prove my skepticism unwarranted.

        And let me make a prediction.

      <p>
       <em>

        If I built a model and it showed what you wanted, you'd say "PROVEN!".
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If, IF you build a model and you manage to make it show a total, progressive, vertical top-down collapse, AND you give sufficient instructions on how to confidently repeat your experiment, it will
       <em>
        of course
       </em>
       be
       <em>
        obvious
       </em>
       that my prediction was right: it will be a domino contraption, or its top alone will be as heavy as the rest of the structure, or the whole tower will be under huge, but well-balanced tension in one of many other ways - which is extremely hard to accomplish, much much harder than building a tower that is so weak it buckles and falls over under its own weight - or it will hang by a rope from the ceiling). My prediction is that it will be
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       obvious that you will have a very hard time rationalizing that that is how the towers were engineered. You, at least, will not say "PROVEN WRONG!" without getting red ears.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But if I built a model and it DIDN'T show what you wanted, you'd say "INACCURATE!".
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes, of course. If it falls over, or buckles or breaks or shears as a whole, or if the progression of the collapse is arrested, it supports my prediction.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is one way for you to "win" this of course: build a tower. Pick up the top 1/4. Drop it on the bottom 3/4. Make it collapse completely, vertically, progressively. And then convince me that a)
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       is how the Twins were designed b) more/most/all skyscrapers are designed like that c) things automatically turn into a contraption like that when they are scaled up.

        Smoking Gun
       </strong>
       : Free fall occurred in Building 7's collapse for 2.25 seconds. NIST was attempting to cover this up, but a physics teacher called them out at the public draft hearing. Surprisingly, in its final report released in November 2008, NIST finally acknowledged free fall, but dishonestly placed it in bizarre framework that continues to deny its clear significance. This video series was created by the man who forced NIST to admit free fall occurred and displays the brazenness of the NIST WTC7 coverup.

        Seems to say "fell at NEAR free-fall speeds,
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Exactly. Please, do us ALL, and yourself, a HUGE favor. Each time someone says the towers fell ALMOST at free fall speed, you bring up that braindead debunkster blog that "you assume you think seems to make sense to you" and proves that a bowling ball cannot fall through earth's atmosphere at FREE FALL SPEED, only ALMOST.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't do that. Your attempts at making truthers look stupid makes you look stupid, obtuse, and dishonest, and by now amounts to sheer trollery, forum sliding, and thick-headedness.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you can see,
       <strong>
        NIST themselves
       </strong>
       write in their FAQ that
       <strong>
        the structure below was unable to stop or even TO SLOW the falling mass
       </strong>
       (no slowing = free fall) and that
       <strong>
        the building section above came down essentially in free fall
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       No truther will EVER insist that the towers fell at 100% freefall rate. Nor did
       <a href="/u/rockytimber">
        /u/rockytimber
       </a>
       claim, as you
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3g0sl5/once_newtons_laws_of_motion_are_put_into_place/ctwpqis">
        insinuated
       </a>
       , that the buildings fell at free fall speed, only so you have an excuse to link that stupid propaganda pseudo-pop-science piece from 911myths.com to derail the discussion like only a paid government shill would.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it took the towers 14 seconds to come down, we're still talking about much, much more than 50% free fall. Do you understand that? Does that compute for you? Can you ASSUME that this CLAIM SEEMS REASONABLE and LOGICAL to you? Will you please stop hitting that poor, defenseless strawman each time the term "fall" is used?
      </p>
      <p>
       Make a note: the towers did not fall at a free fall rate. But not even NIST nor ANY OTHER government agency denies that the towers fell ALMOST, ESSENTIALLY, PRACTICALLY, FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES, NEARLY at a free fall rate. Not faster than freefall. Not at freefall rate. But close. WAY TOO CLOSE. Faster than a building can fall from fires alone. This needs to be properly investigated, because it never was.
      </p>
      <p>
       THIS IS THE CLAIM MADE, NONE OTHER, BY ALL HONEST, EDUCATED AND INTELLIGENT 9/11 TRUTHERS. Write it down somewhere. Do not insinuate otherwise. Do not build strawmen. Do not derail. Do not be obtuse. Do not troll. Do not shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now carry on. Thank you for your attention.

       Good we got that out of the way: a.) You do not completely understand the official explanation. b.) you have not seen their models. c.) you have not seen their evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand: a.) you act as if you understand truther's explanation well enough to dismiss them, b.) dismiss their models because they are not precise 1:1 replicas of the Twins or million-dollar supercluster FEMs and c.) handwave all their evidence away as "coincidences" or come up with some far-out speculative nonsense to explain it away.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are NOT objective. If you were truly objective and skeptical and Socratic, you would give BOTH explanations the benefit of the doubt and try to address both as equally [in]valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did that. For ten long years. I debated truthers and debunksters. I was wrong and I was right.
      </p>
      <p>
       One day, I understood what happens and what doesn't happen when you build a tower, pick up its top 1/4 and drop it on the lower 3/4 and why total, vertical, progressive collapse requires SOME form - not necessarily explosives, mind you! - of additional energy, preparation, premeditation (that is why I
       <del>
        forced
       </del>
       <em>
        invited
       </em>
       you to do the same, by the way. Only through experience and experiment can you gain true knowledge, not by rote learning fancy engineering formulas or gullibly gobbling up everything some expert has to say).
      </p>
      <p>
       It looked like I would have to give up my neutral "I don't know" stance. So I studied all the official material I could get my hands on which all seemed way too complicated to me before. And I found that
      </p>
      <p>
       a.) there is no official explanation for the collapse itself (only up to the initiation), and NIST
       <em>
        explicitly
       </em>
       says, REPEATEDLY, that it failed to meet its prime objective.
      </p>
      <p>
       b.) they never released their models for public scrutiny, which is totally unacceptable when it comes to the scientific method (repeatability/falsifiability/verifiability).
      </p>
      <p>
       c.) they explicitly SAID they never looked for explosives, because they did not think they would find explosives, because everyone saw the planes crash, which is in direct violation of all applicable codes and protocols which EXPLICITLY demand that there be tests for exotic accelerants EVEN and ESPECIALLY if no loud bangs are heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       THAT is how I became a truther, not, as you try to tell yourself, by working from the pre-conceived conclusion "govt is evil" or "govt is lying" you always fall back on, but from the premise "I don't know, but it should be possible to exclude the impossible until what is left is the truth".

      <p>
       You practically ADMITTED to being a believer, not a skeptic, not a truth-seeker, not an objective, Socratic asker of questions, that your whole conviction stands on the shaky ground of the assumption that these experts you place your whole trust in could not commit such a mistake, oversight, blunder or fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am willing and prepared to be proven wrong, it doesn't hurt me, I can only learn from that. I even told you how to prove me wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       You insist on being right, but by peeling away each layer of what seems to be your conviction, what remains is your steadfast BELIEF that the official narrative is true. You are utterly dependent on that belief. When all else fails, you always come back to "but muh experts". Your logic is circular. More enlightening debates can be had with flat earthers. At least they don't constantly rub their experts under one's nose.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you know what? It's okay. The world is even bleaker when you accept that not only does the government lie sometimes, not only are they lazy and incompetent sometimes, but that it has been subverted by a mafia-like gang that has outright betrayed and sold you out at a cheap price. Keep your youthful, naive innocence. No good can come from being a truther. You just end up questioning JFK, the Moon Landing Hoax and who knows, maybe the Jews were right all along and there IS an almighty God...

       As I read those web pages, the "points of resistance" were so weak compared to the dynamic force that they barely slowed down the collapse at all.  And the pages seem to say "nothing unusual about that, we don't design buildings to tolerate the dynamic force of upper part of the building falling onto lower part, we design for far lower static forces".
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as "Were the three buildings that fell at or near the tipping point for at least minutes before they fell?" and "if the weakening to the structures had been halted at a certain point, the buildings would not have fallen in the way they did", I think the answers are Yes.  If the fires had been put out before the towers fell, the heat-weakened steel would have cooled and strengthened and not failed, and the buildings wouldn't have collapsed.  But the fires went on and on, and at some point the steel weakened enough that it failed.  I don't think any "sudden addition of destructive energy at the last minute" was needed for that.
