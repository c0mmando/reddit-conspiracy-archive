       Why is it that the only surgeries Bruce underwent are all reversible? He hasn't had the sex change or voice change (both irreversible) yet he claims he's had a desire to be a woman since childhood. Here's why $$$$$$$$$$$$$$

       How do you know it isn't genuine?

      <p>
       Aside from that, you called
       <strong>
        her
       </strong>
       a freak of nature, which prompted my response. Even if she is faking it (I see now real reason to believe this), calling a transgender a freak is bigoted.

       That's the whole point, I do not think he is being genuine. I have nothing against Trans people. However, if this man is doing it for the money/fame, then yes, he is a freak-of-nature (imo).

       How could you possibly know that she is faking?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have an evidence? Can you read her mind? Do you have a close relationship with the family?
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I'm concerned, if an adult tells me they want to identify as a different gender, I should respect that, no matter what I feel about their motivations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, say she is faking, what harm is she actually doing? If this wasn't the thing people who follow this type of thing are concerned with, there would be some other celebrity fad to follow. I dislike celebrity worship as much as the next guy, but its not like Kaitlyn Jenner is the thing keeping people from becoming activists.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, even if it isn't genuine, the whole saga serves to help transgender acceptance in America and around the world, which is objectively a good thing.

       Biology the person's chromosomes... Is that so hard to understand? No amount of surgery hormone therapy changes a persons chromosomes. Does not matter what is on the outside Dr. Frankenstein it's what's on the inside that determines what a person is. It is not my opinion its fact.

       Of course, but you understand that, as a progressive society, most people now accept that not everyone feel comfortable in the skin their biology afforded them? So we accept that they may want to identify as a different gender? At least here in Canada, almost everyone I know is cool with that. After all, its not like it actually effects me.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, again I ask. Who are you to tell people that they can't identify socially as something other than their biological organs indicate?

       It is not for me to say. I have no power what a person does with their body. I will actually get real with you. I have two close friends who are transgender. People I have known all my life. One mtf one ftm. Both are pretty far along in the process and I have nothing against what they choose to do with their bodies. Every life is a personal journey.

       But the way it is portrayed in the media is disgusting. Bruce Jenner makes what my friends go through look so fake. He never suffered anything. He has never experienced what young poor trans people feel. Imagine being a poor young person who can't afford what Cait can. Imagine how someone feels who can't afford to continue treatment when they loose a job.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what Caitlin is doing is driving a nail in the coffin of true trans acceptance. He is not trans. He is a cross dresser. My friend who spent her life savings to become how she really feels inside is not Caitlin. Caitlin is a fake. A fraud and a divide and conquer tool.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know nothing. Because my opinion is my opinion does not mean I respect someone who is trans. I do not. I merely disagree philosophically with the idea one gender can become another. The trans is a gender in itself. I respect them and do not mis gender them. But cover girl doesn't cover boy.

       It is not for me to say. I have no power what a person does with their body. I will actually get real with you. I have two close friends who are transgender. People I have known all my life. One mtf one ftm. Both are pretty far along in the process and I have nothing against what they choose to do with their bodies. Every life is a personal journey.

       Generally people who give a fuck about transgender people don't declare their identity a scam. Not without good evidence at least.

       You're missing the point, it's beyond transgeneder... If Jenner could make millions for simply dressing like a woman, why not? especially since he didn't get irreversible procedures. Its just odd, that's all, and being in "reality" entertainment, it seems like a possibility. You shouldn't go around accusing everyone of being a bigot.

       So basically people can claim whatever they want here without being expected to actually produce and evidence? And if anyone asks for evidence they are told not to, as you are doing now?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, that seems to me the absolute worst way to pursue any form of truth. But, I'll bet if I asked, most people here would say this is the best place to find truth. Sounds like the community wants to have their cake and eat it too? They want immunity from being called out on their wild, evidenceless assertions, but also want to be taken seriously as pursuers of truth.

       Those people agree with the premise, others look at it and think ok well its possible, etc... You find truth by asking questions and considering different things. Its also helpful to approach things as if you believe it to see what evidence there might be. Its a great skill to be able to approach something you dont believe with the mindset as if you do...i feel like youre just playing PC police and/or looking to be offended,

       Because it's a premise....people either agree if they agree or if they don't agree, they come at it from a neutral perspective and say whether they think it's possible, probable, or not at all... I think you're taking this the wrong way.... If you want this thread to be your "ha look at how dumb r/conspiracy is!" example, go right ahead.

       Then the title is wrong and the tone of the OP is wrong. If they just wanted to speculate with no evidence they should not have made declarations like "caitlyn is a liar".
      </p>
      <p>
       People use language to differentiate intentions in discussion. If OP had said, "I think it is suspicious that this Jenner situation is getting so much attention, thoughts?" Or something along those lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling someone a liar in the title is not an invitation for a discussion, its a claim. I have every right to question it and it is extremely disheartening that you are trying to tell me I shouldn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm done. Good luck not asking for evidence, but I'm going to keep doing it.

       Seems like a flimsy assumption. There wording was very clearly an assertion and a claim.

       Because you've spent a dozen comments trying to tell me a shouldn't be asking for evidence for a
       <strong>
        very, very clear assertion
       </strong>
       . The idea that this sub has some different idea of how the English language works is absurd. This is textbook "just asking questions" techniques, in which someone makes a clear claim or attack, and when Some asks them to back it up, all of a sudden they are "just asking questions" or "presenting an idea". It's a laughably transparent attempt to remove responsibility for their own claims.

       No I'm saying this is a premise....if it's a premise that interests you, then go look for evidence. Comment with what you found or didn't find, and tell your opinion on the premise....you just want to think we are all a bunch of idiots that jump to conclusions over 3 words.

       Am I justified in telling you that you should not be asking for justification of this claim? Does it really seem like I am just presenting a premise, or making a claim against you? You know damn well which on it is.

       Well, part of transgender (as well as all LGBT) acceptance is having the respect to not demand someone to justify their gender identity or sexuality. Could she be faking it? Of course. Does that mean OP is justified in calling her a liar with no evidence to back it up... fuck no.

       I used the term bigot in response to someone who referred to her as a freak of nature. That comes as bigoted. (The user explained a little better what they meant, and while I don't agree, I don't necessarily think that it is bigoted anymore)

       When I first heard about the whole transgender thing I was like sure, cool whatever, good on him for being who he wants to be, just thought the announcement seemed very staged. Then when I heard of that show, a bell went off and all I could think was.. That's too bad.  Maybe that's the woman in him wanting to flaunt himself, but it looks more to me like he is imprisoning himself.

       Of course, but you understand that, as a progressive society, most people now accept that not everyone feel comfortable in the skin their biology afforded them? So we accept that they may want to identify as a different gender? At least here in Canada, almost everyone I know is cool with that. After all, its not like it actually effects me.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, again I ask. Who are you to tell people that they can't identify socially as something other than their biological organs indicate?
