<p>Aside from that, you called <strong>her</strong> a freak of nature, which prompted my response. Even if she is faking it (I see now real reason to believe this), calling a transgender a freak is bigoted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How could you possibly know that she is faking?</p>

<p>Do you have an evidence? Can you read her mind? Do you have a close relationship with the family?</p>

<p>As far as I&#39;m concerned, if an adult tells me they want to identify as a different gender, I should respect that, no matter what I feel about their motivations.</p>

<p>Further, say she is faking, what harm is she actually doing? If this wasn&#39;t the thing people who follow this type of thing are concerned with, there would be some other celebrity fad to follow. I dislike celebrity worship as much as the next guy, but its not like Kaitlyn Jenner is the thing keeping people from becoming activists.</p>

<p>In fact, even if it isn&#39;t genuine, the whole saga serves to help transgender acceptance in America and around the world, which is objectively a good thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course, but you understand that, as a progressive society, most people now accept that not everyone feel comfortable in the skin their biology afforded them? So we accept that they may want to identify as a different gender? At least here in Canada, almost everyone I know is cool with that. After all, its not like it actually effects me.</p>

<p>So, again I ask. Who are you to tell people that they can&#39;t identify socially as something other than their biological organs indicate? </p>

<p>But the way it is portrayed in the media is disgusting. Bruce Jenner makes what my friends go through look so fake. He never suffered anything. He has never experienced what young poor trans people feel. Imagine being a poor young person who can&#39;t afford what Cait can.

<p>I think what Caitlin is doing is driving a nail in the coffin of true trans acceptance. He is not trans. He is a cross dresser. My friend who spent her life savings to become how she really feels inside is not Caitlin. Caitlin is a fake. A fraud and a divide and conquer tool. </p>

<p>You know nothing. Because my opinion is my opinion does not mean I respect someone who is trans. I do not. I merely disagree philosophically with the idea one gender can become another.

<p>So basically people can claim whatever they want here without being expected to actually produce and evidence? And if anyone asks for evidence they are told not to, as you are doing now?</p>

<p>So, that seems to me the absolute worst way to pursue any form of truth. But, I&#39;ll bet if I asked, most people here would say this is the best place to find truth. Sounds like the community wants to have their cake and eat it too? They want immunity from being called out on their wild, evidenceless assertions, but also want to be taken seriously as pursuers of truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those people agree with the premise, others look at it and think ok well its possible, etc... You find truth by asking questions and considering different things. Its also helpful to approach things as if you believe it to see what evidence there might be.

<p>Seems like a flimsy assumption. There wording was very clearly an assertion and a claim.</p>

<p>Because you&#39;ve spent a dozen comments trying to tell me a shouldn&#39;t be asking for evidence for a <strong>very, very clear assertion</strong>. The idea that this sub has some different idea of how the English language works is absurd. This is textbook &quot;just asking questions&quot; techniques, in which someone makes a clear claim or attack, and when Some asks them to back it up, all of a sudden they are &quot;just asking questions&quot; or &quot;presenting an idea&quot;. It&#39;s a laughably transparent attempt to remove responsibility for their own claims.</p>

When I first heard about the whole transgender thing I was like sure, cool whatever, good on him for being who he wants to be, just thought the announcement seemed very staged. Then when I heard of that show, a bell went off and all I could think was.. That&#39;s too bad.  Maybe that&#39;s the woman in him wanting to flaunt himself, but it looks more to me like he is imprisoning himself. </p>

<p>On what fucking planet am I living on where this is something to comdemn someone for?</p>

<p>Oh is evidence not important here? I assumed it would be? </p>

<p>I&#39;m the only one in this thread addressing the OP&#39;s claim.</p>

<p>It is not my fault people are disagreeing with me. I will address responses directed at me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course, but you understand that, as a progressive society, most people now accept that not everyone feel comfortable in the skin their biology afforded them? So we accept that they may want to identify as a different gender? At least here in Canada, almost everyone I know is cool with that. After all, its not like it actually effects me.</p>

<p>So, again I ask. Who are you to tell people that they can&#39;t identify socially as something other than their biological organs indicate? </p>
