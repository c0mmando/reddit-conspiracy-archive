       I don't really have real reasons to doubt him. It's more of a gut feeling type of thing. Kind of like they're testing how viable a virtual platform is.
      </p>
      <p>
       On paper he seems wonderful. In fact, I'll probably vote for him. But does anyone else feel like there's another side to this?

       Before I started earnestly supporting him I paused and thought about this. 
I thought he was going to split the democratic vote and give the election to Jeb. But after seeing him say he wouldn't seek a third party nomination I was assuaged. Maybe he's just that genuine. Go look at his older speeches. He may just be the real deal.

       Yup, I'm not a fan of him purely because of his stance on Palestine but he is as genuine as any other person out there. I mean the man organized civil rights sit ins as early as 1962.
      </p>

       The saddest part is that we've been trained to be so beat down when a genuine candidate does show up we can't trust him,

       He's the Left's Ron Paul, an older guy with an educated (relatively speaking) base, who are progressive, older, and love WeAreChange petitions (hint: overeducated, unemployed, and politically disatisfied millenials, who could be a FUCKING FORCE but he is meant to corrall them). Fuck, some of them may have even read some Marx.

       They're somewhat savvy social media users, who think they
       <em>
        know what's going on
       </em>
       . Bernie'll say whatever they think, be he
       <em>
        does know what's going on
       </em>
       , and it's his job to pull the base to the Left (
       <em>
        or the appearance of this, at least
       </em>
       ) so he can throw his support behind Warren when Hilary fizziles out (do not forget, there's
       <em>
        emails
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        Bengazi
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        Haiti
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        The Foundation
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        I Could Go On
       </em>
       ) and she gets this version of the Swift Boats For Truth.

      <p>
       They'll bring in the Woman, The Professor, The Consumer Watchdog - and she'll make Student Loans be her thing (that I'm sure will be a huge exercise in doublespeak) as well as those damn TPP/UN Climate Change Resolutions she can shepherd in. She'll be this Cycle's Carter, a 1-termer.
      </p>
      <p>
       But she won't be able to do it
       <em>
        without Bernie
       </em>
       .

       It really isn't healthy to assume everything good is actually a trojan horse. Bernie has been on the right side of history and issues for decades. He's the real deal. What happens after he becomes president and what pressures are put on him, who knows. But he truly is a good guy who deserves support. All you have to do is notice the silence from the media. It's like the status quo has seen a specter wandering the halls.

       He's  been saying the same things since the 1960s. Try and find a more consistent candidate.  What you see is what you get. He wants  to support the middle class and reduce corporate and bankster ownership of out government and return that power to the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       In spite of  all that, people here seem to respond to him in stereotypes and cliches like "Jewish," "Zioinst," "unelectable," "socialist."
      </p>
      <p>
       If he were the perfect construct of a candidate he would be 10-20 years younger.
      </p>
      <p>
       To some people there is no perfect candidate. They just like to complain while  refusing to get involved in the process themselves.

       Sometimes you cant make a big difference, only a small one. Collectively, small differences add up to big ones.

       I have been reading a lot of mpc.com (my posting history) threads and...
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, the thing that immediately jumps at me is that the hardcore right and alt-right issues are THE SAME as the left and alt-left issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police brutality, corruption of our political system, the law enforcement harassment, constant wars, constant immigration.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that the greatest threat/worry for the neoliberals and neoconservatives (who are THE SAME THING) is a political union of alt-left and alt-right guys ON THE ISSUES THAT MATTER.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why the wedge issues are sought and amplified to divide us, the normal, working folks, that is why the race relations are amped up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is done to divide the population - the importation of 3rd world immigrants main goal is to further polarize our societies so that we are less and less homogenous.

        The more we fight with each other at the bottom for scraps, the more the top can get away with.

       He's managed to piss off both side of the gun issue. Vermont is an "anyone can carry without a permit" state, and he is OK with that.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Bernie Sanders is taking a position on the Second Amendment that aims to straddle both gun rights and gun control, with protections tailored to needs. Sanders says that guns in locales where hunting is a way of life, and in states where gang violence is a way of life, are two completely different cultures, and laws need to take both into consideration.

       "Certain types of guns" - fully auto, machine guns, maybe even 50 cals. A lot of people may agree with that. The second amendment and case law provide for "regulated"

       Automatic firearms are already regulated. Let's say he goes after and somehow successfully bans .50 caliber weapons and pistols. Would you still consider him to be pro-second amendment?

       I feel you are being unnecessarily defensive about Bernie because you like him.  I'm being critical of his stance for the same reason.  I like Bernie but he's on the absolute wrong side of this issue.

       From  your perspective, not everyone's. I know you have a lot of allies, but there are a whole host of people out there who favor responsible gun regulation. (defining "responsible can be tricky," I get that.) But some people do favor gun control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I am uncomfortable with civilian availability of 50 cals. I own  guns and support the second amendment, but it does say "well regulated."
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, Bernie has pissed off both sides of this issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not a one issue voter, and if i was, that issue wouldnt be guns. The NRA, which represents gun manufacturers, not gun owners, has behaved in an incredibly sleazy manner, acting in its own self interest.

       Let me put it like this: He's on the wrong side of the Constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bill of Rights does indeed say "well regulated...". That is in reference to a (let's continue the phrase!) "well regulated
       <em>
        militia
       </em>
       " -- whereas a militia is defined as any male over the age of 17.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only information in the amendment having anything to do with limitations on citizens to having firearms states that these rights "shall not be infringed".  A civilian can own machine guns (although you have to pay for a tax stamp) and .50 caliber guns are easy to purchase by anyone with the money and inclination. I don't feel endangered in the least.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree with you on the NRA, though.  They're pretty scummy but I do see them as an ally on these issues as they have the most money (which is how you get things done in Washington, sadly).  I like the Gun Owners of America,  personally.

       Absolutely. Seeing how ravenously some of my friends are supporting him reminds me of supporters for Obama's first campaign on meth.  Even if he is to get elected and genuinely has a desire to affect change, the only change he'll be successful in affecting is that which the shadow government already wants.

       Obama is a constitutional law professor and he threw it (edit - the constitution) out the window. Do we really expect a man who has been elected so many times to do any different?

       So, your attempt to smear Bernie Sanders indicates to me that you feel threatened by him, that you are a right-winger who is attempting to perform mischief on behalf of your troll-factory employers, or you are a freelance troll.

       He's a Zionist, and not going to win the democratic primary because brown people like me won't vote for him.

      <p>
       Why would I need to smear him? He's doing a great job ruining his own campaign by getting these terrible headlines about black lives matter.

      <p>
       It's probably the Hilary campaign sending these hecklers. They make him look like a senator from Vermont who has never seen a black woman.

       He's Jewish and is saying he's going to take down the banks/get money out of politics. That's as farfetched as Obama saying he will heal the world. It's hope and change v 3.0. If people fall for this

       I'm not so sure. There's plenty of worldwide Jewry that openly opposes Zionism. Despite the fact that 90% of Congress is beholden to Israel, this support is concentrated in Washington, the media and Hollywood. A financially powerful group, but one with a small membership. This is what they're so scared of.

       Simple solution would be to stop being dicks. This is what Bernie Sanders seems to be saying. At least to me, an interested British observer.

       Exactly. If we of all people can become compromised and believe in the system again it will show that they can wave false hope in our face and be subdued, just like everyone else. They just play off what we want to hear. More change.

       on the nose. I'd like to think Sanders has the interest of the people. Just because he is of jewish descent, doesn't necessarily mean he is in favor of Israel. Well, saying anything the wrong way about Israel is political suicide. It is a tight rope. If you want to get ahead in any political game, Israel's brand cannot be challenged; tread lightly.
      </p>
      <p>
       No politician has the quick fix to all of our problems. If he wins the oval office, who knows what will happen. Maybe we'll see small steps in the direction we need to go. Maybe he'll bend over to wall-street and the banks and begin taking it balls deep. Maybe he'll start to look like the next JFK, making waves, and then gets brained by the CIA (Weekend at Bernie's II).
      </p>
      <p>
       All of our leaders have never seem genuine. I am weary of it all, but if I'm going to decide to cast a vote for the first time in my life I don't see the harm in helping him overtake Hillary. Or at least try to.

The Americans who are working on the Black Lives matter project in no way interfer with Bernie Sanders. This is a false attempt to create conflict. Nice try.

       Let me put it like this: He's on the wrong side of the Constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bill of Rights does indeed say "well regulated...". That is in reference to a (let's continue the phrase!) "well regulated
       <em>
        militia
       </em>
       " -- whereas a militia is defined as any male over the age of 17.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only information in the amendment having anything to do with limitations on citizens to having firearms states that these rights "shall not be infringed".  A civilian can own machine guns (although you have to pay for a tax stamp) and .50 caliber guns are easy to purchase by anyone with the money and inclination. I don't feel endangered in the least.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree with you on the NRA, though.  They're pretty scummy but I do see them as an ally on these issues as they have the most money (which is how you get things done in Washington, sadly).  I like the Gun Owners of America,  personally.
