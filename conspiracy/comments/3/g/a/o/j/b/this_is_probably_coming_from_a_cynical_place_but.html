    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s the Left&#39;s Ron Paul, an older guy with an educated (relatively speaking) base, who are progressive, older, and love WeAreChange petitions (hint: overeducated, unemployed, and politically disatisfied millenials, who could be a FUCKING FORCE but he is meant to corrall them). Fuck, some of them may have even read some Marx.</p>

<p>They&#39;re somewhat savvy social media users, who think they <em>know what&#39;s going on</em>. Bernie&#39;ll say whatever they think, be he <em>does know what&#39;s going on</em>, and it&#39;s his job to pull the base to the Left (<em>or the appearance of this, at least</em>) so he can throw his support behind Warren when Hilary fizziles out (do not forget, there&#39;s <em>emails</em> and <em>Bengazi</em> and <em>Haiti</em> and <em>The Foundation</em> and <em>I Could Go On</em>) and she gets this version of the Swift Boats For Truth.</p>

<p>They&#39;ll bring in the Woman, The Professor, The Consumer Watchdog - and she&#39;ll make Student Loans be her thing (that I&#39;m sure will be a huge exercise in doublespeak) as well as those damn TPP/UN Climate Change Resolutions she can shepherd in. She&#39;ll be this Cycle&#39;s Carter, a 1-termer.</p>

<p>But she won&#39;t be able to do it <em>without Bernie</em>.</p>

<p>He&#39;s  been saying the same things since the 1960s. Try and find a more consistent candidate.  What you see is what you get. He wants  to support the middle class and reduce corporate and bankster ownership of out government and return that power to the people.</p>

<p>In spite of  all that, people here seem to respond to him in stereotypes and cliches like &quot;Jewish,&quot; &quot;Zioinst,&quot; &quot;unelectable,&quot; &quot;socialist.&quot;</p>

<p>If he were the perfect construct of a candidate he would be 10-20 years younger.</p>

<p>To some people there is no perfect candidate. They just like to complain while  refusing to get involved in the process themselves.</p>

<p>Sometimes you cant make a big difference, only a small one. Collectively, small differences add up to big ones.</p>

<p>Well, the thing that immediately jumps at me is that the hardcore right and alt-right issues are THE SAME as the left and alt-left issues.</p>

<p>Police brutality, corruption of our political system, the law enforcement harassment, constant wars, constant immigration.</p>

<p>I believe that the greatest threat/worry for the neoliberals and neoconservatives (who are THE SAME THING) is a political union of alt-left and alt-right guys ON THE ISSUES THAT MATTER.</p>

<p>That is why the wedge issues are sought and amplified to divide us, the normal, working folks, that is why the race relations are amped up.</p>

<p>Everything is done to divide the population - the importation of 3rd world immigrants main goal is to further polarize our societies so that we are less and less homogenous.</p>

<p>Bernie Sanders is taking a position on the Second Amendment that aims to straddle both gun rights and gun control, with protections tailored to needs. Sanders says that guns in locales where hunting is a way of life, and in states where gang violence is a way of life, are two completely different cultures, and laws need to take both into consideration.</p>

<p>From  your perspective, not everyone&#39;s. I know you have a lot of allies, but there are a whole host of people out there who favor responsible gun regulation. (defining &quot;responsible can be tricky,&quot; I get that.) But some people do favor gun control.</p>

<p>Personally I am uncomfortable with civilian availability of 50 cals. I own  guns and support the second amendment, but it does say &quot;well regulated.&quot;</p>

<p>As I said, Bernie has pissed off both sides of this issues. </p>

<p>I am not a one issue voter, and if i was, that issue wouldnt be guns. The NRA, which represents gun manufacturers, not gun owners, has behaved in an incredibly sleazy manner, acting in its own self interest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me put it like this: He&#39;s on the wrong side of the Constitution. </p>

<p>The Bill of Rights does indeed say &quot;well regulated...&quot;. That is in reference to a (let&#39;s continue the phrase!) &quot;well regulated <em>militia</em>&quot; -- whereas a militia is defined as any male over the age of 17.</p>

<p>The only information in the amendment having anything to do with limitations on citizens to having firearms states that these rights &quot;shall not be infringed&quot;.  A civilian can own machine guns (although you have to pay for a tax stamp) and .50 caliber guns are easy to purchase by anyone with the money and inclination. I don&#39;t feel endangered in the least.</p>

<p>I do agree with you on the NRA, though.  They&#39;re pretty scummy but I do see them as an ally on these issues as they have the most money (which is how you get things done in Washington, sadly).  I like the Gun Owners of America,  personally. </p>

<p>He&#39;s a Zionist, and not going to win the democratic primary because brown people like me won&#39;t vote for him.</p>

<p>Why would I need to smear him? He&#39;s doing a great job ruining his own campaign by getting these terrible headlines about black lives matter. </p>

<p>It&#39;s probably the Hilary campaign sending these hecklers. They make him look like a senator from Vermont who has never seen a black woman. </p>

<p>on the nose. I&#39;d like to think Sanders has the interest of the people. Just because he is of jewish descent, doesn&#39;t necessarily mean he is in favor of Israel. Well, saying anything the wrong way about Israel is political suicide. It is a tight rope. If you want to get ahead in any political game, Israel&#39;s brand cannot be challenged; tread lightly. </p>

<p>No politician has the quick fix to all of our problems. If he wins the oval office, who knows what will happen. Maybe we&#39;ll see small steps in the direction we need to go. Maybe he&#39;ll bend over to wall-street and the banks and begin taking it balls deep. Maybe he&#39;ll start to look like the next JFK, making waves, and then gets brained by the CIA (Weekend at Bernie&#39;s II). </p>

<p>All of our leaders have never seem genuine. I am weary of it all, but if I&#39;m going to decide to cast a vote for the first time in my life I don&#39;t see the harm in helping him overtake Hillary. Or at least try to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me put it like this: He&#39;s on the wrong side of the Constitution. </p>

<p>The Bill of Rights does indeed say &quot;well regulated...&quot;. That is in reference to a (let&#39;s continue the phrase!) &quot;well regulated <em>militia</em>&quot; -- whereas a militia is defined as any male over the age of 17.</p>

<p>The only information in the amendment having anything to do with limitations on citizens to having firearms states that these rights &quot;shall not be infringed&quot;.  A civilian can own machine guns (although you have to pay for a tax stamp) and .50 caliber guns are easy to purchase by anyone with the money and inclination. I don&#39;t feel endangered in the least.</p>

<p>I do agree with you on the NRA, though.  They&#39;re pretty scummy but I do see them as an ally on these issues as they have the most money (which is how you get things done in Washington, sadly).  I like the Gun Owners of America,  personally. </p>
