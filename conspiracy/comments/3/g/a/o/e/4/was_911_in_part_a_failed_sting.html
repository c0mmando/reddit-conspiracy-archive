        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Richard Clarke has argued this.  And it would explain many facts, such as the idea that 2 of the hijackers could live in the US and have a landlord that was an FBI informant.  And the idea that the hijackers could train and get flight lessons in US flight schools without raising alarm.  It would explain Michael Springman&#39;s statement that he gave VISAs to 15 of the 19 even though he told his bosses it was suspicious.  It would explain the FBI agent at the 20th hijackers trial who said he told his bosses SEVENTY times that an attack was going to happen soon.  </p>

<p>We know Saudi Arabia and the Bin Laden&#39;s were CIA assets.  Bin laden and Al Queda assisted the US in the war against Russia.  And Bin Laden also helped the US in Bosnia.  </p>

<p>Bin Laden&#39;s family intimately knew Bush&#39;s family.  </p>

<p>I think its likely the US, FBI, CIA and Bush all looked the other way:</p>

<p>Because,</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Bin Laden&#39;s were close friends of the US government.  Osama helped us in the past.  We looked the other way because of his past help.  &quot;Lets ignore the &quot;crazy&quot; Osama, he may be crazy but his family is super important friends of ours&quot;.  its easy to look the other way about some crazy relative, when the Bin Laden&#39;s were active and influential US allies.  </p></li>
<li><p>Letting the hijackers in the US to live and train, was a result of their past help.  Al Queda helped us in the past in the Russia and Bosnian wars, why wouldn&#39;t the US allow them to freely enter the US?  We considered the hijackers allies.  Bin Laden was a paid CIA informant.  Its likely the hijackers also enjoyed this status.  </p></li>
<li><p>The US knew how bad Bin laden was, what the hijackers were planning, they knew from multiple scores of people that an attack was imminent, yet the CIA, FBI, no one did anything.  Why?  Clarkes assertion is that it was a sting gone wrong.  We had hoped to turn some of these informants and hijackers.  And instead we got played, and 3000 people lost their life.   The CIA played a dangerous game, gambled and 3000 people died.  </p></li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>Clarke was a limited hangout. Whatever happened with the hijackers, the World Trade Center buildings 1, 2, and 7 were destroyed in a controlled demolition and NORAD stood down and let all those planes fly around for HOURS.</p>

<p>That wasn&#39;t an accident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can sort of see your point.  Clarke is a fascinating character.  He&#39;s a whistleblower, but he&#39;s also strikingly conventional.  He still believes the war on terrorism is a legit fight and that terrorism is real.  </p>

<p>I think his main point was that while he believes Cofer Black and Rich Blees  and Armitage, and others who knew of the Malaysian Plot and did nothing and said nothing, that they are criminals but that these are abherrations, in a system that he believes usually works well.  So I see your point.  But I also think what he says is compelling.  </p>

<p>In dealing with people who believe the official story, I often argue with people who believe the &quot;US didnt know, Bush didnt know&quot;.  And I think Clarke presents a story, where we did know.  They did know.  And as he says, he&#39;s trying to understand why.  Why his coworkers tracked the hijackers, let them in the country, knew they were planning an attack, and why these coworkers and bosses wouldn&#39;t alert anyone.</p>

<p>Clarke&#39;s statement that someone, specifically Blee, Armitage and Black, interfered with protocol and essentially interfered with the e-mail system so that Clarke and his coworkers wouldn&#39;t receive information about the Malaysian plot.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Long before the Richard Blee movie, Clark was on TV, meeting with 9/11 families, and giving a limited hangout line. </p>

<p>Everyone with a half a brain knows that WTC 1, 2, and 7 were destroyed in a controlled demolition, which means someone had access to the buildings before 9/11. Clark knows this but he still pretends like &quot;the 19 Saudi hijackers&quot; were the beginning and end of the plot.</p>

<p>Which means Clark is basically full of shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But thats whats so odd about him.  he&#39;s both.  He;s trotting out the party line, but at the same time is suggesting that Black, Blee and Armitage and everyone who listened to the Malaysian plot tapes and did nothing, are as responsible for the death of 3000 people too.  </p>

<p>He also if I remember correctly is the one who made public the idea that Rumseld, that day, had said &quot;lets connect this to iraq&quot;.  </p>

<p>His whistleblowing is fantastic and I think his conclusions about a possible sting gone wrong are fascinating.  </p>

<p>But his theory that the war on terrorism is a legitimate fight worth having, is laughable.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clark says that Tenet took him off of the email list about the Saudi cell. I think he&#39;s just mad he was cut out of the loop. He was a star at the 9/11 hearings because he admitted that the government &quot;failed.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear you.  Ive seen many interviews with the guy, and he&#39;ll be saying something I totally agree with one minute but then be arguing that we need to go after ISIS the next minute and its like &quot;huh&quot;?  </p>

<p>But I dont know.  I think Ryan had him on his list of &quot;Another 19&quot; and it could be argued Clark was involved.  Or knew.</p>

<p>But he&#39;s also made us aware of alot of information too.  </p>

<p>Suggesting what he is suggesting is a huge deal, and its what many of us all believe.  That Tenet, Black, Blee and others are directly responsible for 9/11.  </p>

<p>But I think thats sort of the messy nature of whistleblowers.  Wasn&#39;t Deep Throat a Republican?  He wasn&#39;t an antiwar, hippie person who wanted to end the war in Vietnam.  </p>

<p>The government knew these people, they trained them and were on CIA payrolls like Osama was.  Allowing them to come to the US, was a no brainer.  &quot;We worked with these people before, they fought for us in 2 wars.  We trust them.  Let them into the US&#39;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you believe anything other than the fact that 9/11 was a dick cheney/ don rumsfeld production - you are probably incorrect.</p>

<p>It was an inside job. It did exactly what it was designed to do.</p>

<p>The best thing to do is not look at the details leading up to the event, but the repercussions following it.</p>

<p>The patriot act, the war in afghanistan were direct results. The government has had more control thanks to 9/11 and the population just sits by while it happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the father of &quot;Johnny Taliban&quot; the Bush administration was pretty much set to recognize the Taliban government before 9/11. The Taliban had agreed to allow a pipeline through.</p>

<p>At Tora Bora, the US Army stood down and allowed an air lift of Osama Bin Laden and the core &quot;Al Qaeda&quot; to fly into Pakistan. This was discussed at the time, the flights were shown on live TV news, Army sources later complained bitterly about it.</p>

<p>Hell, in 2004, John Kerry himself brought it up at the freaking Presidential debates. There&#39;s no questioning what happened - the Bush administration purposefully allowed Osama Bin Laden and his core Al Qaeda team fly into Pakistan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>indeed.  Osama&#39;s bro was at the White House meeting with Bush the father on the morning of 9/11.  And Bin Laden&#39;s family was flown to safety in the days after 9/11, when everyone else in the US was banned from flying at all.  </p>

<p>Its clear Bin Laden and his family had deep connections inside the US and the government.</p>

<p>Which was largely my original point.  If someone is as valuable to the American government as Bin Ladens family was, then ignoring and backing off Osama would make sense from that standpoint.  Harassing Osama would only hurt ties with his family.  And it would not benefit the US financially or strategically.  </p>

<p>its as Clarke said, those people at the top valued their jobs and money more than the safety of the american people.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clarke&#39;s theory rests on the notion that the CIA let 3,000 people get murdered because they didn&#39;t want to be blamed for running an illegal operation in the US. That is the explanation he gave when asked why the CIA didn&#39;t tell the FBI. The CIA did tell the FBI in late August. So Clarke&#39;s explanation is already contradictory. He passes off the sharing as low level. This is an aburd comment. The FBI UBLU was the unit that received the information. They were the Bin Laden unit! It would have taken one phone call for anyone at the UBLU to tell the FBI Director. It&#39;s such a stupid story to pretend that everyone at the UBLU was a moron.</p>

<p>Clarke (and others) fails to explain why even after the FBI was told about al-Hazmi and al-Mihhdar in late August the FBI side investigation was also obstructed. Remember we were told the US intel community was in panic mode. Yet somehow anyone who attempted to investigate the hijackers was obstructed. The failed recruitment explanation doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>yeah, I&#39;m not really seeing Alqueda mentioned here bro.  </p>

<p>My main point is its silly to blame just Bush and Cheney as someone did in the above comments.  It wasn&#39;t just a land grab for oil and Iraq.  It was a score of people, corporations, entities, all with different agendas, all working in concert together. </p>

<p>As I said before, Al Qeuda, the billion member group of suicidal terrorists thirsty for American blood is a myth.  But I do think, a small group does exist or did exist.  Those al Queda members were CIA trained and on the pay roll.  This is documented extensively.  Al Queda helped us fight against Russia and in Bosnia.  And Osama was on the CIA payroll.  </p>

<p>Whether the 19 hijackers did fly the planes I have no idea.  Its clear they weren&#39;t who the media has told us.  But I do think Atta, and Bin laden and others and his associates did exist.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do think, like Oswald, its likely that the hijackers were patsy&#39;s.  They had assisted us in the past, we were friendly with Osama and his buddies, and we let them in the country.  And then we pinned the blame on them for 9/11 or the gov&#39;t caused 9/11 and then put the blame on Bin Laden.  That is a definite possibility.  </p>
