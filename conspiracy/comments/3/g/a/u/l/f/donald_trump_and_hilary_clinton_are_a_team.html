       In the first debate, Trump reminded everyone that he is used to buying politicians to get favors, and specifically Hillary Clinton. He also refused to say that he wouldn't run as a third party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is going out of his way to appeal to the Republican far right while simultaneously turning off moderates. He has no hope of winning the election, though, so why run? Answer: because he gets something out of it. What does he get out of it? Publicity? Sure, he loves publicity. But he loves business favors more.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here's my theory: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have an agreement. Trump will make a joke out of himself and the Republicans while simultaneously appealing to the conservative base. After he loses the nomination, he runs as a third party, spoiling the election to the Democrats, whose nominee is most likely Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton is then in a position to give major contracts/favors/whatever to Donald Trump. Alternately, the Clinton Foundation will give Trump a great deal of business.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's win/win for Trump. He needs publicity, and this is a good way to get it. Plus, if Hillary wins, it's good business, and she owes him a big favor. If she doesn't win, he still gets a huge amount of attention and sells Celebrity Apprentice 17 or whatever for huge prices. And it's win/win for Hillary. If Trump gets the nomination or runs as a third party, it's great news for her. If she loses the election, she doesn't have to do anything for him anyway, and if she wins, that's worth far more than owing Trump a few favors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put another way, if candidate Trump did not exist, Clinton would want to create him. As candidate Trump does exist, I theorize that Clinton DID create him, or at least further incentivize him to exist.

       It seems like a classic "never trust the new guy who volunteers to buy the dynamite" situation. This movement is gaining momentum, police brutality is suddenly regularly reported, and now they are after...Bernie Sanders? The guy who marched with MLK? The only dude on the ballot who isn't a racist? The Clintons also have a history of using their (fake) southern cred to court black voters. Even that interruption did not prevent 15,000 people from showing up to a rally later that night.

       Mostly, Donald Trump is running to help Israeli Zionist Jews prevent Obama from signing a nuclear deal with Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, the Zionist Jews want America to bomb Iran for them. Just like Zionist Jews got us into the war against Iraq. Zionist Jews love it when Americans spend our blood and money for them. That's why Zionist Jews like Chuck Schumer run for office in America - to help their country, Israel.

       But what I said is correct. The reality is, Jews will call you "anti-semitic" for any reason, or no reason at all, any time you criticize Israel.

       The Jew laughs while the common folk squabble over trivial bullshit like Donald trump and Megyn Kelly beef. Not one mention of the Fed or anything else that matters in that debate. It's time for Rand to push trump off the podium and echo his fathers war cry of "end the fed". Only a retard would believe that this Trump thing is some grassroots anti-establishment movement.

       Listening to Paul and Christie go back and forth about the warrant-less searches of peoples data was VERY fascinating. We all know that the government does this -- Paul kept talking about warrant-less searches and Christie kept saying "that doesn't exist, you don't know what you're talking about, blah blah".

       This isn't a conspiracy, this is 1992 and Ross Perot all over again...

       Perot not only ended up siphoning votes off of Bush Sr. when he switched to a 3rd party, but also poisoned a lot of potential voters against him with the nasty advertisements and attacks during the debates.

       Right, but Perot really did want to win, I think. And before he went double crazy and temporarily withdrew over threats on his family and stuff, he was starting to look like he had a reasonable shot.

       Well let's say the mechanism is similar regardless of the collusion of the actors. I highly believe Hillary and Trump are working together though. I can't believe that people can't seem to remember the 90's when Trump was most definitely a Democrat.

       I disagree, but I can see why you think so. The problem where your theory breaks apart is no one can buy Trump. His ego won't let him and his bank account makes it impossible. Sure he COULD be bought, but who has enough cash? Dude has more money than our country does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Naw, he's in this for his own ego and that is why everyone on both sides are out after him

       I disagree, you can "buy" a rich man by promising to make him richer. He already has said he likes to buy off politicians and make them do what he wants, so how is this any different?
      </p>
      <p>
       If he can get Hillary into office, she will owe him MASSIVE favors which he can use to get richer, acquire more power, etc. I don't think anyone is suggesting that Hillary is paying him in actual money.

       I think trumpy is used to gauge the strength of the anti-immigrant (especially anti Mexico/Latin America immigrant) sentiment in this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       In many European countries openly talking badly about immigrants and government(s) immigration policy leads to an arrest; we have ways to go to catch up.

       This is an interesting theory, but it's very short on evidence. From what I can see, most of the people pushing the notion seem to be Republicans who want to discredit Trump (because he is not in-synch with the party machine).
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump thinks he has a fighting chance of getting to the White House, there's no way he's going to suddenly give up and hand the keys to Hillary.

       I 100% agree with your theory, and it was a thought that was already scratching at the back of my head.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think that the media and pollsters are lying when they say he is leading the polls(or manipulating poll data to fit their narrative), in order to gaslight people into thinking he is more popular than he is and making moderates feel disfranchised by the republican voter base.

       Been saying this all along. Hillary will win, running against a complete retard from the red team (not Trump), after Trump destroys the red camp.
They want the lesbian queen in the white house after the black homo.
Another little TPTB joke at our expense I guess.

       Lose a lot of credibility calling a man with two children a homosexual.  And sure, her marriage is a sham, but you don't gain points for calling her a lesbian.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory is legit, Trump probably is a Clinton machine puppet, but you come off as a bigoted asshole with the homosexual slurs

       So you think the GOP nominee will be a complete retard (insinuating that the all the GOP candidates are stupid), you think Obama is a "black homo" and Hillary is a "lesbian queen". Who do you like?

       There are two major problems with your theory.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Sarah Palin wasn't the Republican Nominee, she lost the primary
       </li>
       <li>
        She didn't run as an independent, nor did she threaten to if she lost the primary.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The GOP doesn't want Donald Trump. He, and the media are forcing himself on us.
