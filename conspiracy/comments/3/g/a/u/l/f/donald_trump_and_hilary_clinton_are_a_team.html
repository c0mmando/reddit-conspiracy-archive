        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the first debate, Trump reminded everyone that he is used to buying politicians to get favors, and specifically Hillary Clinton. He also refused to say that he wouldn&#39;t run as a third party.</p>

<p>Trump is going out of his way to appeal to the Republican far right while simultaneously turning off moderates. He has no hope of winning the election, though, so why run? Answer: because he gets something out of it. What does he get out of it? Publicity? Sure, he loves publicity. But he loves business favors more.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s my theory: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have an agreement. Trump will make a joke out of himself and the Republicans while simultaneously appealing to the conservative base. After he loses the nomination, he runs as a third party, spoiling the election to the Democrats, whose nominee is most likely Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton is then in a position to give major contracts/favors/whatever to Donald Trump. Alternately, the Clinton Foundation will give Trump a great deal of business.</p>

<p>It&#39;s win/win for Trump. He needs publicity, and this is a good way to get it. Plus, if Hillary wins, it&#39;s good business, and she owes him a big favor. If she doesn&#39;t win, he still gets a huge amount of attention and sells Celebrity Apprentice 17 or whatever for huge prices. And it&#39;s win/win for Hillary. If Trump gets the nomination or runs as a third party, it&#39;s great news for her. If she loses the election, she doesn&#39;t have to do anything for him anyway, and if she wins, that&#39;s worth far more than owing Trump a few favors.</p>

<p>Put another way, if candidate Trump did not exist, Clinton would want to create him. As candidate Trump does exist, I theorize that Clinton DID create him, or at least further incentivize him to exist.</p>

<p>It seems like a classic &quot;never trust the new guy who volunteers to buy the dynamite&quot; situation. This movement is gaining momentum, police brutality is suddenly regularly reported, and now they are after...Bernie Sanders? The guy who marched with MLK? The only dude on the ballot who isn&#39;t a racist? The Clintons also have a history of using their (fake) southern cred to court black voters. Even that interruption did not prevent 15,000 people from showing up to a rally later that night. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably.</p>

<p>Mostly, Donald Trump is running to help Israeli Zionist Jews prevent Obama from signing a nuclear deal with Iran.</p>

<p>You see, the Zionist Jews want America to bomb Iran for them. Just like Zionist Jews got us into the war against Iraq. Zionist Jews love it when Americans spend our blood and money for them. That&#39;s why Zionist Jews like Chuck Schumer run for office in America - to help their country, Israel.</p>

<p>But what I said is correct. The reality is, Jews will call you &quot;anti-semitic&quot; for any reason, or no reason at all, any time you criticize Israel.</p>

<p>Or they will engage in hand wavery about &quot;Jew vs. Zionist&quot; etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just theatre.</p>

<p>I think trumpy is used to gauge the strength of the anti-immigrant (especially anti Mexico/Latin America immigrant) sentiment in this country.</p>

<p>In many European countries openly talking badly about immigrants and government(s) immigration policy leads to an arrest; we have ways to go to catch up.</p>

<p>Protip - look up his daughter&#39;s conversion to &quot;the bestest religion ever&quot; (well, after scientology, of course, all hail lord Zenu).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an interesting theory, but it&#39;s very short on evidence. From what I can see, most of the people pushing the notion seem to be Republicans who want to discredit Trump (because he is not in-synch with the party machine).</p>

<p>If Trump thinks he has a fighting chance of getting to the White House, there&#39;s no way he&#39;s going to suddenly give up and hand the keys to Hillary. </p>

<p>I also think that the media and pollsters are lying when they say he is leading the polls(or manipulating poll data to fit their narrative), in order to gaslight people into thinking he is more popular than he is and making moderates feel disfranchised by the republican voter base.</p>

<ol>
<li>Sarah Palin wasn&#39;t the Republican Nominee, she lost the primary</li>
