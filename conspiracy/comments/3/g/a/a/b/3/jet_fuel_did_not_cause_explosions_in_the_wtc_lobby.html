        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://digwithin.net/2013/11/17/jet_fuel/"><strong>Jet Fuel Did Not Cause Explosions in the WTC Lobby</strong></a></p>

<hr/>

<p>NIST admitted to the presence of an incendiary explosion at the concourse level, (NIST NCSTAR 1-7, p 73, but their fuel in the elevator shaft is easily proved false.</p>

<hr/>

<p>For the jet fuel bolus hypothesis to be even remotely reasonable, the following five challenges would have to be overcome...</p>

<ol>
<li>The jet fuel that was available to flow down and away via openings, after accounting for the external fireballs and impact zone fires, was <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/mirrors/guardian2/wtc/WTC_ch2.htm">estimated by FEMA</a> to be about 3,500 gallons. And NIST stated that, “No evidence or analysis emerged that significantly altered the FEMA estimate” (NCSTAR 1-5F, p 56). The 3,500 gallons would need to flow evenly across the entire, acre-wide area of the impact floors</li>
<li>The impact damage would have had to fully open, and leave exposed, the 22 elevator shafts in the core area of the impact zone (or the 30+ in the WTC2 impact zone). The shafts that were most important would be for cars #6, #7, and #50, the express elevators traveling the entire distance from top to bottom. In WTC1, these were located at the opposite side of the core from the impact zone</li>
<li> We must assume that no more than a proportionate amount of jet fuel flowed into the express elevator shafts on the opposite side, after traveling through more than half of floor space of the tower. This would be one-22nd of the total available, or 159 gallons. There were also <a href="http://guardian.150m.com/wtc/small/not-so-hot.htm">12 in x 18 in telephone cable openings between floors</a>, however, and holes in the floors made by the impacting aircraft, through which fuel would have been lost. A realistic maximum therefore might be 120 gallons in each shaft, assuming an equal amount of the spilling jet fuel made it all the way across to the express elevator side</li>
<li> The jet fuel would have adhered to the surface of the elevator shaft as it traveled downward. The elevator shafts were lined with 2-inch thick gypsum planking and the low surface tension jet fuel would have wetted this thoroughly. An estimate of the surface area in an express shaft is 60,000 square feet. A quick experiment shows that gypsum board soaks up approximately 0.03 gallons of kerosene per square foot.  All the available jet fuel (120 gallons) would have been lost in this process before the jet fuel bolus reached the mid-point of its fall.
Therefore the jet fuel that was available to flow down and away from the floors of impact could not have reached the concourse level of the WTC towers</li>
<li>However, a lot of damage was attributed to this impossible jet fuel bolus. Eyewitnesses stated that there were intense elevator area fires in the lower half of the building. There were fires on the 40th floor, and the 22nd floor, and <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPHIC/9110490.PDF">witnesses said that the elevator doors on the 22nd floor had been blown out from fires or explosions in the elevator shafts</a>. Even if a highly disproportionate quantity of jet fuel from the aircraft had somehow caused these fires and the related damage, there certainly would not have have been any left to reach the lobby.</li>
</ol>

<p>All of this ignores the questions of how unburned jet fuel could make its way around the elevator cabs in the shafts, how it could re-accumulate at the lower level, and how the supposed fuel/air mix could become optimum and then ignite. It also ignores how much jet fuel would be required to produce the explosive energy needed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvUIQZ7t7Ak">destroy so much of the lobby</a>, including the huge windows and the massive granite wall coverings, and kill people in that area.</p>

<p>The jet fuel bolus hypothesis also ignores the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W1HlV9O65w">eyewitness testimonies</a> of massive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zED8dy63w">explosions within the lobby</a>.</p>

<p>If NIST had done a minimal amount of physical testing to support its weak fuel bolus suggestion, the hypothesis would have been easily disproven. But that would have left people to wonder what actually did cause these incendiary fires and the <a href="http://911blogger.com/news/2008-05-29/more-evidence-energetic-materials">ones in the basement levels</a>. The answers to those questions would almost certainly add to the other, extensive evidence for the presence of energetic, incendiary materials at the WTC</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The behaviour, mechanics and chemistry of explosions, detonations, deflagrations, DDTs and BLEVEs are well-studied phenomena in the context of storage unit, chemical plant and transportation safety, hazard and risk assessment, as are plane accidents and jet fuel fires. <a href="https://books.google.de/books?id=73M6aqqy-uUC&amp;amp;dq=fireball+diameter&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s">Source 1</a>, <a href="https://books.google.de/books?id=ARIOBAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;dq=fireball+diameter&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s">Source 2</a>, <a href="http://www.ewp.rpi.edu/hartford/%7Eernesto/F2009/EP/Materials4Students/Mossa/Luther2009.pdf">Source 3</a>. It therefor comes as a surprise that the South Tower/UA 175 fireball, although documented videographically from more than 30 angles, apparently received only little curiosity from explosion hazard specialists, experts and professionals. Except for Baum/Rehm (2005), no scholarly article seems to have been published on its mechanics; official estimates for the fuel consumed in the first ten seconds are irreconcilable with approaches found in pre-9/11 technical literature correlating fuel mass and maximum fireball diameter, and their validity is questionable by association with Lysenkoistic science alone.</p>

<p>Usually, fireball diameter and initial hydrocarbon fuel mass are correlated with an empirically derived formula looking like this: </p>

<p>D = (3...6) m <sup>~1/3,</sup> where D = 5.8 m <sup>1/3</sup> is the most commonly used approximation for kerosene/jet fuel/Jet A. </p>

<p>Thus, under laboratory conditions, a 3500 gallon fireball would have a maximum diameter of ~130m. A 150 m fireball requires at least 4900 gallons of kerosene. </p>

<p>Analysis of the South Tower fireball shows the fireball stretched elliptically ~170 meters on the (structural) N-S axis and ~130 meters on the W-E axis, corresponding to a 150 m diameter circle. </p>

<p>Baum and Rehm, who wrote <a href="http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/fire05/PDF/f05179.pdf">the only scientific paper about the ST fireball</a>, give a lower bound estimate of 1500kg. They measure the diameter at 2.5 seconds after impact, arriving at 120 meters. The duration of the fireball was, however, more than 9 seconds, during which it expanded further. FEMA claims the fireball reached its maximum diameter at 2 seconds.</p>

<p>FEMAs lower bound estimate is 3066 kg. </p>

<p>NIST NCSTAR 1 estimates 4547 kg.</p>

<p>FEMAs upper bound estimate is 9190 kg. </p>

<p>Fireballs are usually less dense than the surrounding medium (air), thus buoy - up. As an <a href="http://ukelg.ps.ic.ac.uk/47GA.pdf">unwritten rule of thumb</a>, Deflagrations typically blow out only one side of their containment. To go down a narrow shaft, 80 floors at that, the ignition source would have to be hermetically sealed against the shaft. Unlikely with all the potential vents an elevator shaft provides, impossible with the vent the plane impact created, sheer wizardry that the deflagration blew out the whole east face, half of the north face and only marginally through the impact hole on the south face, beyond imagination such a deflagration could possibly blow out the thick glass panes of the lobby. </p>

<p>tldr: the lack of curiosity of the scientific community and risk assessment experts regarding the South Tower deflagration and the quality of analysis so far are, on their own, red flags and sufficient evidence of a cover-up of gigantic proportions. </p>

<p>In a sense, yes. Typically, movie pyrotechnics use kerosene deflagrations for an impressive fireball display. Detonative explosives such as TNT produce smaller fireballs per fuel mass than hydrocarbon deflagrations (detonation = supersonic explosion, deflagration = subsonic explosion), because a fireball would be a mere byproduct when the aim is lots of force. TNT has less <em>energy</em> per mass than kerosene (or chocolate chip cookies, for that matter), but TNT is more <em>powerful</em> (energy per time) than kerosene. A debunker, ironically, explains it well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gasoline, mixed with air, releases 15 times as much energy as an equal weight of TNT. That fact astonishes most people. The numbers are simple: one gram of TNT releases 0.65 kilocalories of energy; one gram of gasoline, mixed with air, releases 10 kilocalories. TNT is not valued for its high energy, but rather for its ability to deliver the material-shattering force that accompanies rapid energy delivery (high power). Even chocolate chip cookies have nine times the energy content of TNT. To tear down a building, if you&#39;re in no hurry, don&#39;t use TNT; hire some teenagers, give them sledgehammers, and feed them cookies.</p>

<p>I also forgot to mention that the Baum/Rehm paper uses an approach unheard of in fireball literature (Fay/Lewis, Roberts, Moorhouse/Pritchard, Hagesawa/Sato, Hardee/Lee, Lihou/Maund, to name just a few of the names that will inevitably pop up whenever you read a paper about fireballs), deriving the fuel mass from the expansion rate - which is explicitly mentioned as kept <em>constant</em> by most modelers in CCPS (Source 2 in parent post) by introducing a &quot;dimensionless energy release parameter&quot; &amp;beta; so that </p>

<blockquote>
<p>[t]he present model [...] primarily requires a plausible estimate for β in order to be in a position to extract useful information from an accident scenario. Moreover, the results obtained above show that physically interesting values of β are strongly constrained by the solutions to the conservation equations. Thus, given video information, the expansion velocity V can be extracted. Since β is strongly constrained, a knowledge of V leads directly to an estimate for the heat release per unit area q, and thus to the global energy release rate. This procedure yields a useful lower bound for the fuel consumption in the WTC fireballs. Hopefully, it can be used for other purposes as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IOW, all you need is a &quot;plausible estimate&quot; for this dimensionless parameter to deduce fuel mass, but which is constrained by plausibility (0.85...0.95), so all your estimates will remain within the same order of magnitude anyway. But they used NISTs own FDS software and managed to render a fancy image (which they put next to a photo of an <strong>8 second old fireball</strong>, BTW - for a study treating only the first 2.5 seconds After Impact!!!), so their science must be scientific. </p>

<p>Please note also the review included in the Baum/Rehm paper PDF:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your elegant model does not include the effect of oxygen entrainment, or combustion, as do other fireball theories and correlations (e.g., Fay et al.). Have you compared your model to those simpler fireball data sets to assess the accuracy and advantage of your new solution?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answer: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The assertion that the model &#39;does not include the effect of oxygen entrainment or combustion’ is incorrect. A mixing layer whose thickness grows with time as the fireball expands represents the heat release zone. The quantities being mixed are fuel and air. Indeed, it is easy to show that an oxygen mass fraction equation with the heat release related to oxygen consumption by Huggetts rule produces a steady depletion of oxygen as the mixing layer is traversed. Analyses like that of Fay and Lewis [...] are concerned with the rise of a spherical fireball, and contain far less physics than the present model. We have correlated our model with the fireball &#39;data&#39; that emerges from the actual WTC events. That is what this paper is about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. </p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>

<p>A fireball. Presumably fueled by kerosene.</p>

<p>It burns nine seconds. </p>

<p>On its longest horizontal axis, it is 170 meters wide. </p>

<p>On its shortest horizontal axis, it is 130 meters wide. </p>

<p>As it extinguishes, it keeps rising in the form of a black spherical/toroidal smoke cloud with a diameter of over 250 meters. </p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>

<p>A scientific paper on the fireball. </p>

<p>It states the fireball reached maximum diameter after 2.5 seconds. </p>

<p>At which point it is 120 meters wide and has effectively not risen one meter (still momentum, not buoyancy, controlled).</p>

<p>Although there is a huge body of scientific literature on fireballs and the <em>empirical</em> correlation fuel mass - maximum diameter - rise height - duration (Source 1, Source 2,  Fay/Lewis, Roberts, Moorhouse/Pritchard, Hagesawa/Sato, Hardee/Lee, Lihou/Maund et cetera perge perge), it ignores ALL of it, introduces a <em>completely</em> new model unheard of in scientific hydrocarbon fireball literature, untested, unverified, with no comparison to other fireballs (the world famous <a href="http://www.tes.bam.de/de/umschliessungen/behaelter_radioaktive_stoffe/dokumente_veranstaltungen/pdf/rmtp1999104231.pdf">5900kg BAM propane gas BLEVE</a> for example) or other empirical research, and comes to the conclusion that 1500 kg (489 gallons!!!) are a reasonable lower bound estimate for the kerosene needed to produce the fireball that rose from the north-east corner of World Trade Center Tower 2 on September 11th, 2001. </p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>

<p>A Boeing 767-200 flies from the east coast to the west coast and will fuel according to its weight and flight distance (plus safety margin) fuel mass W. Shortly after take-off, it is hijacked and steered into the WTC and has consumed only X amount of fuel. Upon impact, Y amount of fuel is consumed in the fireball. </p>

<p>W-(X+Y)=Z amount of fuel remains in the building. </p>

<p>Your job is now to prove that jet fuel can melt steel beams. </p>

<p>How does Lysenkoistic science get involved with a paper that was tested, documented, peer-reviewed and published?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Really? We&#39;re back to this again?  I thought its already been established that &quot;melting&quot; the beam is not necessary and that a heat source well below the steel&#39;s melting point would be enough to reduce the beam&#39;s structural rigidity to the point that it would sag and eventually fail.</p>

<p>Exactly the contrary. I mentioned it as a well-studied, well-documented example for a deflagration that the Baum/Rehm model could have been tested against before it was applied to the South Tower fireball. </p>

<p>I said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To answer your other question: &quot;association to Lysenkoistic science&quot; was merely a play at the official reports and the public and popular science and &quot;scientific consensus&quot; that proved beyond a doubt that it is perfectly reasonable, inevitable even, for a tower to disintegrate an hour or so after being hit by a plane. </p>

<p>Nope. This is commonly used disinfo/meme to make theorists look crazy and/or stupid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Jet fuel can melt steel if in stoichiometric mixture with air and oxygen. This is not disinfo. This is not a meme. It is a provable, scientific fact. If you wish, I will dig up a video of jet fuel melting steel. Not just weakening and softening it, but cutting right through it. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Additionally, &quot;jet fuel cannot melt steel beams&quot; is commonly understood by butthurt truthers as a meme to make them look stupid. Instead, they should celebrate the fact that go-to standard explanation for the collapse of the Twins that has been regurgitated over and over again by &quot;debunkers&quot; and other reality deniers in the first years after 9/11 has been utterly debunked. </p>

<p>These experts claimed that jet fuel can melt steel beams: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As the <strong>construction manager</strong> for the World Trade Center, <strong>University of Colorado civil engineering professor Hyman Brown</strong> gets a call every three weeks or so from someone who has a new theory about 9/11. Some of these theories are hard for Brown to dispute, he says, but debunking the central World Trade Center theories embraced by 9/11 Truth Movement is easy.</p>

<p>&quot;It is correct that the towers did not collapse because of the airliners hitting it. But we do know how it collapsed and it has nothing to do with conspiracy,&quot; says Brown. &quot;What caused the building to collapse is the airplane fuel and the fire-suppression system that we now have, which basically blocks off five-floor blocks, so the fire can’t go up and the fire can’t go down. You now have a fire confined to a five-floor area, burning at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The steel in that five-floor area melts. All the tonnage above the five-floor area comes straight down when the <strong>steel melts</strong>. That broke all the connections, and that caused the building to collapse.&quot;</p>

<p>Just-released preliminary findings from a National Institute of Standards and Technology study of the World Trade Center collapse support Brown’s theory.</p>

<h1><em>Intense heat melted steel supports</em> in Trade Center</h1>

<p>Although the impact of the jetliners was strong, it was the heat from the explosion that most likely caused the buildings to collapse, experts say.</p>

<p><strong>Richard Ebeltoft, a structural engineer and University of Arizona architecture lecturer</strong>, speculated that <strong>flames fueled by thousands of gallons of aviation fuel melted the buildings steel supports</strong>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don’t take our word on that: the engineers and the architects have studied this thing in extraordinary detail, and they can tell you precisely what caused the collapse of those buildings. What caused the collapse of the buildings, to summarize it, was that <strong>the super-heated jet fuel melted the steel super-structure of these buildings and caused their collapse</strong>. There’s a powerful lot of evidence to sustain that point of view, including the pictures of the airplanes flying into the building.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Common debunkster practice is to ascribe the intergranular melting and sulfurization to the gypsum wallboard that was abundant in the towers. </p>

<p>I have started a list of other odd chemical reactions that had to take place for the official conspiracy theory to be true, please feel free to expand it:</p>

<p><strong>In the beginning, it was:</strong></p>

<p>Asbestos + Computers + Light Bulbs + Wiring + Heat + whatnot → the air is safe to breathe</p>

<p><strong>Now, it is:</strong></p>

<p>Heat + Gypsum Wallboard + Steel → cheesification, sulphurization, intergranular melting of steel beams</p>

<p>Heat + Aluminum + Jet Fuel + Office Cubicles → red glowing lava streams</p>

<p>Heat + Steel + Water → moar heat + molten metal + sintered concrete meteorites</p>

<p>Aluminum Perimeter Cladding + Steel + Jet Fuel + Heat → iron-rich microspheres + thermitic nanocomposites </p>

<p>Primer Paint + Heat → powerful heat release</p>

<p>Thermite + Ignition → Icicles</p>

<p>Plane + Jet Fuel + Steel Building → delayed sudden rapid total progressive top-down dustification</p>
