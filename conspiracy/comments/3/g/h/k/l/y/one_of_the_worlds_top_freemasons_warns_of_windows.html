       he warns of a new Operating System which has to be stopped or the war against TPTB will be lost once and forever.

      <p>
       James Cameron mixes in high circles and is given information which the rest of us are not; Freemasons of his rank are known to be given information which is kept from the masses.  Given his past record, he appears to be one of the good guys.  He's also a vegan and he intends to make a film about when the US dropped atomic bombs on Japan i.e. raising awareness that the US are the only nation to have used weapons of mass destruction, in doing so they committed a crime against humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now straight after Terminator Genisys a 'free' Windows 10 appears which is an

       </a>
       , as it shares all our information with them.  It appears that Cameron was warning us through Terminator Genisys not to upgrade, as Windows 10 will make it a lot harder for the people to fight back and keep our remaining freedoms.

       It's amazing to me how many idiots will blindly trust Microsoft, the company that has been in bed with the NSA since it's inception. No one cares about their privacy. No one realizes that all these gadgets with fingerprint readers, telemetry data, private encryption keys are all being read by Big Brother. You think that this is all just some innocent coincidence. Think again. Windows 10 was specifically designed to hand over all your data to the NSA and surveillance state. You've got to be a complete idiot to not see it. Free as in goodbye Freedom.

       Is it true that Linux is difficult to use? I'm not very the house savy but I do care about privacy, so I would hate to get Linux and not know how to operate it.

       I just want to point out something that people seem to be glossing over. To me it's the fox in the hen house.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are in the middle of an electronic war with multiple factions in the world. China, Russia and others have been attacking the US infrastructure non stop. Yet, here we are today with an OS that seems to be very insecure.
      </p>
      <p>
       My only theory I can assume allows this possibility is that the OS was intentionally released with backdoors and such in order to use all systems as a "Zombie botnet" type defense or offense.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my theory and I'm sticking to it. There is no other logical conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       One other interesting tidbit is that Windows 10 was developed and released exponentially quicker that all other past Microsoft operating systems. Microsoft was still working on the Windows 8.1 update in 2013. They already had Windows 10 in the works at that time. Windows 10 was announced in late 2014.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though the OS release cycle has dropped by a year since XP it just seems amazing to me that they could build a whole new operating system in just 2 years. I'm assuming they either had outside help or they were given a platform partially completed at one point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what's their reasoning behind skipping 9? It seems like no big deal but that's just the numerology guy in me being curious.

       What I heard was it was for legacy. Some software checks if the first number of the os is 9 (95, 98) and this could make trouble.
I want to emphasize this is what I heard. It may easily have been a comment on Imgur.
      </p>

       Another reason: an reason-less exception makes people talk about it. People talking about it is free commercial.

       Yep, this is what I heard too. Lazy programmers writing shortcuts in their installation code years ago. Instead of separate checks for Win 95 and Win 98, it would just check for Win 9.

       Yeah, but the problem is quite wide, and is analogue to the "forced updates". People are lazy -&gt; if something is wrong they will blame MS even if it's their own fault -&gt; MS makes sure they don't get a bad name.

       10 is not a whole new OS. That is rumored to still be in the works. Primarily, 10 is a update to old parts of the Windows 'kernel' or core of it's code that hadn't been touched in years.
      </p>
      <p>
       They skilled to Windows 10 because there are some critical infrastructure items that learned to differentiate versions via it's proper name. Therefore Windows 9 (new) would be lumped in with Windows 95 and Windows 98, Two OSes that Windows 10 is beyond.

       They've been specifically confirmed to exist in every version of Windows since 7. And any version of Windows older than that can almost definitely be completely hijacked, virtually instantly, just due to its inability to patch new holes or defend against modern malware. So all this fretting about Windows 10 in particular really doesn't even make any sense.

       Yeah... no. If anything they accidentally published something sourced on a conspiracy site and then, obviously, retracted it. Conspiracy sites love to claim that anyone and everyone in Hollywood that makes a popular movie is a Freemason (along with every President, Prime Minister, King and potentate).

       Not at all, but he's had several rather messy breakups that have made me wonder about how he treats people in his life... it's a personal thing, and has no bearing on how you might see his movies, I would hope.

       Not counting the groups that Freemasons have gone off and created that are non-Masonic; the groups that were Masonic-like that were founded by non-Freemasons (e.g. Illuminati) and all of the other edge-cases, just variant Masonic formats, Masonic splinter groups, schisms, offshoots and pretenders include:
      </p>
      <p>
       Prince Hall (US), Swedish Rite Masonry, Scottish Rite Craft Masonry (not to be confused with the Scottish Rite Freemasonry that you've probably heard of, but the sort of all-Scottish-Rite-from-the-start that you see in Central and South America), irregular Continental Freemasonry, Comasonry, Chinese Freemasons, the amusingly irregular Regular Grand Lodge of England, The American Federation of Human Rights, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just a taste of the groups that range from perfectly legitimate Masonry (Prince Hall, Swedish Rite, etc.) with some important differences from their mainstream counterparts to the outright invented whole-cloth (e.g Regular Grand Lodge of England). There have been hundreds of such organizations over the years, and they pop up all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can't control these groups because Freemasonry is just a system of mutual recognition. If someone decides that that mutual recognition doesn't matter to them (e.g. Grand Orient de France in the mid-19th century until the present day) then the rest of Freemasonry has no control over them.

       With billions of people updating their systems to Win10, you really think the NSA or who ever is going to sit there and collect our information off of millions of people, sounds like a stress job, or these people have no lives, besides to look at your info.. I just think there is too many people to monitor, and it would cost a lot of money and time. I will always stick to my WinXP, there is nothing wrong with it, and it works perfect. I have all the updates, and have the secret files, to update it if I need to reinstall XP... good luck with WIN10, and I find Linux a bore...

       Hollywood talk. Even the phrasing is interesting: they "ASK"ed Cameron for input. That doesn't mean he responded or offered any input.
      </p>
      <p>
       That movie was a piece of shit, btw. Do you really think Cameron had anything to do with it? I notice he's said it's the "real third movie," but I thought it was a really rotten reboot.
