       Now hear me out here, I'm not the biggest fan of Donald Trump and how he normally can't find a way to keep his foot out of his mouth, but I think he could change this country. He's a "self made" billionaire, which means that he doesn't have to make any deals with the devil to get funding for his election. He has little to no obligation to anyone in the government at the moment (as far as I know) and has spoken out about how stupid our government has become on most fronts. Could Donald Fucking Trump be the one that gets into office without making bullshit agreements under the table to fund his run for the presidency? If he is a conspiracy theorist as a post on here a few days ago says, who's to say that if/when he gets elected, he doesn't expose all the bullshit for what it is? I don't know why this subject hasn't been brought up on here before. The simple fact that he isn't bound by any allegiances but himself, which could make him make laws to further his own economic interests, but nevertheless, do you guys think I have a good point here? Do you think Trump could change this country for the better?

      <p>
       Nope, he just made the deals a little bit earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty obvious the guy is fucking stupid. He's clever enough to make some decent business decisions to continue what his father started but he's not smart, and he's definitely not wise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because he's not directly funded by the exact same moneyed interests that run clinton, bush, obama etc doesn't mean he doesn't have his own greedy and shortsighted agenda. Anyone driven by $ is automatically going to be a shitty leader.
      </p>
      <p>
       After watching the debate the other day I don't see how anybody but bush gets the nomination. I could maybe see them giving it to Huckabee if they want to lose to Clinton but there's just no way Trump is going to get it, and if he ragequits the GOP to run independently he'll quickly become irrelevant and/or buried by the 2 parties.

       Also, if you think it's the PRESIDENT who can save this country, you're hopeless(no offense).

       I just thought it would be an interesting thought expiriment. I live in the South and he seems to have a pretty big following down here. Then again, most of the people down here are idiots, but if his agenda is about money, he's already huge in America. He pretty much wants to raise prices and charge a shit ton of money to get an American Visa, then let immigrant work it off. He could be motivated to help the economy so his own investments will increase in worth, but I don't know. I just thought it was an interesting thought considering we could have a potential president that isn't in the pocket of the 1%, but that's only because he is the 1%

       He's just such a circus act I can't really see his endgame. I don't get the feeling that he's a pawn like the rest of them...he seems just as fed up with the government as most of us. But that's also just me. I can't say for sure if he'd be a good POTUS or not, but it's definitely worth noting he's probably funding himself, so most of his policies and running points are probably his own.

       I guess it depends on your point of view. He has a lot of money but he's still a pawn in the grand scheme. He's a slave to $ and power-seeking and ego thrills, not a sovereign and conscious individual. He's still an animal like most people, he just gets to put on a fancier costume.

       So you think most of the people in the south are idiots? I live in Texas and can't say anyone takes Trump remotely serious. People find his unfiltered/unscripted responses refreshing for someone running for office but please don't confuse that with supporting or endorsing the actual content. On another note, if you have something against the south then just GTFO.

       I should probably see your remarks as a complement, we do think we're a breed of our own and we like it that way. Never the less we are indeed the south and for the most part I'm fairly excited about the choice of quality candidates that have come forth in this election minus 2-3 and trust me Trump will fizzle out before long.

       It is a compliment. This post was only to incite a discussion about The topic. I even said in the post that I don't necessarily support trump at all, hell I've told many friends if he gets elected I'll leave the country. It was just a thought man no need to get defensive lol

       I remember being SO excited when I was finally old enough to vote.  I voted for Clinton, twice, on the limited explanation from my parents that Republicans were for corporations while Democrats were for the people, and the recollection of my union-member father calling Reagan an idiot every time he saw him on television.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm embarrassed to say that for many years I voted without any real knowledge about exactly whom or what I was voting for.
      </p>
      <p>
       My real political and economic education started when I met my husband, who is a little older than me and started objectively following politics in the 1970's.  I came from a combination blue-collar/white collar family, while he came from a family of small-business entrepreneurs.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to grasp an idea of the completely new mindset I was exposed to, check out "Rich Dad, Poor Dad", which sums it up nicely.
      </p>
      <p>
       By combining that understanding with my own research and discussions with others, I finally started to form my own real thoughts and opinions regarding my country's political system, based on real knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Voting is one thing, but being truly an informed voter is quite another.  As far as labels go, I test out as a fiscally conservative social libertarian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which, incidentally, correlates with the majority of the voting populace.

       IMHO, I do think Trump could change this country for the better.  It certainly appears to be his intention, judging from his speeches, present and past.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you take the time to research Donald Trump the person, including his family, friends, religious, and business lives, you might be surprised by what you find, especially from the most direct and the most objective sources.

       As a research-a-holic, Trump is my top obsession of the moment.  I've been learning more and more about him, and I can honestly say that the more I know, the more I think that, as President, he really WOULD be the one candidate who could Make America Great Again.

       This is exactly the response I was looking for! If it wasn't such a hassle to try and do research on my phone that loads at half the speed of smell, I would gathered a ton of more information about ole' Donny, but I knew someone on here had to have already done exactly that. It's a rare oddity to have a candidate be self funded. Sure his policies may reflect that self obsession, but it also means he really can do what he says he wants to, without being weighed down by promises to lobbyists.

       You HAVE to do what you say in business, or you won't survive, never mind thrive, as Trump has done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, in business, the biggest successes come from a combined foundation of business acumen, charisma, and luck.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you follow Trump's election strategy to date, his approach to his candidacy is fascinating.  It's all him, and it's all part of the plan.

       Rand Paul constitutionalist positions include term limits.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't seen Trump mention anything about campaign finance reform or term limits.  Would be a good thing to get him to elaborate on seeing that he's recently made it clear that business  buys politicians.

       Damn. That sounds like a damn good plan. Lol. If he's got the money to waste on a "false" run for president then that seems very plausible. Maybe in exchange for his support he gets the VP nod for whoever he's trying back?

       Maybe. At the very least, he'd be an awesome Secretary of Commerce.

       I do not see the electoral college letting happen. Yes we the people 'vote' but it could all come down to a close count and they get the decision in the long run.
