       Please please please don't fall into the trap of flat earth theory. I call it a trap because it not only promotes a way of thinking that is incredibly flawed, but contained in that mindset is a mental device that renders your newfound beliefs unfalsifiable. In other words, it is almost impossible to pull out of the dive that is flat earth theory, because once you start, you'll be surrounded by people demanding that you ignore thousands of years of undeniable scientific evidence in favor of a few youtube videos. When you're deep into that mindset,
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       amount of evidence will ever be able to convince you otherwise. And that state is tantamount to delusion.

       Thousands of years of scientific theory?!? Lol.  You wish. I have been looking long and hard for scientific proof the earth is going around the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heliocentrism and Geocentrism are both theories,  neither are proven nor disproven.  Heliocentrism was chosen as our model 500 years ago for 'philosophical' reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact,  many experiments done on the matter indicate the
       <em>
        earth is not moving
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Forget all you were taught at school,  science is like  religion nowadays: no one can question it and you folks put a lot of faith in those theories.

       Let me put a guess out there — just bear with me, for a minute. I would predict that you do not have any formal education in the sciences. If that's the case, then your "long and hard" search for evidence of heliocentrism was probably
       <em>
        neither
       </em>
       . In other words, you gave millennia (yes, I do mean millennia) of scientific evidence and a couple conspiracy YouTube videos equal weight. Do you see why that's a flawed way of thinking? Do you understand why that amounts to delusion?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm tired, so I'll just copy part of my comment from a previous thread.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It would be one thing if there were scientifically literate people within the flat earther community. But there simply aren't. There is no argument that can't be disproved with a high school level understanding of science. And there's no shame in being scientifically illiterate — if science isn't your thing, it's not your thing. But there is shame in considering yourself in a position to throw away millennia of evidence. There's no shame in me not knowing Chinese, but then I, as a non-Chinese speaker, must give up the right to attempt to rewrite the rules of Chinese grammar.

       The concept is that the earth is flat and the part we know of is disk shaped and inside the north pole there is like a utopian society that looks over us, and then Antarctica surrounds us on all sides and they are both guarded by the military to perpetuate the false belief that we live on a globe.  Part of this concept is that we have never gotten into "orbit" since that wouldn't make any sense, so we just launch stuff to perpetuate the myth that we live on a globe. Some even go so specific that they describe how cell phone towers could reproduce GPS like features without the existence of satellites.  (I bet that part is probably true...)
      </p>
      <p>
       The motivation for perpetuating this myth is that it is easier to subdue a population that thinks they live on an insignificant rock that floats through space, than to subdue a group of beings on a still disk like plane that has a universe that revolves around it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one part of the flat earth theory that trips me out and I haven't ever heard a good answer for is why the horizon stays at eye level.  I wish someone that wasn't a flat-earther (or better yet, a convex-earther,) would ELI5.
      </p>
      <p>
       My humble opinion is that this theory was manufactured as a distraction.

       The motivation for perpetuating the flat earth myth is that it will all boil down to the fact that in order for there to be a flat disc covered by a impermeable dome with lights in it, containing a light orb making circle paths, surrounded by an ice wall, is that the only way this would be possible as described is a higher power controlling it and having made it.  This is a push for religion, and a a screen that filters out those who are to analytical or educated to be manipulated and controlled in that sense.  It feels like a check at the door for another sect of interpretation.  There will be an organized religion with this as its identifying basis, I guarantee it.

       Also,
      </p>
      <p>
       GPS works in the middle of the ocean and in regions there are no cell sites, like the arctic and deserts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The horizon would be the same as far as "eye level" with a globe or a flat circular disc.  Being above a basketball ball or a dinner plate (for example) would have nearly indistinguishable identical profiles.  The surface of a ball may curve away from you but its outline remains the same.  As you raise above each model, you would see farther.  The flat model because the distant objects would be more spread out and distinguishable in the distance until you see the edge.  The globe model because you are seeing farther around the globe until you see the farthest edge before it curves away at 90 degrees from your position. Eventually with either shape the horizon would be below eye level if you move far enough away.
      </p>
      <p>
       The really strange part of most flat earth arguments is pointing to a horizon and saying "Look, its flat, see??"  As I said above, when you're above a flat circular disc, the edge would appear curved with either model.

       Yes I have identified that glaring weakness in the argument.  I just meant I suspect they could recreate navigation in urban areas without satellites.

       The idea isn't that the earth is a disk, it is that the part "we" are allowed to know about it a disk.  I think part of the theory is that it could keep going beyond that.

       I am beginning to sound like I am defending the theory. I merely wanted to clarify my comments.

       I knew you were playing devils advocate, no worries.  A lot of the flat earthers (here at least) deny the infinite plane theory though.  Especially on r/theworldisflat.  To quote the Mod banhammer OurJesuitPaymasters...

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Most flat earthers would agree that we are on a flat plane. As to the shape the most popular would be circular in shape, with an impenetrable ice barrier surrounding us.

       <p>
        Most flat earthers do not believe in an infinite plane theory.

       Correct. It doesn't automatically mean the earth is flat, but it means we must revisit certain things we previously and unsuspectingly accepted to be true, including the shape of the earth.

       I can see at least 3 of them right now sitting at my desk. A soda can, a coin, the base of my desk lamp. None are a sphere, but I could make a circular shadow on the wall with any of them if I held them at the right angle.

       Actually, it is what I wrote.  I said a sphere
       <em>
        projects
       </em>
       a rounded shadow in the sense of a map
       <em>
        projection
       </em>
       , which would necessarily be from any given angle. So fuck off.

       No you're just tap dancing. What does map projection have to do with a discussion about shadows of the Earth on the moon?
      </p>
      <p>
       Map projection is the system of depicting a 3 dimensional surface onto a 2 dimensional map.

       I know what you were trying to say in your original post, and I agree with it. You just said it ambiguously. That's my point.

       Edit: For more help: imagine the light source and "screen" rotated at any angle around the sphere--the shadow will always be the same.  I'm sorry I didn't word it specifically enough for your satisfaction in my original comment, but this is what I mean.

       I understand all that just fine. I don't need any 'help'. But that's NOT what you wrote in your original post. You wrote:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        what the only geometrical solid that projects a curved shadow is. (Answer: a sphere)

       That's wrong.

       I'm not saying the earth is flat, but is this really the best that you can come up with for a globe earth? That doesn't really seem to prove anything. Come on, there is a ton of undisputed scientific evidence to support the fact that the earth is round (or so everyone keeps saying), so let's hear some of it.

       One thing is that all of physics rests upon Newton's laws, one of which is the law of gravitation. The mathematical expression for this law contains a variable "r" which represents the radius of a spherical body (or roughly spherical body; that works also), but not a disc.  Newton's laws are correct for macroscopic bodies the size of earth. This has been proven by thousands of experiments.  Another reason is because of the EXTENSIVE work done with satellites by space agencies foreign and domestic, and by private firms.  All of our current maps and geographic data are modelled to a spheroid that is a mathematical construct based on precise satellite measurements of the physical boundaries of planet earth.  Another reason is space photography.  All you have to do is look at photos from the space station to see earth is a sphere.  Another reason is dead reckoning--the use of stars to navigate. This would not have been possible if earth was not a sphere.  Eratosthenes proved it in the 3rd century BCE.  I could go on and on.  Flat earth theory is ridiculous.
