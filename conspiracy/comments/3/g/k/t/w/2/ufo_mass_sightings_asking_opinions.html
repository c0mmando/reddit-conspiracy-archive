Instead of linking the documentaries/videos which convinced me, I want to ask if anyone has ideas about the reasons for non-disclosure. Clearly &#39;not inciting mass panic&#39; is the most logical reason. But perhaps some groups do not want to be discovered or &#39;backed into a corner&#39; just yet. However, the mass sightings I am thinking of occurred over cities (and sometimes over very public events), so it makes me question the &quot;Men in Black&quot; stories. </p>

<p>One other thing on my mind: in two of the mass sightings, witnesses reported that the UFOs simply vanished into thin air. Any ideas on what is happening there? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGgUZgCeOzQ">Invisiblity cloaks</a>? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do more research.  Go a level deeper.  Look at who is making and promoting UFO material.  Look at who is promoting disclosure(for example the Rockefellers <a href="http://redefininggod.com/2014/10/why-are-the-rockefellers-and-the-jesuits-guiding-the-ufo-disclosure-movement/">http://redefininggod.com/2014/10/why-are-the-rockefellers-and-the-jesuits-guiding-the-ufo-disclosure-movement/</a>).  Think about how much the aliens theme is pushed in movies, TV shows and even the news.  Do you know who controls all of those media publishers?</p>

<p>Read about project Blue Beam, the potential to use a fake alien invasion as the next &quot;war on terror&quot; to control the masses and further degrade their liberties.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Today, America would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order [referring to the 1991 LA Riot]. Tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond [i.e., an &quot;extraterrestrial&quot; invasion], whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the World Government.&quot; - Dr. Henry Kissinger, Bilderberger Conference, Evians, France, 1991 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason to believe in aliens from outer space is the size of the conspiracy required to fake it.  Events like the Phoenix lights and newspaper articles from 100 years ago can be convincing.  I went down the aliens rabbit hole myself, but I came back out.  There is a conspiracy to produce this material.  It is trap.</p>

<p>Hear what Bill Cooper had to say about it(13 mins): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTT5RPMDws">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTT5RPMDws</a></p>

<p>Don&#39;t reject what I&#39;m saying because you don&#39;t want to lose your fantasy.  Take a step back and objectively examine who is funding it and the fact that there is no hard evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There my not be hard evidence. I have seen one with own eyes. If I were asked, &quot;do you believe in aliens?&quot;, the answer would be no. I know there are aliens, there is a difference. I have lived near NASA almost my entire life. I know man made space craft, I have seen almost every launch and landing since the 80&#39;s. There are crafts out there as big as apartment buildings (I have heard of even bigger) and they don&#39;t make a fucking sound. You wouldn&#39;t know they were even there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are 2 possible explanations for what you saw.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Human technology.  Publicly available or not.  Have you heard the recent talk about EM drive that breaks the law of conservation of momentum?  If NASA is not lying to us when they say that now, how long do you think they have had such tech before disclosing it?</p></li>
<li><p>Holographic projections.  The patents for this stuff are all out there.  The capabilities for holographic projection as non-lethal warfare have been demonstrated.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>You are buying into their fantasy.  It is santa for grownups.  They know that a certain segment of the population needs something cool to believe in.  They are right there to supply your dreams to you, to control your imagination.  </p>

<p>NASA is a complete fraud.  Take the time to investigate that topic.  For a simple demonstration to get you started, go to this page: <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/07/20/new-blue-marble">https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/07/20/new-blue-marble</a>  Look at the images there.  Notice how they call them photos:   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What made the Blue Marble so special? Sure, it might have been the first full photo of the Earth that we took, but we’ve taken a bunch more since then.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now take a look at the size of North America relative to the sphere in the 4th image.  Compare that to the others.  The lies from NASA just come tumbling out once you start looking critically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aren&#39;t you the same guy that professes that the Earth is flat?  Sorry, but I think you lost any and all credibility with that one.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yet Flat Earth is real?  Riiiiiiight.  If anything, seeing people like you discount UFO sightings and the possibility of extraterrestrials only strengthens my position.</p>

<p>I submit to you that if aliens do in fact exist (which I believe they do), and they wanted to introduce themselves to humanity, no force on Earth could stop the revelation of their presence. For me, this leads to one of three logical conclusions.</p>

<p>Either:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We are truly alone in the Multiverse, no contact has been made, and all UFO encounters are unexplained natural phenomena. (This is statistically improbable, and conflicts with the evidence.)</p></li>
<li><p>Extraterrestrials exist but have yet to discover our little blue ball, and all UFO encounters are unexplained natural phenomena. (This conflicts with the evidence.)</p></li>
<li><p>Aliens exist, have visited &#39;our&#39; planet, and are purposefully remaining elusive to the masses. (This is a logical solution to the The Fermi Paradox, and supports the evidence.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The Fermi Paradox Part 1: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNhhvQGsMEc">Introduction</a></p>

<p>The Fermi Paradox Part 2: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI">Solutions and Ideas</a></p>

<p>Again, no human power on Earth could stop the revelation of their presence if they wanted to be known.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not asking you to believe me based on my credibility.  I&#39;m asking you to consider the points I am making for yourself.  Check out the links I have provided.  When you start listening to people based on how well they are able to set themselves up as an authority you are giving away your agency to consider evidence yourself.  You are susceptible to confidence artists.  Consider the evidence on its own merits yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aren&#39;t you the same guy that professes that the Earth is flat? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I profess to not know of a complete working model of the earth.  The standard flat earth model cannot be correct(an easy problem is: how is it possible to have long summer days in the Southern &#39;hemisphere&#39;?).  But the official globe model also has problems.  It is an interesting topic, you should have a look rather than completely dismissing it at the outset because the conclusion is too far from your world view.  If you want more detail on my thoughts on the topic please see my post history.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Either:  1.  We are truly alone in the Multiverse</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I question the nature of space itself which is an assumption that this and the rest of your comment is based on.  We are told of an infinite number of other galaxies, solar systems and planets, but we have no way to verify for ourselves.  NASA provides only obvious fakes.  The combination of NASA veiled fakery and Hollywood official fakery provides us with a fantasy box for our minds to explore.  But if we poke at the edges of the box we have been presented with we can see that there are other possibilities besides what has been forced down our throats.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have to be kidding, you can take a GoPro, attach it to a balloon and see for yourself. </p>

<p>Yes, that is an experiment that you can do yourself.  If you use a flat lens you will find two things: 1.  The horizon is flat no matter how high up your balloon goes.  2.  The horizon rises to the level of the observer no matter how high up your balloon goes (on a sphere you should have to look down to see the horizon as you rise)</p>

<p>There is a lot to consider on this topic.  If you want to look, you could start here: <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/view/l679prcg097ny8u/200_Proofs_Earth_is_Not_a_Spinning_Ball!.pdf">http://www.mediafire.com/view/l679prcg097ny8u/200_Proofs_Earth_is_Not_a_Spinning_Ball!.pdf</a>  </p>

<p>In all respect, I just don&#39;t understand the point of the conspiracy.  To what end?  How does knowing the Earth is flat free us from governments?</p>

<p>Here are just some of the questions I have:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How do you explain water droplets?  They naturally form a spherical shape.  This occurs on Earth and zero gravity. </p></li>
<li><p>Other than clouds and the effects of erosion, I&#39;ve never witnessed a naturally occurring disc shaped object form.  Have you?</p></li>
<li><p>What do the other planets look like?  Are they flat as well?  </p></li>
<li><p>What&#39;s on the other side of the Earth?  Or, is there another side of the Earth?  </p></li>
<li><p>If there&#39;s not another side of the Earth, then aren&#39;t you really suggesting that the third dimension doesn&#39;t exist?  Or, at least doesn&#39;t apply on a planetary scale?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In all honesty, I couldn&#39;t care less about what&#39;s &quot;going viral&quot;.  I view this topic as an argument against reality.  I have my own view, path, and purpose.  </p>

<p>To thine own self be true.</p>

<p>The reality that was created for you is a false one. The truth is the earth is flat. If you were to have read the PDF link I sent you there would be no questions. I truly understand how big a mindfuck this is but I swear if you earnestly and honestly do your own non biased investigation into it you will find the truth as nothing I say will alter your mind. It took me a month to grasp it and all of the implications. Government has perpetuated the lie via NASA and media, textbooks, globes in every class, so on and so forth. When the lie is known by all who would willingly pay taxes? Billions upon billions have been stolen from us and a false sense of self reality and our place in the world. I hold no ill will towards these liars and thief I just want them out of my life, out of our schools, off the tv, and I want my money back for the nothing I have received in return  for the tens if not hundreds of thousands I have paid over the last 25 years. The lie is so deep and so big even when brought up to a seemingly reasonable fellow such as yourself it is denied, this I feel is the worst part , how many minds have been warped so badly that when the truth is presented it is chosen to be an attack of reality when it simply is reality. </p>

<p>Please instead of responding give flat earth and honest solid week of your time. Caution: Flat Earth Society is disinformation and full of shit. Eric Dubay, Paul Cheeft, Jeranism, and MrThriveandSurvive on YouTube is a great place to start. I wasn&#39;t fully convinced until I did my own experiments with ships at sea at distances that would be impossible to see with the supposed curve.</p>

<p>PM me with any questions you have after at least 10 hours of research and I will be happy to answer any non nescient questions. Once you &quot;get it&quot; you will be hooked and research for probably over 100 hours. I know I did for a solid 4 months at 3-8 hours per day even after I knew it was flat because damn there is so much more going on and so many things you thought you knew that must be relearned.</p>

<p>Peace and happy hunting! </p>

<p>How is observation irrelevant and flawed logic?</p>

<p>That&#39;s based on erosion.  Are you suggesting the Earth has been eroded flat?  If so, what force acted upon the Earth?  The river rock took a disc shape after many many many years of water erosion.</p>

<p>Do they emit their own light?  So they&#39;re circular, but flat?</p>

<p>So you admit you don&#39;t know what&#39;s on the other side of the Earth, yet reject that it&#39;s simply more Earth because you think it&#39;s irrelevant?  That&#39;s like your central theme.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are on a flat plane and are 3 dimensional beings upon it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not how it works.  A plane lacks either length, width, or height.  If the Earth is on a flat plane, with no height, nothing can exist &#39;upon it&#39;.  There is no upon it.  There&#39;s nothing there to exist in or upon.  You&#39;re literally limiting our existence to only two dimensions.  You can&#39;t have it both ways.</p>

<p>Get back to me when you can answer your own questions without using fanciful fairytales to do it.  Eliminating the likely and reasonable explanations prior to blaming fiction for what you can&#39;t explain.</p>

Those who demand complete/fool proof and guaranteed solutions to the discussion are sadly transparent and generally not worth engaging.

    <div class="md"><p>I have a hard time believing that the UFO phenomenon is all just a conspiracy by TPTB. The phenomena is too far reaching and commonplace for it all to be a conspiracy, especially since it happens all over the world and there are sightings that have been happening to thousands and thousands of years.

<p>As I said, this is the reason to believe it.  The fact that the conspiracy required to fake it is so massive.  So much material where stories line up to fit the same narrative.  I was enthralled by Phil Schneider&#39;s presentations, I watched all of the Dark Journalist interviews, I read the entire Law of One (Book of Ra).  But once you get into the CIA and Jesuit ties that UFOologists and disclosure pushers have you see that it is really being thrust onto us.  We are being manipulated.  This page regarding the Clinton connection to disclosure has been removed since the last time I looked at it: <a href="http://www.siriusdisclosure.com/ProjectStarlightClinton.shtml">http://www.siriusdisclosure.com/ProjectStarlightClinton.shtml</a> but you still find it in google search for &quot;clinton disclosure starlight&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;UFO&quot; I saw was pretty similar to some others I have read about. I saw it on a very bright, clear sunny day. It was diamond shaped (from my point of view at the time), very shiny and metallic, like chrome. It was traveling very fast, then suddenly went backwards in the opposite direction, forwards again, and then vanished. It looked like it had almost dissolved or disintegrated. </p>

<p>No, I&#39;m sorry, this is not the case.  The elites push it.  Bill Clinton on Jimmy Kimmel: <a href="http://time.com/48132/bill-clinton-wouldnt-be-surprised-if-aliens-existed/">http://time.com/48132/bill-clinton-wouldnt-be-surprised-if-aliens-existed/</a></p>

<p>The elites are the source of it.  Like I said, I know it sucks to lose your fantasy, but step back for a moment and reconsider if you have been fooled.  All those UFO conferences, all that content on movies and TV shows.  Everyone who pushes aliens is a disinformation agent.  It is practically mainstream.  It is a manufactured storyline that follows a script.</p>

<p>If you really want to know what is going on in the world look into the history of freemasonry and the Jesuit order.  Read &#39;Propaganda&#39; be Edward Bernays.  Learn about the Tavistock institute.  See the techniques of deception that are used against us, then rethink this issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re just uneducated on the subject; that&#39;s all there is to it. You should actually READ A BOOK by Dolan or Vallee, because the evidence is massive. How about 20,000 people witnessing the Phoenix lights, a mile long craft that was completely silent, and many people said it felt like an exchange of intelligence. Also the 2007 Stephenville, Texas case, similar. Too many witnesses to ignore. Or the Mexico City sighting in I believe 1997. UFO&#39;s over the White House in 1952. countless thiusands of cases of peoole seeing crafts do thungs that our technology can&#39;t even do now, never mind thirty to fifty years abo. Etc., etc. </p>

<p>Clinton on Kimmel? Yeah, he lied through his teeth like a typical NWO stooge, said there&#39;s nothing there. Of course they want us thinking that. It&#39;s the biggest cover-up of all-time. Jimmy Carter wanted to reveal it, but they wouldn&#39;t let him.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;ve had encounters with alien intelligence in DMT, as have thousands of others, so there&#39;s that. I know it personally, and I have no reason to lie. Good documentary: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LtT6Xkk-kzk">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LtT6Xkk-kzk</a></p>

<p>Check out a fairly short documentary called <em>Mirage Men</em> if you&#39;ve never seen it before.  It shows how US intelligence disinfo agents literally drove a man insane by convincing him the human black technology he saw in and around the military base by his house was actually alien technology.  They even interview one of the main intelligence agents in the movie and he&#39;s creepy by any definition of the word - you get the sense that every single word he says was calculated years beforehand.</p>

<p>The UFOs are a technology out our league. To answer the question, we can&#39;t see them because they can bend the light around the craft to make it appear to be sky.

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, OP, you should check out Richard Dolan. He has several fantastic books and a lot of good talks on youtube. He gets into a lot of the meta-reality around the subject. To answer your question, there are a lot of reasons global elites don&#39;t want us to know that there are lots of other intelligent life forms around. One simple one is that whoever is behind UFO&#39;s obviously has some advanced technology that non-petroleum based, probably something like &quot;free energy.&quot; Acceptance of the reality of this technology would be very liberating to humankind and would destroy the petroleum industry. I think the are bigger picture reasons, even. We might realize that there are &quot;good&quot; aliens- because there clearly are- who are interested in us advancing peacefully. We could, and should, unify with these beings, in a conscious collective evolution, but the powers that be sure don&#39;t want that. They want us ignorant, materialist, and alone.</p>

<p>Try smoking DMT or taking ayahuasca some day. There&#39;s a direct connection with an alien intelligence that occurs that&#39;s profoundly enlightening and revealing and sheds light on these really big-picture questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ChangeThroughTruth is right on the money but I&#39;m going to delve deeper down the rabbit hole.  There&#39;s a ton of evidence for the alien phenomena in the form of abductees and UFO sightings that seem like they couldn&#39;t have been staged.  What could this be?  A good place to start looking is at the Ancient Aliens deception.</p>

<p>Ancient Aliens proposes the idea that the angels, demons, spirits, and old gods were all actually alien visitors and our ancestors were too stupid to understand.  But what if it was the other way around?  What if we&#39;re purposefully being fed the idea that these things are aliens from another galaxy when they&#39;re actually spirits manifesting in the physical world?</p>

<p>I know it sounds totally insane so I&#39;ll leave it there.  It&#39;s possible that everything alien related is faked through government/military technology but people have been seeing this stuff for a <em>long</em> time so it&#39;s likely there&#39;s something more to it.  Either way, don&#39;t trust the idea that these are outer space aliens and don&#39;t believe that they&#39;re benevolent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you looked into all of the New Age explanation for it?  That&#39;s originally where I started out believing in the higher dimensional &quot;densities&quot; and that the beings could be highly evolved from other star systems.  But really, if they travelled light years (very unlikely) or they&#39;re interdimensional, why would they mess around with us?  Does that sound like the actions of beings with higher conciousness?  If they can enter our reality at will, then why do they appear for such short periods and remain so hidden?</p>

<p>The thing is that these beings never really seem helpful.  They&#39;ll <em>say</em> they&#39;re here to help us and might make some claims about our nature and origins, but they don&#39;t provide a cure for cancer or anything to actually benefit mankind.  They instead tell us that we need to rethink our perception of God.  We have to acknowledge that we ourselves are gods and that will allow us to evolve with them.  Funnily enough, &quot;Ye shall be as gods&quot; is the lie the serpent tells Eve in Eden.  And don&#39;t forget that the idea of evolution is being pushed pretty hard by the powers that be.  </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t into any of this Bible/demon stuff a few months ago but the more I look into it the more it fits.  If you research what New Age teachings say will happen as we collectively move towards 4th density, most of the &#39;powers&#39; they say we&#39;ll manifest are typical of demon possession.  Telepathic communication, seeing spirit manifestations (dragons and serpents are common ones), ability to speak ancient languages, levitation, <em>communication with spirits of dead relatives</em>.  Take it for what you will, but it&#39;s all very suspect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve actually looked into a lot of New Age material. I personally tie New Age teachings into Ancient Aliens teachings...I also believe that we are either products of aliens breeding with cave men, or we are simply an anomaly. There is still a good chunk of human DNA that science can&#39;t explain. The Greys are supposedly advanced enough mentally to comprehend the higher dimensions but they are basically emotionally numb and clones of themselves. It has been speculated that aliens offered to exchange technology for rare resources that the Earth holds. I believe some are very well trying to help us and exist in the higher dimensions free of physicality, and I also believe there are those that are still in this 3D reality permanently and are visiting and contacting us for their own selfish means. Think about it like this, if the elements and conditions for this planet to have the form of intelligent life we have (mammals, humans) have only been here for 250,000 years, conditions on another planet could&#39;ve been similar enough to form an entirely different kind of alien life in other parts of the universe. Say hypothetically there is a humanoid intelligent life that formed, say, 3 million years ago in a star system we haven&#39;t even discovered yet, they&#39;ve had a HUGE head start on technology that we have. With the advances we have every year in technology, I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be very long at all before we&#39;re capable of interstellar travel. It&#39;s entirely conceivable that another life form that is maybe silicon or methane based rather than carbon based (you literally have no idea what other conditions on planets so far away could be) life forms could travel here. Saturns moon Titan has a surface very similar to Earth&#39;s with oceans and landforms, except it&#39;s so cold there that the land is frozen water and the oceans are liquified methane. There could be life forms in those oceans that are straight out of a science fiction novel. The possibities are far too endless to think that aliens don&#39;t exist, and you if you do believe they exist then it&#39;s in the same line naivity to think that they aren&#39;t capable of traveling here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the whole limiting aliens to the dimensions we exist in thing always bugged me. Clearly there would have to be beings in the upper and lower dimensions. I&#39;m gonna guess that aliens exist in the dimensions we occupy as well, and that they too talk about upper dimensional beings, or at least beings advanced enough to pass through those dimensions, in a similar way we do. Maybe. Or perhaps those aliens can sense the other dimensions better than we can, but haven&#39;t quite gotten the trick of breaking through.</p>

<p>I mean... come on, y&#39;all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are all kinds of aliens out there man. There are those that could be stranded here, those that are here right now and if they have the technology to travel here they have the technology to blend in with the rest of humanity. Those who don&#39;t possess the technology but rather higher mental capacity are the ones that are still here but in hiding. Such as all the mysterious cave systems reported all across the globe. Aliens are all around us. Supposedly about 30 years after Carl Sagan sent the gold disk out attached to the Hubble deep space telescope, a crop circle appeared that is very intriguing. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but this is fucking absurd.  You&#39;re talking about millions of sightings over thousands of years.  Man has only conquered flight for barely over 100 years, and we still don&#39;t have the technology to perform the aerial acrobats performed by these crafts.    </p>

<p>Because of people like <a href="http://putlocker.ms/watch-mirage-men-online-free-putlocker-2013.html">Richard Doty.</a> Because the US government bends over backwards to get it&#39;s hands on people like Manning, Assange and Snowden, but couldn&#39;t care less about all the &quot;ex-CIA&quot; and former military personnel leaking the biggest secret in human history. If there is a concerted effort to do anything, it&#39;s to keep discussion of UFOs <em>away from</em> discussion of things like MKUltra, for example, lest too many people make the connection.</p>

<p>Totally.  That must also be why Hollywood and the media cover aliem fiction like its going out of style.  The same bullshit agenda pushed on people 24/7 to &quot;hide&quot; the truth.  </p>
