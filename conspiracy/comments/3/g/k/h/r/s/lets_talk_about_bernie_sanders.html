    <div class="md"><p>Nah, I&#39;ll pass.  This &#39;only when it&#39;s convenient&#39; Zionist politician refuses to stand against his own when it really matters.  He consistently votes for war.  Consistently supports the criminal private Federal Reserve.  He is a too good to be true liar who will only perpetuate the same corrupt to the core failing establishment.  More of the exact same &quot;hope and change&quot; bullshit lies Obama force fed us for nearly a decade.  No substance.</p>

<p>The Hillary campaign has utterly failed under its own weight.  Literally NO ONE I&#39;ve talked to supports her.  Hell, they can&#39;t even stand her.  They can even find a single nice thing to say about this habitually lying piece of trash.  Other than hacked fraudulent Diebold votes, she won&#39;t be seeing more than low single digit votes.  </p>

<p>The Bush name alone is absolutely toxic.  The people haven&#39;t forgot about the hands down worst American president of all time.  The fuck can&#39;t even show his face in public anymore.  The exact same around fraudulent hacked votes can also be said for Jeb&#39;s snowballs chance in hell of seeing any votes.</p>

<p>America has finally woke up to these worthless lying pieces of shit.  The old methods no longer work.  The jig is up.  Glad you&#39;re buying it though, OP.  This time it&#39;s probably real, and you can probably trust this known liar.  Hope and change...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite his own claims, Sanders has not been an antiwar leader. Ever since he won election to the House, he has taken either equivocal positions on U.S. wars or outright supported them. His hawkish positions -- especially his decision to support Bill Clinton&#39;s 1999 Kosovo War -- drove one of his key advisers, Jeremy Brecher, to resign from his staff. Brecher wrote in his resignation letter, &quot;Is there a moral limit to the military violence you are willing to participate in or support?&quot;</p>

<p>So outraged were peace activists over Sanders&#39; support of the Kosovo War that they occupied his office in 1999. Sanders had them arrested. Under the Bush regime, Sanders&#39; militarism has only grown worse. While he called for alternative approaches to the war on Afghanistan, he failed to join the sole Democrat, Barbara Lee, to vote against Congress&#39; resolution that gave George Bush a blank check to launch war on any country he deemed connected to the September 11 attacks.</p>

<p>Ever since, he has voted for appropriations bills to fund the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan, despite their horrific toll on the occupied peoples as well as U.S. soldiers.</p>

<p>Sanders has been critical of the war on Iraq, but he has supported pro-war measures -- such as a March 21, 2003, resolution stating, &quot;Congress expresses the unequivocal support and appreciation of the nation to the President as Commander-in-Chief for his firm leadership and decisive action in the conduct of military operations in Iraq as part of the ongoing Global War on Terrorism.&quot;</p>

<p>He also opposes immediate withdrawal from Iraq, despite the fact that a majority of residents in his home city of Burlington voted for such a position in a town meeting resolution in February 2005.</p>

<p>The day after his election to the Senate, Sanders declared, &quot;I don&#39;t think you can do a quote-unquote immediate withdrawal. I think the policy has got to be we will withdraw our troops as soon as possible, and by that, I mean that I believe we can have our troops out in the next year, and maybe a significant number of them before that. I don&#39;t think you can snap your fingers and just bring all the troops home tomorrow. I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s practical.&quot;</p>

<p>Even more shocking, Sanders scuttled any action on a wave of Bush impeachment resolutions that swept Vermont towns in 2006. Like House Majority Leader-to-be Nancy Pelosi, who has promised not to impeach Bush, Sanders argued that impeachment was impractical, and that activists should put energy into electing Democrats.</p>

<p>Outraged, Dan Dewalt, the organizer of the impeachment resolution campaign in Vermont, said, &quot;We think we have quality politicians in Vermont. We&#39;re wrong. We have politics as usual in Vermont. Our so-called independent congressman, Bernie Sanders, can&#39;t get far enough away from impeachment.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that one is fairly self explanatory.  Just like Sanders said himself, the idea of a dual-citizen &quot;serving&quot; in office is absolutely disgusting.  That it&#39;s somehow allowed is treason of the highest order.  </p>

<p>The fact that those who vote to send taxpayer money and taxpayer funded military hardware and lives that directly benefits ONLY their &quot;home&quot; nation is absolute insanity.  Sanders has been playing this game for far too long.  Those who really know him know just how corrupt he is.</p>

<p>Much like the scumbag Obama turned out to be, Sanders is mostly an act with zero substance or morals.  He does what he&#39;s told.  Fuck the once great America.  Fuck her citizens.  Fuck her future.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie is Israel&#39;s candidate.  There has been something going on with US/Israeli relations recently where they seem to be breaking down.  We are seeing prominent politicians saying some anti-Israel things that would have been unspeakable just a few years ago.  I could speculate about what, exactly, but that&#39;s all it would be.  My speculation is that there is going to be an economic crisis of some kind that won&#39;t be able to be covered up.  The politicians will certainly not blame themselves; so they will blame Israeli/Zionist loyalists who manipulated the financial system against the best interests of the citizens.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Sanders will be &quot;allowed&quot; to make it far because he is Israel&#39;s guy...  you simply will not win if the &quot;national security&quot; state does not approve of you.</p>

<p>You must have him confused with the entire republican party, who remain at the beck and call of Bibi Netanyahu.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not vocally critical enough of Israel for some progressives (it would be political suicide) but he&#39;s far more skeptical than the others.</p>

<p>Sanders supports Obama&#39;s Iran deal.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alternet.org/1988-bernie-sanders-condemned-israeli-attacks-palestinians-reprehensible">Yet what many may not know is that Sanders was once a strong critic of the Israeli policies towards Palestinians – going further than any major presidential candidate ever has in terms of excoriating that country&#39;s policies</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie is Israel&#39;s candidate.  There has been something going on with US/Israeli relations recently where they seem to be breaking down.  We are seeing prominent politicians saying some anti-Israel things that would have been unspeakable just a few years ago.  I could speculate about what, exactly, but that&#39;s all it would be.  My speculation is that there is going to be an economic crisis of some kind that won&#39;t be able to be covered up.  The politicians will certainly not blame themselves; so they will blame Israeli/Zionist loyalists who manipulated the financial system against the best interests of the citizens.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Sanders will be &quot;allowed&quot; to make it far because he is Israel&#39;s guy...  you simply will not win if the &quot;national security&quot; state does not approve of you.</p>
