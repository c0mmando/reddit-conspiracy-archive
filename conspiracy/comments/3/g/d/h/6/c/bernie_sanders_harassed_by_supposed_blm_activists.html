<p>I sincerely believe that these women are agents provocateur meant only to divide the left in an attempt to keep a self described socialist out of the White House. If they were truly genuine the obvious targets for them would be any of the Republican candidates. It&#39;s possible they&#39;re in the employ of Hillary Clinton or they may be on the Koch payroll. One thing is entirely sure, Bernie is perceived to be a genuine threat to the status quo. This is only the beginning, the ruling class won&#39;t give up easily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look at it from the right angle, it all goes back to Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>George Soros donated money to BLM. BLM disrupts Sanders rallies but not Clinton rallies. Clinton wins the nomination with the help of her longtime supporter Soros. </p>

<p>Meanwhile on the right, Trump takes the early lead for the Reps. Says tons of really nutty shit that draw the racists to the forefront of the party. Drops out right before Republican nomination, leaving the party in disarray with limited time to reform the voter base around a candidate and a remaining public vibe that the Republican message this go-around is all about bigotry.</p>

<p>Clinton takes the election after kicking the legs out from underneath rivals with help from key long-time associates on each side of the aisle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most frustrating part about this is that there is nothing Bernie can do about it once the protestors take the stage and start screaming at him.  He can&#39;t have security or the police intervene because then he will be called a racist.  He is forced to negotiate with these fuckers and then ultimately shut down his appearances.  If these protestors were part of a legitimate movement they would educate themselves on the candidates and realize is the last guy they should be harassing.  </p>
