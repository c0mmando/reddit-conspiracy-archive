       Can this sub please fight the reflex to brush off Bernie Sanders as just another Washington shill?  Every time he's mentioned in a headline, it seems like the top comment is something amounting to
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It doesn't matter if Sanders becomes president
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I understand the rationale--modern presidents have all played the same position and ignored their campaign promises.  Once in office, they've all accelerated the same campaign of global terror, and acted to further social inequity and injustice at home and overseas.  It seems like a political truth that a change of president doesn't result in a meaningful change of policy, but this truth is not absolute.  It's possible for a new president to completely overhaul the USA's foreign policy, as well as end many of the criminal domestic practices of the federal government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now let's look at Sanders.  He is a genuine independent politician, meaning that he is not a member of any political party.  You can look at his long voting record first in the House of Representatives and recently in the senate to see that he has never supported the fucked up policies of Democrats and Republics.  Searching up how Sanders has voted in Congress about issues we care about reveals that he has been an ally of ours in the halls of power:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/107-2001/h398">
         Sanders voted against the Patriot Act  on Oct 24, 2001
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/107-2002/h455">
         Sanders voted against authorizing the Iraq War on Oct 10, 2002

        <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2011/s218">
         Sanders voted against the NDAA on Dec 1, 2011

        <a href="http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/113/senate/2/282">
         Sanders voted against granting fast-track TPP authority on June 23, 2015
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       These votes were all cast with an (I), not a (D) or an (R) next to his name.  For most of these votes, Sanders was one of very few congressmen voting as he did.  I'm sure many of you will be curious about his voting record regarding Isreal, but there disappointingly hasn't been a bill for Sanders to vote on regarding Isreal in the last 2 decades.  The one exception was a bill that passed unanimously in the senate
       <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00092">
        to establish a deficit-neutral fund relating to supporting Israel
       </a>
       , but I'll leave it to you guys to read the text of that one if you really want to know what the bill entailed.  It seems that congress has had no real input on US military affairs since shortly after 9/11.  This forum gets a lot of readers, and we shouldn't be so quick to broadcast that Sanders would be no different than Hillary or Bush III.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to wrap this up, I don't really know much about Sanders.  I wasn't very familiar with him at all until very recently.  But doing some research on the man, it seems like he has a real shot at the presidency, and is the only such person who has consistently demonstrated to be a friend of the people, and an enemy of the evil powers that have been driving the US government.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl:dr; Do some research and form your own opinion about Bernie Sanders.  He's not just another shit-bag politician.

       You're right, he has had a consistent platform since forever. And to those comparing him to obama, obama was a junior senator with no record, sanders has been around for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       My only problem with sanders is he supports israel and mandatory vaccines, but then again so does every other politician running for president.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sanders points out that even though the parent might feel they have a certain right to control their child’s health and what goes into their body, that child inevitably interacts with other children, and thus can impact the health of others. While parents understandably want to have input on matters relating to the health of their child, Sanders asserts that when that input ends up impeding upon the health of another child, that decision becomes problematic. Health is not just a personal issue — it is also a public issue.

       What do you think that implies? He doesn't outright say it, but it's pretty obvious what he would support if there were calls for mandatory vaccination.

       How is it a stretch? It's clearly implied what his policy would be.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the president does have the authority in two ways.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Sign a bill into law requiring mandatory vaccinations instead of vetoing it. This would make all the difference in a situation where a two thirds majority was not available.
       </li>
       <li>
        During an emergency situation (pandemic, real or not) the president has overriding powers during the implementation of martial law. Legally after the 2011 NDAA, the president can assassinate or indefinitely detain any american citizen. If that's on the books you can bet your ass he has the power to enforce mandatory vaccinations during martial law.

       keep in mind a lot has changed in the republican party, remember Lincoln was a republican (ya i know that was a long long time ago)

      <p>
       the US republicans pretty much had the same thing happen as the progressive conservatives in Canada. the neo-con element took over and what is left is not really conservative so much as authoritarian.

       It doesn't matter, not because he's not a good dude, but because the entire thing is rigged. From the rigged Diebold voting machines, to SuperPACs, the electoral college, and the fact that nearly every President is a blood relation to the English Royalty, Bernie Sanders cannot BECOME President.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it doesn't matter if Bernie Sanders RUNS for President, TPTB will not allow their power structure to be damaged.

       The Electoral College is no longer part of the equation. All electoral votes in every state are now legally mandated to correlate to popular vote for that state. It's pure math.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main issue today is money. As Trump so eloquently stated during GOP Debate 1, the wealthy buy politicians of both parties so that when the wealthy want something, they get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because politicians of both parties are bought, the voting doesn't need to be rigged. The wealthy win regardless who the voters elect.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why this election will be interesting, especially so if Bernie actually beats that bitch Hillary in the primaries.

       I agree, but the crumbling remains of our democracy are still standing.  Even if the actual electoral process is rigged, there are still many polls which basically reflect the true distribution of votes.  Voting aside, if polls end showing 50% for Sanders, and 35% for the next candidate, I believe the candidate polling at 50% would get the win.
      </p>
      <p>
       But seeing how the Republicans denied Ron Paul everything throughout the 2012 primaries despite consistently polling between 1st and 3rd, I would wager that Hillary will be chosen as the democratic candidate, even Sanders ultimately edges her out in popularity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_the_United_States_presidential_elections">
        voter turnout is around 50% in presidential elections
       </a>
       , and much lower for other elections.  Even if you are voting for someone with a chance of winning, it would make a difference in future elections if we can pump up the numbers of the third party losers.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a third party candidate were to get 10% of the popular vote, it would be a highly visible gesture of protest.  By not voting at all, people are being beaten by the system.  It's actually crazy, 50% of eligible voter don't vote, presumably because they think their votes don't matter?  Imagine if those 50% were to throw their votes away at the polls rather than at home--the election results would be a shit-ton better than 49% for (D) 46% for (R) and 1% for (Other).

       People in r/Conspiracy can find a thousand reasons not to like Sanders, but I've yet to see someone argue in favor of another candidate. The fact is Sanders is the best option we have, and a mighty good one at that. Maybe all of his policies aren't perfect in everyones eyes, that would be an impossible feat, but by and large he fights for the majority while all other candidates work to protect the interest of the wealthy minority. He is the best chance we have, period.

       To be frank, no candidate is going to win the presidency on an anti-vaccination platform so you better just get over it. Bernie isn't acknowledging the truth about 9/11 either but you have to pick battles you can win with voters, and that said his stances are plenty radical for this constituency.

       Trump said he'd fix the vaccine issue if he becomes president and he's leading in polls even though traditional wisdom would say those kind of statements are suicide in politics. I'm not saying he is going to win, but his numbers show he has a chance.

       It seems odd that to pass legislation, a two thirds majority of the senate is required - if there are any absences. Yet those representatives can be elected with a 1% turnout?

       It wouldn't even necessarily be anarchy - the states and local structures would still be there. Unless they also couldn't muster X% of voter turnout.  But on the subject of anarchy - It is already the way of the world. Law abiding citizens are just tricked into thinking otherwise.

       Unless of course the ultimate presidential conspiracy is true.  Credit to Dan Carlin for this one but here's the idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right after swearing into office, they take the new president to a dark room filled with cigar smoking industrialists.  They roll a film of the Kennedy assassination from an angle never shown to the public.  After giving the implied death threat a moment to sink in, they then ask "Any Questions?"  For the next 4-8, the president is reminded that it will cost his life to defy the wishes of the puppet masters.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even if that is true, Sanders appears to genuinely be in the later chapters of a life of civil service.  I think he's veto a bill renewing the NDAA, even if it meant going out Kennedy style.  What a way to go...

       Look, he's one man. I get it, we all think the president has a whole lot of power but they have their handlers they have to appease; in the states and abroad. This guy is the closest I have seen to an "authentic" candidate during my years. I am definitely going to vote for him, but dear god guys something doesn't smell right. Our whole setup with government is trash. I know I sound like a pessimist I don't mean too; personally I'm just more concerned with trying to brighten up as many lives as I come into contact with. I don't want to have to worry about what's going on in the economy, wars in other countries, natural disasters, malevolent corporate deals, martial law, etc. Obviously, I HAVE to worry about those things because they're REAL. But they don't take time away from my mission; to heal nature. Human nature. Mother Nature. The nature of our relationship with each other, the world, and ourselves. If Bernie Sanders has answers for aaaallllll that shit, then great, but I really doubt it. How bout this... I'm fucking president of the United States. Have a good day, amigos!
