<p>If you simply treat the proton at the heart of the atom as a black hole - you can apply the holographic principle - yielding the proton rest mass - and by going backwards - the proton charge radius. This solution not only solves quantum gravity (we are deducing the mass of the proton via quantum vacuum fluctuations), but also rids us of the strong nuclear force (strongest force in the universe with absolutely no source, just &#39;is&#39; to make the equations work), understanding dark energy, and all of the &#39;spiritual&#39; and occult mysteries at the heart of the secret societies, namely that the whole is present in each piece. </p>

<p>The 64 tetrahedron matrix is the geometry of space itself. This matrix is a fractal - meaning it is self similar at all scales. It has very unique properties including utilizing Buckminster Fullers vector equilibrium and isotropic vector matrix. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/btQaGYo.png">Holofractal geometry 101</a></p>

<p>Essentially, this is the geometry which makes up space, and allows for spin, expansion, contraction, and stillness (singularity).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, i should have structured my sentences better. He is a complete fraud, he is literally spewing bullshit that would not fly under any conditions in a peer reviewed envrionment. Not only that but his theories on free energy and quantum theory are bastardizations of ideas newer physicists like David Bohm and older physicists like Tesla were positing. Tesla&#39;s free energy idea was elegant and has actual ground to stand on. Nassim&#39;s &quot;there&#39;s a black hole inside everything&quot; is a New Age mutation of the idea that every atom is a star or &quot;star seed&quot; that is a repeated image of the  cosmos that contains all the information of the cosmos inside of it. That&#39;s holographic theory, you can read about it in Mystical books like The Corpus Hermeticum (1-3 Centuries CE) and the Upanishads (800 Century BCE). You don&#39;t need Nassim&#39;s bullshit which is just a parody of philosophically sound ideas that were later noted in actual scientific inquiry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s essentially linked through symbol, &#39;sacred&#39; geometry.</p>

<p>It pervades all of the occult / elite secret societies. If you haven&#39;t seen secrets in plain sight - it&#39;s a must watch.</p>

<p>The real meanings / understandings of these symbols are probably lost - but the ideals associated with them still stick.</p>

<p>&#39;As above so below&#39; is the easiest to digest. Literally, the entirety of the cosmos is represented in the quantum world holographically.</p>

<p>The iChing, the tree of life / Kabbalistic tradition / Egyptian creation mythos relation to the vacuum geometry that allows this is linked in the OP. </p>

<p>For example, the Kabbalah <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/holofractal/comments/2utgnx/orthographic_projection_of_the_64tm_with_2/">talks about</a> fractal and holographic principles, and the tree of life lines up perfectly to the space geometry.</p>

<p>The flower of life that is <a href="http://gfycat.com/ShinySereneGrayreefshark">encoded at</a> the Egyptian Temple of Osiris is an exact match to the holographic interference pattern that results from this geometry.</p>

<p>The western occult has many ties to ancient Egypt, we can see this everywhere from the dollar bill to the Washington monument to freemasonic art/ideologies. This was probably facilitated by Egyptian priest schools (of which socrates, alexander the great, da vinci all attended) - which most likely brought the occult teachings over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So do you believe that the elite is actually trying to spread the messages of one-ness and the occult, nowadays?</p>

<p>What I&#39;m really asking is, the elite know of all this information, but try to keep it quiet. People think this helps keep people divided and easier to control, however, if somebody truly understood this information, would they not want to share it with the whole world? This leads me to believe the people who are trying to silence this information don&#39;t really grasp it 100%. Or maybe they know something we don&#39;t and what they&#39;re doing in this world is actually for the long term benefit of everyone</p>

The &quot;elites&quot; may not really know the hidden truth, but they know their goals, and they are achieving them. The internet, and individuals changing their own consciousness are their main opposition.Their current policies of instill and continuously reinforce fear, divide and conquer (men vs women, black vs white, etc), fake election process, external enemies, are working well.</p>

<p>He&#39;s already assumed a uniform density for everything so of course he&#39;s going to get linear progressions when looking at mass versus radius.

<p><strong>WHAT RESULT?</strong> He completely skips <em>the entire derivation</em> of the quantization of spacetime in the framework of general relativity under the Schwarzchild metric. Are we supposed to take his word for it? That isn&#39;t how scientific progress is made. This is a baseless claim. The entire paper is nothing but <em>algebra</em> - not a single tensor is in this paper. And when you&#39;re dealing with general relativity (i.e. black holes), you can only describe the spacetime interactions with tensor objects - not vague terminology.</p>

<p>You should stop propagating misinformation. It&#39;s really deplorable, even if it&#39;s on a site like reddit. This &quot;pseudo-physicist&quot; constitutes everything that is opposed to the progression of the knowledge of mankind.

<p>... this whole notion of Nassim Haramein being credible is offensive to the great theoretical physicists of the past. It&#39;s truly a prime example of blissful ignorance. It&#39;s almost like some users <em>want</em> to believe that all of our physics conundrums are <em>conveniently</em> already solved by the &quot;great&quot; Haramein, &quot;If only scientists would listen!&quot;.

<p>Nassim Haramein is the same ilk as Giorgio Tsoukalos, Graham Hancock or David Icke. </p>

<p>The fact that Nassim himself states that he was basically terrified of going to a scientific conference and then all but laughed out of it (moreso everyone was just shocked to silence that he couldn&#39;t even grasp basic concepts) should tell you all. </p>

<p>&quot;unfortunately, the truth exists independently of our wants.&quot; - couldn&#39;t have said it better myself. </p>

<p>I think it stems from the fact that physics is purely mathematical and requires years of study to fully understand - not something I claim to be able to do - so people prefer to fill in the gaps with easily understood, nicely sounding fluff coated with a few scientific concepts that fall apart at a moments scrutiny.

<p>I merely lumped them together because they all started their careers in basically a fraudulent manner. Heavens Mirror comes to mind with Hancock and while Icke may have been correct about a lot of things I wouldn&#39;t hurry to revere him as its entirely possible he was just throwing ideas at a wall and got lucky. I grouped them together because at they&#39;re core they write non-peer reviewed books with some extremely dubious claims all in the name - although they won&#39;t admit this - and scamming a few people out of some cash. </p>

It&#39;s just strange and very Occult-ish and fascinating at the same time. It&#39;s very hard to put into words.

<p>ok so what a hologram have to do with all this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is the more traditional understanding of holographic. Holographic - meaning holo (whole) graphic (image). The whole information set is present at each point. This is not the typical understanding of the holographic principle (everything is actually encoded on a 2d surface somewhere) - however the math is exactly the same. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle">holographic principle</a> is a solution for the black hole information paradox, meaning the volumetric information of a black hole can be encoded on it&#39;s surface.</p>

<p>If we treat the proton as a black hole - we can apply the holographic principle - showing us that the mass information of all particles is present in each particle (there are 10<sup>55</sup> grams worth of vacuum fluctuations [planck spherical units with the planck mass] that fit inside a proton volume)</p>

<p>This facilitates different concepts such as morphic resonance, non-local evolution of form, etc - without getting into any spirituality/occult talk (each particle is the ocean in a drop, not a drop in the ocean)</p>

<p>Adding up the amount of vacuum fluctuations in a proton volume yields the mass of the Universe. We currently see shadows of this phenomenon through quantum entanglement. However this is a preliminary understanding of the holographic network that connects all particles through the structure of space itself - that allows each proton to be informed of every other protons electrodynamic fluctuations, instantly. This is accomplished via a wheeler wormhole network - which we currently understand as &#39;quantum foam&#39;</p>

<p>After we deduce the mass of the Universe, we can apply the holographic principle - simply by dividing the surface vacuum fluctuations by the volume fluctuations - and yield a single protons rest mass. </p>

<p>It helps to think of the planck spherical unit (vacuum fluctuation) as an information &#39;voxel&#39; tiled in the interior of a proton. It creates a holographic interference pattern the same way we see the sphere packing in the flower of life symbol. </p>

<p>and who the hell knows how many particle are in the observable universe?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.physicsoftheuniverse.com/numbers.html">Estimations, again based on density</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>how the fuck one can calculate the mass of the entire universe?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mass density. To be more clear - it&#39;s the observable universe.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=mass%20of%20observable%20universe">Here</a></p>

<h1>tl;dr;</h1>

<p>the proton contains the mass-energy of all protons. only the rest mass of the proton is observable outside of it&#39;s event horizon due to the holographic principle. the ratio of surface to volume vacuum fluctuations in the proton yields the rest mass of a proton, taking us from the mass of all particles to the mass of a single proton. </p>

<p>all protons are in instantaneous communication with each other through the phenomenon we currently call quantum entanglement, however all particles are entangled. this explains the occult and spirituality.</p>

<p>this is because the 10<sup>40</sup> surface vacuum fluctuations are the terminations of wormholes connecting 10<sup>40</sup> particles. this means that out of the 10<sup>60</sup> vacuum fluctuations in the volume, 10<sup>-20</sup> volume fluctuations do not have a &#39;port&#39; out. These 10<sup>-20</sup> vacuum fluctuations left over, without instant access &#39;dial-out&#39; port - are the exact amount of vacuum fluctuations to equal the proton&#39;s rest mass. mass is a result of &#39;lag time&#39; of the holographic network.</p>

<p>In future publications we will address the confinement string-like gluon jet
flux tube structures of the QCD vacuum model as potentially arising from high curvature
within the spacetime Planck vacuum collective behavior background, acting as vortices near
the holographic screen topological horizon. This will be addressed utilizing an extended

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. </p>

<p>The first statement made in the OP says: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/holofractal/comments/3bzsyl/since_i_wrote_this_out_in_a_comment_might_as_well/">The amount of planck masses/vacuum fluctuations that fit in the proton volume is <em>coincidentally</em> the mass of the observable Universe at 10<sup>55</sup> grams.</a></p>

<p>Just off the top of my head, the issue with this statement is that both a 10<sup>55</sup> magnification and the currently observed mass of the universe are completely subjective characteristics - they only correlate to other nonsensically selected measurements and other subjective approximations rather than correlating to anything concrete about the actual universe. Additionally, the volume of a proton being divisible into x number of Planck masses is literally as meaningful as a meter being divisible into centimeters - it is an intrinsic property of the units of measurement being used and aside from that means nothing. On top of that, just like the approximated mass of the observable universe is a completely subjective measurement, so too is the approximated volume of a proton a completely subjective measurement.</p>

<p>Hopefully you can see at this point why I have little interest even bothering debunking anything else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I looked at the second statement in the OP, and it&#39;s such nonsense I can&#39;t even figure out how to demonstrate that it&#39;s nonsense. It&#39;s just measurements being compared against each other and shown to correlate to other measurements - but none of the measurements have any actual meaning, and nothing is actually implied regardless of whether they correlate or not. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why it would be my responsibility to prove such a thing. Are you saying that, when you look at something like the OP&#39;s second statement, for example, the first thought you have is, &quot;oh man! Everything makes so much sense now!&quot; Because that&#39;s completely ridiculous. If you&#39;re honest with yourself, I&#39;m sure you will agree that, upon looking at the statement aforementioned, it means <em>absolutely nothing.</em> The only reason a person would possibly believe the related claims, or think they had any merit, is because he takes the OP at his word when he says it&#39;s significant. Why don&#39;t you just stop doing that instead of expecting someone else to explain to you why nonsense is nonsense?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There actually are ideas in there that are quantum physics related.
