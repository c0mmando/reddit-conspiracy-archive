       If what you suggest is correct, think about what that means. An ex-President will only says what he actually thinks when he's on his way out. Does this mean he was actually afraid for his own life if he said the wrong thing?
      </p>
      <p>
       ps: People like to criticize Carter as a President, but he seemed like a pretty good guy. He didn't get the US into any wars and the late 70's were some pretty good times.

       He once made a comment that as President not a single US military shot was fired.  That is pretty god damn impressive.  That is also, unfortunately, one of the reasons people think he was a do-nothing president.  He didn't have any notable wars to impress us with or attacks on our civilians to save us from.

       He's gotten endless praise since leaving office for his involvement in american politics and had a very hefty travel schedule until last spring.  I think he has mended his reputation, it's hard to hate a guy that stayed in the game til his late 80s

       Everyone kinda says the same thing about him:  "He is an amazing humanitarian but was a terrible President." or "Jimmy Carter is the only person who is happy about Obama's tenure as President because now Carter won't be the worst President in modern history."  People respect him for his charitable work but they still trash him as a President.

       Carter inherited a fuel crisis, and brokered a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt.  And he built Amy a cool treehouse.

       CIA under Carter destabilized Iran leading to religious fundamentalists holding american hostages for over a year...

       No. That was the Shah and his huge social and military spending programs. Nixon and Ford were selling him everything but nukes. Back in the 1960's and early 70's, Iran was the USA's regional ally in the Gulf in much the same way the Saudis are (were?) today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, the Shah overreached with the spending and decided to cut back the social spending while maintaining the military buildup. People didn't like it. They also didn't like his cultural modernization policies. The combination of these and other factors led to social chaos and the Shah's overthrow.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Iranians knew that the CIA was quite active in Iran and they also remembered how the CIA helped put the Shah in power back in the day. The hostage taking by "students" was just an excuse to invade the US Embassy and go hunting for whatever stuff the CIA had left lying around.

       Carter is one of the very very few (maybe the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       ) modern presidents who didn't lie to the people. I'm serious, I can find outright, blatant lies from every president back to Carter and beyond, but Carter was just an all-around
       <em>
        good person
       </em>
       . It's no wonder the rest of politics hated him.

       he said the US is now an Oligarchy. I understood what you were saying all along. People just need to think a bit more and realize  what you are pointing out.

       This is sad, im sorry but down vote me all you want but what a coward. Mr. Carter knew it has been an Oligarchy for a long time, he has seen it starting to shape into this during his presidency. Where was his outcry coming into office? Now that your dieing you would like your name to be known once more by stating this. You knew you bastard.

       you can still be a democracy as an oligarchy. It just means that people who own property have the power through holding the ear of government and the indigent masses have none. How is that different from anywhere really? The poor, disadvantaged, etc are without power. As they have always been. It kind of comes with the package.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: hmmn, it would appear that at least 3 people don't understand the various forms of democracy. Or they don't like hearing that an Oligarchy is quite common in most democracies. Anyway, Carter should know it's more of a plutocracy run by the USAs 400 or so Billionaires. lol
