    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but there are far more white people than blacks in this country. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware of that. So obviously more white people will be killed by police. But, there&#39;s probably a higher percentage of the black population that gets killed by the police every year. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Irrelevant. You can pull statics out of your rectum, but situations are different. Where&#39;s the list of unarmed white people in the suburbs getting murdered by the police as compared to unarmed blacks in the bad parts of town? And I serious doubt anyone is for &quot;all lives,&quot; I never see people saying that criminal lives matter, a lot of people hate immigrants, the list goes on, it&#39;s always &quot;all lives matter... except for _____.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s mostly the actions during interactions with cops that get them killed and you know it.  You don&#39;t attack or attempt to run from anyone with a twitchy trigger finger.

    <div class="md"><p>back the fuck off -- it <em>may not</em> be skin color <em>TO YOU</em> but if you&#39;re not white living in a poor area where the majority of cops ARE white (&amp; let it be noted that often Black cops are just as bad), yeah i can understand why someone would run,</p>

<p>no, it doesn&#39;t make sense, but people <em>do</em> stupid things. they run when scared <em>or</em> they shoot someone in the back because they don&#39;t feel like chasing them (i&#39;m just guessing).</p>

<p>not all killings happened because of a &quot;bad&quot; interaction. people have been killed because they <em>called</em> for HELP.</p>

<p>don&#39;t justify murder by cop that has issues (whatever the hell they are).</p>
