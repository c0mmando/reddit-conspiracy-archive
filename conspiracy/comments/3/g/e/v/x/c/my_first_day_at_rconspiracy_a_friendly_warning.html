        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey there fellow thinkers,</p>

<p>Today I stumbled upon this subreddit and as a critical thinker I was quite pleasantly surprised to discover that there wasn&#39;t a purposeful &quot;tin-hat in the basement&quot; humor theme going on. I was, however, terribly disappointed once spending some time here for a completely different reason.</p>

<p>Whether you consider yourself a cynic, a critical thinker, open minded, someone with a wide world view, or whatever; you are here because you are more aware of the world&#39;s bullshit than your average person. Most people of this nature intrinsically have a desire to relay the knowledge they possess that others around them do not. This is both normal and healthy. The whole reason for this sub being here is to do just that.</p>

<p>This subreddit is currently filled with an abundance of negative, condescending, confrontational, and aggressive comments. And no matter how historically accurate these comments are (or how incorrect the comments are that provoked them), their inherent purpose of educating someone goes out the window when you approach someone in this manner. You end up sounding like someone stealing Bernie Sander&#39;s microphone.</p>

<p>I know that you are right (or at least strongly believe so). I know that they are wrong. I know that you need to correct what they typed. But the only way to truly do that is to calmly, politely, and rationally point out their error and provide the correct information.  Anything else will simply solidify their incorrect viewpoint.</p>

<p>I apologize for the rant, but the world is a fucked up place and the people here acting like children only make the task of informing the masses about it that much harder.</p>

<p>TL;DR stop being assholes. </p>

<p>-edit- It seems I wasn&#39;t super clear - this doesn&#39;t apply to the majority of comments in this subreddit. (although it applies to more than it probably should apply to). It isn&#39;t a blanket comment about everybody or you personally. My &quot;I know that you...&quot; is a method of writing meant to relay the context of my message, not directly and precisely describe YOU. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep in mind that a good percentage of users here are paid PR shills, or &quot;social media consultants&quot; if you like. Some of them bring negativity, themselves, as part of community-fracturing strategy. And some of them attract negativity through their insincere, disingenuous, deliberately misleading arguments. </p>

<p>Depending on context, I see many of them as accessories to mass murder -- they deserve much worse than mean words on a screen. At a minimum, they need to be shut down and publicly shamed for what they&#39;re doing. And it&#39;s often difficult to tell these assholes from actual newbies -- so sometimes there&#39;s some splash damage, and I do regret that. edit: But when we have agents of evil masquerading as normal users, this is a predictable, if unfortunate, result.</p>

<p>If we could wave a magic wand and eliminate the PR shills, this would be a much nicer place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One man&#39;s trash is another&#39;s treasure... or some shit.</p>

<p>It is hard to remember sometimes, but one-off text-only communication with strangers can often come off wrong. I&#39;m a perfectly rational, intelligent fellow. However, I type faster than I can think and have put down sentences that were so off from what I wanted to communicate that I looked the fool. I&#39;ve also (on...well, more than one occasion) been straight fucking wrong. We all have.</p>

<p>And then the cases which you are dealing with actual trash- I try to remember that a bunch of people will see their trash and then my response. So, I quickly &amp; politely correct them then completely ignore their trash response. That way people see they are trash and consider the info in the more rational comment below it :-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub is threatening to a lot of interests, including large corporations and governments. I talk about this stuff in person to people at festivals all the time, and the typical modern &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is typically a lot more kind and open minded than you would get an impression from here.</p>

<p>I think most of the really insane voices here are paid to do what they do. If I was Monsanto, I&#39;d throw a few million dollars a year into &quot;Reputation Managment&quot;... same with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran, Russia, Britain, Shell, Walmart, etcetera, etcetera.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t tell how many people are shills here, because they hide the stats that I would use to detect such nonsense. However, as a baseline, I can say with high certainty that Disqus is as much as 90% paid comments in a sensitive, medium traffic article.</p>

<p>On topics that have thousands of articles and tens of thousands of votes, it is much harder to control the conversation... but controlling <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would be a cakewalk... and MOST of reddit, for that matter.</p>

<p>I would skip <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> until you have a grasp of what topics are official cover for the underlying earth based, non-paranormal conspiracies. Head over to CorbettReport.com or his page on YouTube and look up any topic you want to learn about. He is the consummate sane conspiracy theorist, and he beats <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> unless you&#39;re looking for just the new information that pops up. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is GREAT for that.</p>

<p>It SUCKS if you want to find out how the average conspiracy theorist thinks, because 80% of the A-Holes are trying to make you think that all <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is FULL of A-Holes.</p>

<p>Again, Disqus is 70%-90% paid for comments and votes, and they are using Meat Puppets, not Bots... so it is expensive. It would be foolish to think that they&#39;re dominating Discus, where they CAN get caught, and not Reddit, which hides all the forensics and lets snakes crawl free.</p>

I&#39;ve been part of digital marketing schemes that used many fake reddit accounts to give injections of upvotes to something to get it enough momentum for natural upvotes (for example, a moving company with a really funny commercial. pop it on <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a> or something, give it a few hundred upvotes in rapid succession to become &quot;hot&quot;, then let it go from there.) The same basic mass account principles can be used for anything you want. There is no real safeguard against it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s working. They can post as many videos about the New Madrid Fault Line or Nibiru as they want. I&#39;m not going to fight about it any more, because the people saying these insane things... the aren&#39;t like normal people.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been on BBS&#39;s and IRC slinging BS for 30 years. They are FLOODING this place with meat puppets, and yet... we survive.</p>

<p>I just ignore the BS and watch for NEW people coming here and make sure they know it&#39;s BS. I don&#39;t call anyone &quot;Shill&quot;. I just ignore them and support people who are clearly sincere... even if they&#39;re a bit wacky =P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I haven&#39;t checked out that site to be honest. So, I can&#39;t comment on it specifically but from a glance it seems to have a lot of valid information.</p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming you know a lot about the topic (thus I can be really general). I think we had three planes hitting three buildings as cover to demolish them, and one of those planes met with an unplanned end in a field. This resulted in WTC7 going down without a plane hitting it. Just a slight hiccup in the plan, which isn&#39;t too big of a deal because you can just have the official government investigation refuse to bring up the third building later. </p>

<p>It is hard to remember sometimes, but one-off text-only communication with strangers can often come off wrong. I&#39;m a perfectly rational, intelligent fellow. However, I type faster than I can think and have put down sentences that were so off from what I wanted to communicate that I looked the fool. I&#39;ve also (on...well, more than one occasion) been straight fucking wrong. We all have.</p>

<p>And then the cases which you are dealing with actual trash- I try to remember that a bunch of people will see their trash and then my response. So, I quickly &amp; politely correct them then completely ignore their trash response. That way people see they are trash and consider the info in the more rational comment below it :-)</p>
