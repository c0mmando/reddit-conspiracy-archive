       I'm gonna die of laughter if @deray endorses Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is something so off about that guy. Came out of nowhere and took over the movement by hooking up and raising money with Ferguson locals. He never gets arrested, never gets majorly harassed and always lands interviews on big media. He even had a site where he got people to give him their cell phone numbers to receive a text of the Michael Brown jury decision.  If you wanted to build a list of shit disturbers for the government what a great way to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare him to someone like Bassem Masri who was arrested many many times and put in solitary for a week because of a traffic ticket. They cops harassed him so much he dropped out of protest scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would bet my liver the government has at least a couple people embedded high up in the movement. Is it Deray? Maybe. Maybe not. But if we could bet that's who I'd put some money on.

       Security agencies have many experts out there working as founders and organizers of ''dissent'' groups. That's an old game from ancient Chinese folklore and shit.
       <br/>
       I accuse Stokely Carmichael and Angela Davis and Abbie Hoffman of being federal agents or CFR type agents.
       <br/>
       Your boy there sounds like one.
       <br/>
       I'm positive the Occupy thing was leapt upon by these expert movement leaders, from the UN, the feds, AND the elite cartels as a tactical furthering of their thousands of years old studies on how to control people in mass groups, of varying environments.
       <br/>
       Right now, every single security agency interested in control, the secret elite squads, the feds, the cops, the social planners, the ''educators'' cough cough, UNESCO, view this unrest as super happy study and learn how to control more, fun time. These leaders of  social unrest movements they train get to pull puppet strings dictated by orders from above.
       <br/>
       In some civil disobedience groups, the training is complex, where one needs to know all about whales or seals or fracking chemical analyses. One must be aware of complex issues, and be able to speak about them.
       <br/>
       In black oriented organizing, the game is much easier to play, as an undercover agent leader. That provocetuer shit is a distraction. The real agents are at the top of civil unrest orgs. Anyway, a black agent has to be black, and be sick of the man's bullshit, and be able to display anger about [list names, dates, places, times, how many shots fired, of police killings] ''This shit got to STOP!''
       <br/>
       So easy to infiltrate.
       <br/>
       What new ideas in black dissent organizing have cropped up since the 60s?
       <br/>
       Nothing. Their movements are led by federal agents with amazing hypnosis based bamboozle plans that really fucking work. Bam fucking boozled.
       <br/>
       Any black who even hints at anything I said would be lynched by their own people. In black civil disobedience culture, they never ferreted out any spies, or double agents, or anyone infiltrating any of the dozens of movements over the decades. In twisted black civil disobedience culture, every single ''leader'' must be respected and solumnly regarded in high praise, with no possibility of them working foir the man, or having been duped by the man.

       He's so fucking obvious. The emotional outbursts spell ''easy agent training''.
       <br/>
       The black guy on the street yelling ''dey killin us!!'' is immediately trusted by all black activists. Alex's job is way more complex.
       <br/>
       He's actually pretty good at it, the federal jesuit agent of whatever.

       He's got millions of folks hoodwinked, both those with him, and against him.

       It's not that surprising.  The parties represent a Hegelian dialectic.  You chop up the issues that most people support to make them more or less equally attractive and split the vote, divide the people.  Then you use one party to attack the middle class, the other party to attack the lower class.  End of the day everyone gets fucked but no one knows how to fight back.
      </p>
      <p>
       People often find themselves liking "extremists" from both parties because these are the people who focus on the things we all like about either party and drop most of the other crap that we don't.  In other words, they are as close to genuine as you can be within the system; no one is allowed to be more than "half" good because they have to pick a party, but they can mostly drop the bad half.  But these people not electable because the elections are rigged and politicians are not useful to the system unless their true intention is to implement things none of us like while paying lip service to a few things we do.

       As has been now resolved, the varying numbers of deaths under the Stalin administration are a product of propaganda, and have hence been wildly exaggerated. The evidence found in Russian archives, opened up by the capitalist roader Yeltsin, put the total number of death sentences from 1923 to 1953, the post-Lenin Soviet Union, between 775,866 and 786,098.a To this we must add up the 40,000 who may have been executed without trial and unofficially.b If we add up the numbers, what we get achieve is 800,000 executions in a period of 36 years, less than the lives claimed by the dictatorship of the CIA-backed anti-communist Suharto in Indonesia in a time span of 2 years. This is not to say the deaths are to be condoned, but it raises an important question: if fewer lives have been claimed by the Soviet Union under Stalin than Suharto’s Indonesia, why is Stalin demonized to that extent when Suharto is rarely even known among pro-capitalists?

       That's grossly understating the death toll.  Holodomir anyone?  Man made famines?

       If unintentional starving is taken into account capitalism still has the higher deathtoll by a landslide.

       The Holodomir was not accidental any more than the Irish potato famine.

       It was Bernays who built the concept of Communism as being "bad" and something to be feared, as a tool to move popular sentiment against the Russians.  Communism has been violently controversial since its inception, but we turned from being Russia's friend to being their deadly enemy, and that turn was deliberately manufactured.

       There was never any proof that that is what the Soviets intended to do. I don't believe it was intentional as there was a food crisis throughout the Soviet Union at the time.

      <p>
       That's interesting that Bernays was instrumental in anti-communist propaganda. It has gotten so bad now that being anti-communist is seen as patriotic as seen by the MURICA subreddit.

       There was a food crisis.  However, the crisis in the Ukraine was purposefully amplified, in retaliation for the Ukrainian dissatisfaction and growing isolationism inside the Communist sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the general food crisis, what kind of food crisis happens at the exact same time that Russia exports record quantities of wheat and other crops?  A failure of management to be sure, but the situation in the Ukraine was a tool to break the back of the Ukrainian resistance by starving the population.

       It's not any worse now than it has been in the past.  I recently helped clear out hundreds of pounds of old magazines and books from someone's cellar that dated back to the 50s and 60s.  If anything, it's much tamer now.  Much tamer.  But because we're young, we don't have the experience to know that.

       You really could not easily find two people in American politics who are farther apart, ideologically. They are on complete opposite ends of the political spectrum and advocate a completely opposite set of ideas. The fact that you would vote for either of them is kind of baffling.

       I disagree.  There are plenty of places where libertarians and socialists intersect, and specifically these two who are, as anyone, not strictly defined by their chosen label.
      </p>
      <p>
       They both rail against the powerful interests controlling the major politicians of the country.  They both talk about getting money out of politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are both similar in terms of foreign policy, in avoiding military conflict as much as possible.  They both opposed the PATRIOT Act and mass surveillance.
      </p>
      <p>
       They diverge when they talk about the role of government in society: healthcare, minimum wage, SS, DOE, EPA and regulations across the board.  These aren't small things, but they both want a government steered by the people and not a plutocracy.  And the media owned by that plutocracy has not been kind to either.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we could agree to reform the system and remove that control, at that point we can decide government's role in our lives.

       And I made sure to point that out. My point was that I'd rather vote for genuine candidate who don't bullshit around and know what they believe. People who aren't concerned with their career as a politician but rather what they feel is right. I can at least respect that even if I don't always agree.

       lol thats funny how you think the two sides are "opposing" each other
      </p>
      <p>
       whether trump, clinton, obama, jeb bush, marco rubio, romney wins, the exact same shit will happen. all that changes is the spin they put on it before and after.
      </p>
      <p>
       a prime example - illegal immigrants, or "undocumented immingrants" i guess we're calling them now. These will all be converted to real citizens at some point in the near future, no matter who is in office. All that will change will be the spin put on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like I write in every one of these "omg politics is corrupt!" threads on here -
      </p>
      <p>
       There are people who benefit with billions, investing millions of $ and hundreds of hours into what they're doing and what they want done. Compare the drive and motivation of those people to the motivation of your average, overweight/obese american. They watch 2 debates on TV, get spoonfed their viewpoint from the "post debate analysis" (like it matters anyways), and then go back to american idol and eating mcdonalds. tomorrow at work they'll "debate" with "bible thumping racists" or "minority loving faggots", thinking they're accomplishing something. election day will come, they'll take the day off work, get a stupid sticker and wear it around like they did something, voting the way that could be predicted years before the "debates" or candidates were even announced. Then at night, every retard will huddle around their computer or tv waiting to see if "their side won". half will go to sleep happy, half depressed, all retarded
      </p>
      <p>
       like most things in life, you get out what you put in. the same goes for politics. So i dont know why anyone with half a brain is surprised that the american public is being duped or manipulated... we don't care at all. we care as much as the CNN or 'The Daily Show with Jon Liebowitz' tells us to care, just enough to jerk off over, and then we move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's gotten to such a level of retardation that there's no point trying to fight it or even get upset about it. it is what it is now, and you thinking you're one step ahead really means you're one step behind.

       how can you be one step ahead of the people at the front?
      </p>
      <p>
       if theyre the ones deciding things years before it's even public, they're the ones that have been openly abducting, torturing and experimenting on their own citizens for more than half a century, and they're the ones storing and analyzing every email, phone call, and tweet you post, how can you be ahead of that?
      </p>
      <p>
       all of us are at the back of the line, it's just most are too busy looking down at their bag of mcdonalds to even realize it. it could be different, but like we all know, people don't want to put in work and change things. easier to just complain (about what the news tells you to. Example - one lion shot in africa, national outrage for a month due to media coverage. meanwhile, 50,000 kids under 5 die per day in africa, nobody really cares. in all the time everyone spent crying over a lion, protesting, etc. they could have achieved a real result and just donated a $5 to prevent the 5,000 daily preventable malaria deaths of children in africa and moved on with their life and done something else with their time. but we know people like to cry)

       It's controlled opposition because they're doing it to control the public. They probably already know the result of the fucking election, they simply do these things to pit the public against each other. I mean for fucks sake, have you seen how mad people get over each others music taste? People will argue about anything. They're taking advantage of that.

       If it was illegal to lie and manipulate regarding politics, then all the politicians would be in jail. I think everyone understands that they all do it, but pretend that they don't see it. Kinda like how people pretend that Velveeta is actually cheese.

       I don't like social democratic government. If I labor and earn money then nobody else has the right to take it for redistribution.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be fine with it if money was a public utility issued by the treasurer based on economic productivity. Those who couldn't work would get the required amount to eat, get medical treatment and be housed with enough extra to have leisure time.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a system where money was handed out on a merit basis then a nation would have legitimate reason to educate, keep healthy, and happy the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Socialist systems can't work with money issued by private entities. It definitely could if it were a public utility.

       I never understood the 'no one has the right to take my money and redistribute it' argument. Money is a tool or a means to an end that's supposed to buy quality of life and happiness right? So instead of looking at yourself, the lone tree, look at the country as a forest- a whole that you are trying to keep healthy and happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea is that its a statement of priorities- is it more important to let a super rich Multi billionaire CEO have an extra $5 million in tax breaks or could our country use that $5 million in tax loopholes to help poorer people be able to afford college . Basically, is it
       <em>
        morally
       </em>
       more important to the country as a whole to have our economic priorities be things like letting
       <a href="http://www.trueactivist.com/18-ceos-called-out-by-bernie-sanders-for-taking-trillions-in-bailouts-evading-taxes-and-outsourcing-jobs">
        the CEO of the Bank of America pay $0 in taxes and yet get $1.9 billion in tax refund
       </a>
       OR do we try and have the super rich contribute more to the collective well being of the country and guarantee that people like

       - are able to get free health care.
      </p>

       I say this as someone who comes from a family that is near the top of wealth in this country and someone who has also lived in the UK, where my friends could go get medicine they needed for free, and where college was several thousand dollars a year rather than $40k or more.

       All you need to understand is that if you worked for something nothing gives another the right to take it from you.

       Not an individual or a group of individuals calling themselves a government.

       The privatization of capital is the reason the world is in this current state. Making capital a publicly available right does away with elitism and classes.

       The harder you work the more you earn, your time is paid for versus exploited as is currently the system the world works under.

       A country that depresses and subjugates its citizens ability to produce in favor of a few at the tops benefit would be weaker than a nation that promotes citizens health and well being equally.

       That's where the whole issue lies though. CEOs make
       <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/Corporate-Watch/Paywatch-2014">
        five HUNDRED times what their workers do
       </a>
       . Are they working 500 times harder? Absolutely not. Are teachers who bust their ass and get &lt;$50,000 a year working 100 times less hard than an NBA player, whose average salary is $5 million? If how hard you worked was directly correlated to pay, then people who come from low income families could just work hard and then be rich, but that's obviously not the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       And more importantly what people like Bernie sanders is advocating for is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to give poor people more money directly. It's to help people with health care like that guy in the video, and college- so that money isn't such a barrier to education or getting giant life-ruining cysts off of your face . Seriously, please take a minute and put yourself in this guys shoes and try to empathize:

       No not even slightly. Read what I wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this moment the money I earn through my own labor is reduced through taxation to fund social programs and service debt on interest caused by governments borrowing capital from private banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think private banks should be dissolved and their function handled by individual countries treasury departments.
      </p>
      <p>
       This way a country can issue currency on a merit based system of labor. The more economic production a worker puts in the more currency they are issued.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the cases of disability, and inability to produce economically then the government would issue the vital currency directly to those individuals and families so as to provide a comfortable quality of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       There would be no need to tax citizens if the government issued a debt free currency tied to GDP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead the govt would have the incentive to actually promote a physically and mentally healthy population versus a competitive, aggressive, and divided population of narcissists like America currently.
      </p>
      <p>
       The loans made to govt are paid by its citizens but the citizens didn't secure these loans. Citizens ask for safety, security, and liberty.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we get from the current system is exploitation, govt terrorism, and fascism.

       Businesses would be better able to plan and budget in a debt free currency system. Instead of navigating a 75,000 page tax code and competition killing regulations they could spend their energy on their products.
      </p>
      <p>
       The silk road demonstrated this principle with bit coin as its debt free decentralized currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       The products from silk road were dependable and high quality (no pun intended). The sellers on silk road had the incentive to provide excellent service and quality due to their market being free to express their likes and dislikes publicly and without intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
       They weren't given tax breaks for backroom deals or future favors and thus they competed with each other to win consumers with quality and customer service.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regulations should only address the businesses operating consequences. If a products production causes environmental or health damage then the regs would demand the biz change or lose their charter and get dissolved.
      </p>
      <p>
       The profit motive is the killer of sound and safe business practices. Take the profit motive away and replace it with customer satisfaction motive and winner winner chicken dinner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also without favors being able to be handed out the regulations that are on the books could be enforced and actually do what they were intended to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly I'd just like to say, competition is great in sports, product creation, and with yourself. Competition with others for the right and comfort to live is fucking horrible.

       I finished two years of school to make less than 15 and I'm a firefighter paramedic. Why would anyone want to go to school for anything less? If they had a way to make sure everyone made more than cool but that hasn't been figured out. McDonalds has already started replacing people with computerized ordering systems. Family owned businesses can't afford it. The whole thing just seems forced and unpolished.

       Wouldn't that put the original low wage earner in the same situation they were in from the start? If you raise everyone's wages then the cost of business will go up. That extra cost will be passed on to the price of the product they are selling to pay for the increased cost of doing business. So while the low wage employees wages go up, their buying power remains the same.

       Wages need to be indexed to inflation to off set the loss of capital. What you describe is a long term effect. People are being robbed of what they deserve through taxes, low interest rates, and rampant inflation.

       I'm so tired of this entitlement. You don't get a bonus just because you've been mistreated. You've already been held at the bottom of what it takes to live, and you just don't know it because they artificially have the 'minimum' far below where it should be.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should be supporting the wage increase specifically
       <em>
        to use as a bargaining chip for a better wage yourself
       </em>
       .

       I already commented on your last point in this thread. I already agree that ems professionals need to fight the same fight. Also, it's not entitlement. It's being paid for your contribution to society. And quite frankly a typical fast food employee isn't worth as much as a firefighter or paramedic let alone someone who is both.

       Fast food workers may not be worth as much as ems, but they aren't worth 7.25. They COULD BE worth 15, and that goes to show how much EVERYONE is getting the short end of the stick. Ems workers are making what fast food workers should be making right now.

        in which she stated "This woman has known me since high school, back when I had a Sarah Palin button on backpack....we been thru a lot."
       </p>
       <p>
        Alone, we can surmise that she may have made a few questionable choices in her youth. OK, she was young, but Palin was a candidate for VP running against the first black president. But when I read down a little further, my benefit of the doubt limit had been reached.

        "GOP shoulda groomed me right then...now they gotta see me on the other side
        <em>
         shrugs
        </em>
        "
       </p>
       <p>
        For real? It's like that? This wasn't 8 years, or even 4 years ago. She posted that last month. So my question is, what kinda grooming would it have taken?
       </p>
       <p>
        If you're going to accuse white liberals of racism, and target the only presidential candidate, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders with a 40 year track record of standing up for #BlackLivesMatter you might not want people to know that "I had a Sarah Palin button on my backpack" or admit that the GOP could have "groomed you more". Because now you look disingenuous at best, and an agent provocateur at worse.#FeelTheBern #BlackLivesMatter2Bernie #SarahPalinButtonReally #BLMjoinBernie #NativeAmericanLivesMatter #Ismellcointelpro

       that's funny, but wearing a khafi does not mean she is palestinian.  It does generally signify unity with that social justice cause though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have any problem with the concept or methods of either of these protests, but I do wonder whether this is another subversive soros coopted movement like those black blocers that always end up causing trouble at trade conferences that make the rest of the peaceful protesters look bad.

       Reddit's reaction to the black live matter campaign has not been particularly sympathetic and I think we're seeing some serious race baiting building.

       I was just repeating what I saw on twitter, apparently she was claiming so but take it with a pinch of salt. At face value I support the concept of BLM (and I also support Palestine) but I really don't agree with the way they interrupted the Sanders speech. I think it's disgusting behavior, as is inciting violence at a peaceful protest, especially if it's paid for by big money with political motivations.

       The elite class politically assassinated Ron Paul last election via the media, but inadvertently cemented a libertarian movement permanently into place. I'm sure they learned their lesson and will be assassinating Bernie with covert grass roots forces, lest they also have to deal with a permanent Democratic Socialist movement.

       Occupy was hijacked by tumblr SJWs (not even kidding - Google the Progresive Stack) but in Sanders and Warren the social democratic movement has firmly-established figureheads. I think it'll be fine.

       The media has inundated us with stories about how occupy failed, likely because they want occupiers to become apathetic and give up. Occupy and the Ron Paul revolution both have made significant impacts on politics IMO.

       It doesn't make sense to shove Bernie aside like that, especially when he is on their side. What's the point of getting up on stage? Just to say, "Hey! We exist and we care! Unlike this white supremacist politician over here, that we clearly know nothing about"?

       Ah well. There's really very little he could do about it. Can't criticise them for being shills, because then he's just whitesplaining and condoning the death of Mike Brown (who was a violent thief, for christ's sake).

       Contextually, shooting Michael Brown was justified IMO. Other cases like Sandra Bland and Eric Garner have been inexcusably handled, and are appalling, but I don't think Brown fits into that bracket.

       Self-defense on this one for sure. The whole "hands up don't shoot" statements by his friend came out to pure BS. All eyewitnesses (including African Americans) backed the officers statements. The media played this one up and sounds like the propaganda worked on you.

       of course the propaganda worked on me. i fully support our glorious leader's right to chose when we live or die without so-called "due process" that bleeding heart liberals are always going on about. if i leave the house and appear to have committed a crime, i expect to be murdered where i stand rather than arrested and taken to a court of law so that a jury of my so-called peers can review evidence and make a decision based on the law and presumption of innocence.

       Have you even looked into the case? The guy (not kid) was shot while bull-rushing the officer after he had already assaulted him. Eyewitnesses and autopsy verify this.  Self-defense. Case closed. It's ok to admit you were wrong.

       You know that sounds ridiculous right? You honestly believe he rushed the officer while he had his gun out? I thought he was trying to take it from the car. I thought he was reaching into his waist band? I mean I guess if you throw enough hyperbole police phrasing people eventually believe some of it.

       Ehhh... name calling, really? Grow up. Guy just robbed a convenience store and then attacks the cop when confronted moments later. If I have my gun on me and you come at me, you are getting shot. I agree 100% that police unfairly target blacks, just not in this case. What about Walter Scott in South Carolina? That was murder and attempted cover-up caught on camera!

       Allegedly, G.S. spent 40 million dollars to support the out of town professional protestors arrival in Ferguson.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently, Soros made his first fortune by helping the Nazi's in his neighborhood locate other Jewish community members and where they hid their monies. Soros left when things were looking bad for his sponsors and fled when his horde to London.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a boom and bust investor in various unstable governments, Soros has unscrupulously taken advantage of international chaos to make his billions. In his autobiog Soros claims he enjoys destroying governments, destabilizing countries and hurting the little people and playing god. The USA is firmly in Soros' target picture.

       Well DUH!!!!
Most of these protests involving blacks have involved paid protestors. Remember in Ferguson when people started bitching about "not getting paid"? OWS had paid union members, etc. the list goes on and on.
Let's not forget the shitstorm just a few weeks ago with O'Malley and BLM people to the point he had to actually apologize for saying "All lives matter"?

       It would have been smart for Sanders to hire the people to disrupt his speech because this has given him more support than anyone. I doubt it's true. Just a theory.

       Sorros has been a longtime funder of radical protests in order to overthrow many governments. He's spurred the Ferguson riots and gave 33+ million dollars to fund the black lives matters. They won't ever interrupt a Hillary event because George Sorros has her in the bag.

       Actually, no, it says "groups that embolden activists. That's a pretty ill-defined and broad category. It definitely does NOT specifically say BLM. Why would you interpret those words to specifically mean BLM?

       "Recently when I was blessed to make a religious pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca where I met many people from all over the world, plus spent many weeks in Africa trying to broaden my own scope and get more of an open mind to look at the problem as it actually is, one of the things that I realized, and I realized this even before going over there, was that our African brothers have gained their independence faster than you and I here in America have. They've also gained recognition and respect as human beings much faster than you and I. Just ten years ago on the African continent, our people were colonized. They were suffering all forms of colonization, oppression, exploitation, degradation, humiliation, discrimination, and every other kind of -ation. And in a short time, they have gained more independence, more recognition, more respect as human beings than you and I have. And you and I live in a country which is supposed to be the citadel of education, freedom, justice, democracy, and all of those other pretty-sounding words. So it was our intention to try and find out what it was our African brothers were doing to get results, so that you and I could study what they had done and perhaps gain from that study or benefit from their experiences."

       So support Rand Paul, then. He's been speaking out against financial influence in politics for years, too, but he also doesn't want government controlling your life or your finances, unlike Sanders. Win-win situation...unless you somehow think its morally justifiable to institute socialism and vote yourself more of other individuals' money and force them under the will of the collective.

       I would urge you to do your own independent research, and stay away from blogs and opinions. Now I don't know 100% of Bernie's policies, but most of them, and especially the ones he campaigns on, are economically sound and supported by many economists.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as socialism goes, its more of an ideal rather now than anything. Greece and Venezuela are both capitalist, however certain policies are of a socialist persuasion. Guess what, we've had policies of socialist persuasion for a very long time too, and just like us, those 2 have more going on than just policies. It would be wrong to say those 2 countries are the epitome of socialist design, in a vacuum, and their socialism ideals is what did them in - because its not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Koch brothers are probably the most visible in regards to monied person interest corrupting our government. That is why Koch is the popular go-to when identifying the issue. His policies would affect Koch and Soros alike - the goal is to remove special interest, the American public should just about be their only interest.

       Not socialist countries? Really? I study this stuff virtually every day, for a good portion of the day. Read Mises, Hayak, Bastiat, Friedman, or any of the economists and political thinkers out there on this issue. Socialism is a wormy, vile, and dishonest system because fairness is relative and forced redistribution is morally reprehensible.

       This was my point: there is no epitome of a socialist country like there can't be an epitome of a libertarian or free trade country. They are all fundamentally capitalist, but may have specific policies that reflect an ideal.
      </p>
      <p>
       So given that, and given that i n our melting pot of a country, we have persuasions of every direction. You may not want to throw out the socialist things like roads, police or education simply because of the label socialist.

       First of all, I'm not a shill for Bernie Sanders as I am not even an American, so I don't exactly care who wins your presidency.

       Second of all, no, he doesn't have dual citizenship with Israel. Please try not to get your information from Facebook posts.

       Haha yeah I know that, but I guess it's a sort of "who was there first?" thing. Certainly the people who rule over America now are not actually "American". I don't really want to go deep down that road though, 'cause I know you people can get brutal with all this stuff. I'll just let it die with me.

       Contextually, shooting Michael Brown was justified IMO. Other cases like Sandra Bland and Eric Garner have been inexcusably handled, and are appalling, but I don't think Brown fits into that bracket.

       You know that sounds ridiculous right? You honestly believe he rushed the officer while he had his gun out? I thought he was trying to take it from the car. I thought he was reaching into his waist band? I mean I guess if you throw enough hyperbole police phrasing people eventually believe some of it.

       This was my point: there is no epitome of a socialist country like there can't be an epitome of a libertarian or free trade country. They are all fundamentally capitalist, but may have specific policies that reflect an ideal.
      </p>
      <p>
       So given that, and given that i n our melting pot of a country, we have persuasions of every direction. You may not want to throw out the socialist things like roads, police or education simply because of the label socialist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to sit here and lecture you why a certain ideal is better or worse than the other, because that's futile.

       I'm so tired of this entitlement. You don't get a bonus just because you've been mistreated. You've already been held at the bottom of what it takes to live, and you just don't know it because they artificially have the 'minimum' far below where it should be.

       No not even slightly. Read what I wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this moment the money I earn through my own labor is reduced through taxation to fund social programs and service debt on interest caused by governments borrowing capital from private banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think private banks should be dissolved and their function handled by individual countries treasury departments.
      </p>
      <p>
       This way a country can issue currency on a merit based system of labor. The more economic production a worker puts in the more currency they are issued.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the cases of disability, and inability to produce economically then the government would issue the vital currency directly to those individuals and families so as to provide a comfortable quality of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       There would be no need to tax citizens if the government issued a debt free currency tied to GDP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead the govt would have the incentive to actually promote a physically and mentally healthy population versus a competitive, aggressive, and divided population of narcissists like America currently.
      </p>
      <p>
       The loans made to govt are paid by its citizens but the citizens didn't secure these loans. Citizens ask for safety, security, and liberty.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we get from the current system is exploitation, govt terrorism, and fascism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Businesses would be better able to plan and budget in a debt free currency system. Instead of navigating a 75,000 page tax code and competition killing regulations they could spend their energy on their products.
      </p>
      <p>
       The silk road demonstrated this principle with bit coin as its debt free decentralized currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       The products from silk road were dependable and high quality (no pun intended). The sellers on silk road had the incentive to provide excellent service and quality due to their market being free to express their likes and dislikes publicly and without intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
       They weren't given tax breaks for backroom deals or future favors and thus they competed with each other to win consumers with quality and customer service.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regulations should only address the businesses operating consequences. If a products production causes environmental or health damage then the regs would demand the biz change or lose their charter and get dissolved.
      </p>
      <p>
       The profit motive is the killer of sound and safe business practices. Take the profit motive away and replace it with customer satisfaction motive and winner winner chicken dinner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also without favors being able to be handed out the regulations that are on the books could be enforced and actually do what they were intended to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly I'd just like to say, competition is great in sports, product creation, and with yourself. Competition with others for the right and comfort to live is fucking horrible.
