    <div class="md"><p>Zero.</p>

<p>China devalued its currency in an attempt to prevent its economy from completely crashing, not to start some sort of currency war.  The US understand that.</p>

<p>China is also more than capable of determining why that plant exploded and, if it was foul play, making a clear, provable connection. If that proof were to point to the US, it would be considered an act of war.</p>

<p>The USA is a bully. It only picks on easy targets. China is not in any sense of the term an easy target.</p>

<p>No chance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i am very curious to hear what evidence comes out about the origin of this explosion but i don&#39;t believe my eyes when i see the footage.  this historically horrific if terrorist.  USA terror or any other culprit.  Treasonously high to provoke war like this.  so...</p>

<p>IF the US is involved the citizens of the US should revolt.  its evident based off personal experience and history that this is no longer humanitarian US/foreign wars of the 20th and 21st century... you are seeing provocation.  the paradigm shift that americans cannot accept and must accept and react to.</p>

<p>either way i hope there is a way for the Chinese people to recover.  this is an unbelievable event.  timing of it all seems very suspicious.   and i hope to god my government is not this stupid.  if so, we have no choice.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wouldn&#39;t surprise me...the U.S. has been ratcheting up the tension over the past few years--even going to the extent of re-focusing the longterm goals of the military. U.S. has also been attempting to open military bases in Vietnam and the Philippines--it&#39;s no wonder China is building an island in the South China Sea.</p>

<p>Another tidbit I found interesting is that the explosion caused China to shut down their Supercomputer: <a href="http://www.ecns.cn/cns-wire/2015/08-13/177010.shtml">http://www.ecns.cn/cns-wire/2015/08-13/177010.shtml</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s not clear yet if there was damage to the Supercomputer or not (the article says there was damage to the building, but the computer was turned off as a precaution).</p>

<p>The port in the city that was damaged is the 4th busiest in the world--this fact alone will cause a strong reaction if China perceives anything other than a tragic industrial accident to have taken place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok lets just slow down for a second. I think it&#39;s fair to say that whenever you add more layers to a plan the more complex it becomes and the greater the chances for failure. Also, just because someone wants to maintain plausible deniability doesn&#39;t mean it always happens. What if they are discovered? Wars have been started over less certainty.</p>
