       Been hearing and reading a lot about the madness of all the thin ice Political Correctness trends popping up in Universities, and recently a thread about it made it to the front page here:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3go2y1/anne_rice_i_think_we_are_facing_a_new_era_of/">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3go2y1/anne_rice_i_think_we_are_facing_a_new_era_of/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Which got me to do some critical thinking. Now I am going to propose this scenario without having even done a single internet search on the subject, mostly because I'm off to bed for tonight, but $100 says, if we investigate this further, i bet we will find special interest groups who are funding this movement as a form of social engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it becomes trendy to never question, to impose this constant need to walk on thin ice so each person is constantly monitoring their own words, thoughts, actions for the sake of not creating any "micro aggressions" and "emotional responses" in others, then this will have successfully created a generation of sheep that live in a thought policed society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hmmmm.....thought police, where have I heard that before?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, im out, but I bet by the time i get up tomorrow, the sleuths on this sub would have found the source of funding for this ridiculousness. (Wouldn't be surprised if it was Soros)

       It goes right along with what you're saying. In my own readings, I've come across the concept of Cultural Marxism. Long story short, this is the origin of the whole political correctness thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       PC is all about criticizing existing social norms, mores etc. What you'll notice is a whole lot of criticism but seldom do you see any solutions or better options. It's all about getting people to be easily offended and (as you said) living in a state of constant tension... not wanting to offend anyone else about anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       PC is not (imo) political awareness, it's just another form of censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for offending people, a wise man once said "If someone unknowingly says something offensive, understand that they don't know any better. And if someone is
       <em>
        trying
       </em>
       to offend you, don't fall for it."

       Do a little research into cultural marxism and the origins of political correctness. Even if you choose to discount this as a conspiracy, you still might be willing to admit that PC equals censorship.

       That's a legitimate point. Your parents probably raised you with a set of values that would be considered pc a hundred years ago, is that thought police? Is it the thought police that's responsible for the average person in America recognizing that calling someone a nigger is unacceptable?

       Yes, this new morality is being forged as a the lynchpin for our cultural values.  It's somewhat reminiscent of the PC craze of the 90's and will be similarly used to define "what is profane" and what should be censored.
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems to me to be the moral focus of "New Atheism", which I've found to be a veiled term for secular judaism.  Whereas traditionally left leaning and social justice oriented people were concerned with how banking and big industry/government and the military use and abuse and marginalize people who don't have the means to defend themselves- this morality has been shifted by this very concentrated group speaking through loud megaphones and gathering troops who they have once again convinced are primary victims of cultural injustice.  Where have we heard this before?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I should be careful, because I think that historically, women and lgbt people HAVE been mistreated.  I personally don't even see how there is an argument about whether or not the gay people should have the same pair bonding rights as straight people, especially in an age of family planning.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that said, this appears to me to be a campaign to change how we communicate, how we think, and how we are allowed to criticize cultural groups.  Google is already censoring trend data on search terms that don't line up with this perspective- try searching "redpiller" keywords in the KP tool.  It's real.  I'd never even given a second though to this perspective until I knew people who were thrown out of university on provably false rape charges.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see why it is an attractive ideology for some, but once these people decide they are victims, they become rabid and illogical.  And now it's being fostered at a university level.  I have my theories, but I'd be interested in learning more about how and wear this philosophy is being inculcated and to what ends.

       Wasn't there DARPA involvement in that stuff with Gamergate? Like the studio that the chick worked for was funded by DARPA or something and then next thing she was giving all these speeches on feminism in the gamer community. It's one of the prongs they use to control the narrative online. It allows them to start bracket creep censorship.
