<p>Here is an <a href="http://national.suntimes.com/national-politics/7/72/1058212/decision-2016-whos-faking-social-media">article</a> that actually shows the percent fake <a href="/u/specktech">/u/specktech</a> provided in the comment section, way below a bunch of circlejerky comments by people who didn&#39;t bother clicking the link.</p>

<p>Browse /new, read stuff other than the comments, and this subreddit will look a lot less stupid. </p>

<p>If you include inactive (mostly fake) followers then is the article really that incorrect?</p>

<p>Most accounts at her level have a 1%-2% (bot/fake) following percentage. She has 15% and 41% inactive. That&#39;s actually INCREDIBLY high.</p>

<p>Of those 56% of her 3.xx million following. I can certainly see where they got the ~2 million faked estimation from.</p>

<p>It really isn&#39;t hard to clear &quot;Good&quot; parameters in their algorithm. The vast majority of Hillary&#39;s social media followers are junk.</p>

<p>re: I&#39;ve been using Twitter longer than just about anyone on the face of the earth.</p>

<p>edit: the math is rough but still they aren&#39;t really that far off at least 1.5 million of her followers are completely useless.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a stance either way - I avoid Twitter/Fb at all costs and only glommed on here because it was pseudoanonymous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is not how bought followers works, I have used those services, you buy 1000, you get them for about 2 weeks, but slowly they dwindle down to around 100. Twitter detects most fake accounts and shuts most down, a small percentage remains. So if that&#39;s how many are still active, she probably bought more than 2million </p>
