        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><em>&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods">Operation Northwoods</a> was a proposed operation against the Cuban government, that originated within the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) of the United States government in 1962. The proposals called for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or other US government operatives to commit acts of terrorism against American civilians and military targets, blaming it on the Cuban government, and using it to justify a war against Cuba. The proposals were rejected by the Kennedy administration. &quot;</em></p>

<p>Based on this, why is it that most American people feel insulted and find it so horrifyingly hard to believe that their own government might have been involved in 9/11, and yes, killing it&#39;s own population.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, yes, only you brave truthwarriorlords are brave and special enough to know the truth and carry the ragefire inside, right?</p>

<p>You know what the difference between a normal person and a conspiracy wingnut is?</p>

<p>Normal people figure out that government is inherently corrupt and must be held at arm&#39;s length when they&#39;re about fifteen fucking years old, and then they get over it and get on with their lives. </p>

<p>Conspiracy wingnuts figure this out a little bit later and then spend the next several decades congratulating themselves over and over and over for their searing insight and then use this one simple fact as the explanation for everything under the fucking sun.</p>

<p>You are not special or brave or smart for figuring out what every normal human being already knows and then using that one explanation for everything. </p>

<p>It was true, it is well documented, it was approved by all the joint chefs of staff, but rejected by a sane person, this being Kennedy, we know how this ended up for him, being assassinated by his own security services.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because even at the very height of the Cold War, Operations Northwoods, which was only a brainstorming document to begin with, was spiked <em>before</em> even getting to the planning stages. Interestingly, if you read <a href="http://www.smeggys.co.uk/operation_northwoods.php">the full document</a>, it also goes very much out of its way to avoid as far as possible, injury to US citizens. For instance, it suggests blowing up an <strong>unmanned</strong> vessel in Cuban waters, and switching out an airplane for a drone which is then remotely destroyed.</p>

<p>There is, basically, little or no indication it was any kind of &quot;bliueprint&quot; for 9/11, and that fact this keeps getting trotted out, more than 50 years later, shows how feeble the actual evidence for government involvement in 9/11 is. </p>
