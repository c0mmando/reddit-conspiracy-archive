    <div class="md"><p>Ok, you are right. You didn&#39;t state he wasn&#39;t a worthy candidate. I inferred that was your opinion from the general theme of your comments referring to &quot;14 year old redditors circle jerking, creaming their pants, etc for Sanders&quot;.  It&#39;s why I asked you some direct questions. I&#39;m trying to better understand your comments. After a quick scan of the link you provided me I can&#39;t understand this statement of yours...
&quot;Look at Sanders&#39; platform. The headings alone show how blind all of DC is to the real issues in the US.&quot;  To me, this reads as you disagree with his platform. I don&#39;t want to debate the issues with you. I just want to know if you think what is listed are important issues facing this country. 
I&#39;ve met Gary Johnson and have been fortunate to sit in on a few talks he&#39;s given at libertarian events I&#39;ve attended. He&#39;s cool. Some things I feel him on, others not so much. I honestly have never found a candidate my opinions align with 100%.
 DC is purposefully deaf, dumb, and blind to what real Americans are currently living through in this country. A very slim minority of the folks there have our best interests in mind. 
My question about your location relates back to the original post which you responded to. The post seemed to imply there is some sort of conspiracy related to support for Sanders. My thoughts are that maybe just maybe, to the rest of the country he seems like a dark horse. Here in New England he is more of a household name. The New England area maybe small in area, but in terms of population, we&#39;re a pretty huge chunk of people. A huge chunck of the American population that champion progressive ideas and more than likely have access to Reddit. Speaking just for myself, If Clinton gets the nomination I will be opting out of this election. So I guess my whole point was to try to lend some insight as to why Sanders might be receiving so much love on Reddit. That is all. Thanks for your time ☺️</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fully agree. I&#39;m very much in favor of tossing the 2 party system in the trash... And I don&#39;t want to sound like a total Bernie whore, but he usually runs on the independent ticket. It&#39;s just that some states only hold D &amp; R primaries (Massachusetts is one). During last year&#39;s midterms, the Independent candidate for governor here in Mass successfully landed 25% of the vote in the general election which helps qualify the party to become officially recognized in this state. It will take one more election cycle with numbers equal to or above 25% to make it law though. 
I wish voters had a None Of The Above box to check on ballets. I usually just write myself in to avoid being forced to vote for an asshole. </p>

<p>Hmm  - cut and paste from that page:</p>

<ul>
<li>INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY</li>
<li>GETTING BIG MONEY OUT OF POLITICS</li>
<li>CREATING DECENT PAYING JOBS</li>
<li>RACIAL JUSTICE</li>
<li>A LIVING WAGE</li>
<li>REAL FAMILY VALUES</li>
<li>CLIMATE CHANGE &amp; ENVIRONMENT</li>
<li>REFORMING WALL STREET</li>

<p>&quot;Real family values&quot; sounds a bit stupid - and there isn&#39;t anything anti-war there, which is a shame, but Bernie does have an enviable voting record on that.</p>

<p>That aside, all of these issues are huge.  What are you looking for?</p>

<p>Ending US imperialism is big - and a big gap.  Bringing taxes on the 1% back to where they were in Reagan&#39;s time is big - but that&#39;s covered by &quot;income and wealth inequality&quot;.  </p>
