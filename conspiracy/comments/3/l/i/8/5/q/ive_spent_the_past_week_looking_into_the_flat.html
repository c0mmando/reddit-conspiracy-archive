        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was spurred to look into flat earth theory when I saw people I respect taking it seriously.  These include <a href="http://deepinsidetherabbithole.com/">this site</a> and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> user u/shillyourself. Every conspiracy that I now know to be fact once seemed like complete insanity to me, so I don&#39;t use my immediate impression as a gauge of whether something merits investigation.  </p>

<p>The evidence I found most intriguing in the pro- Flat Earth Theory (FET) camp:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>lights and other objects being seen across vast distances at sea, when the curvature of the earth should be obscuring them.  I did the math myself, finding that there are definitely photos that should not be possible.  </p></li>
<li><p>The strangeness of airline flight routes in the southern hemisphere.  Looking at a globe, it&#39;s obvious that the shortest route between Buenos Aires and Sydney is straight over Antarctica.  But <strong>no</strong> flights go over Antarctica.  Not only that, very few, if any flights go across the south Pacific or south Atlantic.  Everything is funnelled through the northern hemisphere, just like you&#39;d expect on a flat earth with the north pole in the center.</p></li>
<li><p>photos of the earth from NASA that show drastically different sizes for the Northern hemisphere.  <a href="http://i.livescience.com/images/i/000/027/253/i02/blue-marble.jpg?1337197448">Here&#39;s one</a> where the USA looks huge, while in <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Earth_from_Space.jpg">this one</a> it&#39;s much smaller.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>However, there&#39;s one huge problem with FET and that&#39;s the fact of the setting sun.  In FET, the sun would always be in view, even if dimly and far away.  It circles the world, never setting.  </p>

<p>But we don&#39;t see the sun receding so far away that it sheds no significant light our way, we see a big blazing ball sink below the horizon, and our world goes dark.</p>

<p>This is an insoluble problem with FET.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, North, South, East and West are false concepts?</p>

<p>April 1st was a while back guys.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen your flat earth pancake theory with its total surround of  an incredibly massive Antarctica. </p>

<p>It shows that I can go east or west to get to Antarctica.  That&#39;s one  of many reasons why it&#39;s too flawed to consider.</p>

<p>Another reason is that it would make the journey AROUND the world many thousands of miles farther, south of the EQUATOR, than a trip around the world  would be in the  northernmost LATITUDES</p>

<p>This theory is too ridiculous for any reasonable human.</p>

<p>Edit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking this is a psyop to &#39;prove a point&#39; for these folks.</p>

<p>They can and probably will bring a gradually increasing number of votes in favor of this crap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This plays a part in it. Airlines like to fly with jet streams, not against them, for fuel considerations. And any trips across the poles will have half of the trip going against the wind. Going against the wind uses a lot more fuel. And lengthens the flight times. In the northern hemisphere running low on fuel isn&#39;t that big a deal because there is plenty of land,with airports, close enough to divert to if neccissary. Antarctica, on the other hand ,has very, if any,airports that an airliner could land on. There is also a lot of ocean to cross. Oceans don&#39;t have airports,either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take no issue with entertaining a thought. The claim that the planet is not as it is abundantly proven to be, for some obscure and ludicrous reason yet to be claimed, is just preposterous to me. That&#39;s the only issue I really take with this sub as a whole; that there have been so many &quot;official&quot; lies that some people have deluded themselves, much like an abused woman could be deluded into thinking that all men are violent. If not that, then possibly the &quot;forum sliding&quot; claim. Lying to justify wars or imperial conquest is realistic, albeit atrocious. Lying about the shape of the planet is just as dumb as it is implausible though.</p>

<p>Ok, entertain for a moment.  We don&#39;t have to guess whether or not this is a forum sliding game since it is &quot;implausible&quot;, which really just means &quot;far from my world view&quot;.  Instead we can consider the specifics of the topic.  It is not a topic where you have to trust the authenticity of documents or believe what a person is saying.  We are talking about the physical properties of the world around us.  We can experiment and make diagrams to see if our models fit experimental reality.  The spinning globe is a model, it is not reality by default.  Let&#39;s test the model to see if it fits with reality.</p>

<p>Step 1:  NASA is fraudulent.  Obviously if they were not, then there is plenty of evidence for the official model.  All the information we have about our cosmology is from official sources such as NASA and royal astronomical societies.  It is interesting to look into how much of the share of big telescopes the Jesuits own.  When we critically look at what NASA has produced starting with the moon landings we see a lot of problems.  Critically looking at the imagery of earth from space we find more problems.  When you spend enough time critically examining what you get from NASA there are just too many contradictions and things that do not make sense.  </p>

<p>Step 2:  There are experimental problems with the globe model such as Michelson-Morley, Airey&#39;s failure.  There are issues with orbital motion of the solar system based on &quot;gravity&quot;.  The distance you can see over water is too far, requiring light to refract through the atmosphere by an amount very close to the exact supposed curvature of the globe.</p>

<p>I am not promoting any specific alternate model.  Just saying that there are some interesting questions and it is not above consideration.  Not understanding motivation, &quot;why would they do this?&quot; is secondary to physical evidence.   Just because you cannot comprehend the motivation for something is not a reason to ignore all arguments.</p>
