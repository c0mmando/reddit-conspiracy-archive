        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For years, various disinformation agents have been attempting to sabotage the 9/11 truth movement with claims that &quot;mini-nukes&quot; or &quot;nuclear devices&quot; were used to demolish the World Trade Center. The fact that the Twin Towers and WTC7 (Building 7) were destroyed in a series of controlled demolitions is not in doubt; more than 1,400 architectural and engineering professionals have called for a new, truly independent investigation and cited evidence of controlled demolitions at all three collapsed WTC steel-framed high-rises. A plethora of evidence for controlled demolitions includes numerous reports of molten steel and molten metal found in the debris pile - some of which was analyzed and found to be abundant in iron -  iron-rich spherules indicating a previously molten state that were found in the WTC dust (including a sample collected ten minutes after collapse of the North Tower, eliminating the possibility of contamination from the clean up), an orange-yellow flow of molten material from the South Tower caught on video in the minutes preceding collapse indicative of an iron-rich melt and totally at odds with the &quot;office fires&quot; scenario, heavily sulfidated steel and partly evaporated steel members from WTC7 that were fireproofed with Monokote MK-5 which (according to NIST-sponsored tests on thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity at Anter Laboratories) outperforms the Cafco Blaze-Shield types DC/F and II used in the Towers.</p>

<p>Pre-2001 studies found that the WTC Towers would survive a 600 mph impact from a jetliner, and predicted that the buildings would remain standing even if all of the jet fuel had been dumped inside and ignited a horrendous fire that killed many people. Apart from the three World Trade Center buildings on 9/11/2001, there have never been any instances of steel-framed high-rises that totally collapsed as a result of fire. It just doesn&#39;t happen. And everyone agrees that the structural damage - much exaggerated in the case of Building 7 that was not even hit by a plane - was insufficient to bring down the buildings. In subsequent tests sponsored by NIST on corresponding floor assemblies subjected to greater heat exposure and protected with less fireproofing than at the WTC on 9/11, it was found that the test specimens &quot;were able to sustain the maximum design load&quot; without collapsing for as long as the tests were run: 2 to 3 1/2 hours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, thank for you this. We have a particular user that has spammed this particular bullshit dozens of times over the last few days.</p>

<p>They used to use Judith Wood&#39;s &quot;Space Beams&quot; nonsense, but that was just too silly, so they moved on to Dimitri Khalezov &quot;mini-nuke&quot; nonsense.</p>

<p>Notice that the real truth group, AE911Truth, has thousands of people endorsing their work.</p>

<p>Judith Woods and Dimitri Khalezov have no actual scientists, architects, engineers, or anyone other than internet trolls willing to endorse their bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh hey the AE911Truth DISCREDIT BOTS came out to play, running their collaborative disinformation campaign!</p>

<p>(FYI, AE911Truth is limited hangout -- its mission is to keep people from discovering that nuclear demolition devices were used on 9/11)</p>

<p>Briefly:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Nano-thermite alone cannot explain the lack of rubble and total pulverization of steel, office furniture, bathroom fixtures, and human bodies. The buildings turned to dust -- not piles of rubble, but <em>dust</em> 100 microns in size. How did the nanothermite completely reduce the buildings to microscopic dust? Only a nuclear device is capable of that.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/Lec9giab90I?t=2h27m37s">You can clearly see the nuclear detonation points in satellite imagery</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>For those having trouble visualizing an underground nuke, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSjratvNGmo">here&#39;s an excellent video example</a>. First, notice the detonation causing a ground-based blast wave -- i.e., earthquake. Then about 10 seconds later, the ground collapses. Imagine one of these under each WTC building. </p></li>
<li><p>With that test footage in mind, watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrPpkuw8qro">WTC ground shaking at detonation</a> roughly 10 seconds <em>before</em> collapse.</p></li>
<li><p>Many eyewitness testimonies of ground shaking: <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/oralhistories/shaking.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/oralhistories/shaking.html</a></p></li>
<li><p>And this video is really the smoking gun, IMO: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMBlkYvCGuw">9/11 Underground Nuclear Demolition Earthquake/Rumble Witness Testimonies</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here&#39;s an article explaining the demolition, originally in the German magazine <em>NEXUS</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.911thology.com/nexus1.html">Ground Zero – Nuclear Demolition of the World Trade Center</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And here&#39;s a brief video that explains everything:</p>

<p>This is, of course, completely false.</p>

<p>Even if it were true - which it is NOT - it isn&#39;t evidence of anything nuclear at all.</p>

<p>If you go through everything LetsHackReality is posting, you will find this same pattern - simply a lot of words, no evidence of any kind, and full of logical fallacies.</p>

<p>I suspect that LetsHackReality hasn&#39;t even read the &quot;1000 pages&quot; of this crap himself - notice that he CANNOT actually quote the meaningful parts, quite the actual evidence, show the work, or even point to anyone actually endorsing all this bullshit.</p>

<p>Yep, because you are the one SPAMMING this crap 20+ times over the last few days, and you STILL can&#39;t even answer basic questions about it.</p>

<p>watch Dr. Judy Woods presentation.</p>

<p>every time she says &quot;dustification&quot; or &quot;directed energy beam&quot;, ask yourself...</p>

<p>&quot;could a nuclear demolition device accomplish the same thing?&quot;</p>

<p>the answer is always &quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<p>Thanks again for giving me yet another opportunity to present a few details regarding the nuclear detonation.</p>

<p>If anybody would like to research more about the nuclear detonation of WTC1, 2, and 7 on 9/11, there&#39;s an excellent new documentary on this, &quot;Thermite Hoax - 9/11 WTC an Act of Nuclear War&quot; (uploaded Sep 11, 2015): </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/c9rbdVWLmac">Part One</a> (nuclear detonation explanation)</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/b9-YU8fgJNU">Part Two</a> (radiation-based cancer among WTC recovery workers)</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/gClwoSA5ZKo">Part Three</a> (whodunnit)</li>
</ul>

<p>Or for more focus on the technical aspects of nuclear detonation, this one is fantastic:</p>

<p>Page number, and copy and paste the text here.</p>

<p>We&#39;re looking for EVIDENCE - so, name the person who took the samples and found evidence. Name the person who took a Geiger counter down to Ground Zero on 9/11 and took measurements.</p>

<p>You know, EVIDENCE - do you have any?</p>

<p>Are you really arguing the buildings were not reduced to 100 micron thick dust?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great links!</p>

<p>You will notice that that website, and that analysis, is associated with AE911Truth - the people you are attacking - and NONE of that research has anything to do with Dimitri Khalezov and doesn&#39;t purport any &quot;nuclear demolition.&quot;</p>

<p>So, as we can see, when pressed for actual EVIDENCE LetsHackReality doesn&#39;t link to Dimitri Khalezov, or anything to do with &quot;nuclear demolition&quot; - he is forced to actually go to the real research done by people associated with AE911Truth - NOT Dimitri Khalezov.</p>

<p>So, the question is, why is LetsHackReality still SPAMMING Dimitri Khalezov crap?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok for the umpteenth time - where is the evidence for &quot;nuclear demolition?&quot;</p>

<p>No spamming. No youtube videos about Katy Perry.</p>

<p>We want to see some EVIDENCE - show us the measurements of nuclear fallout, show us the Geiger counter measurements taken the day of 9/11 - names, dates, and locations please ...</p>

<p>... but we know damn well you won&#39;t post any evidence because you don&#39;t HAVE any evidence.</p>

<p>Your lies are wearing thin and I&#39;m sure people are tired of your SPAM.</p>

<p>LetsHackReality can&#39;t actually show any evidence of a &quot;nuclear demolition&quot; and he hasn&#39;t even READ his own 1,000 pages of bullshit he&#39;s SPAMMING here.</p>

<p>So he resorts to trolling and memes.</p>

<p>Pathetic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently it&#39;s very important.
