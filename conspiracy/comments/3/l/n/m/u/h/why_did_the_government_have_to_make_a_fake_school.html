    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a tough question, but here&#39;s my $0.02.
I reckon that actually killing people as they did at Port Arthur and 9/11 proved far too difficult to control both the scenes, and the narratives of the victims. Also, by faking the killings it&#39;s easier to get people that know what happened to go along, because no-one actually died (a ton of money never hurts too though). Then after the fact they have these nice prepared actors playing the &quot;victims&quot; who are properly trained to deliver the narrative.
Just my thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But with real shootings you don&#39;t need to get anybody to go along with anything.  You have an actual crime scene that can be investigated and no loose ends.

There is no way to control that many people for the rest of their lives and hope none of them get a conscience and talk.

<p>You have an actual crime scene that can be investigated</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A real investigation could expose the plot by means of the plotters being linked back to the shooter.</p>

<p>A real shooting involves real ammunition and weapons, which can be traced back to their original point of sales.</p>

<p>A real investigation would blow the whole operation, which is why they do not engage in a real shooting, they stage a shooting so that they can control every single aspect of the event.</p>

<p>THAT is how you ensure no loose ends.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You don&#39;t need to worry about one of the hundreds of people involved in the hoax making an anonymous internet post explaining what they did and how they did it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They never do, because the NSA tracks these people involved in these incidents more closely than other citizens who are not important.</p>

<p>Any attempts to spill the beans would be insane as for starts, most of these people involved were paid off handsomely, secondly, the worst thing they did in their minds is lie because nobody died in the hoax shooting, so their conscious is not going to eat them up because nobody actually died and their lie is for the &quot;greater good&quot;, and if they did attempt to spill the beans they would be killed very quickly.</p>

<p>It is 2015, there is no &quot;anonymous&quot; internet posting. Try logging on to Tor and going through all your BS proxy nonsense, if you start off connected to the internet, they know when you switch over as they are already tracking you, so they know who you are on Tor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no way to control that many people for the rest of their lives and hope none of them get a conscience and talk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stop lying, it&#39;s called the NSA and CIA, no human needs to track you as they have computer ran algorithms autonomously engaging in that tracking indefinitely in a manner that allows &quot;their people&quot;, real physical humans, to move in after having received the right information alerting the system to the possibility of a leak.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only way to ensure that nobody speaks is to..well.. kill them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, and that is ALWAYS their go to last resort. Nothing else is stopping this human? Kill them, problem solved. People getting suspicious looking into their death? Kill them too, scare off any more people who may be suspicious about these deaths.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and that would sort of defeat the purpose of using actors in the first place. </p>

<p>No, it does not, I do not think you understand how bribery and blackmail works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do understand how bribery and blackmail works.. and a lot of the time it doesn&#39;t... that is why we hear of people attempting to bribe and blackmail people... if it worked all the time we&#39;d never even know it ever happened.  If somebody from the government comes up to you and says &quot;hey.. you are going to be a part of a giant hoax where we pretend to kill your daughter and for the rest of your life you have to pretend your daughter is dead.. now.. for this to work we&#39;re also going to need to take your daughter away and keep her hidden for a while until she is old enough that her appearance is changed and then she will have her identity changed and she can never be seen around you again because, well, that would spoil the story so say goodbye to her now but here is a bunch of money!&quot; nobody is going to take that deal.  Now try to run that deal 20 different times and everybody who is friends of the families also needs to either be paid off or fooled so now you have parents who have to fake mourn around their friends and family for the rest of their lives without anyone ever seeing the kids who were killed ever again.  And, bear in mind, these are just normal citizens who had normal lives up until Sandy Hook.  So they suddenly get talked into this plot by the government and now they are instantly hardened operatives who are willing to detach themselves from their previous lives and never see their kids again for the sake of a hoax that didn&#39;t even manage to get one federal gun law passed.... Yeah.. I think it is much easier to just shoot up a building... OR, easiest of all... just wait for a real shooting to happen and then use the media to sensationalize it.  11,000 gun homicides a year in America.. there is no need to fake an event.. just wait for a real one.  </p>

<p>Or, you get a single person to pretend it&#39;s their daughter. </p>

<p>The one thing that really gets me is the first 30 seconds of this video. There is no way this man had a son/daughter killed the day before. Look at that smile. You wouldn&#39;t be able to smile like that surely? In fact just look at him altogether. He hasn&#39;t had a night of no sleep and crying in fact he&#39;s very fresh faced, until he turns the waterworks on...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a friend die in a streetbike accident a few years ago.  At his funeral his mother was switching between crying and laughing and praying and cursing God and every other emotion possible.  At certain moments if you saw her you&#39;d never believe her son just died because she was acting like she was at a party.  At other moments you&#39;d swear she was gonna collapse to the ground and never get up.  Her husband, who just lost his son, was totally stoic at the wake and funeral.  He was shaking hands and comforting his wife and acting like he acted every other time I&#39;ve been around him.  However, when I went over to their house a few days later to visit their other son who I am also friends with the father was a crying mess.  You can&#39;t predict how people are going to act when they lose a child.  People grieve in strange ways and some people never grieve on public.</p>

<p>All the people who lost kids at the shooting have lives and histories in sandy hook.  They really have kids.  It is all verifiable.  They didn&#39;t get single people and pretend they had kids.  There&#39;s no way getting around the idea that they&#39;d have to convince these families to legitimately give up their children for this hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand people react differently. Your talking about a funeral though which is often a week or two after the person has passed. I laughed at my mums funeral 3 years ago. She died young and suddenly. I know for a fact I couldn&#39;t laugh like he does 24 hrs after my mum had died. Certainly not if she had been shot and murdered. </p>

<p>His eyes are not bloodshot, which you would expect from having no sleep and being very upset and just the whole turning the tears on makes me very uncomfortable watching that. </p>

<p>I&#39;m on the fence with this tbh but </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A funeral is 3-4 days after a person dies.. Not weeks.  And you can google all the families and verify their histories.  They have friends and families.  My aunt went to college with one of the women who lost a kid at sandy hook and was good friends with her.  They still talk.  My aunt isn&#39;t in on the hoax and she knows the woman had a kid and now that kid is dead.  By your version that kid is fake dead which means she has to stay hidden the rest of her life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t just Google... these people who had family members die are still alive and around... you, yourself, can get into a car and go meet them.  If you don&#39;t feel like you can trust the media or the information provided on google you can investigate this stuff yourself.  Nobody does that.  Everyone just makes youtube videos and says &quot;look at this guy... he doesn&#39;t seem very sad.&quot;  or &quot;look at this coroner... he seems kinda weird doesn&#39;t he?&quot;  And as far as funerals... yes... they are typically within 3-4 days... certainly inside of 1 week.  I&#39;ve never been at a funeral where the person is dead for more than 4 days before the funeral.  You might have a service where the body is already cremated first and then you push the service date back if family is out of the area or something and can&#39;t make it but you certainly don&#39;t have a funeral 3 weeks after a death.  Embalming doesn&#39;t maintain the body for long enough to wait 3 weeks... You always want to try to have the funeral inside of a week unless you are going to cremate before the funeral.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your comment says a week or 2...I thought it said 3 weeks.. assuming you didn&#39;t edit it I must have been mistaken.. at any rate it&#39;s certainly not 2 weeks either.</p>

<p>And no.. I don&#39;t know it&#39;s bullshit that a guy was grinning so his daughter wasn&#39;t killed.  I know at least 1 kid was killed so I think it&#39;s very likely they all were.  Why would you only really kill one kid?  The actor thing makes no sense.  Any of the people who thinks it&#39;s a hoax can go investigate for themselves.. they never do.  They watch youtube videos and say &quot;it&#39;s a hoax&quot; and that&#39;s it.  They aren&#39;t interested in the truth.  They are interested in finding a conspiracy whether there is one or not.    </p>

<p>Well it does not seem to be working, which is why the &quot;crisis actors&quot; theory seems to make sense, as if normal events do not work, they must engage in events which will work, which obviously requires a harder emotional impact.</p>

<p>This is why people question the Virginia news reporter shooting.</p>

<p>He recorded the shooting from his phone as he did it and did it on live tv, because that is more shocking than anything we have seen yet.</p>

<p>That is another reason why people are suspicious of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should have been more clear:  none of the presidential candidates made this into a part of their campaign.  They were asked about it so they addressed if but none of them threw in a new policy plan because of it.  If this was staged why the fuck didn&#39;t a politician run with it?  Staged for what?  All these events get called &quot;staged for gun control&quot; and then when no federal laws are passed nobody seems to wonder why...  If the government had a nefarious plan to take our guns they would broadcast shootings all day every day.  We have 11,000 gun homicides a year.  That&#39;s 30 a day.. They could broadcast Shooting deaths around the clock and fake a few polls and have laws passed in no time.  They don&#39;t do this because they don&#39;t want to do it.  They use gun control as a fundraising point in elections.  Both parties do this.  That&#39;s the only &quot;conspiracy&quot; here.  Gun manufacturers, the NRA and both parties conspire to make money off Americans by talking about &quot;gun legislation&quot; that will never be passed.  If people don&#39;t realize this after Sandy Hook when 90% of the population wanted a fed background check law passed and congress still didn&#39;t pass it because they are bought then I dunno what to tell ya.</p>

<p>but none of them threw in a new policy plan because of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Waste of time and goes against what their party stands for on the republican side, and democrats already have and still are pressing for more gun laws, though they have been slowing down as the people are against them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If this was staged why the fuck didn&#39;t a politician run with it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because if they always have specific politicians try and enact legislation after bad events, then people become suspicious.</p>

<p>This is why a better method would be to create a whole bunch of gun violence victims to form a coalition so that it is grass roots and based on real events, so it is tangible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Staged for what?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shock value. Normal shootings are non-concerns to people because they happen for understandable reasons.</p>

<p>They are attempting to create the fear of random prowling gun violence that could strike you at any moment at any place in the public, that would be the point of faking shocking events that are not common place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the government had a nefarious plan to take our guns they would broadcast shootings all day every day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a fallacy, because it is proven that that one method alone does not work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have 11,000 gun homicides a year. That&#39;s 30 a day.. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup, that is a lot of people that need help, guns are not the problem and we should not be stupid and be reactionary and think that guns are the problem, because they are not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They could broadcast Shooting deaths around the clock and fake a few polls and have laws passed in no time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clearly they can not, so that is just a lie. Seriously, if all they did was broadcast gun deaths 24/7 it would be way too obvious they are clearly pushing an agenda to restrict gun rights. What you are saying is just straight up unrealistic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They use gun control as a fundraising point in elections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nM0asnCXD0">Not even</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s the only &quot;conspiracy&quot; here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it is not, you are a misleading disinformation slinging informational gatekeeper looking to steer people away from the truth of reality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gun manufacturers, the NRA and both parties conspire to make money off Americans by talking about &quot;gun legislation&quot; that will never be passed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clearly you do not live in a state such as New York or Illinois, or you would know what insane gun legislation exists and how not everything is a conspiracy to make money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If people don&#39;t realize this after Sandy Hook when 90% of the population wanted a fed background check law passed and congress still didn&#39;t pass it</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics">We already have Federal background check laws</a>, so congress has nothing to do with this unless people suggest amendments to existing legislation which makes sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I dunno what to tell ya.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You do not know what to tell anybody because you do not know much of anything.</p>

<p>You present an argument that pushes the idea that there is no fed background check law when there already is.</p>

<p>Try harder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m talking about the Federal Universal background check law with a mental health check requirement that was introduced after Sandy Hook and then killed even with majority support in the public.  If there was a government plan to take our guns why wouldn&#39;t they pass that bill thru Congress when they had majority support?  Could it be that the members of Congress who would be responsible for passing such a bill were also paid money by the NRA to NOT pass the bill?  It&#39;s amazing how everyone thinks that government is completely run by a &quot;shadow elite&quot; but they can&#39;t manage to pass a fuckin bill with 90% public support.  It&#39;s almost as if they never really wanted to pass that bill to begin with... it&#39;s almost as if they just want to talk about gun control so they can fundraise and then the members of congress will just continue to do what the NRA (who pays them) tells them to do.. just like they do with the pharmacy lobby and Monsanto.  As long as the NRA is donating to their campaigns no federal legislation gets passed.  </p>

<p>And clearly you don&#39;t understand the difference between state and federal laws if you are telling me living in New York has anything to do with a federal law being passed.  If you think the government is hoaxing mass shooting events so that a couple of states can make it hard to own large amounts of ammo you are nuts.  Go hop in your car and go to Sandy Hook or Virginia and talk to some of the people close to these events... see how much truth you really want to find... everyone loves watching &quot;100% proof of crisis actors!!111!&quot; videos but nobody wants to actually talk to the people involved and really see if their stupid fantasies hold any validity.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eric Holder was ultimately responsible for Sandy Hook psy-op. He funneled an awful lot of cash to the actors, er um &quot;victims&quot; as in a similar way, $29 million was funneled to the Charleston psy-op. </p>

<p>They thought they could pull it off but failed miserably. The Boston Marathon psy-op was a big fail as well. The amount of money paid to these traitors is outrageous. I hope to see Robbie Parker on the street one day. Even Jeff Bauman. That would be real fun. </p>

<p>These motherfuckers have sold their souls. Criminal elements have taken over the US government. Evil is spreading like never before. The psy-ops are coming regularly now. The Virginia news shooting. All the freeway shootings. Maybe as zeropoint mentions, its easier to control the scene and the narrative by faking it, but they have been doing a terrible job.</p>

<p>I would think my tax money should provide much better-executed psy-ops.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again. Events like this simply are not staged. The risk of ONE loose end coming clean to the public would blow the whole thing wife open. A cell phone recording, a witness, a fake victim being found or coming out of hiding.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just simply not worth it. If our government wants to kill a school full of kids to push an agenda they will do it. That simple.</p>

<p>And here&#39;s where it gets ugly on this sub... Frankly, I believe the government is complicit in some way on 9/11, JFK and RFK, disclosure, etc. I am a true believer in a lot of &quot;conspiracies&quot; but this crisis actor biz and those who insist on it look to me like the real shills. It muddies the water, throws us off the trails, divides us and gives those of us looking for truth and thinking outside the narrative a bad look. On par with Elvis sightings. Not everything is a conspiracy. The world is an unpredictable and ugly place sometimes. </p>

I understand most of this, but sometimes I can&#39;t help but to just laugh. The thing about social engineering is, if they were staging anything, it would look real as fuck and there would be minimal loose ends, because if somebody is pulling the strings you can bet they don&#39;t want us to see them. They don&#39;t have to actually get their hands dirty, that&#39;s what they&#39;re manipulating us for.

    <div class="md"><p>A funeral is 3-4 days after a person dies.. Not weeks.  And you can google all the families and verify their histories.  They have friends and families.  My aunt went to college with one of the women who lost a kid at sandy hook and was good friends with her.  They still talk.  My aunt isn&#39;t in on the hoax and she knows the woman had a kid and now that kid is dead.  By your version that kid is fake dead which means she has to stay hidden the rest of her life.</p>
