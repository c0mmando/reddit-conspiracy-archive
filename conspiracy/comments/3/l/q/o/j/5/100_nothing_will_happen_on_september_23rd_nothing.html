<p>Please ignore the fear mongering. I originally thought something might happen but I realized nothing needs to happen. We&#39;re already afraid and they are in control. Don&#39;t let  them control you.</p>

<p><strong>September 23rd will be uneventful and safe. I know it will be because of it is not, we will be there, front row, en masse, to make sure MSM can&#39;t cover it up like 911. Why commit a flase flag to drum up fear when you need only convince your enemy you will attack, perpetual tenseness. Nothing will happen because if it does we&#39;ll be there to expose it. Nothing will happen on September 23rd because you are protected by  the truth, I promise you this.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like, say, there was an economic collapse on nibiru, so aliens had to perform a pretend invasion on earth, but they got too close to our atmosphere so instead they just look to us like a meteor shower... While nibiru follows behind. Then the aliens and nibiru all crash into earth and is on earth realize the aliens and nibiru were just a bunch of water molecules. But there were so many it causes a great flood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would disagree that it&#39;s a psyop. I do think those have occurred (check out the documentary <em>Mirage Men</em>, for example), but I think true, organized psyops are probable more rare than people imagine.</p>

<p>I see the September 23rd thing as more of a widespread cultural phenomenon, disseminated via the Internet by well-meaning individuals. I&#39;m not sure where it started, or when it began. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was some obscure forum, or perhaps somewhere a bit more well-known like AboveTopSecret.</p>

<p>That&#39;s kind of the weird thing about this, though: I don&#39;t remember hearing about it until earlier this year. Y2K was talked about years in advance. In fact, it was a serious threat, and part of the reason it <em>didn&#39;t</em> happen were legions of programmers and engineers who worked during the 1990s to prevent it. As for 2012, I vividly remember seeing sensationalized TV programs about the prediction, back in the early to mid-2000s.</p>

<p>September 23rd does seem to have come out of nowhere. I mean, where did it originate? 2012 stems from a fairly well-known, if perhaps misunderstood, cultural tradition in ancient Mesoamerica. Y2K was a well-known possibility stemming from technology. Both were publicized in the mainstream media, and everyone knew about them. The 9-23 thing seems restricted more to people online who have some degree of interest in conspiracies, paranormal discussions, and things to that effect. As such, I think it arose on the Internet and spread memetically, gradually catching on in forums like this one.</p>

<p>I would love to know where the September 23rd thing started, though. It must have originated somewhere. Perhaps it was a detailed post on a forum somewhere?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can someone fill me in on what exactly is predicted to happen on September 23rd? I&#39;ve heard so many disparate things. I&#39;ve heard predictions that verge on plausible, like some sort of financial collapse, natural disaster, or terrorist attack. I&#39;ve head numerous &quot;fringe&quot; ideas as well, about things like alien invasions and some kind of purported connection to numerology and Judaic lore.</p>

<p>This has happened so many times. First it was Y2K, then it was 2012. People make so many predictions about cataclysmic or world-altering events; and yet, not one person predicted the September 11th attacks. I just can&#39;t really take doomsday predictions seriously. Besides, apart from acute mass extinction events like the K-T asteroid impact, it seems quite rare that &quot;apocalpytic&quot; scenarios happen overnight. Even the singularly devastating end-Permian extinction unfolded over tens of thousands of years.</p>

<p>Short of a nuclear winter or an asteroid impact, I don&#39;t think anyone can say that &quot;this day, the world (as we know it) will end.&quot; The ends of things seem more likely to come about as a result of gradual unraveling over a period of time. Rome wasn&#39;t built in a day, but it didn&#39;t exactly fall in a day either. One things lead to another, and things fall apart over time. Will our civilization fall apart? Perhaps. But unless there&#39;s a natural or nuclear event that renders the Earth borderline uninhabitable-- think &quot;Book of Eli&quot; or &quot;Mad Max&quot;-- it won&#39;t be a matter of one single day. Instead, it will end in ice.</p>
