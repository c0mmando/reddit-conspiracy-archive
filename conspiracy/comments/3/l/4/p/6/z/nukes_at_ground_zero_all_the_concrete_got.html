       I'm most concerned with the fact that people who are promoting this theory are also attacking AE911 Truth. I'm sure everyone who has been here more than a month has seen the fantastic research and watched the interviews they have produced. They are also one of the few groups that has managed to get major billboards up.

       AE911 Truth rarely attacks other theorists, but the proponents of other theories attack AE911 truth relentlessly.

       There shouldn't be teams. I started hearing about the nuke theory from groups of people who attack AE911. Hear all sides, sure... but the evidence is not strong for a nuke. It simply doesn't explain the mechanics of the collapse.

       If you can give me some specific link explaining the columns of concrete intact at the base sections of the tower, I'll look at it. A four hour video... I'm not going to do that again. I've already sat through a lot of Dimitri over the months.

       No you haven't. If you did, you'd understand the mechanics of the theory. An underground nuclear explosion does not look/act like an atmospheric explosion. There is no compression wave visible. Maybe on a flat plane, but not with a building over it.

       So, you admit, you do not want to here other sides. Got it, that's all I need to hear. I watched the 4 hour video, the 2 hour A&amp;E for 9/11 and others. Hearing all sides. To each their own. You can be lazy (it's a special kind of lazy, to not watch a video), that is

       I'm not going to watch another 4 hour video on this theory. I think that was a lot of energy to entertain this idea... but I've got a good 120 hours into this one.

      <p>
       It looks like a controlled demolition. You put the collapses next to 50 controlled demolitions and it is rare to find one that looks significantly different. There is no video record of this hypothetical situation ever happening... just drawings and claims of pulverized dust that fly in the face of the thousands of tons of Basketball to marble sized chunks of concrete which are everywhere.

       I don't think they could have convincingly sold the story of fire initiated collapse on the towers unless they destroyed the building from the collapse down.
      </p>
      <p>
       A traditional demolition favors taking out the base and crushing the building under the maximum mass. They had to detonate it as it collapsed to be convincing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The look and feel they were going for kind of takes a nuke out of the equation. A nuke would have destroyed the base first... like most demolitions look.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was really considering this and the "No Planes" theory. Both have an air of plausibility about them. I'm just concerned with the fact that they Nuke Camp is outright attacking AE911.
      </p>
      <p>
       2300 Architects and engineers are onboard for AE911 truth.
How many physicists... support this? Not even nuclear... just plain old physicists.

       Your first image only shows one fragment of a wall, clearly doesn't show the base or the

       to that base.

       Allowing alternate theories of the 9/11 destruction model has been taboo in here. IMHO, quashed. Even as I attempt to respect all parties in this

       AE911 Truth is focused specifically on opening a new investigation. AE911 Truth is not focused on proving that nukes weren't used, or berating Judy Woods. They are focused on what you are focused on... a new investigation and justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nuke people are focusing on the mechanics of the collapse in order to draw us back about 10 years in time.

       That was exactly my position until a week ago. Until I stumbled on some new info.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does matter that nukes were used. It matters that thousands of WTC workers could have been prevented from getting cancer. It matters that nukes are used pretty commonly for false-flags. (OK City, for one) And it matters that at least 20 more are still in play.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a massive cover-up here. Bigger than just 9/11 being an inside job. There may be even more to it that we haven't uncovered yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       But YES we also need to move forward to prosecutions. We don't need another official investigation. We don't need to beg our masters to investigate and prosecute themselves. We need to find another way.

       Good link. He banned him from his site. You saw how he didn't disparage Judy woods or the guy during any of that. He even offered to go have a beer with the guy to talk about it. He let the speaker have five minutes and ask a number of questions when he said, sixty seconds at the beginning, and he talked to him again after the presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       He banned him from a private forum. That's quite a different thing from attacking other theorists.
