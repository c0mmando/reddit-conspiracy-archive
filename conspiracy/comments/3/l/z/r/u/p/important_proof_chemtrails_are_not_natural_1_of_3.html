       IMPORTANT PROOF CHEMTRAILS ARE NOT NATURAL (1 of 3): This is the first of three pictures I took in quick succession of this event. I was walking along and watching as one chemtrail plane was going through the sky with its 'trail' of poison intact. Then I watched and was so amazed by what I saw, I stopped walking, and watched as the plane's trail stopped for a very short moment but then --- it started/continued again!!! This is not natural! If it was wind, it would have been a larger gap. I riffled in my bag for my phone to capture this. When I took this and two other pictures, the plane had continued on with its trail, but as you can see here it left a small gap in it's sky-path from when it (for some reason) stopped and restarted the purposeful poison-trail in the sky. I witnessed this while walking home and taking pictures of many other parallel ongoing chemtrails above my town. Maybe the pilot saw me taking pictures of the other chemtrails in the sky and wanted to send me a message. I think this is very important and proves that these trails in the sky are not naturally occurring from planes interaction with the sky and surrounding clouds, but a purposeful dump of (who knows exactly what) toxins in the sky by these pilots not on commercial flights but intentional missions to do this. (the only editing I have done here it to show the zoom-in and circle the gaps, links are of the other two pics that I also posted to MY minds.com account)

       You realise that plane was about 10 miles away from you, right? Do you really think the pilot shut of the chemicals because he saw you watching him? That's truly hilarious.

       Obvious: the pilot was one of them there grey aliens (you know, the ones w/ the big eyes).  They can see 100000X better than humans. They work with the government and are in on the whole chem trails/FEMA/Freemason/9-11/bigfoot thing.  Don't you follow this /r ?

Perhaps they are geoengineering for some sort of good, but it is seemingly affecting peoples' health and is very concerning to others, including myself as I have chronic health problems that have only gotten worse as the years go on (I'm only 26).

       No it's not "Informative and well researched". It's a polarised one-perspective view of a controversy. Unless you are willing to give equal time to seeing the other side - which says that contrails are easily explained by physics and meteorology - then you have learned nothing.

       Unlike most conspiracy theories, this one is actually backed by scientific data so the only people who would make comments like this are people too stupid to understand scientific data. It's even simpler than that. CONtrails are created when the temperature of the air is cold. Like when you go outside on a cold day and you can see your breath hanging in the air. Have you ever gone for a walk on a cold day and looked back over your shoulder and noticed a contrail following you? No? That's because CONtrails dissipate in a matter of minutes. CHEMtrails are designed to hang around in the air for as long as possible. Their contents include heavy metals like aluminum, barium and strontium. These metals eventually fall back to the earth where scientific analysis can detect them. Rainwater should contain 0% aluminum yet tests on rainwater after spraying has found high levels of these metals in the water. The snowpack on Mt. Shasta contains more aluminum than the soil beneath it. That's not natural. How do you suppose that aluminum got there? Hikers pitched their empty beer cans in the snow where they dissolved?

       </em>
       , and you can't understand why anyone would want to disagree with such an avalanche of proof that 'They' are messing with the weather by filling the skies with chemtrails.
