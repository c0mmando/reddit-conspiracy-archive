    <div class="md"><p>This is the truth, and now the jade software knows where every device is and can strategically send bodies to these areas. America&#39;s army is the smallest it&#39;s ever been and loads of soldiers are spread out all over the world leaving our homeland vulnerable. They probably just connected satellite systems and ran private fiber cables that only they can access. Unhackable jade software for a planned world war that will have fighting on American soil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually saw a lot of transports earlier this spring/summer heading west with military vehicles. It was the first one that i saw heading east so far. It was an 8 wheeler i forget what they are called. They are made in Canada and Harper wants to sell them to Saudi Araibia. Its possible the transport i saw was delivering the vehicle east to be shipped overseas. But it also could be headed back to the military base outside of Ottawa-east of here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing that interests me is that Sandra Bland was killed in Texas. The command center for JH. Part of the exercise criteria was that there was to be uniformed and undercover personal involved and anything that happened they would pretend is 100% real. Soo, what if Sandra Bland&#39;s death was a way of testing out how the public would react to situations like such where it is likely large amounts of people would be agitated.

    <div class="md"><p>It was a troop saturation exercise.</p>

<p>Military science backs up the need to have a minimum soldier-to-civilian ratio during low-intensity conflicts, riots, and general peace keeping operations.</p>

<p>As other commenters stated, SNAP benefits were temporarily shut down.</p>

<p>What is not being discussed, is that should the government shutdown, SNAP payments will be immediately halted starting October 1st until a budget is decided on.</p>

<p>That is ~45 million Americans who wont be able to buy groceries.</p>

<p>Does that sound like it has the possibility of turning into a low intensity conflict?</p>

I think this is what they want us to think. Bring in all the equipment because people are expecting them to because, well, its what they will need for an exercise. The two months have now passed and its all over. The skeptics are all laughing in their pantaloons and now we are all back to our normal lives....but wait...All they did was bring in the Trojan horse. All the equipment is now in place....they will strike when we least expect it. </p>

<p>Was there any evidence of explosive residue? No.</p>

<p>Any structure weakening or explosive force concentrating blankets? No.</p>

<p>Was their any seismic activity that would indicate cutter charges going off?  No.</p>

<p>Was the site investigated by the foremost expert in explosive demolitions?  Yes.</p>

<p>Did they find anything? Not one bit. </p>
