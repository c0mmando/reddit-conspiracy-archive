       You can’t make this stuff up.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A young Jewish American man has been charged with pretending to be an Australian-based Islamic State jihadist after a FBI joint investigation with the Australian Federal Police based on information provided by Fairfax Media.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Wait, there’s more! He was also a “neo-Nazi White Supremacist” and even published at The Daily Stormer.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You may remember that the Daily Stormer published several articles by a user using the alias ‘Michael Slay’ earlier this year. ‘Slay’ had been active on various pro-White Reddits, was clearly intelligent and a skilled writer. He contacted me asked if he could submit articles to the Daily Stormer. I agreed.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Interestingly too, he published a piece proposing Israel literally genocide the Palestinians under the name of a well known Jewish lawyer, who then – of course – blamed it on “White Supremacists.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the Bornstein hoax, Goldberg established a blog on the Times of Israel in the lawyer’s name before posting an inflammatory article calling for the “extermination” of Palestinians. The Times retracted the article and apologised, and Bornstein went public with the story saying “I deplore racism – I’ve fought racism since I was four years old”.
       </p>
       <p>
        When confronted, Goldberg boasted he had avoided detection, saying, “That guy has no idea. He thinks [online radical right wing website] Daily Stormer did it.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Let’s leave aside exactly how a “four year old” Jew can “fight racism” for now. Perhaps the most interesting part is that Goldberg was given publicity by none other than Rita Katz of SITE. You remember Katz, who runs the “intelligence” group in Maryland that “just happens” to find all those scary Islamic State videos online even before Islamic State finds them?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Australi Witness persona fooled members of the international intelligence community as well as journalists, with well-known analyst Rita Katz of SITE Intelligence Group saying the “IS supporter” held a “prestige” position in online jihadi circles and was “part of the hard core of a group of individuals who constantly look for targets for other people to attack”.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ms Katz has previously acted as a consultant for US and foreign governments and testified before Congress on online terrorist activities.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What got Goldberg in trouble with the FBI was his attempt to create a terrorist attack on the anniversary of September 11, 2001.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But it was Australi Witness’s role in helping a confidential FBI informant plan an attack on the anniversary of 9/11 that brought Goldberg’s trolling to an end. (The complaint alleges that Goldberg confessed ‘in substance’ to being the voice behind Australi Witness and affiliated accounts. Journalists at the Syndey Morning Herald say they uncovered Golberg’s trolling and handed evidence over to police after one of the reporters discovered Goldberg impersonating her.)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Is there any doubt that, had he been successful, we’d be hearing from the Usual “White Nationalist” Suspects about how the “911 conspiracy theorists” have it all wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is “hambaconeggs” all over again, isn’t it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s also keep in mind that Goldberg’s Jewish Supremacism, Zionism, and hatred for Muslims and Arabs were motivating factors in his years long hasbara campaign:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In online conversations, Goldberg said: “I wanna smear Amnesty and Mariam Veiszadeh – Amnesty is already in hot water over their links to CAGE, I wanna cement their jihadist connections and ruin their reputation. And Mariam is a Muslim whore, so smearing her as a jihadist should be easy.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Joshua Goldberg is part of a long and storied tradition of Jews dressing up like their “enemies” and creating the same “anti-semitism” they are so fond of complaining about. Of course, there is Frances Cohen, the Jew who pretended to be a “Nazi” and helped popularize the Holocaust culture in America. Cohen was constantly quoted in the media saying, “Hitler only killed six million, I want to get the rest.” He had a group of about ten people, yet was all over the news in 1978, and the media acted as if “Neo-Nazis” were all over America just waiting to kill elderly Jewish people. From what I’ve read, it was wall-to-wall coverage for months, and his Jewish lawyer took the case all the way to the Supreme Court to allow his “protests.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there was Adam Pearlman, a Jew from California, grandson of an ADL director, that under the name “Adam Gadahn” was “Al Qaeda’s Media Director.” The Pentagon regularly reported that he was a close associate of Osama Bin Laden and an important part of “Al Qaeda.” Yes, we were led to believe that a Jew from California was taken under the wing of the world wide Muslim terrorist group – the people that had pulled off 9/11 – and given a high rank. Pearlman made a number of videos – in English – demanding that America surrender and promising “another 9/11.” These videos were, of course, publicized by Rita Katz of SITE. The Pentagon announced he was captured, then said he wasn’t, then just stopped talking about him altogether. I’m not saying he’s probably sunning himself on a Tel Aviv beach these days, but really, would it surprise anyone?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Adam Pearlman, Al Qaeda's Number Three &amp; Joseph Cohen, Revolution "Muslim"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s not forget “Yousef al-Khattab” – real name Joseph Cohen – that was regularly featured on the TV during the 2000s as the leader of a terrorist group called “Revolution Muslim.” They promoted outrageous anti-American and anti-Israel propaganda while Cohen walked around Manhattan coffeeshops calling for jihad. The New York Daily News particularly liked to feature him on the front page and run pictures of him giving “thumbs up” to news headlines about terrorist attacks in Israel. Just like the anthrax attacks of 2001, the message was “Death to America, Death to Israel, Praise Allah.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Just about everyone was fooled until, one by one, they were outed at which time everyone just pretended like they didn’t exist and simply dropped the stories. And it doesn’t matter how often this sort of things happens, while it’s happening, expressing any doubt whatsoever makes you a “conspiracy theorist” which is about the worst thing you can be called other than “racist.” Then after the hoax is exposed, bringing it up makes you “obsessed” about things that “don’t matter anymore.”
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, this long history should make Identitarians quite skeptical of people and groups promoting a “hardcore” image, especially when they call for violence. I’m reminded of a frequent poster on Radix Journal and other pro-white sites that constantly praises violence and goes all the way to the line of suggesting “lone wolf terrorist” attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       This should also make one pause about the kinds of people attracted to sites like The Daily Stormer, the “Neo-Nazi” subculture, and Hitler fetishization. Because – literally – it’s exactly what “the Jews” want you to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, considering this very long history, would it be too much to describe these people as “crisis actors?”

       Joshua Goldberg also used to write for DailyKos, Feministing and a number of progressive sites under the pseudonym 'Tanya Cohen'. Do you remember the uber Zionist who complained about "Squazis" ("Nazi" redditors who moderated desirable subreddits)? That was Joshua Goldberg (aka Tanya Cohen):

       I think this story provides justification.  Anti-semitism is simply a term that says Jews should be treated with kid gloves because they think they're special when they are worse than anything that Hitler has done.  In fact they are doing the same thing to the Palestinians as the Nazis had done to them.  I'm sure if there were no repercussions they would be gassing Palestinians if they could.

       What's the difference?  I'm sure there are gentiles that do not hold the same view as Goldberg but how do you determine that?  We could say all orthodox jews, hasidic jews are doing these types of things and claim anti-semitism for opposing their views.  Which is complete and utter bullshit.

       Anti-Semitic canards are used regularly by racist bigots. Never mind the fact that none of these claims are backed up by a source.

       Claiming Jews dressing up like their “enemies” and creating the same “anti-semitism” is quite sick and disturbing, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, this subreddit has a fetish for anything involving Jews.

       Yet the article just listed five Jews doing JUST THAT - complete with sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when you said that "none of these claims are backed up by a source" - you lied.
      </p>
      <p>
       That does NOT mean that "all Jews are liars" - no one said that. It just means that YOU are a liar.

       What if I told you 9 out of 10 'neo-nazis' who post on /pol/ are just more Goldbergs and the rest are NEET losers who'd rather believe the lie that they actually have a majority of opinion somewhere other than the sewer they crawled out of and the combination of the two has utterly ruined any worthwhile discussion on the board.

       It's anti-semitic to take one jew and declare he represents all the jews.
And the irony is to say that all jews are guilty of quite everything and in the same time that there is no anti-semitism. Yep, your are a big group of racist, and some very dumb one.

       It's just that if you say one Jew is guilty of something, the standard Jewish response is "stop saying all jews are guilty of everything!"
