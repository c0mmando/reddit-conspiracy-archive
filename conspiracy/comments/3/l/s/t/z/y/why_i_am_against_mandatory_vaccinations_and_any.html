        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>(Just skip to the first break at &quot;1932-1972&quot; if you don&#39;t want to hear me ramble) </p>

<p>I see a lot of people pushing for mandatory vaccinations, using the classic &quot;think of the children&quot; excuse  (which is about the oldest thought terminating cliche in the book) and I just feel like the other side deserves to be heard. What you&#39;re basically saying is &quot;the government knows what&#39;s best for our children&#39;s bodies&quot;</p>

<p>Yes I will concede that some vaccines are beneficial, and many of those vaccines parents should get, but the line has to be drawn at making them mandatory. Quarantine the children, don&#39;t allow them into public schools if you don&#39;t want. Force the parents to homeschool the kids. Just don&#39;t allow the government to force a medical procedure onto someone without their consent, or the parents consent. The personal freedom is what matters.</p>

<p>The vaccines cause autism stuff is a distraction. It&#39;s an easily defeatable straw man that is only being perpetuated because it helps to undermine the legitimate arguments against mandatory vaccinations. The legitimate arguments basically boil down to reigning in the governments power over your health and your child&#39;s health.</p>

<p>You&#39;re only being told one side of the story about why people do not trust this.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not irrational paranoia. It&#39;s a completely rational reaction given the governments track record with the publics health.</p>

<p>Any power given to the government should be looked upon in the context of how it can be abused. It&#39;s not irrational to think in that way. That&#39;s history. Like all of history. I don&#39;t remember who said it, but I recently read a quote from a UK politican </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The main lesson to be learned from history is that we never learn any lessons from history&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the truth. It&#39;s irrational to believe that the government has your best interests in mind, given their track record the evidence points towards the opposite being true.</p>

<p>It does seem peculiar how much the push for mandatory vaccinations has increased these last few years.</p>

<p>The precedence is already there to preform any number of experiments and harmful programs on the people using mandatory &quot;vaccinations&quot; as the excuse. Americas &quot;greatest&quot; ally Israel recently admitted to <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/israel-admits-ethiopian-women-were-given-birth-control-shots.premium-1.496519">injecting Beta Israeli Ethiopian women with birth control</a> in order to keep the Beta Israeli population down. Over the course of the program the birth rate of the Beta Israelis dropped 50%, the population dropped 20%. Many of the women attest to the fact that they did not understand what they were being given. Some were told they were mandatory inoculations or vaccinations, others weren&#39;t told what it was. Some were told that it was a drug that would prevent them from giving birth, but they were doing it for their own good because child birth is painful and will lead to their deaths. The drug would make the Ethiopian jews sterile for 3 months, so new injections had to be conducted every 90 days, the Israeli government banked on the fact that the Ethiopians were not educated enough to understand what it was they were having done to them. This isn&#39;t a theory, Israel admitted in 2013 this program had been going on for a decade. Some more radical groups, like the UN, might even define what they did as genocide (specifically it falls under the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide article II section D &quot;Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group&quot; ). No one is going to hold Israel accountable though, their government admits they did it but they deny any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Right there you have a modern day example of forced injections being used by a developed state (one of our closest allies no less. An ally with HUGE political pull in the United States) to reduce the population of an unwanted minority. The scary thing is it worked. It worked exceedingly well. Other governments might publicly shake their fist and condemn it, but privately they&#39;ll add that to the playbook as something that does work if needed. What&#39;s to say the same will not happen here? We just take it for granted that it won&#39;t. What if the government decides one day that, for example, blacks are too much trouble, lets just covertly start to cull them. (I used blacks for a reason. As you&#39;ll see they really like experimenting on poor blacks. Apparently no one kicks up much of a fuss if the subjects are poor/black. If you&#39;re a poor black criminal, you might as well be a guinea pig to the government)</p>

<p>This post is about the US though, not of Israel did/did not commit genocide. So lets dive into the history of unethical human medical experimentation in the United States. Our history is littered with unethical medical experiments being conducted by both the US government and other scientists, and the sad thing is most people are completely ignorant on just how much was done. In the interest of fairness, we did gain a lot of medical info from these things, but they&#39;re still unethical as fuck. In no particular order here are 50 of them</p>

<hr/>

<p>1932-1972: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment">The Tuskegee Syphilis experiment</a> Hundreds of poor African American men that had syphilis were left untreated by the US government. They weren&#39;t told they had syphilis, it was deliberately hidden from them, if they were told it could&#39;ve been treated and many would&#39;ve probably lived. Unlike later experiments in central America, the government didn&#39;t infect the men with syphilis, they just lied about the infection once the men had it. The government wanted to test how the disease spread when left untreated. Almost all died to the disease or complications from it. Of the original 399 men, only 74 of the victims were still alive in 1972 at the experiments conclusion. 59 of the men&#39;s family members (wives and children) ended up becoming infected with syphilis.</p>

<hr/>

<p>1913-1951: <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/phr.2009.78.2.210">the San Quentin prison testicle human to human and animal to human transplantation experiments</a> (it&#39;s as bad as it sounds). Dr. Leo Stanley, chief surgeon at the San Quentin Prison, performed a wide variety of experiments on hundreds of prisoners at San Quentin. Many of the experiments involved testicular implants, where Stanley would take the testicles out of executed prisoners and surgically implant them into living prisoners. In other experiments, he attempted to implant the testicles of rams, goats, and boars into living prisoners. Stanley also performed various eugenics experiments, and forced sterilizations on San Quentin prisoners. Stanley believed that his experiments would rejuvenate old men, control crime (which he believed had biological causes), and prevent the &quot;unfit&quot; from reproducing.</p>

<hr/>

<p>1952-1972: <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/MKULTRA">Project MKULTRA</a>. The CIA conducts hundreds of experiments on American citizens in order to test various methods of mind control. CIA Director Helms destroyed most of the documents, but what we do know was bad. The unibomber was one of the victims of MKULTRA. The project also led to at least one suicide. Hundreds of people were given LSD without their consent. It&#39;s too much to go over here. Very interesting read if you have some time.</p>

<hr/>

<p>1908 <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=0HRWtjV4mm0C&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=st+vincent%27s+tuberculin&amp;cd=5&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=st%20vincent%27s%20tuberculin">three Philadelphia researchers infected dozens of children with tuberculin</a> at the St. Vincent&#39;s House orphanage in Philadelphia, causing permanent blindness in some of the children and painful lesions and inflammation of the eyes in many of the others. In the study they refer to the children as &quot;material used&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>1911 <a href="http://annals.org/mobile/article.aspx?articleid=708859">Dr. Hideyo Noguchi of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research</a> injected 146 hospital patients (some of whom were children) with syphilis.</p>

<hr/>

<p>1906: <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/archives/">US army infects Filipinos with the bubonic plague</a>. U.S Army doctors in the Philippines infected five prisoners with bubonic plague and induced beriberi in 29 prisoners; four of the test subjects died as a result. In 1906, Professor Richard Strong of Harvard University intentionally infected 24 Filipino prisoners with cholera, which had somehow become contaminated with plague. He did this without the consent of the patients, and without informing them of what he was doing. All of the subjects became sick and 13 died.</p>

<hr/>

<p>1941 at the University of Michigan, virologists Thomas Francis, Jonas Salk and other researchers deliberately infected patients at several Michigan mental institutions with the influenza virus by spraying the virus into their nasal passages (so the guy who created the Polio vaccine experimented on mentally ill patients. Won&#39;t see that in the history books). </p>

<hr/>

<p>1937-45: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731">Unit 731</a>. <strong>NOT CONDUCTED BY US</strong>. It was conducted by the empire of Japan unit 731 is quite possibly the most brutal, horrific chapter in the history of war. Over 3000 deaths. You can&#39;t make up the horrible things these &quot;scientists&quot; did to their chinese, korean, and American PoW victims. Their crimes are too numerous to go over here, ranging from vivisections on living subjects, to biological warfare experiments, to the body&#39;s tolerance for mutilation and torture. Read up on them if you want your day ruined. I&#39;ve included them on this list because the US government pardoned the scientists that conducted the 731 experiments after the war, they wanted the information gained from the extremely unethical human experimentation. The victims of 731 saw no justice.</p>

<hr/>

<p>1940s:  The Stateville Penitentiary Malaria Study was a controlled study of the effects of malaria on the prisoners of Stateville Penitentiary near Joliet, Illinois, beginning in the 1940s. The study was conducted by the Department of Medicine at the University of Chicago in conjunction with the United States Army and the State Department. For reference on how unethical these types of studies were, the Nazi researchers on trial for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials used Statesville as part of their defense to point out the hypocrisy of the US trying them for experimenting on prisoners while we were conducting experiments on our own prisoners. (really the only difference between US government scientists in the 30s and 40s and Nazi government scientists in the 30s and 40s was that they got caught and put on trial for what they did. Our stuff was covered up until decades after the fact. Japan was on a higher level than everyone, but no country was innocent.)</p>

<hr/>

<p>1946-1948 <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala_syphilis_experiment">Guatemala syphilis experiments</a> , U.S. researchers used prostitutes to infect prison inmates, insane asylum patients, and Guatemalan soldiers with syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases, in order to test the effectiveness of penicillin in treating the STDs. ~700 victims were infected because of the studies. In 2010 the US officially apologized to Guatemala for the studies.</p>

<hr/>

<p>1950:  <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2005/7/13/how_the_u_s_government_exposed">The U.S. Navy</a> sprayed large quantities of the bacteria Serratia marcescens – considered harmless at this time – over the city of San Francisco. Numerous citizens contracted pneumonia-like illnesses, and at least one person died as a result. The experiment was meant to simulate a biological attack on a US city. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=JCU9KV00aCkC&amp;pg=PA2">Serratia tests were continued until at least 1969</a> (which means they knew for 19yrs it caused sickness, but were like &quot;oh well&quot;)</p>

<hr/>

<p>Mid 1950s. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/army-sprayed-st-louis-with-toxic-dust-2012-10">The US army sprays poisionous zinc cadmium sulfide</a> in poor black st louis neighborhoods as part of a biological contamination experiment to test how it&#39;d react in a population. Confirmed in 1994 that St Louis was chosen because it was similar to a Russian city. Multiple children born during the timespan die due to strange outbreaks of cancer</p>

<hr/>

<p>1950 Dr. Joseph Stokes of the University of Pennsylvania deliberately infected 200 female prisoners with viral hepatitis. (Hornblum 1998 p91)</p>

<hr/>

<p>1950:  CIA&#39;s <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Bluebird">Project Bluebird</a>, later renamed Project Artichoke, whose stated purpose was to develop &quot;the means to control individuals through special interrogation techniques&quot;, &quot;way[s] to prevent the extraction of information from CIA agents&quot;, and &quot;offensive uses of unconventional techniques, such as hypnosis and drugs&quot;. The purpose of the project was outlined in a memo dated January 1952 that stated, &quot;Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will and even against fundamental laws of nature, such as self preservation?&quot; The project studied the use of hypnosis, forced morphine addiction and subsequent forced withdrawal, and the use of other chemicals, among other methods, to produce amnesia and other vulnerable states in subjects. In order to &quot;perfect techniques ... for the abstraction of information from individuals, whether willing or not&quot;, Project Bluebird researchers experimented with a wide variety of psychoactive substances, including LSD, heroin, marijuana, cocaine, PCP, mescaline, and ether. Project Bluebird researchers dosed over 7,000 U.S. military personnel with LSD, without their knowledge or consent, at the Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland. Years after these experiments, more than 1,000 of these soldiers suffered from several psychiatric illnesses, including depression and epilepsy. Many of them tried to commit suicide.</p>

<hr/>

<p>1952: professional tennis player <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Blauer">Harold Blauer</a> died when injected by Dr. James Cattell with a fatal dose of a mescaline derivative at the New York State Psychiatric Institute of Columbia University. The United States Department of Defense, which sponsored the injection, worked in collusion with the Department of Justice and the New York State Attorney General to conceal evidence of its involvement for 23 years. Cattell claimed that he did not know what the army had given him to inject into Blauer, saying: &quot;We didn&#39;t know whether it was dog piss or what we were giving him.&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>1950s-1972: mentally disabled children at the Willowbrook State School in Staten Island, New York were intentionally infected with viral hepatitis, for research whose purpose was to help discover a vaccine. From 1963 to 1966, Saul Krugman of New York University promised the parents of mentally disabled children that their children would be enrolled into Willowbrook in exchange for signing a consent form for procedures that he claimed were &quot;vaccinations.&quot; In reality, the procedures involved deliberately infecting children with viral hepatitis by feeding them an extract made from the feces of patients infected with the disease. (Hey look, it&#39;s the old &quot;horrible human experimentation disguised as a vaccination&quot; trick. Thankfully no one ever decided to use that again. Otherwise making vaccinations mandatory could be really bad)</p>

<hr/>

<p>1955, <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=14708">the CIA allegedly conducted a biological warfare experiment</a> on Tampa Florida. They released whooping cough bacteria from boats outside of Tampa Bay, causing a whooping cough epidemic in the city, and killing at least 12 people (in the interest of fairness, there are some that doubt the CIAs whooping cough experiments caused the whooping cough outbreak in tampa. Pure coincidence that they happened at the same time.)</p>

<hr/>

<p>1954-55: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Big_Itch">Operation Big Itch</a> . Tests were conducted with mosquitoes and fleas to test their usefulness as bio weapons loaded into munitions. In may 1955 300,000 uninfected mosquitoes are dropped over Georgia to test if air dropped mosquitoes could still be reliable to feed on human blood. (The weapon would be where you infect the mosquitoes with a biological agent, and drop them over enemy cities. This is similar to experiments 731 worked on in China)</p>

<hr/>

<p>1963-69:  Project Shipboard Hazard and Defense (SHAD), the U.S. Army performed tests which involved spraying several U.S. ships with various biological and chemical warfare agents, while thousands of U.S. military personnel were aboard the ships. The personnel were not notified of the tests, and were not given any protective clothing. Chemicals tested on the U.S. military personnel included the nerve gases VX and Sarin, toxic chemicals such as zinc cadmium sulfide and sulfur dioxide, and a variety of biological agents</p>

<p>1966: <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2005/7/13/how_the_u_s_government_exposed">The US government releases the harmless bacteria Bacillus globigii</a> in the new york and Chicago subway systems to test the spread of a biological outbreak. (Even if it&#39;s allegedly harmless, it&#39;s still the government infecting citizens without their knowledge or consent)</p>

<hr/>

<p>1963: University of Washington researchers irradiated the testes of 232 prisoners to determine the effects of radiation on testicular function. When these inmates later left prison and had children, at least four of them had offspring born with birth defects. The exact number is unknown because researchers never followed up on the status of the subjects (Goliszek, 2003: Ch. 4)</p>

<hr/>

<p>1949 operation  &quot;<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Run">Green Run</a> &quot; radiation experiments. the AEC released iodine-131 and xenon-133 to the atmosphere near the Hanford site in Washington, which contaminated a 500,000-acre (2,000 km2) area containing three small towns</p>

<p>(Sources for the next few things are The Plutonium files and the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce report entitled American Nuclear Guinea Pigs : Three Decades of Radiation Experiments on U.S. Citizens)</p>

<hr/>

<p>1953: The US atomic energy commission (AEC) runs tests at the University of Iowa on pregnant women and newborns using radioactive isotopes of Iodine. In one of the studies they gave 25 newborn babies (who were under 36 hours old and weighed from 5.5 to 8.5 pounds (2.5 to 3.9 kg)) iodine-131, either by oral administration or through an injection, so that they could measure the amount of iodine in their thyroid glands, as iodine would go to that gland. (Goliszek, 2003: pp. 132–134)</p>

<hr/>

<p>1950s: 28 infants are experimented on at the University of Nebraska similar to the University of Iowa tests. (Goliszek, 2003: pp. 132–134)</p>

<hr/>

<p>1953, the AEC sponsored a study to discover if radioactive iodine affected premature babies differently from full-term babies. In the experiment, researchers from Harper Hospital in Detroit orally administered iodine-131 to 65 premature and full-term infants who weighed from 2.1 to 5.5 pounds (0.95 to 2.49 kg).</p>

<hr/>

<p>1955-1960, Sonoma State Hospital in northern California served as a permanent drop-off location for mentally handicapped children diagnosed with cerebral palsy or lesser disorders. The children subsequently underwent painful experimentation without adult consent. Many were given irradiated milk, some spinal taps &quot;for which they received no direct benefit.&quot; Reporters of 60 Minutes learned that in these five years, the brain of every cerebral palsy child who died at Sonoma State was removed and studied without parental consent. According to the CBS story, over 1,400 patients died at the clinic.</p>

<hr/>

<p>1960s: 100 Alaskan citizens are exposed to radioactive iodine</p>

<hr/>

<p>1946-1947, researchers at the University of Rochester injected uranium-234 and uranium-235 in dosages ranging from 6.4 to 70.7 micrograms per kilogram of body weight into six people to study how much uranium their kidneys could tolerate before becoming damaged</p>

<hr/>

<p>1945:  Albert Stevens, a man misdiagnosed with stomach cancer, received &quot;treatment&quot; for his &quot;cancer&quot; at the U.C. San Francisco Medical Center in 1945. Dr. Joseph Gilbert Hamilton, a Manhattan Project doctor in charge of the human experiments in California had Stevens injected with Pu-238 and Pu-239 without informed consent. Stevens never had cancer; a surgery to remove cancerous cells was highly successful in removing the benign tumor, and he lived for another 20 years with the injected plutonium.Since Stevens received the highly radioactive Pu-238, his accumulated dose over his remaining life was higher than anyone has ever received: 64 Sv (6400 rem). Neither Albert Stevens nor any of his relatives were told that he never had cancer; they were led to believe that the experimental &quot;treatment&quot; has worked.</p>

<p>1946-50:  researchers at Vanderbilt University gave 829 pregnant mothers in Tennessee what they were told were &quot;vitamin drinks&quot; that would improve the health of their babies. The mixtures contained radioactive iron and the researchers were determining how fast the radioisotope crossed into the placenta. At least three children are known to have died from the experiments, from cancers. Four of the women&#39;s babies died from cancers as a result of the experiments, and the women experienced rashes, bruises, anemia, hair/tooth loss, and cancer</p>

<p>1946-1953, at the Walter E. Fernald State School in Massachusetts, in an experiment sponsored by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and the Quaker Oats corporation, 73 mentally disabled children were fed oatmeal containing radioactive calcium and other radioisotopes, in order to track &quot;how nutrients were digested&quot;. The children were not told that they were being fed radioactive chemicals; they were told by hospital staff and researchers that they were joining a &quot;science club&quot; (Quaker Oats just forever lost my business)</p>

<p>1950s, researchers at the Medical College of Virginia performed experiments on severe burn victims, most of them poor and black, without their knowledge or consent, with funding from the Army and in collaboration with the AEC. In the experiments, the subjects were exposed to additional burning, experimental antibiotic treatment, and injections of radioactive isotopes. The amount of radioactive phosphorus-32 injected into some of the patients, 500 microcuries (19 MBq), was 50 times the &quot;acceptable&quot; dose for a healthy individual; for people with severe burns, this likely led to significantly increased death rates</p>

<p>1960-1971, the Department of Defense funded non-consensual whole body radiation experiments on poor, black cancer patients , who were not told what was being done to them. Patients were told that they were receiving a &quot;treatment&quot; that might cure their cancer, but the Pentagon was trying to determine the effects of high levels of radiation on the human body.</p>

<p>1960-1971, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/06/local/me-saenger6">Dr. Eugene Saenger, funded by the Defense Atomic Support Agency</a> , performed whole body radiation experiments on more than 90 poor, black, terminally ill cancer patients with inoperable tumors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. He forged consent forms, and did not inform the patients of the risks of irradiation. The patients were given 100 or more rads (1 Gy) of whole-body radiation, which in many caused intense pain and vomiting</p>

<p>1963 to 1973, a leading endocrinologist, Dr. Carl Heller, irradiated the testicles of Oregon and Washington prisoners. In return for their participation, he gave them $5 a month, and $100 when they had to receive a vasectomy upon conclusion of the trial. The surgeon who sterilized the men said that it was necessary to &quot;keep from contaminating the general population with radiation-induced mutants&quot;. <strong>Dr. Joseph Hamilton, one of the researchers who had worked with Heller on the experiments, said that the experiments &quot;had a little of the Buchenwald touch&quot;</strong></p>

<p>To test whether or not sulfuric acid, which is used in making molasses, was harmful as a food additive, the Louisiana State Board of Health commissioned a study to feed &quot;Negro prisoners&quot; nothing but molasses for five weeks. One report stated that prisoners didn&#39;t &quot;object to submitting themselves to the test, because it would not do any good if they did&quot;. (Anyone ever read about those old studies where they found if you hurt and torture a creature long enough, eventually the despair will get so great that they won&#39;t even try to fight back after a certain point, but rather accept their fates? Yeah.)</p>

<hr/>

<p>1953: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Top_Hat">Operation Top Hat</a> . Military personnel exposed to chemical weapons. The experiments used Chemical Corps personnel to test decontamination methods for biological and chemical weapons, including sulfur mustard and nerve agents. The personnel were deliberately exposed to these contaminants, were not volunteers, and were not informed of the tests.</p>

<hr/>

<p>1951-74: The Holmesburg Program (this should be a movie. agent orange, corrupt chemical companies, a mad scientist, and good old fashioned government exploitation of prisoners)  1951 to 1974, the Holmesburg Prison in Pennsylvania was the site of extensive dermatological research operations, using prisoners as subjects. Led by Dr. <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0101/0101gaz3.html">Albert M. Kligman</a> of the University of Pennsylvania, the studies were performed on behalf of Dow Chemical Company, the U.S. Army, and Johnson &amp; Johnson. In one of the studies, for which Dow Chemical paid Kligman $10,000, Kligman injected dioxin — a highly toxic, carcinogenic compound found in Agent Orange, which Dow was manufacturing for use in Vietnam at the time — into 70 prisoners, most of them black (wow didn&#39;t see that coming /s). The prisoners developed severe lesions which went untreated for seven months. Dow Chemical wanted to study the health effects of dioxin and other herbicides, and how they affect human skin, because workers at their chemical plants were developing chloracne. In the study, Kligman applied roughly the same amount of dioxin as that to which Dow employees were being exposed.</p>

<p>Kligman later continued his dioxin studies, increasing the dosage of dioxin he applied to the skin of 10 prisoners to 7,500 micrograms of dioxin, which is 468 times the dosage that the Dow Chemical official Gerald K. Rowe had authorized him to administer. As a result, the prisoners developed inflammatory pustules and papules.</p>

<p>The Holmesburg program paid hundreds of inmates a nominal stipend to test a wide range of cosmetic products and chemical compounds, whose health effects were unknown at the time. Upon his arrival at Holmesberg, Kligman is claimed to have said, &quot;All I saw before me were acres of skin ... It was like a farmer seeing a fertile field for the first time&quot;. A 1964 issue of Medical News reported that 9 out of 10 prisoners at Holmesburg Prison were medical test subjects. In 1967, the U.S. Army paid Kligman to apply skin-blistering chemicals to the faces and backs of inmates at Holmesburg to, in Kligman&#39;s words, &quot;learn how the skin protects itself against chronic assault from toxic chemicals, the so-called hardening process.&quot;</p>

<p>1940s, researchers began performing experiments in which they tested diethylstilbestrol, a synthetic estrogen, on pregnant women at the Lying-In Hospital of the University of Chicago. The women experienced an abnormally high number of miscarriages and babies with low birth weight (LBW). None of the women were told that they were being experimented on.</p>

<hr/>

<p>1962, researchers at the Laurel Children&#39;s Center in Maryland tested experimental acne medications on children. They continued their tests even after half of the children developed severe liver damage from the medications (Goliszek, 2003: pp. 223–225)</p>

<p>2004, <a href="http://markingson.blogspot.com/">University of Minnesota research</a> participant Dan Markingson committed suicide while enrolled in an industry-sponsored pharmaceutical trial comparing three FDA-approved atypical antipsychotics: Seroquel (quetiapine), Zyprexa (olanzapine), and Risperdal (risperidone). Writing on the circumstances surrounding Markingson&#39;s death in the study, which was designed and funded by Seroquel manufacturer AstraZeneca, University of Minnesota Professor of Bioethics Carl Elliott noted that Markingson was enrolled in the study against the wishes of his mother, Mary Weiss, and that he was forced to choose between enrolling in the study or being involuntarily committed to a state mental institution. (Either let us experiment on you, or we&#39;ll throw you in a mental institution and they&#39;ll experiment on you for us)</p>

<p>1950, researchers at the Cleveland City Hospital ran experiments to study changes in cerebral blood flow: they injected people with spinal anesthesia, and inserted needles into their jugular veins and brachial arteries to extract large quantities of blood and, after massive blood loss which caused paralysis and fainting, measured their blood pressure</p>

<p>1971: <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=NmkWW05RBOcC&amp;pg=PA71">The San Antonio Contraceptive Study was a clinical research study about the side effects of oral contraceptives</a> .

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are more. We usually don&#39;t learn about the really bad stuff until decades after the fact, to protect the criminals from prosecution.</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t believe the number of unethical human experiments conducted by our government, researchers, and pharmacological companies has stopped (fun fact, the greek word that pharmaceutical and pharmacological comes from is Pharmakon. It means both &quot;cure&quot; and &quot;poison&quot;). I think they have just gotten much better at hiding their tracks. No one will give a shit if you experiment on Muhammad bin ali Muhammad in some CIA middle eastern black site, or Tyrone Johnson in some Chicago black site prison (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/24/chicago-police-detain-americans-black-site">which do exist btw</a>). Out of sight out of mind.</p>

<p>Many of these things were able to be conducted due to the average persons ignorance about these chemicals, and about the existence of the experiments themselves. It left these victims with a  the perceived trust they had for authority.</p>

<p>We know better now. We know without a doubt that our government has no problems taking the bad road.</p>

<p>There is a middle ground. Not all of the vaccines are bad, but some that get thrown in with the good ones are &quot;questionable&quot;.</p>

<p>The question isn&#39;t why do we fear government having this power over children&#39;s health. The question is why would you want to give it to them. Why you can look at the plethora of evidence and still believe that they won&#39;t use the opportunity to do something horrible with it.</p>

<p>When a government is given power over its citizens that it previously did not have it&#39;s not a question of &quot;if&quot; but &quot;when&quot; they will abuse it. (source: human history)</p>

<p>They always start with something rational. Something that most people will agree to without thinking. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>if you oppose mandatory vaccines then you want children to die. Think of the children!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then they edge away and push farther and farther. Then ten years down the line your son is getting &quot;the buchenwald touch&quot; in a mandatory appointment at a government run clinic, they said it was because of some new and deadly virus but in reality the ruling party just wanted to reduce your demographics numbers Israeli style. Your son comes down with an illness and in two weeks he becomes sterile. Within a month your genetic line is dead. You&#39;re just sitting there wondering how we got here. This isn&#39;t science fiction, this has already happened to Beta Israelis in Israel. The women and girls went for their mandatory inoculations, and 3 month vaccinations and next thing you know your people&#39;s birth rate is cut in half and your population shrinks 20% in a decade.</p>

<p>If it does go south it&#39;s not a case of &quot;full me once shame on you&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s more like &quot;fool us 50 times, and we are still dumb enough to give you even more control over my kids.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It just baffles me how many otherwise reasonable people are so brainwashed in the area of medicine. Whatever the government decides about vaccines, drugs, doctors, alternative medicine, etc, they take it as the gospel truth. I&#39;ve seen my own siblings have adverse reactions to vaccines. I&#39;ve read the literature, the official lines, the whistleblowers&#39; statements. I don&#39;t oppose vaccines but I absolutely believe the U.S. medical establishment is hiding a lot about them, including the extent to which they&#39;ve used us as unwitting guinea pigs for minimally tested or even deliberately harmful vaccine components.</p>

For decades, other doctors thought he was &quot;cutting edge&quot;. The fact is, we don&#39;t know everything about the body, especially the brain. And this is including honest doctors who have no hidden agenda. It&#39;s scary. We have come A LONG way since even 1950, but there are so many unknown areas, and with all the drugs they are pushing out, odds are bad stuff can happen. Doctors are humans just like us, and can have varying opinions, so it is healthy to have a bit of skepticism. It&#39;s scary to think how many practices will be considered &quot;barbaric&quot; 50 years from now, but currently considered &quot;cutting edge&quot;. Tread carefully.</p>

You&#39;d be surprised how many people who are mercury poisoned intuitively know the problem is emanating from their mouth, but nothing more specific than that.

    <div class="md"><p>This post is conflating two different issues.  Not mentioned: I&#39;m rather convinced that the unethical development of a polio vaccine in the Congo lead to the AIDS epidemic, but that doesn&#39;t negate the necessity of most vaccines, including the Polio vaccine.</p>

<p>The polio vaccine gives one out of two million people ACTUAL Polio, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a bad idea or you shouldn&#39;t get it.</p>

<p>I think things should be reformed. I think the use of preservatives like mercury are a profit decision, not a medical one. I think that some vaccine are NOT necessary and are marketed by a profit decision, not a medical one.</p>

<p>72% of polio infections are asymptomatic.</p>

<p>Fewer than one percent of all polio cases result in some form of paralysis.  This is only fatal in 2-5% of children and much more so in adults.  Like many illnesses we vaccinate our &quot;vulnerable&quot; children for, childhood is the safest time to contract the disease (.02-.05% chance of death IF infected) and duration of immunity is unknown.  It takes three doses to predict 95% chance of immunity for duration unknown.</p>

<p>More than 99% of those who contracted polio fully recovered in the pre vaccine era.  Even paralytic polio had a majority of sufferers recover fully within a year.</p>

<p>The rule has been in effect for several years, It was included as a means to eliminate back and forth name calling that used to go on for dozens of comments in some threads, thus derailing discussions of the topics at hand. </p>

<p>All of our rules were discussed thoroughly prior to implementation and we&#39;ve received great support for them through the years from the vast majority of readers here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mercury, in particular Thermisol, has been largely removed from vaccinations since 2001 by FDA decision. Of the vaccinations with trace amounts of it, there are all of three.  Those vaccinations are for the DTap (Diptheria, Tetanus, and Whooping Cough), and your every day flu shot.  There are multiple options for non Thermisol based vaccinations of these.</p>

<p>For adult vaccinations, there are five with Thermisol in them.  Again it&#39;s the usual flu vaccination, one for DTaP (for adults who never got it in the first place, or pregnant women) which has multiple non Thermisol stabilized versions, and Meningitis.</p>

<p>I should also note, that many over the counter medications such as Sudafed, Benadryl, and Tylenol have thermisol in them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not all vaccines are created equal. Some have caused hardly any problems at all, while some are responsible for far more than their share of vaccine injuries. Some are very effective at preventing whichever disease they&#39;re for, some are far less effective and shouldn&#39;t be on the market at all. In many cases it&#39;s not the virus in the title of the vaccine that causes the harm - it&#39;s the preservatives, the binding agents, and the other stuff that I believe they put in covertly for experimental purposes. </p>

<p>Do I think we give too many vaccines? Absolutely. None of them are necessary for anyone, much less everyone, and some are not helpful at all. In many cases they don&#39;t confer lifetime immunity, and it seems silly to have childhood-only immunity to (extremely rare) diseases that are mild in childhood but extremely serious if contracted as an adult.</p>

<p>EDIT: I wanted to add that if there was a reasonable public discourse about vaccines it would solve so many problems. If we were more informed about the side effects of vaccines, especially the effects of giving them in combination and to such young infant patients, I think there would be more attention paid to children before and after their (hopefully fewer) vaccinations and therefore less injuries. More parents would choose not to give their baby the full range of shots, at least not until school age, and in other countries they&#39;ve shown the positive effects of a delayed immunization schedule. </p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t know if this is what they&#39;re trained to do or not, but if your kid has a vaccine and then a bad reaction, in general the doctors will look for any other possible cause they can find, try to downplay the possibility of the vaccine being responsible, and sometimes downright deny that it could have anything to do with it. This should change. My little sister had terrible reactions to several shots, culminating in the day she got the MMR shot, one other shot that I can&#39;t remember, and a flu shot all at once. She had a fever of 107 degrees, febrile seizures, loud shrill screaming for days, vomiting, and other symptoms. The pediatrician and the ER doctors all flatly denied that the vaccine could have anything to do with it or that she could have sustained permanent damage. We didn&#39;t take a picture of the thermometer and her temperature had gone down by the time we got to the hospital, so they just denied that it had been that high and told my mom &quot;You read the thermometer wrong. She has the flu. Go home.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Veterinarian here. Not sure why human docs are so against saying vaccines can cause a reaction, when that is exactly what they are intended to do. They are designed to stimulate your bodies natural defenses so that when you come into contact with the real pathogen your body is ready to fight it off. I&#39;ve treated patients for vaccine reactions. We generally dont vaccinate them for the one that caused the problem next go around. But the owners have to be aware that their pet is at an increased risk for the disease. Vaccines work and i believe in them. They absolutely do more good than harm. But they can cause adverse side effects. Just need to be dealt with in a case by case basis. </p>

<p>It&#39;s one of the biggest reasons that I actually became suspicious of vaccinations. When anyone we talked to acted like we should be banished or executed for asking questions about the vaccines that might have caused my sister to get sick, it was a red flag for me. Why is the reaction so violent? The PR campaign against &quot;anti-vaxxers&quot; is so effective that it ostracizes anyone who thinks vaccines ever do any small amount of harm to anyone.</p>

She has not had any vaccinations since then though, and now that I&#39;ve done research I probably would have given my 2 year old fewer vaccines (skipping some less effective or more risky ones) and more slowly. Luckily she did not have any adverse reactions that I can see.</p>

There are a few that I don&#39;t think are as necessary for everyone as they say, others that I think should be given around the time kids start school rather than years earlier, and others that cause adverse reactions in more than their share of patients - those patients should be given the option to delay other vaccines after a reaction and to get vaccines one at a time. If your kid gets 4 shots on the same day, then has some kind of severe side effect, how will you know which one it was?

<p>I remember earlier this year in a WorldNews posting about vaccinations that a redditor said to me that if I don&#39;t get a mandatory vaccination then I&#39;ll ruin it for everyone else. I was like &quot;What!? How could I ruin it for everyone else?&quot; </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t understand the explanation that he (she?) said to me, but then that redditor just wailed into me with insults and drivel. At one point another redditor said I deserved to die. I was pretty saddened by the comment. </p>

<p>So just because I don&#39;t get a shot, and everyone else in my office gets a shot, then <strong><em>I&#39;m</em></strong> going to ruin it for everyone else??? If my colleagues at work think I&#39;m such an idiot (overhead from a friend that one of co-workers said that I deserve the Darwin Award), then shouldn&#39;t he (they) be happy if I croak by <strong><em>not</em></strong> taking a shot? Not that I want to die, but wouldn&#39;t my anti-bodies do their best to fight off whatever Mother Nature throws at me, so that I can become stronger?</p>

<p>After informing them that I have not vaccinated my child (who is now 2 years old with no ailments/diseases etc) they said that my child should be taken away from me and I should be killed (because I&#39;m a baby killer).  Guilty till proven innocent these days.</p>

<p>Funny thing is, I&#39;ve most likely done 10x the amount of research then many of these parrots regurgitating orthodoxy have.  Vaccines (and GMOs etc) use the same strategies that the Tobacco industry used decades ago (there&#39;s a reason it&#39;s called Tobacco science), cherry-picking studies, white-washing or removing those with adverse reactions from the study etc .  Remember asbestos, led in paint and DDT in our food?

<p>I feel relieved when I know I&#39;m not alone against the mob of pro-vaccers. That&#39;s why I hardly post on the WorldNews subreddit when it comes to that topic because all I see are 99% of pro-Vs downvoting anyone who goes against the grain. It&#39;s like there are these paid marketing firms who&#39;ve hired tons of grade A assholes just to troll, taunt, belittle, and mock those who are just asking legitimate and concerned questions about what the hell are they putting in those needles. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t had a flu shot in ages (maybe last one I had to take due to work was about in 2006, but I&#39;ve declined all the rest). Yeah, sure, every year I get the flu, but I get some sleep, drink lots of fluids, and within a week I&#39;m alright. That&#39;s how we&#39;ve been surviving all these centuries, right? I know science is important, and I love science, but sometimes I feel like &quot;Whoa, hold on a second there, for how long have you tested this vaccine for, and what&#39;s in it?&quot; Is that such a bad question? Well, like I said, one guy said I don&#39;t deserve to be on Earth any more, and a colleague at work was overhead saying that I deserve the &#39;Darwin Award&#39; (meaning that I deserve to die-off). :( </p>

<p>It really makes my stomach churn (or tighten up in a knot) when someone online says that I deserve to die because &quot;I&#39;m ruining it for everyone&quot;. Like, I never wish ill-will upon anyone (I&#39;ll get angry, but we&#39;re human), but to wish me to die?!?  What the heck did I do to them?? </p>

<p>I&#39;m so glad I discovered this subreddit. I&#39;m not saying that I believe everything mentioned in this forum, but at least a lot of people here are open to discussion without downvoting others to oblivion, or wishing ill-willl to others just because they&#39;re asking a question or two. </p>

<p>I also remember last year there was this thread topic about France considering banning Monsanto&#39;s office (I think), and the majority of the people posting were saying France deserved to starve to death, or let all the crops die out thanks to their stupidity. Like, what??? France has a concern with Monsanto&#39;s GMOs, but why wish them ill-health or ill-will? </p>

<p>I believe I read a news story about one of the States over here that wanted all food products in supermarkets to be labelled GMO or non-GMO (in the News subreddit), and what surprised me there too was that anyone who applauded the effort by the legislature were downvoted. Wow, it&#39;s like there&#39;s an army of marketers or lobbyists on here. :( </p>

<p>Someone or some companies are really really trying to subvert the sway of the conversation through the use of these paid shills. Particularly when people are downvoted their comments aren&#39;t so easily seen or picked up on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The other thing you could do when talking about vaccines with people who don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about is ask them why, in their opinion, it&#39;s necessary for vaccines to contain aborted fetal DNA, aluminum, mercury, formaldehyde, methanol, ethanol, anti-freeze, and dozens of other known toxins.  Ask them why, in their opinion, it&#39;s ever necessary for a newborn to be vaccinated for hepatitis.  If you ask these questions in person, watch as they stutter and stammer and struggle to come up with a reply, or watch them try to quickly change the subject.  The simple fact when it comes to vaccines is that people believe what they&#39;re told unquestioningly, they believe &quot;science&quot; has proven their safety and effectiveness.  Meanwhile we continue to inject toxic substances directly into the blood streams of babies and small children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit, aborted fetal DNA?? That&#39;s sick man... and kind of saddening. And mercury, aluminum, and all that other crap?? Fuck... </p>

<p>I can&#39;t wait until the next A-hole tries to shut me up. I&#39;ll just throw this back at him/her. Thanks again man. I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not alone on this topic. I totally agree with you about the herd mentality. My dad warned me many moons ago not to be a domesticated animal to the &quot;man&quot;, that I&#39;m to think on my own two feet, ask questions, and be allowed to do my own research and/or ask an expert&#39;s advice. </p>

<p>I truly fear a world where everyone just obeys and listens to the TV and just nods their head. I learned the hard way when I was young, by always arguing with my dad. I&#39;ve always regretted getting into arguments with him about certain topics that only now can be talked about more freely (false flags being the #1 thing that I couldn&#39;t fathom, but I do now). </p>

<p>Anyways, thank you for your help. Keep up the good fight my friend! Cheers! :)</p>

<p>Don&#39;t become one of them in a different light.  Take this info you&#39;ve been given and research it deeply yourself.  Build a growing knowledge within of this subject.  Adjuvants like aluminium is used to stimulate an immune response in the body to the site of the injection.  However, aluminium is extremely toxic and should never be injected into a human (same with the other ingredients listed previously).</p>

<p>You can start with a few lectures by people who used to be in medicine (like this kidney specialist) who then realize their patients are doing worse after certain vaccines: <a href="https://youtu.be/SFQQOv-Oi6U">https://youtu.be/SFQQOv-Oi6U</a></p>

<p>You can go for a documentary with many different professionals in their field being interviewed: <a href="https://youtu.be/lJGyN3gCsBg">https://youtu.be/lJGyN3gCsBg</a></p>

<p>Or you can look at actual papers and studies, for example these 30 studies with some damning evidence: <a href="http://healthimpactnews.com/2013/30-scientific-studies-showing-the-link-between-vaccines-and-autism/">http://healthimpactnews.com/2013/30-scientific-studies-showing-the-link-between-vaccines-and-autism/</a></p>

<p>If anyone says your sources are shit, don&#39;t let them be shit and check where all your information is coming from.  The above link may be from &quot;healthimpactnews.com&quot; but all (good) news sites have links that you can reference and look up yourself that bring you to the original source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yes, I try not to be too harsh or negative, but sometimes there horrible trolls really get to me. (sigh)  Like, I&#39;ve never seen such a divide before. I&#39;m trying to increase my knowledge base on the topic before I post or respond to people because my background is in electronics, not bio-medical R&amp;D related matters, but just learning about mercury or aluminum in these vaccines really scares the living daylights out of me. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll go see the videos you posted in your links. I&#39;m glad there are documentaries on YouTube to watch. :) 
I&#39;ll also go look at the papers/studies that you linked as well. And if anyone says the sources are crap, I&#39;ll just shoot back that <a href="https://i.imgur.com/HLde7j3.jpg"><strong>they only see what&#39;s on the TV and nod their heads like sheep until it&#39;s too late unfortunately.</strong></a> This was from the <a href="/r/Im14andthisisdeep">/r/Im14andthisisdeep</a> subreddit. </p>

<p>By the way, remember our brave armed forces who were forced to take those mandatory bio/chemical warfare shots during Gulf Wars 1 &amp; 2? Well, many of our brave men &amp; women came back with very crippling syndromes that no one could pinpoint (other than it being PTSD which is like paint-brushing the entire affair down to stress). One thing I read online was that one scientist found traces of insect-repellent (insect poison?) in one of the many shots army and navy had to take (interesting I couldn&#39;t find any documentation about mandatory shots for pilots, but that&#39;s for another topic). Imagine being ordered or told you have to take a shot because it&#39;ll protect you from bio or chemical warfare agents, but in the end it cripples you for life with extreme fatigue, nausea, lack of muscle strength, etc, etc, etc? Frightening. </p>

<p>And imagine one day &quot;the man&quot; says to all of us plebs &quot;You must take this shot for the good of the country!&quot; (with armed cops that look like soldiers with assault rifles in tow right behind the doctors &amp; nurses that are about to inject you &amp; me). I can see a revolution just happening on that alone! &gt;:(</p>

<p>And many of these companies are in other countries, not just in USA.  So it&#39;s unlikely to be some conspiracy among them.  Hard to see companies in a country run by Putin or Castro or China going along with some capitalist conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So one former editor of one journal has this opinion, and you call that proof?</p>

<p>Surely you have actual data to prove your point, rather than an argument from (one former) authority? It would be easy to show that studies are wrong by reproducing their methods and getting different results, repeatedly. People keep trying and failing to show that GMOs in general are harmful, even scientists being paid by anti-GMO folks.</p>

<p>Some caution is appropriate, as with any incredibly powerful tool, but there is no reason to go nuts and treat them all as toxic or dangerous. All this publicity and back and forth is suspicious, I think we agree, but I think we&#39;re being led to be outraged over GMOs so that we don&#39;t notice something else. </p>

<p>Believe what you want, just make sure you keep questioning. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, I see. You&#39;ve confused Monsanto with all GMOs. Everyone does that nowadays. </p>

<p>Of course unscrupulous people will use powerful tools to bad ends. You can kill someone with a shovel, but it doesn&#39;t make the shovel a bad thing in and of itself. </p>

<p>Same with GMOs. I&#39;m not against reasonable industry regulations. I&#39;m just sick of people trying to ban it or label it broadly. There&#39;s a huge difference between roundup-ready and something like golden rice. </p>

<p>There is no inherent danger to GMOs. They can be misused like anything useful.</p>

<p>Edit: The study that used a tiny number of tumor mice? The one that fed them nothing but corn and roundup? That was the most poorly designed study ever. </p>

<p>First, they used mice that are bred to grow tumors, and not enough of them. In college, I lived with a girl in charge of a mouse lab, so I already knew most of those highly priced inbred mice are always developing tumors. </p>

<p>Who eats only corn and that much roundup? No one outside of a study. Normal people eat a variety of foods, and wash their food.</p>

<p>This had two variables at the same time: the herbicide and the genetic modification. Even if the rest of the study had been designed perfectly, that would be a problem because you&#39;d have no way to know which one caused it, or if it was only in combination, or what.</p>

<p>I have no idea how anyone approved the study in the first place. Someone should&#39;ve pointed out these flaws much earlier. Maybe that&#39;s where your concern may be justified? Set up to fail? Doesn&#39;t explain away all the other positive studies, though.</p>

<p>Endangering the natural rice diversity of India (or any nation) threatens their food safety.  Golden Rice might be owned by Syngenta but &quot;the leader of the Golden Rice project is Gerald Barry, previously director of research at Monsanto.&quot;  If there were to be a pest or disease that found a weakness in Golden Rice, then the majority of rice fields would be lost.  When one has diversity, such catastrophes can be prevented.  Also, even beyond the fact that GMO food is toxic on many levels over extended periods of time, the Round Up Ready herbicide is still used (and at extreme amounts compared to normal, non-GMO fields: <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/bethhoffman/2013/07/02/gmo-crops-mean-more-herbicide-not-less/">http://www.forbes.com/sites/bethhoffman/2013/07/02/gmo-crops-mean-more-herbicide-not-less/</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>total volume of glyphosate applied to the three biggest GE crops — corn, cotton and soybeans — increased 10-fold from 15 million pounds in 1996 to 159 million pounds in 2012.</strong>”  Overall pesticide use decreased only in the first few years GE crops were used (42 percent between 1998 and 2001) and has since then risen by 26 percent from 2001 to 2010.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, the chemical warfare agent they are using is known to cause birth defects and other (side) effects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Adding to the risks of GE crops is Monsanto&#39;s Roundup, the world&#39;s best-selling herbicide that is made to be partnered with GE Roundup Ready crops. According to a new report, <strong>regulators have known for years that Roundup causes birth defects.</strong></p>

<p>Regulators were apparently aware as long ago as 1980 that glyphosate, the active chemical ingredient of Roundup, caused birth defects in lab animals. However, the information was not made public. Instead, regulators misled the public about glyphosate&#39;s safety.</p>

<p>Adding vitamins to foods to help supplement those nutrients they may be lacking in a diet might be a good idea... EXCEPT there are over a dozen better LOCAL plants that provide the vitamins they seem to be missing in their diet.  Golden rice just has beta-carotene, which our body converts into Vit A.  This isn&#39;t a hard vitamin to find... beta-carotene is in carrots, sweet potatoes, dark green leafy vegetables, red peppers, squash, cantaloupe, apricots, peas, broccoli.   You don&#39;t need to go and mess with a plant on a genetic level, then spray it with tons of toxic shit (hurting the consumers and the environment).  We have a Vit D deficiency in America, but we don&#39;t need to stuff corn or soy with it.  We can inform people on what foods to eat.  It&#39;s a lifestyle/diet problem.  Americans have shit diets, period.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>GMOs don&#39;t decrease genetic diversity. Hybrids, I can see that being a valid argument. But a process by which you change or add genetic material is not going to lead to less diversity unless you choose to do so. No one&#39;s being forced to grow only one crop by the existence of GMOs. Maybe by politics, but not due to genetic modification.</p>

<p>If people had healthy local crops, no one would be starving, especially in rural areas. Your argument is the same old first world centered viewpoint. For people who are starving right now, they don&#39;t have the luxury of worrying about far distant future problems that may well not come true. They also have the right to choose other crops, same as us first world people.</p>

<p>Finally, you are still conflating Monsanto, roundup, and GMOs. When you have a peer reviewed study that shows the process of making any GMO causes health problems, I&#39;ll consider it carefully. I am not debating the toxicity of most herbicides. You can quit showing me studies on glyphosate or whatnot, as that&#39;s just a straw man and irrelevant to the safety of GMOs.</p>

<p>Personally, I can&#39;t wait for GMOs to be more widespread. As soon as it&#39;s available for the home gardener, I&#39;m getting some. I really hope they find a way of using plants to help with energy problems, such as glowing plants instead of electrical lights. I&#39;m also looking forward to resurrected endangered and extinct species. </p>

<p>And let&#39;s not forget the things they already are working on, like plants that need less water or food. Somehow there are no negative studies about Droughtguard, or whatever the drought tolerant plants are called.</p>

<p>Well, I hope you don&#39;t eat corn. It doesn&#39;t exist in nature. The only difference is that it was made with time and random chance, instead of by a trained professional. (Like monkeys on typewriters instead of Shakespeare.) In fact, it&#39;s the best proof I&#39;ve ever found that man made plants are unhealthy. Too bad so many anti-GMO people are quick to deny it&#39;s man made and claim it&#39;s magically different from other man made plants by virtue of not having a lab around the creators.</p>

<p>I hope you keep considering the evidence. Just please remember that judging GMOs by Monsanto&#39;s actions is like basing your opinion of a country&#39;s people on chats with max security prisoners. You can&#39;t judge something by what the worst do with it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry to hear you think so much progress is unnecessary. I also find a lot of things in this world unnecessary and harmful to society, such as religion, personal vehicles, TV, style, etc. We both just have to accept that others have different needs than us, and sometimes what we see as harmful, others do not. All the proof in the world won&#39;t make most Americans give up their selfish cars, and let&#39;s not even get started on religion! It&#39;s just part of living in a society, I guess, to have to put up with these things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s get one thing straight.  Selective breeding (for traits such as cold resistance, later/bigger yields etc) is completely fine.  This has been done for ages.  Genetically Modified Organisms are a different breed.  They alter the genetic make-up so it is resistant to the herbicide used on it - by placing the toxin within the plant on a genetic level, so that every bite has the toxin laced within.  These are completely different concepts and methods to achieve their desired goals.    Quit your nonsense.  Comparing GMO&#39;s and selective breeding is a false argument as they are proven to be different on multiple levels; from conception, execution and final (un)intended results.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In relation to the use of a common GMO crop, i.e. &quot;roundup ready canola&quot; the simple answer to this question is yes! Plant biodiversity &amp; soil biological diversity will be negatively affected. 
Evidence has previously shown that some plant families including Brassicas, Beets &amp; Amaranths are non-hosts for obligate biotrophic symbionts including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Monocultural crop rotations of such non-host plants are in turn likely to negatively affect AMF biodiversity &amp; thus the potential for mutually beneficial effects of this ubiquitous plant &amp; fungal partnership, see:
Ocampo JA, Hayman DS, 1981. Influence of plant interactions on vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal infections. II. Crop rotations and residual effects of non-host plants. New Phytologist 87: 333-343. 
Karasawa T, Arihara J, Kasahara Y, 2000. Effects of previous crops on arbuscular mycorrhizal formation and growth of maize under various soil moisture conditions Soil Science &amp; Plant Nutrituion. 46: 53-60.
It can therefore be hypothesised &amp; may be easily tested that the blanket use of glyphosate herbicides for weed management in roundup-resisitant brassica crops will be likely to increase the monocultural effects by removing weeds as potential host plant partners of AMF.
Has this hypothesis been tested yet? Unfortunately not yet! 
Why not? Try asking Monsanto for permission to conduct such research, ... not as easy as it may seem! 
What other biodiversity effects are likely to result from subsequent decline on AMF populations &amp; biodiversity? 
Subsequent crop rotations that are host plants of AMF are less likely to be able to benefit from the effects of AMF symbioses,, i.e. improved phosphate uptake, increased plant drought tolerance, improved soil aggregation, improved soil drainage &amp; aeration, &amp; improved plant disease resistance. Thus it is further hypothesised that subsequent crop &amp; weed plant biodiversity will be negatively affected by decreased AMF biodiversity following the use of glyphosate for &#39;roundup-ready canola. 
Will the subsequent &amp; necessary use of increased inputs of P fertilisers remedy or mitigate against effects on AMF biodiversity or plant biodiversity. Not likely! Chemical fertilsers only feed plant nutrient requirements. In the absence of suitable plant hosts AMF populations decline. 
In addition to the effects of vegetation clearance by widespread use of chemical herbicides, intensive soil disturbance tillage practices are also known to decrease AMF populations &amp; biodiversity. 
In summary, GMO crops merely continue to &amp; may accelerate or add to the ecologically detrimental effects of intensive vegetation clearance &amp; soil disturbance on soil &amp; plant biodiversity &amp; ecological functions. 
Unfortunately we haven&#39;t yet acknowledged our predominant ignorance about the unintended effects that we humans can cause during crop production.</p>

<p>I am not confusing all GMOs with Monsanto.  I am telling you that the Golden Rice (owned by <strong>Syngenta</strong>) uses dangerous herbicides (at higher levels than other growing operations).  I informed you, that the person in charge of pushing Golden Rice &quot;<em>is Gerald Barry, previously director of research at Monsanto.</em>&quot;  I am not confusing anything at all here.  I am clear and concise with the words I&#39;m using.  Golden Rice uses glyphosate as an herbicide, otherwise known as RoundUp Ready, owned by Monsanto.  </p>

<p>I have NOTHING against progress nor have I said anything to the contrary.  I&#39;m sorry you think that we shouldn&#39;t have ONE (if not thousands) of [gold standard] <strong>LONG-TERM</strong>, PEER-REVIEWED, DOUBLE-BLIND studies performed by scientists with no attachments to the industry on GMO&#39;s and their toxins used with them.  Their excuse that their seeds/chemicals are proprietary information is bullshit, because they know what the scientists will find when done outside their lab.  I&#39;m including, not only the genetically modified organism, but the herbicide used in tandem with it.  I&#39;m talking about studies on humans, long-term, studies on the surrounding biome, long-term, I&#39;m talking about this and so much more.  If it&#39;s so safe, why not let others test it, LONG-TERM.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How conveniently you ignore one of my main criticisms: you conflate GMOs and pesticides every single time. You cannot do that and expect anyone other than a moron to fall for it. It&#39;s completely irrelevant to the issue at hand, which is the safety of GMOs for human consumption. Pesticides, herbicides, and GMOs are separate issues. The first two, I repeat again, we agree are not great. But there is no reason to assume they always go hand in hand, particularly for GMOs that don&#39;t touch related genes at all.</p>

<p>Also, enough BS about natural vs lab. That means nothing, considering those &quot;natural&quot; techniques are all blunt versions of what happens in the lab. Conventional hybrids are dangerously inbred. Other &quot;conventional&quot; and &quot;natural&quot; techniques include using mutagens aka carcinogens, that also results in more bad than good. Waste of time and resources. I greatly prefer an intelligent person controlling it, and to not waste water and resources growing completely unnecessary fields of genetically defective plants. I can&#39;t think of a single benefit to doing things &quot;naturally,&quot; come to think of it. </p>

<p>Gee, do you think the huge seed and crop industry might have something to do with all the anti-GMO propaganda?</p>

<p>Nothing is stopping scientists both public and private from studying GMOs long term. Make your own GMOs and study them long term. To demand someone else give you the result of their hard work, in hopes of discrediting it, after having already had tumor-rat-guy release his poorly designed, biased nonsense, is not the best idea. I can&#39;t blame them for saying no after that poor excuse for a study. But as I said, it doesn&#39;t matter, because there is no need to have any specific GMO to see if they&#39;re generally safe long term.</p>

<p>I suggest you look into that huge meta-study from this last summer. Looking at an assessment of all the studies is much more accurate than cherry-picking those that happen to echo your thoughts. Any single study can be wrong for many reasons, many of which are no one&#39;s fault, but all the thousands agreeing are unlikely to be wrong.</p>

<p>(As an aside, I had my hopes crushed one of the first times I learned about meta-studies. I wanted that ALH Martian meteorite to have life in it, dammit!)</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m moving on now. Important things to do and all that. Have a good whatever-time-of-day!</p>

<p><strong>Wrong</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>science shows that live-virus vaccines like MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) actually shed for weeks, and sometimes months, following vaccination.</p>

<p>This means that children who were recently injected with MMR, oral polio vaccine and/or other live attenuated vaccines (LAV) are walking disease-carriers.</p>

<p>Johns Hopkins Hospital, for instance, warns about vaccine shedding in its official Patient Guide, urging the immunocompromised to &quot;[a]void contact with children who are recently vaccinated.&quot; Why? Because the recently vaccinated can, and often do, spread vaccine-derived viruses capable of killing children with weak immune systems.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell friends and family who are sick, or have recently had a live vaccine (such as chicken pox, measles, rubella, intranasal influenza, polio or smallpox) not to visit,&quot; explains the guide.</p>

<p>Besides the fact that countless disease outbreaks have occurred <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/048643_measles_MMR_vaccine_immunization.html">in fully vaccinated communities</a> -- and in some cases within populations <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/046085_whooping_cough_child_vaccinations_immune_system.html">where more than 95% of individuals were fully vaccinated</a>, which should have activated &quot;herd immunity&quot; status (according to the official story) -- it simply can&#39;t be proven that unvaccinated children are responsible for provoking the Disneyland measles outbreak.  <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/048940_measles_outbreak_virus_shedding_Disneyland.html">http://www.naturalnews.com/048940_measles_outbreak_virus_shedding_Disneyland.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re welcome!  The &#39;wishing to die&#39; people are certainly the last ones to take advice from, they are obviously twisted in the head to be wishing people to die, no wonder they are pushing vaccines if they want people to die.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry though, they are not the general public, on Reddit there are swarms of paid pro-vaccine posters, they&#39;ve all be trained, they have many &#39;party lines&#39;, you&#39;ll learn to recognize them real quick.  Even when you&#39;ve won the debate they pretend that you haven&#39;t, if they really believed they were in the right they wouldn&#39;t have to lie so much and pull stunts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. So if vaccines are as harmful as some people think, it will never be acknowledged by the government or by those who assisted with the cover up. Those who trust only the official sources never realize when the official sources are wrong, since they don&#39;t admit it, and to them it seems that the official sources are never wrong.</p>

<p>EDIT: You keep acting like I said that lack of evidence in the mainstream media is evidence of a cover-up. It&#39;s not. If there is a cover-up of something, there will be a lack of evidence in the media, because that&#39;s what a cover-up is. If someone says &quot;I&#39;ve never seen a story in the media that says Obama is secretly a Buddhist Chinese woman, so he must be a Buddhist Chinese woman&quot;, that&#39;s fucking ridiculous. If someone says they&#39;ve been convinced by the &quot;evidence&quot; that Obama is secretly a Muslim and was born in Africa, and they point to the media&#39;s derisive and dismissive coverage of the claims as one of their points of evidence, that&#39;s acceptable.</p>

<p>And how would you suppose handling spurious claims made by idiots? For example, let&#39;s say a writer on infowars starts posting about meeting aliens in person. Does the fact that this story isn&#39;t carried in the main stream media but is carried on his infowars blog mean it must be happening and it&#39;s being covered up? There&#39;s a level at which incredulity is a sign of stupidity. </p>

If you have a specific question about a claim you think I&#39;m making, go ahead and ask it. </p>

<p>Here are a few books I&#39;ve been perusing lately in case you&#39;d like to get some arguments together about how they&#39;re written by quacks or liars and all their sources are bogus:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vaccination-Voodoo-What-About-Vaccines/dp/1484923820/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1443213143&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=vaccine+voodoo">Vaccination Voodoo</a> (This one has a lot of good information, for example about animal viruses in vaccines and about reproductive problems due to some vaccines, but is very alarmist and not really my style. Some of their &quot;evidence&quot; is not as convincing as other pieces to say the least.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vaccination-Voodoo-What-About-Vaccines/dp/1484923820/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1443213143&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=vaccine+voodoo">How to Raise a Healthy Child in Spite of Your Doctor</a> (Somewhat outdated but sheds light on a lot of the issues that have plagued vaccines since the beginning.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vaccine-Epidemic-Corporate-Coercive-Government/dp/1620872129/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1443213395&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=vaccine+whistleblower">Vaccine Epidemic</a> (I&#39;m really enjoying this one, much less scare-mongery than the usual for its genre, very well supported with references.)</p>

<p>I have no clue how you got from the first half of that sentence to the second. I&#39;ll try again. If something happens and it&#39;s not mentioned in any mainstream media sources, it still happened. If I told you my neighbor ran over my dog yesterday, do you say &quot;Well I didn&#39;t see that on the news, so obviously it didn&#39;t happen.&quot;? Of course not. People who trust in the officially sanctioned/controlled media can and do use absence from the public eye as evidence that something is &quot;absolutely untrue&quot; or &quot;proven&quot; not to have happened. It&#39;s illogical, just as illogical as the idea you&#39;re trying to ascribe to me, that lack of evidence is in itself evidence of a cover-up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for taking the time to research all of this. I recall back in 2005, I was forced to sign a consent form to be vaccinated for small pox and something else in order to deploy. The form essentially outlined the potential dangers of the vaccines, one of which was an increased likelihood of having offspring with birth defects. We had no say in the matter and had to comply because we were property of the U.S. military. Oddly enough, I was switched out a week before that deployment was underway.</p>

<p>I did eventually deploy to Iraq, and the base that I was on burned ALL of their trash on the installation. Now anyone with a modicum of common sense would know inhaling that stuff is bad for you, but we were briefed and informed that scientists claimed it was safe. Then months after being back home, we were hearing news about people getting sick from burn pits, but the illnesses had some sort of delayed manifestation. Some people became asthmatic, while others had severe respiratory problems. And when it comes to the military investigating disability claims, they lie their asses off to avoid paying their damaged goods. The VA refused to pay my Dad for years because they wouldn&#39;t admit that Desert Storm Syndrome was real. My Dad didn&#39;t get shit until 2012.</p>

Your goal was to make it appear like you provided a source when in actuality you have no reputable source for such a claim.  The medium you are referring to is used to produce the attenuated viruses.  None of it makes it into the vaccine and if it did it would be fully attenuated and no longer viable DNA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basic vaccine and cell line science</p>

<p>The vaccine process works by collecting samples of the actual virus, then growing and altering them in the laboratory to make a weakened strain of the disease. The weakened strain is put into a serum and administered into the body (usually by injection). The body’s immune system is more capable of attacking and destroying the weakened virus, and thus develops the ability to effectively fight off the actual disease should the person ever be exposed to it. The advent of vaccines was a major milestone in medicine, saving millions of lives and saving many others from the devastating effects of diseases like polio and diphtheria. </p>

<p>In order to develop the weakened viral strain, there must be a medium or “cell culture” to grow it in. The virus invades the culture cells, feeds off the cell, matures, and multiplies. The cell cultures are a single type of cell that multiplies itself in a predictable fashion and can be sustained in a laboratory setting for years, even decades. These long-lasting cell cultures are called “cell lines.” The original cells that start these cell lines have been taken from a wide variety of sources, from monkey embryo and kidney cells, to chicken and rabbit embryos, and tragically, from aborted human babies.</p>

<p>The issue of concern is that many common vaccines were developed using cell lines that originally were cells taken from electively aborted babies. The vaccines themselves do not contain fetal cells, but there are significant “residual” biological components from the fetal cells that have been assimilated into the vaccine, including cell proteins and measurable portions of fetal DNA.</p>

<p>Cell lines originating from aborted babies</p>

<p>There are two particular fetal cell lines that have been heavily used in vaccine development. They are named according to the laboratory facilities where they were developed. One cell line is known as WI-38, developed at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, PA. The other is MRC-5, developed for the Medical Research Council in England. WI-38 was developed by Dr. Leonard Hayflick in 1962, by taking lung cells from an aborted female baby at approximately the end of the third month of pregnancy. Dr. Hayflick’s article published in the journal Experimental Cell Research states that three cell lines, WI-26, WI-38, WI-44 were all developed from aborted babies. “All embryos were obtained from surgical abortions and were of approximately three months’ gestation.”(1) Dr. Stanley Plotkin, who developed a Rubella vaccine using WI-38, addressed a question at an international conference as to the origin of WI-38. Dr. Plotkin stated: </p>

<p>“This fetus was chosen by Dr. Sven Gard, specifically for this purpose. Both parents are known, and unfortunately for the story, they are married to each other, still alive and well, and living in Stockholm, presumably. The abortion was done because they felt they had too many children. There were no familial diseases in the history of either parent, and no history of cancer specifically in the families.”(2)</p>

<p>The origin of the MCR-5 cell line, created in 1966, is documented in the journal Nature by three British researchers working at the National Institute for Medical Research. They wrote, “We have developed another strain of cells, also derived from foetal lung tissue, taken from a 14-week male foetus removed for psychiatric reasons from a 27 year old woman with a genetically normal family history and no sign of neoplastic disease both at abortion and for at least three years afterward.”(3) Noting that their research parallels that of Dr. Hayflick’s development of the WI-38 cell line, the researchers conclude, “Our studies indicate that by presently accepted criteria, MRC-5 cells—in common with WI-38 cells of similar origin—have normal characteristics and so could be used for the same purposes as WI-38 cells.”(4)</p>

<p>In both of these cell lines it is quite clear that the aborted children were presumed to be healthy, and that there was no life-threatening condition or other medically-indicated reason for the abortion of these two babies. </p>

<p>There is a more recent cell line, PER C6, developed in 1985, which is being used currently in research to develop vaccines to treat Ebola and HIV. The origin of PER C6 is clearly documented. In direct testimony before the Food and Drug Administration’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, Dr. Alex Van Der Eb, the scientist who developed PER C6, stated:</p>

<p>“So I isolated retina [cells] from a fetus, from a healthy fetus as far as could be seen, of 18 weeks old. There was nothing special in the family history, or the pregnancy was completely normal up to the 18 weeks, and it turned out to be a socially indicated abortus, abortus provocatus, and that was simply because the woman wanted to get rid of the fetus.”(5)</p>

<p>Currently several vaccines using the PER C6 cell line are in development. Undoubtedly the cells used to establish PER C6 came from a healthy baby, aborted from a healthy mother for social convenience reasons. While many of the common childhood vaccines used today were developed using the WI-38 and MRC-5 fetal cell lines, there are some vaccines available that were developed using animal cell lines. The tables on the following page indicate all U.S. abortion-tainted vaccines, and the available alternatives.</p>

<p>So, that would be false.
Sad this is from an antiabortion website, even they don&#39;t agree with you.</p>

<p>I suggested taking remedial science classes so you can understand the literature available,  specifically microbiology.
Or keep screaming that pepsi and vaccines have dead babies in them, I have to say it is a nice attempt to appeal to emotion.
Too bad I am a stoic observer who can not be swayed by this tactic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So all of that is saying that fetal DNA is used to make the virus, which is then used to make the vaccine.  So, there is fetal DNA in the vaccine.  This is really a very simple concept so it&#39;s funny watching you do backflips trying to deny it.</p>

<p>Here, read this line from your own copy-pasta:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The vaccines themselves do not contain fetal cells, <strong>but there are significant “residual” biological components from the fetal cells</strong> that have been assimilated into the vaccine, <strong>including cell proteins and measurable portions of fetal DNA</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or this: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The tables on the following page indicate all U.S. <strong>abortion-tainted vaccines</strong>, and the available alternatives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Abortion-tainted&quot; means that it contains fetal DNA.  Do you understand yet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK.  Say I am conducting an unethical experiment where the delivery is to children through vaccines.  I need two groups of large size that I can easily get follow-up data on.  That means the person delivering the vaccine has to be in on it.  It can&#39;t just be some random, grab whatever vial out of the box type of thing.  I could send a different box to different clinics, but at some point I&#39;d still need to collect the data from the clinics.  If this were truly massive, the best way to accomplish this would be town-wide.  Town A would get one set, Town B would get another.  Then one might not need individual records.  You could sit back and see how one town&#39;s kids were different from another town.  Plus side, secrecy.  Down side, absolutely no way to evaluate effects of other variables.  I just can&#39;t see a way to run any kind of effective study through vaccines on populace children.  The best research is always going to be on captive populations - the military, the prisons, the institutionalized, the disabled. </p>

<p>Of course, if the goal is an action, like sterilization, and not experimentation, vaccines would be the way to go.  Your pediatrician would still have to be in on it.</p>

<p>That link is laughable. He&#39;s pretty much just saying moulden is wrong just because. Not giving an actual reason, and making false arguments that moulden never made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should actually read it.  </p>

<p>For example: </p>

<p><em>Moulden Anoxia Spectrum Syndromes isn’t found in any medical textbook, and there is no evidence that Autism, Alzheimer’s, Gulf War Syndrome, food allergies and Shaken Baby Syndrome are at all causally related.</em></p>

<p><em>Besides, the term ‘anoxia’ is a medical term meaning ‘without oxygen’. Moulden is obviously suggesting that every one of those disparate conditions is fundamentally caused by a lack of oxygen to somewhere, and while his logic has many flaws, this is the fatal one. Food allergies are not related to lack of oxygen. Neither are reactions to the Gardasil vaccine. And we know that Autism is defined by structural and functional changes in the brain that occur in the womb, and can be detected as early as a month after birth [1].</em></p>

<p>Sounds like there&#39;s a lot more there than &#39;just because&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He says for example that allergies cannot be caused by impaired oxygen flow, which is true but that was never what moulden was claiming.</p>

<p>See the above in italics. Moulden claimed exactly that.</p>

<p>Either you&#39;re using a very different definition of &#39;damaged&#39; than everyone else uses, or you&#39;re not on the level. Autism isn&#39;t brain damage. Nothing is damaged. This is the way the brain develops due to the protein expression of the genes of the person and in concert with any environmental stimuli. This is similar to down syndrome. You wouldn&#39;t say someone with down syndrome is &#39;brain damaged&#39;. You would say they developed abnormally, which is the case with autists. </p>

<p>The FDA packing insert lists autism as a possible reaction on the dtap vaccine.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/UCM101580.pdf">http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/UCM101580.pdf</a></p>

<p>We are seeing parents with perfectly healthy children with normal levels of intelligence who have their kids vaccinated and literally overnight (within a few days) they regress to autism.</p>

<p>I guess it&#39;s just a coincidence that children happen to express these genes immediately following vaccination. Also a coincidence that autism is listed as a possible reaction on the dtap insert. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Adverse events reported during post-approval use of Tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS,
anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence
and apnea. Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting. Because these events are
reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to
establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine.</p>

<p>So because yahoos report that it causes autism they list it. They further state, this is not proved to be true. You should read things before you offer them up as evidence for your argument. </p>

<p>In unvaccinated children autism starts at about the same time. It is a developmental disorder. It manifests at approximately the same time for all children regardless of vaccination status. The fact that the vaccination schedule  occurs during this time is coincidence unless you can establish cause. Seeing as autism can be detected before vaccination as well I&#39;d suggest vaccination would not be the cause. Of course they&#39;ve done literally hundreds of studies on this, and they all agree that vaccines are safe, but don&#39;t let that stop you from endangering children.</p>

<p>Right, they only list it because random people reported autism. Legally speaking that would not be on the packing insert unless <strong>absolutely necessary</strong> and it would have to be statistically significant for that to be the case. To argue otherwise is either to be intentionally disingenuous or just ignorant of how the legality of these packing inserts works. If parents could report anything, that list would be three pages long.</p>

<p>This is just a straight up lie. The number is literally in the tens of thousands of parents who have kids who can walk at an early age and can (for example) say their abcs backwards, and then immediately following vaccination they regress to autism and fall back to crawling. That isn&#39;t a &quot;developmental disorder&quot; that is a physical change in the brain.</p>

<p>There is a reason over 83 cases have been proven in court and the government has MADE PAYOUTS TO PARENTS WHOSE KIDS DEVELOPED AUTISM AFTER VACCINATION.</p>

<p>If it was a mere developmental disorder and had no casual link this would not be observed.</p>

<p>The peer-reviewed study looked at cases of vaccine injury that have been monetarily compensated by the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.  It was published today in the Pace Environmental Law Review.  The study investigated approximately 1300 cases of childhood brain injury as a result of vaccines in which the Special Masters ruled for the plaintiffs, looking for references to autism, symptoms of autism or disorders commonly associated with autism. It reports that twenty-one cases actually stated &quot;autism or autism-like symptoms&quot; in the court records.  The researchers then identified and contacted 150 more compensated families to find out whether the children had autism.  They were able to find an additional 62 cases (greater than 40% of their sample) for a total of 83 cases of autism.  In 39 cases (47%) there was confirmation of autism beyond parental report.</p>

<p>It states the criterion for addition to the label. None of it requires evidence of such. Let&#39;s say you have 10,000 people call in a suspected cause of autism. They have to list it whether those claims are verified or not. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a scientific study. I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re offering it as such. This is a legal review that was published in a student journal. The question sheet was sent to 22 of 2500 cases where autism induced injury was claimed. That&#39;s... quite a small sample size and quite dubiously published. We&#39;ll look past that for now. There&#39;s the IRB  question, which shows this &#39;study&#39; is rather unethical in construction, we&#39;ll also look past this. </p>

<p>From the paper:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The authors began a research project with Pace Law School students to locate and analyze VICP cases assessing whether the VICP had in fact compensated vaccine-­induced brain damage, including autism, while perhaps not using that term specifically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s more than a little odd. On the next page:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The authors, with the assistance of Pace Law students, created a database of VICP published decisions that used relevant terms related to autism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm....</p>

<p>There are several critiques which point out the multitude of flaws with this article (not study). Here are a few that might be worth your review. </p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>The biggest problem with this work is the fact that they didn&#39;t use diagnostic criteria for autism. They looked for anything &#39;autism like&#39; and declared it autism. Considering the occupations of the authors and the manner in which they carried this work out, I&#39;d have to say this is not trustworthy. </p>

<p>The point still stands. Direct harm can and does occur from vaccines that leaves children permanently disabled/debilitated. Whether it&#39;s autism or not (which it probably is) is really besides the point of the problem, which is that vaccines often do cause permanent damage. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not how one would determine prevalence of damage. According to your document there are 25000 claims of damage, that&#39;s 25000/330,000,000 or 0.0007 percent. That&#39;s your chance of having an adverse reaction. Your chance of being struck by lightning in your lifetime would be 0.03 percent or 1 out of 3000.

<p>Admit what, autism? Never did that. I admitted there was an incredibly rare chance of adverse reaction, and I stated (and have now shown) that you&#39;re more likely to be struck by lightning. So what else do you have for me?</p>

<p>Peanut allergies were very rare until the 90s when they started using peanut oil as adjuvants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>interesting, however I&#39;d argue that really, none of this is surprising. Nor is it indicative that vaccines of any kind currently are being used for implicitly ill conceived reasons.</p>

<p>That aside, I don&#39;t feel like the government forcing parents that refuse their children vaccines to homeschool and keep them away from public areas would be doable or well received...</p>

<p>If anything I would say that to stop any harm causing vaccines may bring... One should utilize their time studying at the micro level and develop vaccines that are perfect... Which again is not possible. So really we are left with a choice, don&#39;t vaccinate because it may have a reaction (same choice we have when we take prescriptions or supplements or otc medicines), or do so and if it does accept that medicine really is a learning process for both the scientific community and ourselves. We&#39;ve either got to trust that there will be secret experiments done (whether government sanctioned or privately) or we trust that not getting vaccines will keep us safer?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll take vaccines and so will my children. Like I said very interesting but really nothing that should make someone jump to the conclusion that everything is a cover up of some trials for shady purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this. Other factors might easily include misdiagnosis, since autism is in the public eye now. My personal feeling is that many vaccine side effects which are documented include brain damage and may well cause the symptoms of autism. Some people take this as a semantic difference and say &quot;well then vaccines cause autism!&quot;, but I think it&#39;s actually a big difference. My fiance&#39;s son is autistic, my fiance has many symptoms himself but was never diagnosed, and my daughter has a few of the typical habits too. She&#39;s only two and she&#39;s very advanced verbally and physically so I&#39;m not worried about it. I don&#39;t believe that her symptoms were caused by her vaccines (she was vaccinated fully and on time, actually several of her shots were given to her early).</p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;m not ruling out the possibility of some environmental factors working to exacerbate genetic tendencies toward autism. Whether those things are or ever were in vaccines hasn&#39;t been demonstrated, and really there are a lot of other places to look.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that if one researcher, who works for the CDC (one of the foremost &quot;authorities&quot; on vaccine safety and effectiveness), whose work was respected and used to prove vaccines safe - if this guy is proven to have falsified data and lied to the public, then it stands to reason that other scientists could&#39;ve done the same thing.</p>

<p>Says you.  I say that when we&#39;re looking at the safety of a medical treatment or procedure that&#39;s being given to infants, it doesn&#39;t really matter if the infant is a day old or a month old - they&#39;re still a fucking infant and they deserve to be protected and kept safe as much as possible.</p>

<p>Do you disagree?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Actually no.  You said that &quot;just about every study stating vaccines are safe and effective is repeatable.&quot;.  Well, at least one of these studies is a proven fraud - so it stands to reason that others could be as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He was a psychologist for the CDC, not an epidemiologist, check your facts.</p>

<p>In his work with the CDC, and in his work studying vaccines, he was obviously an <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O44rjiMAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en">epidemiologist</a>.  His work on psychology is irrelevant here as he clearly was an authority on epidemiology, read some of the other studies about vaccines he was involved with if you doubt that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anti-vax: someone who questions or disputes the safety and efficacy of current vaccination practices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So no one is even allowed to <em>question</em> whether vaccines are safe and/or effective?  We have to just accept that they are and if we ask any questions we&#39;re automatically an &quot;anti-vaxxer&quot;?  What world are you living in where science isn&#39;t allowed to be questioned?  That&#39;s kinda the entire point of it...</p>

<p>By ignoring the mountains of evidence showing safety and efficacy you&#39;re putting children at risk. This may be simply because you&#39;re ignorant of said evidence, and that would be your doing assuming you&#39;re genuinely interested int he topic as opposed to being a member of a community that holds &#39;begging the question&#39; to be a central ideal.

<p>The failure of one person to properly perform research outside their field of expertise is not corruption. For you to ignore the multitude of papers, (that at this point I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t go looking for) is denial of evidence. Begging the question, as you are doing, without looking for the already existing answers and data you&#39;re asking about is willful ignorance. </p>

<p>You need to learn the definitions of words again because your understanding is lacking here, again.</p>

<p>falsify (v): alter (information or evidence) so as to mislead</p>

<p>Omitting data points is altering information or evidence so as to mislead.  This is obvious if you know the definition of the word.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do, which is why we as a society have an established testing regime for vaccinations.</p>

<p>And we also have studies conducted by the CDC that are fraudulent.  This isn&#39;t an either/or, all or nothing thing so I don&#39;t know why you keep trying to make it that.  It&#39;s possible for certain vaccines to be safe and effective and others to not be, it&#39;s possible for certain studies to be scientific and accurate and other ones to be fraudulent.  Do you get that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You like to play fast and loose with words.  Again, the study wasn&#39;t a &#39;fraud&#39;, it was in error.</p>

<p>And you like to selectively ignore definitions.  What the CDC and Thompson did, in this case, is fraud by definition.  Your inability to comprehend what the word means doesn&#39;t make this any less true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Further, I did say &#39;just about&#39;, implying the majority and not all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah, there we go.  So if some studies aren&#39;t repeatable, and some studies are fraudulent (oh sorry, you don&#39;t like that word - call them &quot;inaccurate&quot; then), then why is it wrong to ask questions and look into whether there are issues with some of the other studies?  Why is it a good thing to just assume pharmaceutical companies and the government have humanity&#39;s best interests in mind 100% of the time in all cases?</p>

<p>Seems a pretty stupid and naive mindset to have to me, did you even read this OP about all of the unethical, terrible shit the US government has done over the years?</p>

<p>And you like to selectively ignore definitions. What the CDC and Thompson did, in this case, is fraud by definition. Your inability to comprehend what the word means doesn&#39;t make this any less true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fraud requires intent, otherwise every mistake one makes is &#39;fraud&#39; in your world. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So if some studies aren&#39;t repeatable, and some studies are fraudulent (oh sorry, you don&#39;t like that word - call them &quot;inaccurate&quot; then), then why is it wrong to ask questions and look into whether there are issues with some of the other studies?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said it was wrong to ask questions and look into things. Of course, if you&#39;re going to look into things, I&#39;d recommend you actually look into them as opposed to sit on reddit and assume that the entire medical establishment is corrupt and perpetrating fraud.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems a pretty stupid and naive mindset to have to me, did you even read this OP about all of the unethical, terrible shit the US government has done over the years?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See what I mean? Sometimes bad shit happens, so you imply that bad shit always happens. You&#39;re not questioning, you&#39;re begging the question. Look them up, they&#39;ve very different. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Deliver it. Your citing of Thompson as such is not fraud or corruption. It&#39;s a researcher&#39;s error.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Researcher&#39;s error&quot;.  You clearly have never even read his statement, or you have and you&#39;re just a dishonest person.  Here is what he actually said, and I&#39;ll bold the relevant part to make it clear how wrong you are:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My name is William Thompson.  I am a Senior Scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, where I have worked since 1998.</p>

<p>I regret that <strong>my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information</strong> in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased  risk for autism. <strong>Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected</strong>, and I believe that <strong>the final study protocol was not followed</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now do you get it?  &quot;Researcher&#39;s error&quot;.  L fucking ol.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you prefer I can assert you&#39;re a liar or incompetent in your research efforts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well you&#39;ve been implying it all along so what&#39;s really the difference friend?  In fact you come off even more douchey and condescending by pussy-footing around it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He admitted that he omitted relevant data. That is not falsification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s the definition for you again.</p>

<p>falsify (n): to make (something) false/to change (something) in order to make people believe something that is not true</p>

<p>In the case of this study, the relevant data omitted suggested an increased rate of autism among certain members of the vaccinated population.  By omitting this data, the study led people to believe something that wasn&#39;t true (that the rates of autism were <em>not</em> increased).  This is falsification by definition.  Again, just because you don&#39;t, can&#39;t, or won&#39;t understand that doesn&#39;t make it any less true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Except neither was done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll quote it again: &quot;<strong>I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information</strong> in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. <strong>The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism</strong>. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that <strong>the final study protocol was not followed</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Get it yet?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Misleading requires intention. According to Thompson he had no such intention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Thompson, and I&#39;ll quote him again, &quot;Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Decisions were made</strong>.  That&#39;s what we call &quot;intention&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re assuming the CDC is corrupt and commit fraud based on one researcher&#39;s work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I&#39;m saying that there might be other instances of corruption if there&#39;s one proven one.  I&#39;m not saying the entirety of the CDC and everyone who works for it are corrupt.  You, again, are putting words in my mouth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fraud requires intent, otherwise every mistake one makes is &#39;fraud&#39; in your world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Should I quote him again?  Okay, I will.</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>Decisions were made</strong> regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that <strong>the final study protocol was not followed</strong>.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never said it was wrong to ask questions and look into things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You said asking questions about vaccine efficacy and safety automatically makes one an &quot;anti-vaxxer&quot;.  I&#39;m assuming that you don&#39;t consider &quot;anti-vaxxer&quot; a compliment so yes, you did say it was wrong to question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes bad shit happens, so you imply that bad shit always happens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But in your world it&#39;s &quot;sometimes bad shit happens, but it was only that one time and it would never ever ever ever happen again under any circumstances&quot;?  Sounds legit.</p>

<p>Nope, I made my usage rather clear throughout our conversation. You asked for a definition, I delivered it and made adjustments. Just like each other piece of &#39;evidence&#39; you&#39;ve supplied, you&#39;ve dropped the adjustments. You act a lot like a biblical literalist.</p>

<p>What adjustments are you referring to?  You gave me a definition which said anyone who questions vaccine safety and efficacy is an anti-vaxxer.

<p>You&#39;re very bad at reading. I made it quite clear someone who adheres to that definition has to satisfy the additional criteria of being willfully ignorant when presented with contrary claims, and refuse to evaluate them.

<p>So I&#39;m not quite sure what you are trying to say. However, it doesn&#39;t alter or in any way negate the article&#39;s conclusion: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What got lost in the brouhaha over Dr. Thompson&#39;s &quot;confession,&quot; allegations about a &quot;cover-up&quot; at the CDC, and threats of whistleblower lawsuits was what should have been the main point: Did collected data actually prove that the MMR vaccine produces a 340% increased risk of autism in African-American boys? The answer is no, it did not.</p>

<p>I agree with this to a point. To refuse to vaccinate is your choice, however, as your choice impacts the health of everyone&#39;s children, society has the right to limit your access to the rest of the herd if you forgo herd immunity. Do you disagree?</p>

<p>but the line has to be drawn at making them mandatory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m really tempted to agree with you because I can certainly see the logic in this. But I thought a little bit deeper and two problems refuse to leave me alone.</p>

<p>A) If children aren&#39;t vaccinated and they catch a major disease, they&#39;re going to pass it on to everyone else who isn&#39;t vaccinated.</p>

<p>B) If vaccinations become voluntary then who will decide? Not the kids. The parents, obviously. But what if you have a hippy mom who believes in holistic and alternative medicines, and she doesn&#39;t vaccinate her kids, who then go on to die from smallpox or plague? Is that fair on the kids?</p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;m really trying to say is that the state isn&#39;t the only thing capable of abusing authority. There are plenty of unfit parents making dumb decisions on behalf of bright kids. That&#39;s how the world works for kids, and it&#39;s the reason I think vaccinations should remain mandatory. If not, kids are going to suffer and die because of the beliefs of their parents and that just isn&#39;t right.</p>

<p>This is just simply unbelievable. I don&#39;t have time to waste arguing with stupid motherfuckers like you.

<p>You&#39;re talking fucking nonsense, and trying to word it in a rational way. That&#39;s exactly what the 9/11 faithers do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The things I listed above are all known toxins</p>

<p>And? Are you also a heavy advocate of eliminating dentistry? Given that mercury has for two hundred years been used to fill people&#39;s mouths?</p>

<p>You listed a bunch of toxins and that&#39;s all you did. Frankly, I&#39;m afraid I have no idea why you think this outweighs the medical fact that vaccines have saved literally billions of lives.</p>

<p><strong>Vaccines are safe. In fact, experts including American Academy of Pediatrics, the Institute of Medicine, and the World Health Organization agree that vaccines are even safer than vitamins. Millions of children and adults are vaccinated every year—safely. Thousands of people take part in clinical trials to test a vaccine before it is licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). After it’s licensed, the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) helps track any health effect that happens hours, days, weeks, or even months later. Anyone can report a possible side-effect so that it can be studied. This monitoring helps ensure vaccines are safe.

<p>Huh?  &quot;Mandatory vaccines&quot; aren&#39;t even a thing.  There are only two states in which they&#39;re required for school.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Worse, you haven&#39;t offered any rational reason why, but have instead made a bizarre appeal to emotion by saying vaccines are being used to poison infants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Appeal to emotion?  It&#39;s a fact that aluminum is added to vaccines, a known toxin.  It&#39;s a fact that formaldehyde is added to vaccines.  It&#39;s a fact that aborted fetal DNA is added to some vaccines.  None of this is an emotional appeal, these are simply the ingredients used to make vaccines.</p>

<p>So: why do you think it&#39;s necessary to add these toxins to them to be injected directly into the bloodstream of infants?  Is there a rational reason why anti-freeze is put into vaccines?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you also a heavy advocate of eliminating dentistry? Given that mercury has for two hundred years been used to fill people&#39;s mouths?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, but I am an advocate for not using mercury in fillings, since mercury is one of the most toxic substances on the planet to humans and thus it is <strong>retarded</strong> to use it for fillings when there are about a hundred other things we could use instead.</p>

<p>This is similar to how it&#39;s retarded to inject anti-freeze and formaldehyde into infants&#39; bloodstreams.</p>

<p>Again: <strong>I&#39;m not saying vaccines are bad in and of themselves</strong>.  But why do we need these toxic chemicals in them?  Can you give me a rational reason why?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Frankly, I&#39;m afraid I have no idea why you think this outweighs the medical fact that vaccines have saved literally billions of lives.</p>

<p>I never said it did.  Can you give me a rational reason why all of these known toxins are added to vaccines?</p>

Do you support anti-freeze being injected into infants&#39; bloodstreams?  If so, give me a valid reason why anti-freeze is being used in vaccines.  We&#39;ll start there.</p>

<p>The monkey virus is called SV40 and it contaminated tens of millions of vaccines at minimum.  And these things are being put into vaccines, you can verify the claim yourself quite easily.  Now before you try to reframe my argument again, let me just make it clear that not every vaccine contains all of these ingredients.  However, it&#39;s an issue that they&#39;re used at all unless you can demonstrate to me that anti-freeze, aluminum, formaldehyde, etc. are toxins in all other situations but somehow aren&#39;t when put into a vaccine and injected directly into the bloodstream.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That was a delusional response, and your replies have not improved since the first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to get past your misinterpretation of my point and argument.  I&#39;ll explain myself for about the 8th time:</p>

<p>At no point have I said I wanted to kill babies or that vaccines should be abolished or that every single vaccine has problems.  You keep trying to make it an either/or, all or nothing thing and vaccine safety and science is a hell of a lot more complicated than that (which should be obvious).  We should be able to have a discussion about this without you calling me a retard while not addressing any of the questions I&#39;ve repeatedly asked you.</p>

<p>So what I&#39;ve been saying specifically is that there are known toxins added to <em>some</em> vaccines, this is a fact, and I&#39;m wondering what the reasons are for why these known toxins are added.</p>

<p>So far you haven&#39;t provided a reason and I suspect that&#39;s because there is no good reason for why anti-freeze would be added to a vaccine.  There is no good reason why aluminum would be added to a vaccine.  If there is by all means, elucidate me.</p>

<p>But please put the strawman away, you&#39;ve given him enough of a beating.</p>

<p>When you go to a restaurant and order a meal you can literally end up eating shit, but in the quantities you might consume, it almost certainly will do you no harm. It is no reason to conclude that restaurants are not safe. Equally, since millions of people are safely injected with vaccines each year all over the world, we can almost certainly conclude that vaccines are quite safe. However, you are trying to create a safety issue where no such issue exists, and you are simply using exaggerated appeals to emotion and ridiculous analogies to do it.

<p>Or explain to me why methanol is added to any vaccine.</p>

<p>These things are all highly toxic to human beings.  This has been demonstrated time and time again.  So why are they being put into something that&#39;s injected into the bloodstream of infants?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Equally, since millions of people are safely injected with vaccines each year all over the world, we can almost certainly conclude that vaccines are quite safe.</p>

<p>Well we also know that the vaccine industry has paid out billions of dollars in damages for injuries related to vaccines.  So from that we can almost certainly conclude that vaccines are not entirely safe.  Again, this isn&#39;t an either/or, all/nothing, all vaccines good/all vaccines bad thing.

<p>Still have never said once that vaccines haven&#39;t saved lives.  This is the strawman I&#39;ve been referring to that you keep repeating.  But go ahead, say it again if it makes you feel better.</p>

<p>Which facts am I &quot;sensationalizing&quot; though?  I&#39;ve simply pointed out some of the actual ingredients put into vaccines, which also just happen to be known toxins.  Nothing sensational about it.  I do agree that it&#39;s kind of sensational that anti-freeze is being injected into babies but hey, I&#39;m not making it up.</p>

<p>Yes, I think it&#39;s stupid to administer tens of millions of vaccines that contain a cancer-causing monkey virus.  You don&#39;t?</p>

<p>I also think it&#39;s stupid to administer vaccines that contain known toxins like aluminum, anti-freeze, and formaldehyde.  Do you disagree?</p>

<p>None of this speaks to the good things vaccines have been responsible for.  Again here you&#39;re unable to see anything beyond your own black and white interpretation.  There is more to this discussion than &quot;all vaccines are good&quot; vs. &quot;all vaccines are bad&quot;.  If you stopped trying to pick a fight with me by continually arguing a point I never intended to make and actually acknowledged what I&#39;m saying, maybe this discussion could actually go somewhere.</p>

<p>You seem unwilling to even consider the possibility that there are <em>some</em> negatives to <em>some</em> vaccines, for example the tens of millions of children who had a monkey virus injected directly into their bloodstreams or the vaccines that contain known toxins like aluminum and methanol and anti-freeze.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re getting nowhere so I think this discussion has run its course.  You keep believing that all vaccines are perfectly safe and harmless, I&#39;ll keep knowing that they aren&#39;t all perfectly safe and harmless.  You keep believing multi-billion dollar international pharmaceutical companies and chemical conglomerates have humanity&#39;s best interests at heart, I&#39;ll keep knowing that the bottom line is and will always be their main consideration.</p>

<p>I personally would rather we made vaccines that didn&#39;t contain known toxins like aluminum or ethylene glycol (anti-freeze) or formaldehyde (embalming fluid) or methanol.  So let&#39;s just agree to disagree.</p>

<p>Well anti-freeze, ethylene glycol, is used in the polio vaccine.  I would assume that all of the ingredients in the vaccine were put there deliberately.  Are you suggesting it just magically ended up in the vaccine by accident?</p>

<p>They prove SV40 does cause cancer.  SV40 was in somewhere around 100 million vaccines.  Put two and two together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Toxic myths about vaccines</strong></p>

<p><strong>One of the biggest myths that antivaccinationists believe and like to use to stoke the fear of vaccines is the concept that they are full of “toxins.” The myth that mercury in the thimerosal preservative commonly used in vaccines in the U.S. until early 2002 was a major cause of autism is simply the most recent bogeyman used to try to argue that vaccines do more harm than good, as was the scare campaign engineered in response to Andrew Wakefield’s poor science claiming a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Now that study after study have failed to find or corroborate a link between thimerosal in vaccines or vaccines in general and autism to the point where even the most zealous of zealots are having a hard time defending the claim that mercury in vaccines cause autism any more, predictably the campaign against vaccines has fallen back on the old “toxins” myth. If you peruse antivaccinationist websites, it won’t take long to find articles claiming that vaccines are full of the most terrifying and nasty toxins</strong></p>

<p><strong>Here’s one example. The aforementioned Jenny McCarthy has been repeating that there is “antifreeze” in vaccines, as she did in the interview linked to earlier. That line is straight off of a number of antivaccination websites. (Amazingly Mr. Heckenlively managed to restrain himself from repeating “the “antifreeze in vaccines” gambit. I can only hope that it is due to intellectual honesty, although I can’t rule out the possibility that he just didn’t know about it.) One website in particular links to an MSDS about Quaker State Antifreeze/Coolant, the principal ingredients of which are ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol. Guess what? There’s no ethylene or diethylene glycol in vaccines.</strong></p>

<p>I will give you a hint though: in your copy/paste propaganda, did you notice how it only specifically mentions &quot;ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol&quot;?  Conspicuously missing from this copy/paste propaganda is <em>propylene glycol</em>, also used in anti-freeze and also included in vaccines.</p>

<p>What your copy/paste propaganda <em>also</em> doesn&#39;t mention is the fact that &quot;ethylene glycol&quot; is the name for a <em>class of compounds</em>.  One of these compounds is Phenoxyethanol, and this ingredient is sometimes included in vaccines. Two synonyms for Phenoxyethanol are <strong>ethylene glycol</strong> phenyl ether and <strong>ethylene glycol</strong> monophenyl ether.</p>

<p>An is a singular term, not a plural, and hence I am obviously correct. I have been correct about everything we have thus far discussed, and where prudent have provided evidential support to prove it. However, your narcissism has unfortunately resulted in a situation where you feel embarrassed by this, and you feel that you have been outwitted, which is why you are still here trying to change your story just enough to make it plausible that you haven&#39;t been making deliberate false claims for the last 3 days, which I think we both know you have.</p>

<p>What the hell are you talking about?  The only thing that&#39;s obvious from what you&#39;ve just said above is that you aren&#39;t a chemist.</p>

<p>When a person, or chemist, says &quot;ethylene glycol&quot;, they could be referring to <a href="http://www.reference.md/files/D005/mD005026.html">any of these compounds</a>, or all of those compounds, or some other compound that meets the definition.  All &quot;ethylene glycol&quot; means is that an ethylene compound has two hydroxy groups located on adjacent carbons.  That&#39;s it.  There are many compounds that meet this definition, a lot of which are used to make anti-freeze and some of which are used in making vaccines.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not embarrassed and actually find it hilarious that you think you&#39;ve &quot;outwitted&quot; me.  This also speaks volumes about your debate tactics, that you&#39;re more concerned about proving me wrong than you are about discussing the subject at hand objectively and arriving at the truth.  This has been evident all along but it&#39;s nice to see you admit it outright.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Care to elaborate on these false claims?  All I did was list ingredients and the only one you&#39;ve attempted to refute is the one referring to anti-freeze.

<p>It is.  Specifically, phenoxyethanol is - and phenoxyethanol is an ethylene glycol.  Ethylene glycols&#39; main uses are as coolants or anti-freezes, though they also have other uses.</p>

<p>Your argument hinges on the misunderstanding between ethylene glycol, which is another name for a specific type of ethylene glycol that can also be called Ethylene Alcohol, Hypodicarbonous acid, or Monoethylene glycol (<strong>check your own wikipedia source and look under &quot;other names&quot;</strong>), and ethylene glycol, a <em>class of compounds</em> that all meet a certain criteria and are mainly used to make anti-freeze.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say it again.  <strong>All &quot;ethylene glycol&quot; means is that an ethylene compound has two hydroxy groups (-OH) located on adjacent carbons.</strong>  There are many compounds that meet this definition, some are used to make vaccines.</p>

<p>LMFAO.</p>

<p><strong>Ethylene glycol</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ethylene glycol (IUPAC name: ethane-1,2-diol) is an organic compound primarily used as a raw material in the manufacture of polyester fibers and fabric industry, and polyethylene terephthalate resins (PET) used in bottling. A small percent is also used in industrial applications like antifreeze formulations and other industrial products. It is an odorless, colorless, syrupy, sweet-tasting liquid. Ethylene glycol is moderately toxic, with children having been particularly at risk because of its sweet taste, until it became common to add bitter flavoring to consumer antifreezes containing it.</strong></p>

<p><strong>But how does it work? Ethylene glycol - or 1,2-ethanediol to give it its more systematic name - can do this because it is structurally quite similar to water.

<p>So there you have it. Ethylene glycol is a group of compounds in the same way that water is a group of compounds. That is, it isn&#39;t. At all. Water is a chemical compound with the molecular formula H20, and ethylene glycol is a chemical compound with the molecular formula C2H6O2.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve provided no proof that vaccines contain monkey viruses</p>

<p>The monkey virus is called SV40 dude, do your homework.  If you haven&#39;t even heard of SV40 contamination before then what business do you have telling me I&#39;m lying?  Haha.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that they aren&#39;t safe</p>

<p>If they&#39;re <em>totally</em> safe why have billions in damages been given out to people who were injured by them?</p>

<p>You are just impossible. You didn&#39;t state any of the ingredients in vaccines and even if you did, you deliberately picked the very worst ones in an attempt to frighten people and emotionally manipulate them.</p>

<p>Yes I did, multiple times.  Here they are again:</p>

<p>Of course I picked some of the worst ones because my point is that <strong>some of</strong> the ingredients in vaccines are proven and known toxins.  That&#39;s literally the point I&#39;ve been making all along, thank you for finally realizing it.</p>

<p>Strange, because I thought you just listed a bunch of nasty-sounding words, and then made the completely unsupported claim that they were all being deliberately put into vaccines which were then &quot;injected directly into the bloodstream of infants.&quot; </p>

<p>Since you are clearly delusional, I&#39;ll just post this and leave you to carry on writing me stupid dishonest replies:-</p>

<p><strong>The Facts Behind Vaccine Safety</strong></p>

<p><strong>While there have been a few highly publicized people who&#39;ve made false claims about vaccines, decades of research from hundreds of medical, government and nonprofit organizations around the world have proven time and time again that vaccines are safe and effective</strong></p>

<p><strong>Vaccines typically take 10 to 15 years of research (historyofvaccines.org), development and testing before being approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and made available to the public. One exception to this time frame is the flu vaccine. The reason for this is that the manufacturing process for the flu vaccine remains unchanged. The only thing that changes each year is the antigen. Founded on ongoing virus tracking around the world, scientists determine which flu viruses are most likely to circulate during the next flu season. Once the viruses are identified, scientists change the antigen in the vaccine but keep everything else the same. The College of Physicians of Philadelphia provides a comprehensive explanation on how vaccines are developed (historyofvaccines.org) and rigorously validated (cdc.gov). If you&#39;re a parent with questions about the process, the AAP offers information specific to childhood vaccines (aap.org). For an interactive exploration of how vaccines play an integral part of our lives, as well as an in-depth look into vaccine science, visit the History of Vaccines (cdc.gov).</strong></p>

<p><strong>Credible scientists continue to assure us, through sound research, that vaccines are safe. At the end of the day, rely on sound science to inform your opinions about vaccines and your decision to get immunized. Simply put, there is no reliable proof that shows vaccines are unsafe, but there are hundreds of studies that prove vaccines save lives and are not linked to long-term side effects. Vaccines have already helped eradicate smallpox and have greatly reduced the number of other infectious diseases, including measles and pertussis. To find out more about the safety of various vaccines, as well as who licenses, recommends and requires vaccines, visit the Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia Vaccine Education Center.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The choice not to immunize can have severe consequences not only for your immediate loved ones, but for the public health at large. Just consider the recent outbreaks of life-threatening diseases that have occurred because people have delayed or skipped vaccinations.</strong></p>

<p>The above copy-paste is neither an admission of, nor an explanation of, why we need anti-freeze in the polio vaccine. The above copy-paste is an explanation of the facts regarding vaccine safety.</p>

<p>If you want to know why there is anti-freeze in the polio vaccine then I suggest you:-</p>

<p>A) Prove that there is anti-freeze in the polio vaccine.</p>

<p>B) Prove that it is harmful in the quantities it is discovered.</p>

<p>C) Take up a law case.</p>

<p>Failing this, please stop being delusional.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe all of these medical experiments took place, but I just can&#39;t see why people would believe they&#39;re being performed on the mass public. Medical procedures/vaccines/etc. aren&#39;t just experiments haphazardly done on patients. And as for vaccines being mandatory according to the government, it is for public health and safety. I think the correlation between vaccines and let&#39;s say, autism, would be a bit stronger if these mandated medical procedures were just experiments made to hurt us.</p>

<p>Except alcohol isn&#39;t a natural component of the environment around us in that extent. The radio emitted 80 years ago, and the radio in use today for wifi and cellular phones is not significantly different in scope or magnitude when examined in terms of personal health.</p>

<p>Of course, this is something we can easily examine. What would be the indicator that cell phones are bad for you? We&#39;ve had them around for over 20 years now. Explain to me what the danger is. We&#39;d also expect to see a stratification of that danger based on how technologically advanced the society you come from is. North Korea would have little to worry about from Cellular phones seeing as they were illegal up until recently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2092574/">Here</a> is an article (from the National Institutes of Health) with a ton of information about various studies done on cell phones with regards to brain cancer. Here&#39;s how they sum it up at the end:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We conclude that results from present studies on use of mobile phones for ⩾10 years give a consistent pattern of an increased risk for acoustic neuroma and glioma. The risk is highest for ipsilateral exposure. Longer follow‐up is needed, however, as an increased risk for other types of brain tumours cannot be ruled out. From these studies, it is not clear at what stage microwaves act in carcinogenesis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the most worrisome things is that these studies showed the highest risk of cancer in those who started using cell phones earlier than age 20. Those would be a very small number of users when cell phones first became prominent and when some of these studies were done, but a much larger number now. I know kids who get their own cell phone at age 8 or 9. Sometimes things can be safe for adults but harmful for children, or sort of harmful for adults but fatal for children.</p>

<p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bem.20458/abstract;jsessionid=DDBB951A7D2F023D4F233E9A97779587.f01t03">Here</a> is a study which shows a correlation between having a cell phone near the head and increased reaction times. There are also concerns about excessive exposure to microwaves in various forms resulting in decreased reproductive ability, like lowered sperm counts and egg degeneration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So why aren&#39;t we seeing a brain cancer epidemic? </p>

<p>Your first link starts off with this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The cohort study was of limited value due to methodological shortcomings in the study. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and then this</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall, no association between mobile phone use and brain tumours was found.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not sure how closely you read this study. It&#39;s a meta analysis, meaning analysis of other studies. There are a few problems with this study in terms of how small the sample size is for total cases reviewed in the meta analysis excluding the cohort as the authors did. This is their only correlation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, an increased risk was seen for ipsilateral phone use, especially for tumours in the temporal, occipital or temporoparietal lobe</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meaning there was a weak correlation for tumor location with the side people prefer to use the phone on. Of course this wasn&#39;t a statistically significant finding and contralateral tumors were also found in a section of participants. </p>

<p>Now here&#39;s some more interesting stuff:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was no truly unexposed group for comparison. Of the subscribers, 85% were men and 15% were women, thus giving a very skewed sex distribution. There seemed to be a “healthy worker” effect in the study, as SIR was significantly decreased to 0.95 (95% CI 0.9 to 0.97) for all cancers.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, this is an explanation of some of the problems with a study they examined. Basically, there were no controls put on the Danish cohort study examined, the largest of the studies, which makes that study largely useless. This is highly unfortunate for the researchers as effectively, we&#39;re dealing with examinations of hundreds of people rather than thousands, and all from very specific locations, making the results very insignificant. Within the remaining studies examined, each suffers a reproducability problem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These results on acoustic neuroma are consistent with an association with use of cellular phones. However, a recent study from Tokyo could not confirm an association.18 No case was reported with a latency period ⩾10 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Effectively, the first link doesn&#39;t agree with an association between tumors and phone device RF frequency. Although the authors make many overstatements of the datasets this is their concluding result:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From these studies, it is not clear at what stage microwaves act in carcinogenesis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately I can&#39;t honestly evaluate your second link at this time due to paywalling, however, if I am able to review it I will revisit this discussion assuming you&#39;re willing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are big problems with the available studies, mainly that almost none of the study subjects have been cell phone users for over a decade, and that most of these studies were done 10-20 years ago. But the fact is that even based on the very limited evidence we have, many scientists and governments are recommending limiting exposure of children to cell phones. I&#39;m not saying cell phones are evil and you can&#39;t have one (for instance, I have one.) But I just can&#39;t conclude that it would be safe or healthy for my kid to get an iPhone for her 5th birthday and carry it around attached to her hand 12 hours a day, because after 20 years of cell phones being commonplace, we obviously can&#39;t know what happens to a human body after 40 or 50 or 60 years of exposure.</p>

<p>EDIT: I just want to say that, from what I&#39;ve seen, there haven&#39;t been a lot of really serious or rigorous studies about the possible side effects of cell phone usage. Not to mention wi-fi or cell phone tower proximity, even less of those. And the studies that do exist are focused only on cancer, basically only on brain cancer. There could be other major problems that come up in some people after a half a lifetime of exposure, and we would have no idea at this point. I know there is a growing group of people who believe they have &quot;electromagnetic sensitivity&quot; I think they call it (my mother is one of those people). What percentage of the population should be affected before we take the idea that there might be an issue seriously? 5%? 10%? I just think it deserves more study and attention that it seems to get.</p>

<p>Does having a few hundred studies, which are mostly specifically about cancer, prove that no EMFs can ever cause anyone problems of any sort, no matter how much exposure they get? (Rhetorical question.) Even if there were thousands of studies, literally none have studied the effects of living for 30 or 40 years in the EMF-saturated environment of a modern city, because no one has done it yet. The increase in the number of microwaves, cell phones, cell towers, &quot;smart&quot; electronics, TV sets, etc. that we have is huge just in the last 25 years. Wi-fi has existed for less than 20. I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m just not convinced. I don&#39;t see what the big deal is. My family and I will live out in the country and minimize our exposure to all sorts of chemical poisons, allergens, and irritants. I don&#39;t think anyone could argue that my kid will be worse off for that. If you grew up in the 1960s or 70s you didn&#39;t have a computer or a cell phone, maybe not even a TV or microwave, and no one thinks kids back then were deprived because of it.

<p>The majority of studies currently are investigating the claims of Electromagnetic sensitivity. The all show no evidence of an actual effect. The way they test this is with a willing participant claiming sensitivity. They expose them to electromagnetic fields but do not tell them when they&#39;re doing it to see if the patient can identify onset of symptoms in line with their claims of rapid onset. The studies show there is no link between the symptoms of EMS and actual exposure to EMF. </p>

<p>Depending on which part of the country, that might not be a true assumption. Especially in farmland they&#39;ve found an increased incidence of autism downwind from farms that use synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. Whether that&#39;s causative or mere correlation is not yet established.</p>

Instead of ignoring them, he became curious and started READING the studies (as opposed to saying &quot;these vaccines have been proven safe many many times because that&#39;s what they told me in school.&quot; No -- he went and read the fucking studies himself and realized that there are all sorts of problems with the studies: they were funding by pharma, or they were performed on groups too small, and none of them compared vaccinated vs. unvaccinated.

<p>If you really believe that the study you posted proves your point, you either aren&#39;t from a science background or you are being disingenuous and hoping that nobody here knows enough about this topic.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a study of vaccine effectiveness, not a study of vaccine safety.  When they talk about unvaccinated they don&#39;t mean a person who&#39;s fully unvaccinated, they mean someone who hasn&#39;t had that specific vaccine.</p>

<p>The pro-vaxxers always post a silly study like this to make their point, that should set off all of the alarm bells for those who are on the fence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay I went back and read what I wrote. My apologies. What the pediatrician said was that the scientific studies weren&#39;t designed to fully prove and test the safety of the vaccines by comparing the incidence of symptoms in vaccinated vs. fully unvaccinated individuals.</p>

<p>&quot;What ends up happening is they compare the incidence rates of these vaccine reactions or these symptoms that kids get after they&#39;re vaccinated to how often those symptoms are seen in the general population, to check and see if this vaccinated group is in any way getting an increased incidence of these symptoms than the general population would get.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I did not turn my back when I heard parent after parent – in the dozens, in the hundreds, and then in the thousands – start to say that their children were fine, then they got vaccinated, and then something really bad happened to them acutely or within days, weeks, or even months. Those parents were told 100 percent of the time by the conventional medical system, &#39;It&#39;s a coincidence. It couldn&#39;t possibly be related to the vaccine.&#39;</p>

<p>As a person who&#39;s curious about science and questioning, it became obvious to me that there may not be a coincidence here and that something more may be going on.</p>

<p>The literature is pretty supportive of the fact that vaccines have much greater adverse outcomes on the genotype of the body, the immune system of the body, the brain of the body, and the intracellular functions of the body than we are willing to tell the public about.&quot;</p>

<p>Vaccine proponents have stated that there are over 20,000 studies that &quot;prove&quot; the safety of vaccines. But a closer inspection of those studies would likely reveal otherwise. Dr. Palevsky explained:</p>

<p>&quot;…in order for us to really delve into those studies, we have to look at who supported the studies. What was the study design? What were the control groups? How big was the actual number of kids or adults that was used in those studies? I think we will see that in most of those studies, the actual safety has never really been proven.</p>

<p>One of the reasons that I think we can fairly say that is that the vaccine manufacturers and the conventional medical organizations have not done studies that compare vaccinated to unvaccinated children. In order for us to really know if children who were vaccinated are having an adverse effect from a vaccine, we have to use a placebo group that&#39;s given an injection of maybe normal saline to evaluate whether or not they developed the same symptoms that children who were vaccinated may develop after they&#39;re injected with the vaccine.</p>

<p>Those studies are not done. They&#39;re not done because the conventional medical system says it&#39;s unethical to leave kids unvaccinated for any length of time. But, most of the vaccine safety studies that are being done last anywhere between one and four weeks anyway. The kids are followed within those one to four weeks. Then, they&#39;re not followed in a very detailed way to recognize whether any of their health outcomes could be related to the vaccine that they got one to four weeks ago.</p>

<p>What ends up happening is they compare the incidence rates of these vaccine reactions or these symptoms that kids get after they&#39;re vaccinated to how often those symptoms are seen in the general population, to check and see if this vaccinated group is in any way getting an increased incidence of these symptoms than the general population would get. But the fact of the matter is that the general population is vaccinated, so they&#39;re comparing a vaccinated group with a vaccinated group.&quot;</p>

<p>On top of that, the studies are not nearly long enough to show what the long-term implications of vaccinations might be.</p>

<p>&quot;…they are not following children long enough to know whether in three months, six months, three years, six years, or 10 years, there could be some autoimmune antibody or some immune challenge that happens to the body that lingers or that just sits there as a genotypic effect. There&#39;s a change in the genetics, there&#39;s a change in the DNA, that doesn&#39;t necessarily manifest itself until years later because of other stressors, perhaps even from another vaccine that comes years later,&quot; Dr. Palevsky said.</p>

<p>None of those studies have been done, so I don&#39;t know how you can say that vaccines are safe.</p>

<p>…We&#39;re not looking at the micro-molecular levels to see, &#39;Okay, was there an autoimmune antibody produced? Were there other inflammatory markers produced? Where did those markers manifest? Did they stay in the body? Did they manifest into clinical symptoms? How are they relevant?&#39; None of that science is being done. But we&#39;re just saying that vaccines are safe, because we&#39;ve been doing it for so long. And anyone with a good scientific mind would say that&#39;s not adequate.&quot;</p>

<p>There are increasing reports of pediatricians ostracizing patients that disagree with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#39;s (CDC) one-size-fits-all vaccination schedule. Some pediatricians will even resist answering your vaccination questions or concerns, or &quot;fire&quot; you as a patient and tell you to seek care elsewhere.</p>

<p>While most pediatricians enter the profession because they have an enduring love for children, many also firmly, and somewhat blindly, believe that there&#39;s no room for questions or disagreement regarding vaccinations. They, unfortunately, have not followed the path that Dr. Palevsky, myself and many other physicians have taken in seeking to look beneath the surface at the deeper issues.</p>

<p>Dr. Palevsky continued:</p>

<p>&quot;These adherents are the same people that said the world was flat. This is the big problem, because the world isn&#39;t flat. Science evolves. What parents are finding, some physicians are finding, what a lot of scientists are finding is that the science is changing, that science is growing. It&#39;s growing to actually show things that we thought we knew are no longer as valid. &#39;The world was flat&#39; was a very hard concept to accept, until &#39;The world was round.&#39; I think that&#39;s the same thing that we&#39;re dealing with here.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why parents are being fired from their pediatrician&#39;s office: because the world is flat, and there is no possibility that the world could be round. I feel for these families, especially in areas where there are very few physicians for them to go to and to have care for their children.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dead patients don&#39;t make the pharmaceutical corporations much money, which I imagine would be the goal of corporations.  Vaccines are neither a miracle cure or a lethal injection; what they most certainly are is far overhyped for the risk and reward they offer.  Here&#39;s an interesting story;  quite awhile ago, doctors didn&#39;t think hand washing was necessary.  A man who took notice of which patients were dying in a maternity ward realized that the dying mothers were always opperated on by doctors who had just performred autopsies.  So, like any sane man, he suggested the doctors just wash their god damn hands before tending to patients.  He was rewarded with a lifetime vavation in an insane asylum for suggesting something other than what followed the medical narative.  We have a similar situation now with vaccines; this time there&#39;s a much larger profit margain at stake, as the vaccine industry is massive.  To think that the ones running the vaccine industry wouldn&#39;t fight tooth and nail to keep their patients is an absurd notion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>vaccine destroyed small pox and ended a plague that was rocking the world. MMR has prevented early childhood diseases from spreading into adult populations. But now that people are all in various states of equivocation about vaccines because of fear mongering, they are on the rise again because parents aren&#39;t vaccinating and thereby putting other members of the population at risk because of the outright nonsense they are listening to.</p>

<p>Vaccines assist in increasing herd immunity in this way.</p>

<p>Smallpox was taken out by vaccines, not hand washing. It is not even CLOSE to being a similar situation and you are comparing apples to monkey wrenches.</p>

<p>How many is &quot;a few&quot;? Why is it that, even if your child has an obvious adverse reaction to a vaccine, you can still be compelled to continue vaccinating your child? In some states it&#39;s unlikely, but not following the vaccination schedule is explicitly listed in the description of &quot;medical neglect&quot; in many state laws. I know from experience that doctors are extremely reluctant to ascribe these reactions to vaccines, even if the reaction is immediate and the symptoms are listed in the side effects on the paperwork they give you. This is not a black and white issue, but suggesting that some children would be better off not vaccinated, or minimally vaccinated, isn&#39;t crazy. Wanting to protect your kid isn&#39;t child neglect. Having questions, which never seem to be answered, shouldn&#39;t be conflated with being ignorant or dangerous.</p>

<p>Fewer than one percent of all polio cases result in some form of paralysis.  This is only fatal in 2-5% of children and much more so I adults.  Like many illnesses we vaccinate our &quot;vulnerable&quot; children for, childhood is the safest time to contract the disease (.02-.05% chance of death IF infected) and duration of immunity is unknown.  It takes three doses to predict 95% chance of immunity for duration unknown.</p>

<p>More than 99% of those who contracted polio fully recovered in the pre vaccine era.  Even paralytic polio had a majority of sufferers recover fully within a year.</p>

<p>Even if 100% of paralytic polio cases resulted in death, it would still be less dangerous than yellow fever.  The same can be said of at least half of the reccommended childhood vaccines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Vaccination is widely considered one of the greatest medical achievements of modern civilization. Childhood diseases that were commonplace less than a generation ago are now increasingly rare because of vaccines. In order to be effective at eliminating communicable diseases, vaccines must be administered to sufficient levels of persons in the community.&quot; from <a href="http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/8852146/Balding06.html?sequence=2">http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/8852146/Balding06.html?sequence=2</a></p>

<p>&quot;The increase in life expectancy during the 20th century is largely due to improvements in child survival; this increase is associated with reductions in infectious disease mortality, due largely to immunization.1 However, infectious diseases remain a major cause of illness, disability, and death. Immunization recommendations in the United States currently target 17 vaccine-preventable diseases across the lifespan.&quot; from <a href="http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/immunization-and-infectious-diseases">http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/immunization-and-infectious-diseases</a></p>

<p>&quot;Vaccination has greatly reduced the burden of infectious diseases. Only clean water, also considered to be a basic human right, performs better. Paradoxically, a vociferous antivaccine lobby thrives today in spite of the undeniable success of vaccination programmes against formerly fearsome diseases that are now rare in developed countries.&quot; from <a href="http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/2/07-040089/en/">http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/2/07-040089/en/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, hygiene, sanitation, and nutrition were big factors, too.  But the doctor hand-washing thing was a minor factor, part of the bigger hygiene thing.  Vaccines added hugely to life-expectancy by stopping lots of early-childhood killer diseases.  You gain a lot more average life-expectancy if you save a 2-year-old from whooping cough than if you save a 45-year-old from post-operative infection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the hand-washing and sanitization of tools and environment were very large factors. Tons of babies died during or soon after delivery before these factors came into play and the survival of those babies greatly improved the average life expectancy. </p>

<p>If you want to know something which came from pharma that has been really helpful, then antibiotics deserve attention. Although, their usefulness has been declining. Vaccines though, not even close. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Healthier mothers and babies and control of infectious diseases is where I would probably look. </p>

<p>Although, looking at a single source, such as the CDC, is not where I would only look if I were you, in order to confirm what I have said.</p>

<p>Here is what I found in that site, which gives you a lead to do research from other sources.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 20th century, for every 1000 live births, six to nine women in the United States died of pregnancy-related complications, and approximately 100 infants died before age 1 year (1,2). From 1915 through 1997, the infant mortality rate declined greater than 90% to 7.2 per 1000 live births, and from 1900 through 1997, the maternal mortality rate declined almost 99% to less than 0.1 reported death per 1000 live births (7.7 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1997) (3) (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Environmental interventions, improvements in nutrition, advances in clinical medicine, improvements in access to health care, improvements in surveillance and monitoring of disease, increases in education levels, and improvements in standards of living contributed to this remarkable decline (1).</p>

<p>From the 1930s through the 1950s, state and local health departments made substantial progress in disease prevention activities, including sewage disposal, water treatment, food safety, organized solid waste disposal, and public education about hygienic practices (e.g., foodhandling and handwashing). </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a scientific study. I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re offering it as such. This is a legal review that was published in a student journal. The question sheet was sent to 22 of 2500 cases where autism induced injury was claimed. That&#39;s... quite a small sample size and quite dubiously published. We&#39;ll look past that for now. There&#39;s the IRB  question, which shows this &#39;study&#39; is rather unethical in construction, we&#39;ll also look past this. </p>

<p>From the paper:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The authors began a research project with Pace Law School students to locate and analyze VICP cases assessing whether the VICP had in fact compensated vaccine-­induced brain damage, including autism, while perhaps not using that term specifically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s more than a little odd. On the next page:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The authors, with the assistance of Pace Law students, created a database of VICP published decisions that used relevant terms related to autism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm....</p>

<p>There are several critiques which point out the multitude of flaws with this article (not study). Here are a few that might be worth your review. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/archives/1671">http://autism-news-beat.com/archives/1671</a></p></li>

</ul>

<p>The biggest problem with this work is the fact that they didn&#39;t use diagnostic criteria for autism. They looked for anything &#39;autism like&#39; and declared it autism. Considering the occupations of the authors and the manner in which they carried this work out, I&#39;d have to say this is not trustworthy. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every claim has been sourced, including the best one which is the most recent. At this point you&#39;re either trolling me or intentionally misdirecting because you cannot refute the evidence since it&#39;s the government itself and not some random youtube video.</p>

<p>I think you really need to review your sources. </p>

<p>Well anti-freeze, ethylene glycol, is used in the polio vaccine.  I would assume that all of the ingredients in the vaccine were put there deliberately.  Are you suggesting it just magically ended up in the vaccine by accident?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>B) They do not prove that vaccines are harmful.</p>

<p>Well the billions handed out in vaccine damages prove that <strong>some vaccines</strong> are <strong>sometimes</strong> harmful.  Again, it isn&#39;t all or nothing.</p>

<p>They prove SV40 does cause cancer.  SV40 was in somewhere around 100 million vaccines.  Put two and two together.</p>
