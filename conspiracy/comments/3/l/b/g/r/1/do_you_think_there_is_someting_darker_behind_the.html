<p>Satanism exists as a direct confirmation of christianity. Otherwiee they would be just pagans, but only they took the extra step to label anyone outside of their &quot;good&quot;-doing a &quot;follower of the devil&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christ and Satan don&#39;t exist, here we can agree.</p>

<p>What you don&#39;t get is that these concepts embody other concepts - they have a concrete meaning. When one said &quot;Follow the ways of god&quot; He intended a very concrete thing, tied to the perceived social order.</p>

<p>God ways were a mythical manner to promote good social behaviour. Satan was used as the opposite, to define bad behaviour and scare people from falling there. All in all, a way to keep society together ( for which purposes and benefits is debatable but not my subject here, altough it&#39;s pretty obvious the whole christianity thing was quite abused by powerful guys through the centuries for its huge potential in social stability )</p>

<p>Back to the point, it seems only natural to me that secret societies created to subvert the social order would find in satan a great ally ( again, it&#39;s the meaning that matter inside the belief system, not the concept per se ): It would have been the perfect way to allure and keep those men that defected god ways, a good recruiting tool. You check philosophy and see it doesn&#39;t make sense on an only analytical level, true. But you forgot that in a social setting with lot of religious fervor ( and silent discontent too i would guess ), it may aswell appear as the most logical way to set up a subversive network.</p>

<p>Also, it was a really good test: at the time you would know a man ready to forbid god would have been ready to tear apart society for personal gain. Today things are more mixed and god doesn&#39;t equate anymore to the only form of social stability, so it&#39;s harder to hit the right mindset of the time since the two are so different.</p>

<p>Because they are representative and full of meaning through history, if you want to talk about past society in a meaningful way, you are going to talk about god and satan as they were viewed then, not about how we view them now. </p>

<p>This show your lack of understanding. I don&#39;t care about absolute good or evil or what people here thinks about that - it&#39;s not relevant. What is relevant is how people perceived such things under the religious framework. It was not a system to benefit the individual the most but society. And if society could benefit from its members not masturbating, you can bet you are going to find that in religion. It&#39;s not about good how we mean it today. &quot;good&quot; back then meant simply socially functional.</p>

<p>True, that&#39;s why none bought that scam in the last 4000 years and it has been totally unprofitable and illogic to play that field, for rich people.

<p>Good and evil are relative, abstract and somewhat arbitrary - we can indeed agree on that. But i think you got it backwards. How does one benefit from no fap, to follow the example? They outruled it so sex becomes a necessity not a luxury. They outruled pre marital  sex so orphans don&#39;t destabilize the standard family model (no condoms back then), outruled suicide because it was cheating your way to god, etc. Not for the benefit of the nation or the individual but the con artists who had the power to change things this way.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t imo. Because god is first an idea of social stability, then of manipulation through myth. None of these 2 concepts will substitute it as they can&#39;t fill the other. It would be better to just use the concept outside the religious framework and inside a social one. True that is going to open up disruptions, but it&#39;s the price to pay for having such a long shot concept decreeting social outcomes for centuries.</p>

<p>Yes, the original concept has been manipulated since it&#39;s dawn by con artists who were machiavellian in nature and didn&#39;t buy the story - but rather used it to gain an edge on the rest of mankind.</p>

<p>So god and satan while always very entwined in social structures, church being the better example. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not really, i don&#39;t. I thought you do though... Awkward</p>

<p>The reason i use god and satan as terms is because i don&#39;t believe in absolution, so i need to resort to words that signify it in other times. &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; can&#39;t do the job as i don&#39;t see a given moral axis. It&#39;s about good and bad now and people can see through the ancient rethoric, but we still need it to talk about ancient people because they definitely had a given moral axis to decode life through.</p>

<p>Do you motherfuckers understand now? DO YOU? Let me spell it out one more time for the densest among you.
This. Is. Not. Just. About. Video games.
These people want to destroy those of you who speak out and control the rest. You&#39;ve seen them talk on twitter and tumblr, they will happily put you to death if they could and drink your tears while doing so. Video games is one front of a much larger war. It does not begin or end with video games and if you don&#39;t fight you are going to lose so much more than just a hobby. This is the end of the war, they have been winning it for years. Gamergate was a surprise resistance that popped up after our &quot;forces&quot; had been routed and slaughtered on the altar of social justice for decades. If you want to live in a world where some histrionic pampered brat and her sniveling cohorts can cry harassment and shut down entire websites then yeah sure do nothing just protect the vidya I guess. If that idea disgusts you then it is time to stand up if you haven&#39;t already and fight them on every level. Remember Shirtgate? Remember how they made a motherfucking scientist cry on what should have been the best day of his life? Over a shirt? It&#39;s not just about video games these people are monsters in human skin. Fight them!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, feminism has been quite a driving force for the elite agenda, one of the best ways they found to destabilize society.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whale.to/b/how7.html">http://www.whale.to/b/how7.html</a> ( Cia, Gloria Steinem and black feminism )
Whale.to is not an accurate website by many means being a dumpster of alternative info ( so disinfo too ) but it also has very good pieces, this being one. Crosscheck at pleasure.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy because you ( as in the &quot;elite&quot; ) just give them a good spin and they will keep spinning for your benefit.</p>

<p>The more society is atomistic/individualistic the more it can be controlled easily. Feminism is a good way to do that on a racial level and it destroy very big chunks all together. Hence it&#39;s &quot;desirable&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, fair enough. I was ambiguous. But part of that is because this <em>social justice phenomenon</em> is itself ambiguous. </p>

<p>&quot;Political correctness&quot; (like &quot;social justice warrior&quot;) is a buzzword that can pretty much be applied to anyone that gets offended for any reason. That doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re right or wrong to be offended, and it doesn&#39;t speak to what they&#39;re offended about.</p>

<p>Donut get me wrong- I&#39;m not saying that some people aren&#39;t easily offended. But I&#39;m saying that these buzzwords don&#39;t actually mean anything because they can mean anything. People usually talk about political correctness as a negative trait of the left. But political correctness is also a negative trait of the right. It&#39;s also a positive trait of the left, and a positive trait of the right. It&#39;s also an entirely different thing in cyberspace than it is outside of cyberspace- that&#39;s what I meant by real life. In real life, there is no social justice phenomenon.</p>

<p>If I say &quot;fuck muslims&quot; that&#39;s politically incorrect and the left gets offended. But if I say &quot;fuck christians&quot; that&#39;s also politically incorrect and the right gets offended. If I make a joke degrading women then <em>some</em> feminists will feel butthurt. If I make a joke degrading men then <em>some</em> MRA will feel butthurt.</p>

<p>In cyber space, people will talk big. But in real life, most people don&#39;t have the balls, even if they are offended. And that&#39;s not a <em>new</em> thing nor is the fact that some people are easily offended hence it&#39;s not a phenomenon. </p>

<p>Furthermore, outside of the snarky internet definition of <em>social justice</em> real life social justice warriors are people like MLK who are nearly universally lauded. And they&#39;re also extremely RARE. There&#39;s hardly an influx of MLK&#39;s in real life. </p>

<p>SO... because people like to blame people getting offended on <em>political correctness</em> and <em>social justice mentality</em> the root of WHY a person objects is ignored. The buzzword replaces real conversation. I can talk about why someone doesn&#39;t want me mocking Jehovah or I can write it off as stupid political correctness. Writing it off discourages discourse. So people who call out other people as &quot;social justice warriors&quot; or &quot;politically correct&quot; are discouraging intelligent discourse in favor of throwing around ambiguous buzzwords.  </p>

<p>Ergo... I think that the darker phenomenon is people using the term <em>social justice</em> as an excuse to not have to defend their own positions. </p>

<p>Satanism exists as a direct confirmation of christianity. Otherwiee they would be just pagans, but only they took the extra step to label anyone outside of their &quot;good&quot;-doing a &quot;follower of the devil&quot;</p>
