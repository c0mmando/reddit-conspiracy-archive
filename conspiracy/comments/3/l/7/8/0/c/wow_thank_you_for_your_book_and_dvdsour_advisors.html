<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>According to Gage, Trump is the only presidential candidate or major public figure who has written the Truther group a custom letter after being sent their DVDs and literature. Trump&#39;s campaign, Gage said, thanked the members of <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/">Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth</a> for their “continued support.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for your book and DVDs,” read the email, which Gage forwarded to me. “Our advisors will investigate the claims made by the architects and engineers more thoroughly and draw their own conclusions from there. We appreciate your continued support. Sincerely, The Trump Campaign.”</p>

<p>Gage and his group were starstruck. “Someone actually acknowledged we took the time to send them something and said they would look at it,” Gage said. “That’s historic at this level of politics, a presidential candidate.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Near the end of our conversation, even Gage confessed he misses his life before 9/11 Truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...“It is tiring after nine years, I have to say,” he said. “I am an architect, I’d rather be practicing architecture. I’ve been full time as a 9/11 Truth activist for five years and I’m looking forward to going back to architecture. I make more money, I have more fun.”</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>“But my country’s at stake.”</p>

<p>That is NOT true. AE911Truth is <em>very</em> picky about their &quot;bedfellows&quot; as they have completely excluded a number of liars, bullshit artists, and disinformation like Judith Woods, &quot;micro-nukes&quot; and other non-scientific non-theories and the people promoting them.</p>

<p>AE911Truth always send their DVDs to all politicians, and only one - Trump - sent a pro-forma form letter thanking them.</p>

<p>To say AE911Truth is now a &quot;bedfellow&quot; of Donald Trump is idiotic in the extreme. I once got a form letter from Diane Feinstein thanking me for sending her a letter complaining of a bill she voted for. Does that make her my &quot;bedfellow?&quot; Of course not.</p>

<p>And for making my case.

<p>I didn&#39;t make your case at all.</p>

<p>AE911Truth sends their DVDs to every politician. One of Donald Trump&#39;s interns sent back a form letter.</p>

<p>You suggested that meant that AE911Truth and Donald Trump were now &quot;bedfellows&quot; - because of a form letter.</p>

<p>That is idiotic in the extreme. There&#39;s really no other way to put it. Receiving a form letter does not make one a &quot;bedfellow&quot; of a politician.</p>

<p>No one brought out any &quot;party balloons&quot; - they simply acknowledged they get a form letter back, for once.</p>

<p>How ironic, in light of the fact that I only expressed my mixed feelings with one single line of text (yay, but) and YOU totally blew it out of proportion and threw around baseless insults, totally fixated on the &quot;but&quot; part. </p>

<p>Look at the warping you have to do: in the article, it is called a &quot;custom letter&quot; (prompting Gage to call it &quot;historic&quot;, and to forward it even to a MSM pen pusher as proof of legitimacy), you play it down by calling it a &quot;form letter&quot; that was simply &quot;acknowledged&quot; and no big deal made of, merely a very, very small PR gimmick.</p>

<p>AE911Truth sticks to verifiable, scientific facts about 9/11 - not a &quot;narrative.&quot; So here you are completely mischaracterizing AE911Truth as some sort of &quot;cult&quot; where you have to follow a &quot;narrative&quot; as opposed to the reality, a group of professionals sticking to verifiable facts and scientific evidence.</p>

<p>What did you say? AE911Truth is not some sort of cult where you have to follow a narrative? Here you are, trying to get a fellow truther back into line. </p>

<p>Let me make this clear: I support the &quot;club&quot; for all the scientific analysis and FOIA request and pestering officials and its presentations with brochures and DVDs. But I am allowed to have my very own, personal reservations about their approaches. I&#39;m not forcing them down anyone&#39;s throat. If you feel attacked personally, grow some. </p>

<p>If you must, shun me, make up theories how my comment was part of a well orchestrated attack on AE911Truth on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, call me a spacebeamer and push micro-nukes into my pocket. If you want to change my opinion, don&#39;t act like a Gauleiter. </p>

<p>Excluding those who promote a false hypothesis that has no evidence behind it is called &quot;science.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s the point of science. An honest person who came up with a hypothesis that they then realized they had no evidence for, or was shown to be false, would drop that hypothesis.</p>

<p>People who keep pushing a false hypothesis which has been shown to be false or which has no evidence behind it isn&#39;t doing science. In the case of a very contentious topic such as 9/11 - where people pointing out the evidence of controlled demolition have been harassed, fired, offered bribes, jailed, and even murdered - sticking close to the actual evidence - and excluding those pushing crazy and false theories like &quot;space beams&quot; or &quot;mini-nukes&quot; - is to be commended.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a member of AE911Truth, I&#39;ve only sent them enough money to pay for a DVD probably five years ago. But since they are the ONLY 9/11 truth group with any credibility - and considering there is a coordinated attack on 9/11 on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> in the last few weeks, I&#39;m going to continue to point out when people attack, smear, and discredit the only 9/11 truth group out there.</p>
