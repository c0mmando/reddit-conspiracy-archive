    <div class="md"><p>More of a patsy, if a narrative can maintain such a title. The plane hijackings provide an easy to parse scenario for those reporting on, and ingesting, the narrative. It also provides cover for what might have happened, so in that way, it could be part of an elaborate distraction. *: Keep in mind the unbelievable amount of put options secured against the affected airlines prior to the attack, and perhaps hijacked planes were merely a means of maximizing profit from tragedy.</p>

<p>The damage caused is not equivalent to the proposed method. If you saw a sedan melted into the street, and I told you I did it with a home made flamethrower, I would not expect you to believe me. Especially if that sedan was liquid metal for nearly a week, and we both developed thyroid cancer, later.</p>

<p>I still believe that planes struck both buildings, but know, that such a limited delivery device could not cause such damage, even if packed to the brim with plastic explosives and jet fuel. However, the interested parties did an excellent job of cleaning up relevant evidence, so it will remain a theory for some time.</p>

<p>What knowledge do you have to be able to make this assumption? You dont think that a 767 filled with 10 - 24,000 gallons of jet fuel might ignite other materials in the building that could cause a fire large enough to weaken floor joists? What training do you have in structural engineering? </p>

<p>No, not in the amount of time given, due to the structure of the building. Additionally, the supposed delivery method, and subsequent explosion, in no way account for evidence found, on-site, the day of. Nor could any combination of jet fuel, and traditional explosives, account for that evidence.

    <div class="md"><p>I believe multiple types of explosives were used at the World Trade Center. Not just Thermite because Thermite alone would not do the job and does not account for the damage seen that day. More than just WTC 1,2 and 7 were targeted. Also WTC 4,5, and 6 which house the El Dorado Task Force. One of the targets of the attack. Gold Vaults beneath those buildings were also targeted and were found empty following the attacks. FEMA photographer Kurt Sonnenfeld took pictures of the empty Gold Vaults and the US chased him out of the country, attempting to charge him with the suicide of his wife. He was found innocent in the first trial and the Government attempted to charge him again for the same crime. His house was raided and all of his computers and cameras were taken but the pictures are already on the web.</p>

<p>I found a private company that produces silent demolition explosives. NIST stated that the reason that they didn&#39;t check for explosives was because they weren&#39;t loud enough. If this private company can produce silent explosives, imagine what the Government has. <a href="http://www.demolitiontechnologies.com/silent-demolition.htm">http://www.demolitiontechnologies.com/silent-demolition.htm</a>.</p>

<p>Eyewitnesses at the Pentagon stated that they smelled Cordite. C4 was probably used at both locations. The Israeli&#39;s that were arrested on 9/11 driving vans that had explosives in them or else had evidence that explosives were inside at one point were probably carrying C4 or something similar.</p>

<p>&quot;Silent explosive&quot;? Not likely. The company you linked to produces a &quot;silent demolition&quot; product they call <a href="http://www.demolitiontechnologies.com/silent-demolition.htm">expanding grout</a>. The <a href="http://www.demolitiontechnologies.com/expanding-grout-technical-info">spec page</a> describes it as follows:    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Utilizing this industry leading chemical demolition agent gives your project predictable, dust-free <strong>non-explosive</strong> demolition results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s just what it sounds like. You pour the expanding grout into cracks, it expands slowly <strong>over a period of 4-8 days</strong>, causing fracturing as it does so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re trolling. You said the company you cited had a &quot;silent explosive&quot; which isn&#39;t true. Obviously thermobaric explosives are not silent and don&#39;t operate on anything like the same principle as the expanding grout that slowly applies increasing pressure over a period of days. An explosion, in which energy is transmitted by a rapidly expanding shockwave, is not going to be silent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i wasn&#39;t comparing thermobaric explosives with silent explosives. I was pointing out that the military has developed a variety of explosives that could have been used. The only one so far that there is evidence of is thermite. Everything else is just a guess. As for the silent explosive, I guess I wasn&#39;t clear on the effects of the explosive but I still wonder if the Military has something similar only more advanced and doing more damage. As far as I&#39;m concerned, the fact that the building was brought down with explosives is the most likely scenario. Also the fact that thermite was used. So the rest is just hypothesizing based on eyewitness testimony, audio and video evidence and the damage done.</p>

<p>This and the steel magma.  <em>Any</em> amout of liquid steel is suspect.  Because it is absolutely not possible by laws of physics/chemistry.  It&#39;s something even a high schooler could calculate using heat of fusion calorie formula wrt melting point of steel, all of the mass in the building and jet fuel burning is not nearly enough to state change the steel to liquid.

    <div class="md"><p>This is why they freeze crime scenes and document everything before cleanup. The burned out cars shown in most of these photos were towed out of the disaster zone and dumped on FDR drive for later disposal. That&#39;s why they&#39;re so far away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess if true, this makes some sense as to why they were towed to FDR Drive.  But I also remember photos in parking lots full of cars, each in their own parking space.  If they were being moved there for later removal, would they have parked them so neatly?  Were those cars there prior to WTC collapses?

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because those are two separate sets of cars. There was a parking lot near the wtc which was annihilated, lots of dust, shattered windows, burned out wrecks. They were parked in their own parking space because they had been parked there before the collapses. The cars towed to fdr drive were cars that were on the streets by he wtc, including emergency response vehicles that arrived before the collapses.</p>

<p>There were burn patterns because some of the cars caught fire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. Im saying those cuts were diagonal as evidence of the building being rigged for controlled demolition. Above the excuse was that the cuts were made after the collapse.

<p>Why cut it diagonally? So that it slides off. It is recognizable as a cut made by an oxygen torch because it has a clean cut made horizontally with slag on the opposite side. A thermite cut would have sagging and wouldn&#39;t cut effectively horizontally as the thermitic material follows gravity as it melts whatever it is on top of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe nukes are more plausible than most of the explanations, though I don&#39;t rule any other possibilities like directed-energy weapons (DEWs) or other explanations out. In my view, however, controlled demolition by thermite seems highly unlikely considering that a demolition would have left much more physical debris than what we saw, which was tons of dust, pulverized material, and just <em>some</em> horrifically twisted pieces of metal. Additionally, <a href="https://youtu.be/M3ZkoNF2ybg">thermite causes a super-bright, fireball-like reaction</a>, and we definitely didn&#39;t see two pillars of fire falling. I feel as though controlled demolition was actually used on WTC7 in order to more easily spread the idea that the Twin Towers were brought down in the same way. That day is still too painful for most to keep investigating, so they&#39;ll usually stop searching once they hear of the easy explanation of controlled demolition. Never mind the fact that controlled demolitions do not act the way that the towers did when they fell. Even in saying all that, I&#39;m more than willing to be wrong.

<blockquote>
<p><em>The main chemical reaction in thermate is the same as in thermite</em>: an aluminothermic reaction between powdered aluminium and a metal oxide. In addition to thermite, thermate also contains sulfur and sometimes barium nitrate, both of which increase its thermal effect, create flame in burning, and significantly reduce the ignition temperature[1] Various mixtures of these compounds can be called thermate, but to avoid confusion with thermate-TH3, one can refer to them as thermite variants or analogs. The composition by weight of Thermate-TH3 (in military use) is 68.7% thermite, 29.0% barium nitrate, 2.0% sulfur and 0.3% binder (such as PBAN). As both thermite and thermate are notoriously difficult to ignite, initiating the reaction normally requires supervision and sometimes persistent effort.</p>

<p>So, I do believe so, yes, it would create the same, bright-white fireball.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evidence for Thermite was found in 4 seperate dust samples taken from 4 different locations in and around the WTC. Both unignited red/grey chips and iron mini-spheres, a byproduct of thermite.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that thermite was the only explosive used that day. multiple types of explosives were used. Very advanced explosives.</p>

<p>I found a private company that produces silent demolition explosives. NIST stated that the reason that they didn&#39;t check for explosives was because they weren&#39;t loud enough. If this private company can produce silent explosives, imagine what the Government has. <a href="http://www.demolitiontechnologies.com/silent-demolition.htm">http://www.demolitiontechnologies.com/silent-demolition.htm</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to thermite, I believe that C4 was also used. Eyewitnesses at the Pentagon stated that they smelled Cordite. C4 was probably used at both locations. The Israeli&#39;s that were arrested on 9/11 driving vans that had explosives in them or else had evidence that explosives were inside at one point were probably carrying C4 or something similar. WTC 1 and 2 were not conventional demolitions. It was a very advanced top down demolition. Eyewitnesses such as William Rodriguez stated that explosions ocurred in the sub basement of the Twin Towers prior to the planes hitting the building. The foundations were taken out first. Then the plane hit, which judging by the size of the fireball, were probably loaded with explosives. Following that, inside the elevator shaft, thermite was taking out the core support beams where witnesses are unable to see the thermite cutting through the steel beams. Once the decision was made to bring the building down, you can see and hear the explosions going off, below the collapse level, floor by floor.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in Judy Woods theory, although I have researched it. I&#39;ve seen a few videos with Judy Wood and she comes off as a kook. I don&#39;t believe Nukes were used because as far as I know, there is no evidence for it. I also don&#39;t believe in the no-plane theory. Planes were used but they were not the airliners that were hijacked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok I checked it out:</p>

<p>&quot;In automotive engineering, a firewall is the part of the bodywork that separates the engine from the driver and passengers.&quot;</p>

<p>Where does that say that the front is any more or less susceptible to a fire?  The firewall protects the passengers from a fire in the engine block and conversely protects the engine from a fire in the passenger area.  The engine is made up primarily of metal.  </p>

<p>This:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The front is the greatest threat of fire. </p>

<p>Is utter nonsense, and it you believe it then you should be ashamed of yourself.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are more sources of ignition in the front of the car than anywhere else.</p>

<p>You have engine oil, which is flammable. Engine oil + hot exhaust manifolds or pipes will absolutely create a fire source.</p>

<p>You have a battery, which if damaged or shorted by protrusion of a foreign object into the case or across the terminals, can generate extreme heat and can create red-hot metals that can easily be a point of ignition. </p>

<p>You have gasoline feed and return lines, that if damaged, can leak and either accelerate an existing fire, or once again if in contact with hot exhaust pipes can create one. </p>

<p>The exhaust system is hottest (aside from the catalytic converter, which is well isolated from contact with any flammable material on the car itself) nearest the engine. If foreign objects that are flammable themselves protrude into the engine bay and contact the exhaust, it is possible for ignition to start. If there is damage on the front end of the car and flammable components inside the engine bay (any of the plastic wiring sheathing or anything else made out of plastic) contact the exhaust manifold or piping, then fire can start that way as well. </p>

<p>So yes, the front is in fact the most dangerous part of a car with regard to fire starting potential. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright...  First of all bear in mind that the only substance that I have been given to refute is this belch that we all now have to deal with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The front is the greatest threat of fire. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since this statement is ambiguous, we are forced to ascertain the meaning of some of its parts.  Although we all know what happens when we assume we will have to do it here.</p>

<p>I assume Rockran does not mean to say that either end of the car is a &quot;threat&quot; of a fire in the first place.  If he/she is trying to tell us that the front end of a car (the part in front of the firewall) is inherently a &quot;threat&quot; of causing a fire, then this statement has no relevance to this thread at all.</p>

<p>So, then I assume that he/she means that the front end of the car is <em>more susceptible</em> to fire.</p>

<p>If that is that case then let&#39;s do an imagination experiment where we use Rockran&#39;s car (which he/she is assuredly making payments on using income garnered from spewing nonsense on Reddit) as an example:</p>

<p>If we chop his/her car into two pieces directly at the firewall, and you are given the front end while I am given the back end, which end do you think would be <em>more susceptible</em> to fire?  If you need a refresher on the internal parts of a car (like I did) check out <a href="http://repairpal.com/evaporative-control-system">this diagram</a>.  </p>

<p>I would submit that I would be able to more easily ignite my portion of the car given that my portion has the entire gas tank, and your portion is made primarily of metal and other cooling fluids.  </p>

<p>Also, keep in mind it would be pretty <strong>nonsensical</strong> to construct a combustion engine that is even the least bit susceptible to fire, let alone a <em>threat of fire</em>.  </p>

<p>Most fires start at the front of the car. I have spent countless hours at the track, demolition derbies, working on cars, racing cars. Fires start in the front of a car a majority of the time. there are electrical components, fuel lines, generally that&#39;s where the battery is placed, plenty of sources for a fire. </p>

<p>Sure the seats and headliner and all are easily combustible but they don&#39;t start fires by themselves and these cars aren&#39;t cut in half like your dumb little &quot;imagination experiment&quot;. yes cars can catch fire anywhere but generally they start at the front, this is the point rockran was making. </p>

<p>No one builds an engine to catch fire but its happened countless times. Ive seen it first hand many times and even had a friends car catch fire in front of my house. Guess where it started? The front of the car! </p>

<p>Basically you&#39;re just being a dick trying to argue something you clearly have no clue about and you look really stupid. </p>

<p>A metal door handle or engine could be hotter than tyres because metal conducts heat really well. Whereas rubber, less so. </p>

<p>You dont think that a 767 filled with 10 - 24,000 gallons of jet fuel might ignite other materials in the building that could cause a fire large enough to weaken floor joists?</p>

<p>No, not in the amount of time given, due to the structure of the building. Additionally, the supposed delivery method, and subsequent explosion, in no way account for evidence found, on-site, the day of. Nor could any combination of jet fuel, and traditional explosives, account for that evidence.
