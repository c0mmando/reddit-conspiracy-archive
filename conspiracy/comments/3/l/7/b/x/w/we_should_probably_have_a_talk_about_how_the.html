        /r/ae911truth

       ) is on the team, but we're losing the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       What shall be done?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because I have no fucking idea, but I love this place and don't want to leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like a replacement for
       <a href="/r/reddit.com">
        /r/reddit.com
       </a>
       and we're going to lose it because of some shit fuck (former moderator, O) who got too close to money and tried to fuck us by not disclosing his conflict of interest?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even going so far as to deny (in PM's from years ago) that he had any affiliations beyond "writing for the website".
      </p>
      <p>
       Folks, we are having a crises here.
      </p>
      <p>
       And either
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       wins or AE911 turth wins.

       should mods be accepting money in any way ?
      </p>
      <p>
       no.
      </p>
      <p>
       is that a reasonable ideal?
      </p>
      <p>
       ideal? yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       should O be held accountable in this case?  no.

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         doesn't it make sense that someone who MODS a /r/ is also a blogger on that topic ?  (duh?)  Or might you prefer MODS that have no interest in the topic they are modding ?? ;)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         i don't see how O has acted irresponsible towards this sub.

        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       In my opinion, the remaining MODS were brash.  overly twitchy trigger fingers.

      <p>
       RIP Orangutan -- you helped keep this sub great.  I can only hope the remaining subs will acknowledge and learn from this error in judgment, as they venture forward in pursuit of their own respective agenda.

       I find it very odd.

      <p>
       I never said anything, for fear he would come down on the subreddit and remove all mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       After today, I do believe he may have some connection to O and ae911truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as a subreddit what are we going to do?
      </p>
      <p>
       The very nature of faction is a result of that essential liberty which defines our contemporary ethic; to deny these men the right to be friends is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, how do we weigh that principle against the inevitable
       <em>
        effect
       </em>
       of said faction on things such as the free flow of information.

       will tell you how hard these ae911 guys drive an agenda.

      <p>
       I dont like it, and I feel we as a community (reddit admins included) have to stop the behavior.

       Community? Lol that what you think this is here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Come on man people in here are so goddamn full of hate and anger that they are just looking for a target. The "community" has shown its utter craziness time and time again by the acts of just recklessness.
      </p>
      <p>
       The daycare thing, then the doxxing of the families in the sandy hook shit. No what you have here is a shitload of people hellbent on fucking shit up.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter how many goddamn physicist, architects, and journalist you get to post story after story it won't matter. Ain't shit gonna change. You need a new angle. Over half the citizens don't believe the official story so what more can you do?
      </p>
      <p>
       Pick a new angle or find a new hobby. This isn't a fight you will win. You just won't so fuck it you have done all you can do. Enough people don't believe the bullshit. Hell 60% don't trust the government acts in our best interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't get the whole reason you are pissed. Is it cause you aren't part of the "crew" now? To hell with them. They want to do shady shit then so be it. Those in the community that choose to follow them can just keep doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck people. Can't save them all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said flip that switch and realize all form of social media are completely controlled. You think the members of this mod team are not influenced by an outside force? Lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even admin of reddit is. Hell they are the worst I think. I just don't care anymore. I highly doubt that even 10% of reddit users act the way they do on here as they do in real life.
      </p>
      <p>
       It shows in the hate they spew out. So you keep saying its a community cause maybe one day you will believe that.

       Then die trying. Cause I assure you without a real plan and support of a reputable source and even then nothing will change.

      <p>
       Usernames are not identities protected in law.
       <br/>
       Thats also why its not illegal for someone on another site to create the same username.

       I'd vote for Soverignman to stay, and AssuredlyAThrowaway to leave, considering AssuredlyAThrowaway is making up a fake story about AE911Truth "brigading" anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been essentially the exactly opposite, a massive brigading over the last few weeks by people who are explicitly anti-AE911Truth and users who instead have promoted the VeteransToday.com crowd, complete with sheer nonsense like "micro-nukes blew up the Twin Towers from 77m underground."
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        And either
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        wins or AE911 turth wins.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is hilariously absurd, considering ae911Truth has been the MOST credible and best truth group - really, the only truth group of any consequence, for a decade.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are at least two mods here that are clearly promoting bullshit and lies, so I suggest anyone interested in 911 to go to
       <a href="/r/911truth">
        /r/911truth
       </a>
       , a high quality sub with submissions based on evidence, science, and fact.

       Can someone explain why what seems to me, with my limited knowledge, to be the most reputable movement as far as 9/11 truth is considered, would ever vote brigade on a subreddit? I just don't get it. These people have jobs, they are adults, they probably don't have time for shit like this. And the time they do spend on this, to me, seems like it would be spent on propagating information to people. Why do people he here hate AE 9/11? They were the people that really firmly got me into the cause. They look really professional, and aren't the delusional conspiracy theorist trope, they're real people. Can someone explain this to me? Please?

       AE911Truth is being attacked precisely
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       they are the most effective and most credible 9/11 Truth group - really, they are the only 9/11 Truth group out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a group of about 5 users, two of them mods, that I know of that are involved in this attack on AE911Truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of them "just happen" to be the ones that post crazy nonsense about "micro-nukes" and other disinformation about 9/11 - the same disinformation that AE911Truth has always distanced themselves from.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods involved in attacking AE911Truth are the same mods who FAKED an AMA by Richard Gage of AE911Truth.

       Hey chicken little,  you're embarrassing yourself.  It's time for you to take a break from reddit I think. Go get a second job, or find a new hobby.

       Do you realize just how crazy you sound? Seriously, you couldn't do that if you tried and you know it for a fact. Why are you acting so insane? Did someone steal this account and is trying to discredit you? Or did something happen in your life that pushed you over the edge?

       Reddit will ban the account and you will get voicemail. Been there done that. So here is the trick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use this place as a source of entertainment. The trolls will continue to just fuck with you unless you do what I did. I can't say here cause well last time I did I lost that account.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no leadership here at all. Never was its just a drama inducted flurry of shit. Today its you tommrow its someone else. These people within reddit want to see a ahit show and you are giving them what they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you indeed brought something to the table then great they will miss it
 If not then no loss to you or them they won't have a reason to say a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are giving reddit money by posting comments and links to shit. Let these people within reddit turn it into an echo chamber. They are petty children looking for entertainment.

       I never said anything, for fear he would come down on the subreddit and remove all mods.

       After today, I do believe he may have some connection to O and ae911truth.

       But as a subreddit what are we going to do?

      <p>
       The very nature of faction is a result of that essential liberty which defines our contemporary ethic; to deny these men the right to be friends is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, how do we weigh that principle against the inevitable
       <em>
        effect
       </em>
       of said faction on things such as the free flow of information.
