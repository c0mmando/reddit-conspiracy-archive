<p><em>A rocket engine.</em></p>

<p>Okay, now we&#39;re getting somewhere.  So far we&#39;ve got a button and a rocket engine.  The Russians could build rocket engines but they never walked on the moon because they just couldn&#39;t come up with a decent button for getting back to earth.  I might have to make an <a href="/r/photoshoprequest">/r/photoshoprequest</a> for what a display at the Kennedy Space Center would look like for that fucking button.</p>

<p>Missing 700 cartons - what a joke. I like to also point out that nobody outside the Apollo missions has been past LEO (including Russia who know a thing about getting into space and unfortunately now also power America&#39;s biggest rocket - Atlas V). It makes no sense - space technology appears to be going backwards after Apollo.</p>

<p>I am not saying the shuttle was peak space - it&#39;s obsolete and was a poor design to start off with. But try focusing on what&#39;s been done in the past 10 years rather than work that was done over 40 years ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No comment on the fact that nobody else has bothered to go into LEO? Don&#39;t tell everybody else is that stupid - if NASA could do it, the Ruskies could do it. They had unlimited budget themselves via the state - until the collapse. </p>

<p>Also NASA themselves has not gone into LEO since. Amazingly only took them 8 years from barely getting into orbit to walking on the moon - and now cannot get into LEO at all. They had this apparently ultra successful launch vehicle which demonstrated capability to go into deep space. After spending untold amounts to develop this capability, then turn around and trash it after a few years. Everything since has been the ultimate struggle to do anything even close to the spectacular lunar missions. Its ridiculous. Its like developing the Nautilus nuclear sub and trashing the plans after a few demonstrations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No comment on the fact that SpaceX is at the forefront of being able to do just that within the next few years - that is the point that I am making, and that seems to be sailing over your head. </p>

<p>And as far as the government not doing so, it does many amazingly stupid things on a regular basis - why should spaceflight be any different? And as I also pointed out, Apollo was not a sustainable program - yes the rocket had huge lift capability, but it was thrown away every time. If the shuttle had worked as designed, it would have been more efficient. However, it was developed by committe with many different demands placed on the vehicle, and as such was able to do none of them well at all.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>SpaceX hasn&#39;t done shit yet - they are far away from being able to reliably transport materials to the ISS - let alone manned space flight. No way they are in LEO &quot;within the next few years&quot; or for a very long time. </p>

<p>ABout 75% of the Shuttle had to be rebuilt everytime - it was a colossal waste in terms of costs. Every other nation has decided to stick with the throwaways instead and indeed NASA themselves are going back to the throwaways for the Orion (whenever that happens). Makes no sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>rolls eyes</em> SpaceX has done more in the past decade than anyone else has done in the past 25 years. That&#39;s hardly &quot;shit&quot;.

<p>You seem to fail to understand that I am not saying the shuttle was perfect - far from it. All I am saying is that there is more going on than the shuttle, and focusing on that and ignoring what&#39;s going on in other areas today is myoptic. </p>

<p>Neither is SpaceX at the &quot;forefront&quot; as you claim. They have just had a string of catastrophic failures. I hate to say that because I&#39;m a fan of them - love the grasshopper landing approach. BUt things apparently waay easier using 1960s technology: 1961 - barely into orbit: 1969 - walking on the moon. I&#39;m afraid that is an unbelievable rate of progress and since, decline. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So one failure is a &quot;string&quot; now? If you&#39;re including the failures of the landing attempts, I remind you that those were using portions of the vehicle that would otherwise have been thrown away. Each landing attempt was a learning experience that they will continue to improve until it reuse of the first stage becomes a regular occurrence. </p>

<p>And I notice that you seem to conveniently forget the sheer number of failures that happened both prior to and during the 1961-1969 time frame that you reference. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks for the np info.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been bringing up the moon question for a long time and nobody can answer it.  I got banned from a pro-Apollo website because no one could answer the question.  I also got banned from a pro-hoax website because I argued that the space station was real because I had worked on it.  (Although, while I was working on it I never thought it would fly.)</p>

<p>It&#39;s good that some people here are anti-conspiracy otherwise there would be no debate possible.  I got banned from those other websites because everybody on them was of like mind and they just banned any detractors.  Not one person agreed with me, not even to be the devil&#39;s advocate.</p>

Check out the weird editing of some of the key words.  I&#39;ll assume where the word was whited out and the word  &#39;on-board&#39; was typed in its place it might have just said simulated or prototype.  The conclusion doesn&#39;t even follow what the rest of the progress report says.   How can things which have yet to have been done been &quot;extensively tested&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting find.  &quot;IMU&quot; was used as a global replacement for something.  I wonder what acronym could have been used before &quot;IMU&quot; at the release of this document in April 1969?</p>

<p>They used a star finder.</p>

<p><em>The sextant articulating star line of sight makes the precision
measurement of star direction for the IMU alignment.</em></p>

<p>The effort to get back from the moon seems somewhat tentative and even more hair raising than the entire Apollo 13 kerfuffle, yet it&#39;s never really mentioned how involved it was in any documentary I&#39;ve seen.  Of course, one thing that makes me skeptical about the moon landing is that everything worked perfectly 6 times, plus being able to salvage Apollo 13.  And Apollo 13 was the perfect mission to fail if you were writing a movie script because... &quot;13.&quot;  What are the Vegas odds on all that?</p>

<p>I hang out regularly with an 83 year old guy who worked under von Braun and was one of the key engineers in solving the CO2 problem on Apollo, and was one of the guys portrayed in the movie when they dumped the box of socks and duct tape, etc., out on the table saying they found a solution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I&#39;m sure you figured out, people get VERY bristled when you bring up the indisputable <strong>fact</strong> that man has never walked on the moon.</p>

<p>I enjoy the Russians&#39; answer as to why THEY never walked on the moon: &quot;We couldn&#39;t figure out a way, using the technology of that time, to safely traverse the Van Allen belts.&quot;</p>

<p>And remember, the Soviets kicked our asses all over the place in the &quot;space race&quot; throughout the 1960s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the major arguments used by the Apollo apologists is that there were laser reflectors put on the moon, with larger ones placed there on a later mission.  But the Russians had already been bouncing a laser off the moon long before that, the moon being shiny and everything as it is.  I even checked how many photons you would be able to detect that were valid reflections from the reflective panels and it was just a few photons given the divergence of the laser beam. </p>

<p>It&#39;s plausible that the Russians faked the Gagarin mission to claim the first man in space and NASA told them they could have the first man in space if you let us fake the first man on the moon.</p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to grant the pro-Apollo people the Van Allen Belts and all the other issues, but they still have to answer the one question regarding getting off the moon by just pushing a button.  Going to the moon is easy, getting back home is the really hard part, and the part that has always been glossed over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No comment on the fact that nobody else has bothered to go into LEO? Don&#39;t tell everybody else is that stupid - if NASA could do it, the Ruskies could do it. They had unlimited budget themselves via the state - until the collapse. </p>

<p>Also NASA themselves has not gone into LEO since. Amazingly only took them 8 years from barely getting into orbit to walking on the moon - and now cannot get into LEO at all. They had this apparently ultra successful launch vehicle which demonstrated capability to go into deep space. After spending untold amounts to develop this capability, then turn around and trash it after a few years. Everything since has been the ultimate struggle to do anything even close to the spectacular lunar missions. Its ridiculous. Its like developing the Nautilus nuclear sub and trashing the plans after a few demonstrations. </p>
