       . I love all people, but we all live under authoritarian governments. Sadly, the Jews are being used (once again) by TPTB, and they (for the most part, accept it and champion it). With that being said, there is a small (very small) minority here, posting race baiting shit.

       I'm not sure about that. I could post a few handle's who do (I wont). I do not think the mods are "in on it" or "complacent". Free speech comes with filthy speech and the people are left to decide what get's up/downvoted. I think the mods here are doing a great job, walking that fine line. I've had my run ins, but they were most likely worthy of it, lol. I'm an ass, sometimes.

       I don't hate Jews.  I just don't trust or share views with anyone in the entire world who requires a condition of someone else suffering as part of their acceptable conditions for success.  Built into the very works of Jewish Monetary Philosophy in Socio-Religious contexts are premises that some are chosen to be wealthy, and others must be deliberately impoverished.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a side edict to Tikkun, or "good will" which is the opportunity for philanthropy as a way to excuse the immoral practices necessary to gain disproportionate wealth.  Masoretic Judiasm carries and promotes a strong heritage that God makes his chosen wealthy, by their own deception and ambition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not hold this against ALL Jewish persons, or ONLY Jewish persons.  In fact, there are some Jews who purge such mess from their religion, recognizing it as a ROMAN influenced redaction.  Then again, this does not indicate by any means I take issue with every Italian, just some of their tenets that aide, abet, and generate an atmosphere of corporate and governmental deception as a means of success for a specific designation of people.

       If Jews did bad things, people will talk bad about them. Simple. Its just sad that the term Jews includes 99% of the innocent ones, when the accused are probably just 1% of them. Its also a tragedy that 99% of the Jews don't speak up for the sins of the few.

       Your question is based on a false premise. This sub (I presume you mean the subscribers to this sub) don't hate Jews. The reason you
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       they hate Jews is because Jews are criticized as a group here. There are not many other places where Jews are criticized for their crimes. The freedom to criticize the actions of Jews is perceived by you as hatred, because you've been brainwashed all  your life, by Jews, that you must never question or criticize Jews.

       There's no common element that really ties the Jews together - they're all different kinds of people from different walks of life, and they have all different beliefs about everything, including what even constitutes a Jew. It makes no sense for Jews to be "criticized as a group" or "criticized for their crimes," because Jewish individuals commit crimes for individual reasons, but the entire group of Jews does not. If you can't figure out this incredibly basic fact, you are a simpleton and an idiot, and your thinking is worthless.

       you sure are going through a lot of trouble to justify discriminating against Jews, and to harass me about it in particular. I'm getting less and less interested in talking to you by the minute, due to this erratic and senseless behavior. Just a heads up.
      </p>
      <p>
       All Jews view their religion differently, just like all Americans view their nation differently. Most Jews just consider themselves Jews because they were born into Jewish families, or because they have Jewish heritage, and don't actually practice Judaism as a religion. I know some rabbinical sources encourage the acquisition of wealth, but you also won't even be able to find a Jew on the street who knows these rabbinical sources, I guarantee it. Not to mention the acquisition of wealth isn't even evil in itself, just like I said earlier.

       I don't work for anyone, you paranoid weirdo. I understand you might have reason to be suspicious, as there really are pro-Israeli shills posting on message boards for a paycheck, but any idiot should be able to look at my post history and realize I'm an actual person with all kinds of different interests and perspectives, and I'm not being paid to shill for Israel. In fact, humorously enough, I don't support Israel period,
       <strong>
        I believe Israel is a terrorist state.
       </strong>
       I just think it's completely ridiculous how people blame "the Jews" for so many things when it's literally impossible for such a diverse group of unrelated people to be conspiring about anything. That's the only reason I argue at all - because these posts about "the Jews" are completely ridiculous garbage and deserve to be shut the fuck down.

       just because you got a downvote doesn't mean I gave it to you, Mr. Paranoid. Also, look at some of the other conversations I'm having in this thread, and look at many of the other top-level comments in this thread, and, if you want, go look through my post history for all the other times I've had similar conversations. There are definitely
       <em>
        very many

       people here who blame "the Jews" as a whole and not just Zionism or the state of Israel, and I'm not making them up. Some of those people are in this very thread, plain as day, and you have no excuse for not noticing them. They're fucking everywhere. In fact

        anybody

       who is not Jewish. It is a race hate bible which declares that only Jews are human, and describes the goyim (non-Jews) as beasts. It encourages and/or permits Talmud-adherents to cheat, lie, steal, rape and murder non-Jews, declaring such actions to be "non-criminal".

       That might be a valid point in some alternate and idealized version of the world, but the fact is, I bet you can't even find a Jew who understands those things about the Talmud. I bet you can't even find one on the street who knows any of the things you're saying. Most of them just consider themselves Jews culturally, or based on their familial associations, or based on their ethnicity, without practicing any ideology whatsoever. So it still makes just as little sense to blame them as a group, and you're being completely ridiculous.

       I do, because, like I said, many Jews aren't Jews according to the practice of Judaism at all, but according to very basic traditions, according to the customs of their families, and according to their heritage - similarly to how people often say they're Catholic just because their family is Catholic, or because they go to Catholic church once a year for a holiday. Actual devotees of Rabbinic Judaism are a pretty niche subset of Jews these days, especially in the West. Do you think most Catholics know their own defining religious texts?

       A religion which does not categorize the acquisition of wealth as a sin, is an enormous threat to me, and everyone I know, and don't know. They actually encourage it. The wealthiest members of Jewish communities are often that communities spiritual leaders. This is a problem for the rest of the world because money and power are exactly the same thing, and it's what has gotten them in trouble again and again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of this is all around you with Jewish domination of Hollywood, the media, banking and finance, and especially American politics.

       There's no reason acquiring wealth should be considered a sin, there's really nothing wrong with it as far as I can tell. If you acquire wealth and you don't share with others in need, though, or if you use the wealth immorally, I think that's definitely wrong and should be identified as wrong. The Hebrew Scriptures are full of many instructions for those with wealth to share with others in need, and not to lend with interest, and stuff like that. They're common themes and they're reiterated many times. So it doesn't really make any sense to say the religion itself is the problem.

       Honestly, it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       See the story of Cain, a murderer, who is given a NATION and diplomatic immunity from heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
       See the story of Abram who discards the surrogate mother that Rachel consented to allow to bear him a child.  Then see how he almost tricked the king if Canaan to commit adultery (which would have left him IN DEBT OF SLAVERY to Abram)
      </p>
      <p>
       See the story of Jacob, who tricks his father into giving his birthright to the wrong son, and this is GOD's PLAN?
      </p>
      <p>
       See the story of Solomon, risen to a godly throne by a sanctioned assassination in secret, plotted by their highest leaders of religion and politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       See the story of Cyrus,..
      </p>
      <p>
       When does the world look at how what the biblical god does is by the same standard of judgement that which we are indoctrinated to fear; how the corrupt keep their iron fist in a silk glove upon the yokes around all our necks?  In Isaiah, he even says to Cyrus,  everything you do good, is all good.  Screw Good and Evil, cause I made them both.  He encourages Cyrus in Persia to do EXACTLY what the current conspiracy are all based around...   Confuse, Conspire, and Confound, and Conquer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if it is not just Jews, or all Jews, the inspiration is EXACTLY this story, the chaos created that the order of the second temple arises out of.  How the prosperity and poverty of nations were both cards in the same deck to fuel secret HOLY SANCTIONED world building events... that people were distracted from either by the emergent need of their own survival, or the distractions of their own greed.  And ANY attempt at truth by any but the chosen was met with financed and endorsed rumor.  Even plotting to cause sin foreign nations to cause them to totally lose sight of common sense and human decency...  moral decay.
      </p>
      <p>
       I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things. (Isaiah 45:7)
      </p>
      <p>
       The danger of the story of Cyrus is that from it emerges that as the chosen people are God's chosen, they do what god tells them to, and it is good...  even if it would be evil for anyone else.   The old testament ESPECIALLY instructs the world to live in a double standard existence where the excuse for any action for a Jew is "God Approves", or as it is now written on the US Dollar "Annuit Coeptis."
      </p>
      <p>
       The only consequence of a Jew, by Old Testamen edict is the punisment of God HIMSELF, and to this end he can conceal any and EVERY atrocity -  but the Midrash says he should not endeavor to abuse TOO MUCH this privilege.  Though if he does, he is fulfilling prophecy which says this is what makes necessary a messiah,  the abuse of some Jews of their UNIVERSAL PRIVILEGE FROM EXCLUSIVE AND HOLY PREFERENCE.

       there were a few things in your post that seemed like they might've been coherent enough to respond to, but it's all surrounded by so much inaccurate understanding and painfully flawed reasoning that I can't even justify trying to appeal to your sensibility, as I expect it will be completely pointless. My honest advice to you is to assume you're much less intelligent than you now believe you are, and to only permit yourself to make declarative assessments according to that assumption. That is: trust yourself and your conclusions much less. I genuinely can't even respect what you're saying and just find it to be ridiculous nonsense. Just fyi.

       I don't think acquiring wealth and coveting power are the same at all. I think there can be some overlap, definitely, and I would agree that a lot of people are doing it wrong, but I think there are also means of acquiring wealth that don't necessarily have any relation to coveting power whatsoever.

       Okay, that just put you over the line, buddy. The statement you're making about money is completely illogical, and it shows me that trying to reason with you is completely pointless. So I'm not even going to bother doing it any more.

      <p>
       I'm not a Jew, I don't even give a shit about Jews, I don't even give a shit if you're racist or not. None of those things, I care about. The only thing I care about is that very stupid people are making

       a shitty place with their shitty posts, and those posts just happen to be about Jews.

       The acquisition of wealth is the single greatest threat the world faces today. Do you have any idea how much money it costs to wage war? Do you think it's actually possible to oppress 350,000,000 people
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       money? Do you think it's possible to brainwash us with Hollywood propaganda without money?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at how politicians pander to Zionists for campaign donations, and it's as crystal clear as glass what the issue is--
       <strong>
        the concentration of money
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       What are you even doing here? Do you even believe 9/11 was an inside job? Are you even a conspiracy theorist?

       like I said, what you're saying is completely illogical. Yes, bad things are done with the aid of money. However, the acquisition of money has no actual relationship to those things. It's completely possible to acquire money and not use it to do evil things. Money doesn't cause those things to happen in any way, they happen because evil people cause them to happen. The issue isn't "the concentration of money" - it's evil people, who just happen to be using money.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe the 9/11 attacks were staged, yes. I believe in plenty of conspiracies and believe most authorities and most powerful figures to be corrupt. I just don't believe in the nonsense you're posting, because it's illogical and it doesn't make any sense.

       That doesn't mean anything at all! Just like saying money equals free speech doesn't mean anything. The things you're saying have no meaning whatsoever! You just keep acting like they do, with no logic at all. Because of this, I cannot even be bothered trying to reason with you any more.

       Money and power are synonymous. Money literally buys power. A great example of this is Ross Perot in his presidential bid-- he did it all with the concentration of wealth. Money can, and has, flawed countless scientific studies. Corrupted hundreds of millions of people.
       <strong>
        It is the single most powerful, tangible resource on the planet.

        "The real reason people want to be rich isn’t so they can buy stuff. It’s so they can have power over others. People want influence and respect and they see that people with money have influence and respect, so they seek money."

        " One of the most obvious examples is politics. Ross Perot was an unkown
multimillionaire and his money is the only reason that he made it into the

with money."

       Big surprise, you're defending them. You're either a straight up race traitor who thinks whites are overprivileged, or JIDF. I'm leaning with the latter. The white race has done more for the technological progress of this world, than any other in the history of man. That alone should be the one and only measure of a race, as nothing else will allow the
       <em>
        entire

       I don't care about race or characterize people by race, only simple minded imbeciles do that. I characterize people by the attributes that actually play roles in how they behave and what they do, because those are the only attributes that actually matter. Maybe whites do contribute more of this or that, but it's not because they're white - it's just because of those attributes. As far as I'm concerned there's no such thing as race, and no conversation about race has any meaning. I just shut down the morons who bring stupidity to the table, that's it, nothing else.

       I think the grey area only exists for those of us who don't understand the dynamics of the situation. If we don't literally focus on our survival, we will most certainly perish. Are you really that unfamiliar with the consequences of multiculturalism?
      </p>
      <p>
       As we speak, other races are increasing in size exponentially, while Caucasian populations sit stagnate. Germany's population has been relying on freaking immigrants just to maintain! It's a virtual fact, that at the rate things are going now, the white race will be all but gone in 100 years. That is not something I intend to sit by and simply watch.

       The "forces" you speak of work against us, either organically, or with nefarious intent. The only thing standing in the way of a Jewish one world government, is the white race. At least I have enough resolution to attempt to do something about it...
      </p>
      <p>
       The only race on the planet with multiple eye, and hair colors. One of the smallest, yet most dominate in the history of the world, with more technological marvels and feats of accomplishment than any other does not deserve to just die out, and fuck you for thinking so.

       I never claimed I believe the white race deserves to die out, that's a pretty serious thing to accuse me of believing when I never said anything even similar. You're the only one worried about the white race dying out. I already told you: I don't care about race at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       in a hypothetical situation where whites are outbred by other races, or where all ethnicities are completely mixed and the world becomes one race, the same attributes that have allowed whites to make their technological advancements would continue to exist, even if whites no longer existed. This is because there is no relationship between those technological advancements and the ethnicity of white people - no relationship at all. Those white people just happened to be in the right place at the right time, and that's the reason those technological advancements occurred - not because of their ethnicity. So there's really nothing to worry about.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had an accurate understanding like I do, you wouldn't need to worry yourself about such silly things, like the Jews, or like protecting the fate of white people, or whatever other nonsense you worry about. Those topics and those viewpoints are only for confused people who lack understanding. It is impossible for a sensible person or a mature person to take them seriously.

       You are asking the wrong question. The correct question should be:
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are Jews involved in so much wrongdoing, exploitation, war crimes, abuse and general injustice against fellow man, that you'd have hell of a hard time finding a misdeed that Jews don't have their hand in?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you tend to see many posts about Jews, it's not because people hate Jews, but because Jews do evil things incomparably more often than anyone else. If they stopped doing it, pure magic would happen - the posts about them would decrease significantly.

       I don't have a problem with Jews, I have a problem with Zionists that want to further their cultural war against the European peoples for whatever ends thry're pursuing.  I don't know exactly what they want, but it involves the rise of a global monoculture and the total destruction of the Caucasian race.

       Either the racists lost every other sub they once hung out in or else they are here solely for the purpose to ruin this sub and discredit the conspiracy theory community… However, "this sub" does not hate any race. Hate and racism has nothing to do with why we are here. My question is, why are the racists here now? The moderators need to ban every account promoting racist views, like NOW before this sub sinks entirely… which is probably the point of why they are allowed to be here.

       between like 200ad and the end of ww2 jews had been expelled from like 80 countries, roughly one every 20 years. I think they've simply been hated by so many various groups it creates a larger feeling of hatred.

       There's no reason acquiring wealth should be considered a sin, there's really nothing wrong with it as far as I can tell. If you acquire wealth and you don't share with others in need, though, or if you use the wealth immorally, I think that's definitely wrong and should be identified as wrong. The Hebrew Scriptures are full of many instructions for those with wealth to share with others in need, and not to lend with interest, and stuff like that. They're common themes and they're reiterated many times. So it doesn't really make any sense to say the religion itself is the problem.
