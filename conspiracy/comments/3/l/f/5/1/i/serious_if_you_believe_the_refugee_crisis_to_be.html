    <div class="md"><p>What I believe:</p>

<p>US/NATO created and is nurturing the mid-eastern extremists, and by proxy the refugees.</p>

<p>This is so that they can point the finger at the countries refugees are flooding in from and demonstrate how terrible the leaders are, how horrendous the conditions are, how dangerous the jihadists are. That way we will be convinced to allow boots on the ground. There are different... subplots? Different factions working together towards mutually beneficial goals, working different angles. But probably different endgames. </p>

<p>For zionists, its about claiming greater Israel. </p>

<p>For the military industrial complex, it&#39;s about the money; the racket of war.</p>

<p>For Washington (ex: W. Bush) it&#39;s about the oil and the strategic value of the middle east. It&#39;s also about clinical narcissism gaining power by any means necessary- The Prince- and keeping the masses in check through fear. Herding the sheep, if you will.</p>

<p>For the western Elites, it&#39;s a game of Risk. Controlling the middle east is about goading Russia into war with the West. Because the elites want to rule the world, and that can&#39;t happen until Russia and China are crushed. The cold war never ended. They&#39;re the ones with nukes that still oppose the western elites. Also North Korea will have to be dealt with at some point... but they&#39;re not really a threat- once Russia and China are out of the way, North Korea is <strong>burnt toast</strong>.</p>

<p>Additionally, they want race war. The media has been stirring it up for a long time- they&#39;re constantly demonizing any given race one breath; the next they&#39;re encouraging integration. Think about it- blacks are thugs. hispanics are illegals. whites are racists. middle-easterners are terrorists. But then they show (staged) images of poor refugees washed up and preach about solidarity- we need to accept these refugees. </p>

<p>That&#39;s because they want us all together, but they want us to hate each other. They want us to break out into civil war. The reality is, we pose no threat to TPTB, only to each other. And when we break out against each other, it gives them more excuse to crack down- to expand their powers. Remember Boston immediately after the Boston Marathon Hoaxing? That was a test to see how readily everyone would submit to martial law. It happened all too easily for them.</p>

<p>That&#39;s also why they want to turn the public vs the police. Don&#39;t get me wrong, there is a lot of corruption in the police forces. But as afraid as the public is of police- that&#39;s how afraid many good police are of the public. The police would be the bulwark of the public against domestic military occupation -meaning forced quartering and cracking down on &quot;insurgency&quot;- so they turn the public against the police and the police against the public. </p>

<p>Then there are the puppet masters. I believe that this is <em>all</em> a game to them, with the ultimate goal being mass population reduction. They want to hit the &quot;reset&quot; button on human history. They don&#39;t want to give up their luxuries but they also know that the current trajectory of humanity is not at all sustainable. There are far too many of us and we are growing exponentially. There simply aren&#39;t enough resources to go around, so they want us to kill each other off. Billions will die.  </p>

<p>What is the solution? I wish I knew. I don&#39;t think there is one, honestly. Because... history and human nature rule against us.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s not go down without some sort of fight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. This was a great read and put a few of my scrambled thoughts on all these matters into clear context. I&#39;m particularly interested in the race-war aspect you mention. I see such huge levels of thinly veiled hatred on my facebook and twitter each day that it;s impossible to notice. This process has had me wondering for a while now as it&#39;s so obvious how TPTB go about their daily dehumanization, rather than simple demonization of people, that they surely must have a truly sinister motive behind doing so. I&#39;m kinda thinking along the lines of 1940&#39;s Germany, the movie Children of Men actually springs to mind too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>RE: the race war</p>

<p>It&#39;s good that you can see the resemblance between what is going on today and what happened in the 1940&#39;s. I recommend doing some reading on the ties of Prescott Bush, The Royal Family, American multinationals (Ford, Coca-Cola, Chase Bank, and many others) to the Nazis. </p>

<p>There is a disturbing truth that not only are we facing the same type of problems... we&#39;re actually facing the same exact enemies. Their children at least. </p>

<p>And what&#39;s going on in the middle east is a genocide. </p>

<p>We must remember that race- like religion and political identity- are mere constructs. They&#39;re intangible and they lack scientific foundation. I&#39;m not saying to detach yourself from all beliefs. But I am saying that these ethnic/ideological identities were designed created and promoted in order to create tribalism.</p>

<p>They want tribalism because that turns us against each other. Divide and conquer. They learned that united we stand, divided we fall. So there will always be emphasis on what divides us, instead of the simple reality that we&#39;re all almost exactly the same. There&#39;s hardly any natural variation among humans. Our biggest divisions are cultural. </p>

<p>The last republican debate made it more clear to me than ever- they&#39;re offering us different flavours of ice cream, but whatever scoop you choose is poisoned. Then they convince us that the people who chose the other flavours should be held accountable, instead of the people serving us the ice cream. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I remember correctly... They portrayed Kennedy as having little or nothing to do with the CIA and Vietnam. I think they went so far as to claim that the Bay of Pigs was done behind Kennedy&#39;s back entirely.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all bullshit. </p>

<p>I think they talked about him being &quot;the greatest kind of American&quot; or something like that. That&#39;s either as whitewashed as its possible to get, or it&#39;s suggesting that Americans are very poor stock. </p>

<p>His philandering... eh. I don&#39;t see it as relevant to his performance as president. But it does speak something to his psychology. </p>

<p>Anyway, I just remember thinking that they seemed to exonerate him of any wrong doing, ever. Maybe my recollection is flawed though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply, they did fluff Kennedy up a bit but the documentary is solid otherwise as far as pointing out certain things about the man.</p>

<p>And his philandering? Not really an issue, MLK jr did certain things himself but it is what the message he was on about that was the important thing. Not his sexual activities because he was not giving speeches about that as far as I am concerned.</p>

<p>And most Christians follow the tenet that they are born to sin and that by doing so they are not technically wrong since they can pray for forgiveness after any act.</p>

<p>Which is one of the main reasons I do not like people that do not take personal responsibility for their actions, right or wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no doubt for sure a proxy genocide.</p>

<p>all those &#39;terror&#39; groups are funded by west, and western powers know exactly what they&#39;re doing. E.U. will be majority Muslim within 100 years and Middle East will be a free for all for the west to swoop in and take all oil resources, while also allowing Israel to expand without much pressure with their 3 kid minimum policy.</p>

<p>I think Islam will do good economically and bring E.U. together as an Islamic power nation, which will unfortunately breed more terrorism and start a massive WW III that will basically be Islam Vs. Rest of world</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate the fact that its either Predictive Programming that creates some of the best anime on the topic of an A.I. running society in years: &quot;Psycho Pass&quot;.</p>

<p>Or its people accessing the collective unconsciousness to gain awareness of things without realizing it to create said fiction.</p>

<p>Said show I mentioned demonstrates why it is a bad idea to have an A.I. run everything, like the article you linked to, it generally behaves like a sociopath.</p>

<p>Thank you for the reminder of this link. I had read about this project some time ago, but forgot about it.</p>

<p>Yes, but unfortunately a lot of alternative media is as well. The Young Turks are the largest alternative news group (I believe?) and    sadly, they&#39;re total shills... and I&#39;m not even sure if they&#39;re aware or not. </p>

<p>Alternative media is being infiltrated and manipulated. I&#39;m terrified for the day, very soon, when the internet will be completely controlled. Once tv is totally obsolete, they&#39;ll take the freedom of the internet away. They&#39;ve already made attempts and steps towards it. </p>

<p>:O MAYBE, just maybe.... once they take away our pr0n they&#39;ll have taken things 1 step too far. And the people will burn DC to the ground. </p>

<li>People on the lower end of society (living just above, on, or under the bread line) get pissed off that refugees are being given asylum while their government does fuck all for their situation</li>
<li>Rather than looking at the source of the problem (constant unwarranted Western intervention in the Middle East causing more and more crises and a lack of compassion from the government for the plight of its own citizens) they look to the &quot;problem&quot;, and blame the refugees for the poor standards (as per the media&#39;s dictation of events)</li>
<li>More people support the war effort due to a detachment from the actual event and a growing annoyance with the dropping standards in their own countries which is happening alongside an influx of people seeking a safe place to live (two separate events which, to the layman, can be viewed as cause and effect)</li>

    <div class="md"><p>There will never be a &quot;WWIII&quot;. It would destroy the planet; what they want instead is slow, calculated genocide. Africa and parts of Asia need little help with that, but the West needs a push. The race war is what is coming, followed by a civil war. Our only hope is to bridge the gaps between races in our own communities, and stop this process from taking root. Once they take our guns, it&#39;s over. Bring in the Russians, bring in the Chinese; there will be no more nation-states. One World Government, for better or for worse, is where were going. The question is, who would you rather see in charge? Do you want Obama to be in office when shtf? That would lead us into a worldwide, all powerful Islamic Caliphate? With him as the new &quot;prophet&quot;. Or would you prefer a socialist, neo-nazi police state under the Clintons? Those seem to be our options, cause let&#39;s face it; Trump is a prank on us and Bernie Sanders is a pipe dream. Whoever is in office WHEN this crisis goes full force gets to be dictator. That&#39;s why you see some division in Washington. </p>

<p>A &quot;cleansing&quot; of the planet by the sociopaths is a viable thought that they do have. One way to look at it is presented nicely in this video:</p>

well, once confronted by the international community for (largely, but not solely) creating this refugee crisis, the usa will be forced to take in a massive number of refugees as &quot;reparations&quot;. they&#39;ll dump &#39;em in the camps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>End result/s:</p>

<p>Solidifying social party powers.  By ensuring party victories, it enrichens those who publicly support those ideologies.  </p>

<p>Increasing population, for monetary gain.  Increasing demands on housing, services, and tax base yields for greater monetary supply.  More supply means more governing.  More governing means more steering of funds to those affiliated with those in power.</p>

<p>Stepping back to housing, they&#39;ll all need loans.  These loans will all be paid with interest.  </p>

<p>Honestly, I think the means to be more economic than social in origin.  </p>
