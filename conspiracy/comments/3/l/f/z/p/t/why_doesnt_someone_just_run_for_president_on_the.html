       Because there are still a large number of Americans who are too traumatized to want to believe that it wasn't actually middle eastern terrorists. The MSM would gang up on them and snuff them out. Plus the elections are rigged so it wouldn't matter.

       That's why I think the electoral college exists. They would probably never allow a real candidate a place on the ballot, but if somehow somebody slid through, the electoral college could nullify the votes.

       I legit don't get how people like Larry can smile. He obviously doesn't have what most people refer to as a 'soul'. He doesn't have empathy, he doesn't feel emotions. Nothing has meaning to him, I don't understand, he obviously doesn't care about being alive or dead, he doesn't care his family, he doesn't care about the future, his country, his homeland, nothing, he's just a dead beaten hollow empty puppet of a human being, incapable of contentment or reaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what goes through his brain, what is the neurological structure of these people? Honestly I kind of understand how people end up believing in the lizard people shit, because it's a pretty good explanation of how someone like Larry Silverstein is able to function as a living organism yet at the same time doesn't have a fully functioning consciousness. It's bizarre, it's like he's a programmable robot or something, just input the code and beep boop he'll do whatever is programmed into him. Fucking bizarre, really does anyone else have an answer? I can't figure it out, there's 0 logic. No value of life, can't value his own life, yet willing to go so far for money for a life that he doesn't value??? My brain is about to fucking melt this is so stupid...
      </p>
      <p>
       He doesn't have emotions so he can't feel empathy.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if he can't feel emotions then why would he value his own life so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       He values 0 other lives, so life to him has 0 value.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet his life has value, yet no value, so he cares about his life but he can't comprehend that other things are alive so life is nothing yet he values nothing so he's hollow so he doesn't care about being alive and why does everything suddenly taste like copper?

       It's because people justify their actions. They legitimately think they're doing the world a favor by bringing us towards the NWO.  The show Utopia displays this perfectly lol

       The great thing about the West today is that assassinations are no longer necessary. In the past they were because the vote was unified and the population was homogeneous. Today, with the injection of foreign populations into European society mixed with the flipping of values and social thought through liberalism, true conservatism or libertarian-ism poses no threat. Everything has been secured from the government to the dinner table. These people can never become president today. They've completely removed any possibility for strong leadership for liberal values and political majorities that pander back and forth, completely masking the corporate strings above. The reason we can't have leaders is because our borders have been secretly dismantled under neo-liberal "free" market.

       Most people just don't care about this issue.  They make their decision based on economics (jobs, houses, price of gasoline, taxes, etc), ideology (religion, political party), image of candidate, single issues such as gun control or abortion or gay marriage or whatever.  9/11 isn't even on the RADAR for most people.

       My theory is that they told Obama once he was inaugurated the actual truth about 9/11. And the real truth is too damaging and could single-handedly tear down any shred of trust we have left in the government.
