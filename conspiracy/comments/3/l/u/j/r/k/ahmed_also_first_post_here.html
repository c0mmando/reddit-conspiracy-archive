       Alright, time to talk about something that has been bugging me for a while now; Let's talk about Ahmed.
We all know that Ahmed made a clock and they thought it was a bomb and he was arrested, etc. But there is a couple of problems with this.
First, they didn't think it was really a bomb. There was no bomb squad that was called, and did not follow any sort of potential bomb protocols. Obviously they knew it wasn't a bomb also because they brought it with them to the station when they arrested him.
Second, Admed's clock, wasn't his invention or stroke of genus, but rather, an older clock taken apart and places inside of a pencil case. If you look closely at the images of the clock, you'll notice that it's using a manufactured board, and ribbon cable, while also using AC power. Most if not all, makers wouldn't have the money to manufacture their own boards; they would use a project board like a pi, or beagle bone.
This whole thing seems sorta fishy to me, I wonder what kind of news we missed while this shit was clogging up our feeds. Or maybe it was just a racist attack? I don't know.

       In my opinion, it was definitely the father's influence (plausibly he is working as part of a covert op) and it was in fact intended to be a hoax bomb that would get Ahmed arrested.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider that
      </p>
      <p>
       ~It looks exactly like a fucking IED. This is indisputable- even IED experts have chimed in to say it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       ~He did not use a regular alarm clock, he used a countdown clock.
      </p>
      <p>
       ~Ahmed stated that he "wired it shut" so that it would look less suspicious. This indicates he
       <em>
        knew
       </em>
       it would look suspicious prior to bringing the clock to school.
      </p>
      <p>
       ~Ahmed claimed that he brought it to show off to his science teacher, but had that been his only purpose he would have only shown it to his science teacher. Especially after said teacher warned him not to show it to anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       ~Ahmed kept showing it to teachers. It was when the alarm went off in his sixth class that he got in trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
       ~Ahmed was uncooperative with the police.
       <strong>
        YES
       </strong>
       he said it was "just a clock." And that's
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       he said. When they asked him why he brought it, where he got it, etc. he would not answer. In the words of the police chief "he was more cooperative with the media than us"
      </p>
      <p>
       ~Ahmed lied about it being his invention. What's more, he lied about being into "inventing" or "tinkering" or whatever you want to call it. He doesn't know jack shit about that, there is an interview where he is showing off his other "inventions." He clearly has no idea what the electronics he shows off are, and at one point he shows off a fucking usb card.
      </p>
      <p>
       ~The infamous photo of him in his NASA shirt in handcuffs was staged by his father and sister at the police station. That's right- the father insisted the cuffs remain on so that the sister could get the shot. She then leaked that image to the press.
      </p>
      <p>
       ~The father has past beef with the mayor of that town- Mayor Van Duyne- who would not allow an Islamic tribunal to be established in the city on the grounds that in other places, such tribunals have been used to enforce Sharia Law.  The father said in an interview that he had less grievance with the police and school officials than with the city officials. Why would he even bring this up if this is just about
       <em>
        his son
       </em>
       being unfairly discriminated against?
      </p>
      <p>
       ~The Mohamed family had a meeting with school officials to discuss his suspension and they stood them up to go to a meeting with the press.
      </p>
      <p>
       ~A reporter said that when he talked to Ahmed on the phone, he could hear his sister whispering things for him to say the whole time.
      </p>
      <p>
       ~Ahmed's family is rich, but he has worn that NASA shirt multiple days for interviews- trying to push the image of him as a legit science geek.
      </p>
      <p>
       ~The school said there were additional details they could not release for Ahmed's privacy. Does anyone think Ahmed is concerned with privacy?
      </p>
      <p>
       ~At the risk of sound like a pompous ass, anyone who saw a picture of that hoax bomb and thought that it was just an innocent clock is a gullible, dumb fuck. Anyone who saw the inside and believed that it was this kid's "invention" is also. That being said, the President, Mark Zuckerberg, MIT, NASA, Microsoft,
       <em>
        all of the media
       </em>
       are not gullible dumb fucks. And yet they were dick riding
       <em>
        hours
       </em>
       after this non-event occured, without even knowing all the details... or did they?

       Fuck that kid and his family. I'm an ethnic individual for the record and that bullshit "
       <em>
        clock
       </em>
       " looked like a fuckin Hollywood bomb. They didn't call the bomb squad cause it was an obvious MOCK bomb. This asshole and his family orchestrated an event for attention. The little bastard even sounds like he's reading lines when being interviewed (IMO). He could have screwed that old clock to some wood planks and labeled components like someone really interested in engineering. Instead this race baiting dipshit built a Hollywood prop and kept trying to get the desired reaction from his teachers. In a world where kids are suspended for pop tarts in gun shape this asshole got at least 5 chances to leave well enough alone. Fuck him and his family, they're the Arab al sharptons IMO.

       According to thirdhand sources, Ahmed brought the clock to 6 different teachers before something was done.  And yes, the English teacher was apparently the one who said that he should probably "put it away to not upset anybody".  And he chose to continue parading around with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if this is a media hoax as much as this kid's family is going to sue the state for racial discrimination.  Such a 2015 case, they couldn't have pulled this off 10 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       But at the same time, I really think this is another hoax because the goal is to demonize Islamophobia as Europe and the US become flooded with "migrants".

       Mark Cuban heard it directly from Ahmed (direct witness) so Mark Cuban heard it from the 1st hand source. him relaying it makes him the second hand source, us quoting him makes us 3rd hand.

       Either way, to me, it's a dead giveaway that this kid is not an inventor and has an ulterior motive.  But I say, let him get his scholarships, and watch that shit blow up in his face when they realize they have a fraud on their hands.

       Maybe it would have been a better hoax to do something to put Muslims into a good light, rather than orchestrate such an easily discreditable charade, involving an obvious bomb lookalike. They scored a massive own goal with this as my worry that Muslims are not to be trusted has just been confirmed.

       Just because the public didn't react the "correct" way doesn't it mean it wasn't orchestrated.  A prime example of that is Sandy Hook.  But the basic gist of the story is "Kid had clock.  Racist Americans thought he had bomb.  Racist Americans were wrong about Muslims."
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the simplified version of the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason why I think the hoax was orchestrated by the media is because of the media's willingness to take this kid's side before most of the information was coming out.  Even Bill Maher's standpoint on this just adds fuel to the fire.  "Muslims blow shit up and we all know it!"  Thought I was watching Fox for a second.

       Can we take a minute here and also commnet on how this kid interacts and speaks, I tried so hard to listen to him on various interviews and couldn't understand half of what came out of his mouth.. he mumbles and slurs his words. His sentience's start out good but end up in a long mumbled drawn out ending. Possible the police had no idea what he was talking about.... sort of like: Its a Clobbbcbcbllk daddddt i maaddde.

       Does anyone remember some years ago when that little kid got stranded on that weather balloon or whatever? The weather balloon was just floating around willy nilly for a period of hours, and all the TV would talk about was this poor kid stuck on the balloon, interrupting regular programming, tracking the movement of the balloon in the sky and everything. After a while of this, it was discovered the kid was hiding in the parents' house the whole time, having never even boarded the balloon in the first place. Then, after one or two interviews with the news anchors trying to do a follow-up, the kid admitted that his parents had told him to lie and pretend he was hiding, and it became clear the whole story was totally fabricated.
