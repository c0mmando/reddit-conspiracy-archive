        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As I&#39;ve said many times before, this sub is great for information, but once you can establish a pretty good picture of how the world really operates covertly, most new stories here just further confirm that narrative.  Instead I think we should be doing more to reach those in our spheres of influence.  I think just linking to this sub would be overwhelming for a newcomer especially with all the disinfo so we should strive to craft a more deliberate method of waking up our communities.  I live in a part of America where, by and large, the population doesn&#39;t even know anything is wrong.  It takes years for global and nationwide political and economic trends to reach us so when they finally do, it&#39;s going to be way too late to do anything about it.  So I&#39;ve started trying to wake up my friends but it&#39;s been met strongly with feelings of &quot;This won&#39;t affect me in my lifetime.&quot;</p>

<p>So, r/conspiracy, what is one incontrovertible truth about our society that shakes you to your very core and drives you to want to do something about it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find a good place to start with someone is social engineering.  It is very easy to show and the implications are profound.  There are people whose job it is to figure out how to get the public to have certain opinions.  These think tanks receive massive funding from large corporations and government.  These are the same groups that were involved in producing the propaganda to get the public interested in WW1 and WW2 and they are still at work.</p>

<p>For this you don&#39;t have to trust the word of a conspiracy writer.  Instead get the info straight from the horses&#39; mouth.  Edward Bernays worked in the administration of Woodrow Wilson as part of the Committee on Public Information as well as being an important member of the Tavistock institute.  He wrote &#39;Propaganda&#39; in 1928 <a href="http://whale.to/b/bernays.pdf">http://whale.to/b/bernays.pdf</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.</p>

<p>We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. - Edward Bernays</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our culture is manufactured through these means.  This is connected with Operation Mockingbird (CIA media manipulation).  </p>

<p>Show them how they should accept nothing from the mainstream media or popular culture at face value.  The question to ask yourself if you choose to watch the news: &quot;What are they trying to get me to think and why do they want me to think that?&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.-- William Casey, CIA Director (from first staff meeting in 1981)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was just very recently that the Smith Mundt act of 1948 preventing the use of propaganda against the American public was repealed.  It is legal for them to make up bullshit and pass it off as truth.  Historically they have lied.  When you stop accepting what they are saying now at face value and look at the details you can see that they are lying.  </p>

<p>Caution, people resist changing their world view very strongly.  You need move a person&#39;s world view gradually.  If you make a statement that oversteps during this process you may lose your credibility in that person&#39;s eyes.  Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really nice, man. I was just having a conversation the other day with a girl at my work about Edward Bernays being essentially the father of marketing but wasn&#39;t sure of his involvement in mass manipulation.  Will definitely drop this bomb on her when I see her next.  Is this why the Smith Mundt act being repealed didn&#39;t cause much buzz? Because people didn&#39;t understand its implications?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Marketing to sell products and mass manipulation are really not so far apart.  They both involve influencing people&#39;s opinions, just for a different purpose.  The mass manipulation side probably employs a wider variety of techniques.  People can understand the motivation for marketing (to make money), but they get a blockage for other types of social engineering (&quot;why would they do that?&quot;).  You have to overwhelm them with concrete information to demonstrate that it has happened and continues to happen.</p>

<p>It really brings it home when you use a recent example.  The push to get the American public to accept going into Iraq in 2003 is a good candidate.  Show the news personalities and the language they use (ie accusations of lack of patriotism as described by Goering below).  Examine the logic used to justify that war (the WMD lie), show the video clip of Bush laughing about the Iraq WMD later at an AIPAC donor dinner. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why of course the people don&#39;t want war. Why should some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally the common people don&#39;t want war neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.&quot; ---- Hermann Goering </p>

<p>There are many other important figures involved in the history of this topic: Walter Lippmann, Willy Munzenburg, Trofim Lysenko, Lord Rothmere, Lord Northcliffe.  The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations is an important institution to learn about.  John Coleman&#39;s &quot;The Tavistock Institute&quot; is worth reading.  <a href="http://www.wingtv.net/tavistock.html">http://www.wingtv.net/tavistock.html</a>  (can find full book by torrent)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always liked Aaron Russo&#39;s documentary &quot;America: From Freedom to Fascism&quot;. Showing how a private banking cartel got control of the United States&#39; money--and how that immediately led to a decay in a formerly-Democratic system. As we shifted from a republic to an oligarchy, our nation started to resemble more and more an authoritarian state.</p>

<p>This only happens when the people at the top <em>know</em> they&#39;re illegitimate. Because of that, they fear the people. To protect themselves, they have to create a police state [and a security grid] to make sure that a revolution doesn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>A General at West Point said, &quot;You can always gauge an illegitimate regime by the amount of money they spend on security for themselves within the nation. Legitimate leaders don&#39;t fear the people over whom they rule.&quot;</p>

<p>Has any country on Earth created a more extensive security grid than that found in the United States?</p>

<p>This has all happened because our country was taken over by a private banking cartel who <em>knows</em> they&#39;re illegitimate.</p>

<p>Watch Russo&#39;s &quot;America: From Freedom to Fascism&quot; to see the steps that got us here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I follow trutherbot (@trutherbotred) on twitter. I think its a great account because everything he tweets is easy to understand (a lot of simple graphics and some comics) and well supported. He touches a lot of the same topics (monsanto/fda, fluoridation of water to name a few) so followers get a deeper understanding of certain topics. Another reason why its a great account for newbies is that he also tweets humorous things that are relevant to everything, so its not as heavy and appeals to a lot of people. </p>

<p>Edit: theres actually a documentary trutherbot tweeted called The Esoteric Agenda on youtube. Its absolutely loaded with info and talks kind of fast, so you usually miss some things if you only watch it once but even considering that its EXTREMELY interesting and is a good overview of how there are certain people controlling most things in the world, which is the main idea you want to convey to someone to open their eyes to things around them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re basically asking &quot;What&#39;s the ONE piece of straw that can break the camel&#39;s back?&quot;</p>

<p>Good luck trying to find out what &quot;one, single piece of straw&quot; that&#39;ll be.  You&#39;re going about it the wrong way looking at it in that manner.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t look for one single piece of straw.</p>

<p>Just accumulate overwhelming amounts of hay instead.  Bowl them over with the accumulative information.  Doesn&#39;t matter if they can deny one or even two straws of data.  They&#39;ll get bowled over by the entire haystack if you just pour on data after data showing that we live in a fucked up world full of contrivance and chicanery.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t go for or look for the &quot;one piece of straw!&quot;  It&#39;s easy to deny any one single piece of information regardless of how much data you have behind it.  Cognitive dissonance is a powerful, powerful emotional tool, and people can deny almost any single thing if it means protecting their shit world view.</p>

<p>Bombard them with overwhelming data, however, and it&#39;ll be real difficult to deny that thing generally point toward a single direction:  That things are very much <em>not</em> what they seem and what we&#39;re told they are on this planet.  It&#39;ll be hard to argue against that in the face of so much overwhelming evidence if you just bombard them with information.  Even if they can say &quot;but, but, but...&quot; to one or two, that still won&#39;t be able to deny the overwhelming data in general.</p>

<p>Explain this, as I do not understand what you mean or are referring to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that&#39;s step 1 in the cult leader&#39;s handbook- mentally overwhelm them by feeding them too much information that confuses them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s not what I’m espousing at all, however.  No one’s talking about giving them so much information that it <em>confuses</em> them.  It’s not about that.  It’s about giving them so much information that the counterargument they might make that “everything’s alright and there are no nefarious forces acting against our best interests” will simply be proven wrong in the face of the facts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>quickly before they can make heads or tails of what they&#39;re being told.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who the heck is talking about doing anything <em>this</em> way, however?  This is deceit.  This is chicanery.  Doing things THIS way might be the way <em>you</em> would do it, and by virtue of this level of deceit, then it <em>would</em> be ironic since you’re using the methodology in a deceitful way, but this is in NO way whatsoever what I’m referring to or talking about, and it is in no way whatsoever the only way that one can interpret what I posted above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When an individual is in a state of confusion, they are more vulnerable to programming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.  Do DON’T CONFUSE the individual in question.  There is nothing about what I initially posted above that even implies that there should be any confusion involved in giving them information.  Don’t worry about having to or trying to confuse anyone.  You SHOULDN’T confuse anyone.  What you should do is simply present a LOT of the data that exists which, again, one will not be able to argued against in its entirety.</p>

<p>That in no way necessarily involves “confusing” anyone.  There is no chicanery here, nor does there have to be in order to clearly present someone with enough data to keep them from logically counteracting.  One can do that without having to confuse an individual or resort to being deceitful.</p>

<p>Perhaps I misinterpreted what you meant when you said that... no offense intended hombre.... That just read to me as being pretty close to the same thing as:</p>

<p>When you consider that <em>any</em> information that challenges their perspective/previously held beliefs <em>is</em> going to confuse them by virtue of being contradictory to their reality. So when you suggest feeding them a lot of information that challenges their perspective you will be: mentally overwhelming them with confusing data.</p>

<p>Fair enough.  Understood.  Apologies for the ambiguity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you consider that any information that challenges their perspective/previously held beliefs is going to confuse them by virtue of being contradictory to their reality.</p>

<p>Yes.  This is correct.  That’s why I used the word “overwhelm”.  It wasn’t because I meant any deceit by it, however, but because I understood that they would likely be confused by, as you said, <em>any</em> information that challenges their beliefs.  They <em>will</em> be confused and overwhelmed, but it doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t still provide them with all the information nonetheless.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Understood.  However, my intention behind this isn’t nefarious.  It is to instead give them so much information that they will realize that there simply <em>is</em> no logical counter to the fact that this world is ruled by chicanery and nefariousness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Write out a list of policies endorsed by the Republican Party and Democratic Party. Notice how they are essentially identical on issues such as the global and internal economy, taxation, and foreign relations. The parties only differ on issues like gay marriage, abortion rights, and drug legalization. These are hot button topics that make it easy to divide voters while ensuring no real change will come about.  </p>

<p>The interesting thing imo is that there is nothing stopping people from voting outside of these two parties. It&#39;s just that people are taught in school and through the media that you are either liberal or conservative, and that these parties represent those ideals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I do agree, simply stating that isn&#39;t going to change anyone&#39;s mind because they&#39;ve probably seen it already in a meme or a joke on TV.  Do you have a source that would confirm that fact&#39;s implications in 9/11? Not saying you don&#39;t, I&#39;d just like one to refer to.</p>
