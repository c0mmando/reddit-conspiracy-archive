RE: Ahmed’s completely innocent homemade clock.</p>

<p>When I first heard about Ahmed, the kid who made the news for his “bomb” clock project, I took his side. I played with discrete electronics as a kid. I built breadboards, I soldered, and I experimented with early robotics... In this STEM obsessed educational system, why couldn’t the school officials quickly dismiss this scare as a science project? Why did this make the news? I just didn’t get it… and then I saw a picture of the clock.</p>

<p>From CNN: “A teenager with dreams of becoming an engineer, he wanted to show his teacher the digital clock he&#39;d made from a pencil case.”</p>

<p>Anyone with an understanding of electronics will immediately see this “homemade clock” is not the tinkering of a child or teen. It was never Ahmed’s idea to begin with. This isn’t some innocent science project. The picture of the clock exposes the lie. Ahmed did not lovingly patch together IC chips and resistors, as the media would like you to believe. What you see is the guts from a manufactured digital clock, right down to the 9 volt memory backup, and the prefab button board. Absolutely nothing was made. It’s the equivalent of taking the plastic surround off of your TV and claiming you “made” a TV.</p>

<p>Look at the case itself. CNN calls it a “pencil case.” Please. The whole package is vaguely sinister, and it’s intentional. Notice the nondescript packet of unidentified white powder. See that nice dent in the side? I wonder if you could stash plastic explosives behind that huge LED. Why is the lining so bumpy? Look at the shoddy taping and the twisted wire used to close the case. It’s almost as if someone designed this clock to look like a questionable object.</p>

<p>Again, from CNN: “&quot;I built a clock to impress my teacher but when I showed it to her, she thought it was a threat to her,&quot; Ahmed told reporters Wednesday.” It was really sad that she took the wrong impression of it.&quot;”</p>

<p>Ahmed, you didn’t build a clock. You’re a pawn to your Dad’s political and social agenda. This is all a creation of your father. I’m sure he involved you in the process, and made you feel as though you were truly making something, but you didn’t. It’s a clock without its case. Everything in the “pencil case” was made in a factory. See, a legitimate electronics project full of diodes and resistors looks innocent. It usually runs off of a battery, not an exposed AC to DC transformer… speaking of science projects, Ahmed, why again did you bring this to class? Was it part of an assignment? Oh, you just wanted to impress your teacher with a clock you rearranged inside a small briefcase? Hmm…</p>

<p>From dallasnews.com: ““He fixed my phone, my car, my computer,” Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed said. “He is a very smart, brilliant kid.”</p>

<p>If he were so smart, he’d know the difference between creating a circuit and stripping the guts from a manufactured clock. His dad helped him “make” this, and dad helped to make this “project” look as questionable as possible, within the realm of plausible deniability.</p>

<p>The dad is a politician. He made this happen. Whatever agenda he’s advancing, it just further demonizes western society, and reminds us all to be guilty for how racist we all are. Maybe that’s the agenda.</p>

<p>It’s propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>in 4th grade I was wiring up a &#39;cat eat-o-meter&#39;.  I had a wood 2 inch thick box as a base the size of a placemat.  then some springs on it and another thin pieces of wood on top the same size, and a small stable shelf above it a few inches deep to hold a cat food bowl.  The box and the thin piece of wood had magnetic sensors on them so that when pressure was put on the top thin piece of wood (enough to move the springs - aka a cat standing on it) the magnets would come together and complete the circuit.  I had this wired up to a black box with a breadboard in it and a counter as well as a battery casing and whatever resistors/etc were needed to make it all work.  Each time the magnets came together the counter would increase.  I had the power button wired in.  Drilled holes (had to get my parents to do the drilling, they wouldn&#39;t let me use power tools in 4th grade) in the box so I could properly attach the power switch and the display.  So I had a black box with a display and buttons mounted on it with wires hanging all over and a battery pack mounted inside it.  I was ALMOST done.  The only thing I had left to do (day before science fair) was to wire in the reset button so that the count could be knocked back to zero without having to turn the whole thing off and then on again - purely a &#39;nice to have&#39; feature that was not necessary.  I must have done something wrong because all of the sudden the teacher goes &quot;what is that smell?&quot;  and I look down and there is smoke coming off of my project.  It had been working perfectly.  I was so angry that I had gotten careless and screwed up at the very end which rendered my project useless because I didn&#39;t have time to fix it - and it was 4th grade...one of the competing projects was a &quot;reading light&quot; that consisted of a flashlight duct-taped to a helmet.  So I still got my A even if I did burn my project in class haha.</p>

<p>needless to say, I had a &quot;weird&quot; looking box with homemade stuff drilled into it, a big wood box, and a power supply, and I even set it on fire, but I wasn&#39;t accused of being a terrorist or arrested or even in trouble other than mildly annoying the teacher.  </p>

<p>...good times...don&#39;t know why I launched in to that story, a touch of nostalgia I guess, hadn&#39;t thought about that in over 10 years.</p>

<p>No pre-made shit in my project other than radio-shack binary display, radio-shack switches/buttons, radio-shack contact sensors, and a radio-shack AA battery enclosure.  Wired up everything else myself on a prototyping bread board.</p>

<p>Citation.  Examples.  Sounds like complete anecdotal bullshit to me.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Typical...Dude, I don&#39;t know what reality you inhabit but here, in this one, people are often learning how things work by taking them apart and rebuilding them using other parts.  There are countless books, guides, youtube vids, courses and kits which provide this exact process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but mostly displays and such, as is typical. I OFTEN had teachers worry about my stuff getting me in trouble.  So they would take it from me. I would have to go back to get it after class, sometimes missing the bus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Buuuuuullshit.  Unless you had the most paranoid and most ill-informed fucktard teachers who can&#39;t tell an anode from anal gland you&#39;re speaking complete shit.  And if it&#39;s true (which of couse it isn&#39;t) then your teachers did you a disservice.  You know what I built as a kid?  A WAVEPOOL game using 9v batteries in parallel and 4 hobbyist electrical motors, wood and paint.  That thing looked like it could be anything but the teachers who couldn&#39;t work out what it *<em>asked</em> me what it did and how it worked.  They didn&#39;t confiscate and try and incite fear from their own ignorance.</p>

<p>But we all know what you&#39;re saying is bullshit and that it&#39;s about to lead into you telling us how little this device and this person impresses you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a maker of considerable but unremarkable ability and utility</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Citation - so far you&#39;re a whiner of unremarkable ability</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am personally unimpressed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup, <em>of course</em> you&#39;re unimpressed - you get to anonymously shitcan someone passively aggressively over the internet.  You get to pass judgement with no chance of rebuttal from the subject.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why have a clock that you have to open to see the time?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just because.  Kids do a lot of things just because.  Maybe you thinks it&#39;s useful from an organisation standpoint.  Maybe he was just interested in building into a hardcase.  Things that occur to child&#39;s minds don&#39;t really occur to adults in the same way - there are vast amounts of research which support this.</p>

<p>You&#39;re a massive manchild - this should make sense to you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>IF he was going to build a different housing FOR STANDARD CLOCK COMPONENTS, why build one that is so impractical? There is only one reason I can imagine, to make it look like &quot;this&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See above.  You&#39;re projecting with the same kind of ignorance his teachers did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree it&#39;s propaganda, but I think the white house/ CIA - whoever orchestrates all this stuff -  is in on it, and got the dad to do it not the other way around, I think right now it&#39;s a nice lesson for America to not be racist towards smart kids - but it may devolve with further staged incidents, that will somehow create an elongated narrative -- this was fully planned, the kid likely does not realize he&#39;s being used. tho you pick up on a lot at that age so it&#39;s hard to say, either way shame on his father. and shame of the psyopers behind the scenes, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I knew something was fishy when I found out his dad was a politician. Also, how so many celebrities are jumping on the hype train for this kid. Its like some one told them, &quot;alright, make sure you make a tweet or something about this kid&#39;s clock. Idk, give him a free ticket or something.&quot;</p>

<p>What&#39;s up with everyone calling him brave and so smart? They&#39;re treating him he&#39;s Gandhi. If hes so smart why the fuck would you bring a suitcase like that to school? How old is he, 14 right? Hes old enough to know cops are there for show. And people say that this kid is scarred for life from being arrested, like he&#39;s going to have PTSD from this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This reminds me of the old saying -- &quot;You can&#39;t cheat an honest man.&quot;</p>

<p>The idea seems to be that his father was taking advantage of the racism that he knew was present and flip it to his advantage. This is somehow more malevolent than the inherent racism. Of course if the racism had just not been present, then it never would have worked in the first place.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I agree with your narrative, but that even if it&#39;s true it only worked because he was right about how his son would be mistreated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I call shenanigans.  ANY kid would have been treated like that if they had a &quot;homemade&quot; clock beeping in class with no concept on how to turn it off.  </p>

<p>This hoax is to highlight &quot;Islamophobia&quot; as Muslims overrun Europe.  I put that word in quotes because it&#39;s a term generated by the media and then used by the media to label its audiences.</p>
