        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Take a look at this image of Ahmed&#39;s clock released by the Irving PD: <a href="http://cdn.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/0916ahmedclock.jpg">http://cdn.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/0916ahmedclock.jpg</a></p>

<p>Anyone who is remotely familiar with electronics can tell that this clock is simply an consumer alarm clock that has been disassembled and the LED display screwed into a case. </p>

<p>The ribbons that connect the display and the buttons are soldered, and clearly by machine, as are all the other solder connections on this device. While the photo is blurry, the PCB and the number of pins on the main IC are also clearly made and assembled by machine. </p>

<p>Why would a student project etch a separate PCB just for the buttons? They wouldn&#39;t, because this is clearly designed to be mounted to the top of a plastic case of an alarm clock. </p>

<p>The power cable is also built in a way that suggests that a $10 &quot;Giant&quot; alarm clock was removed from its chassis and haphazardly attached to a briefcase or pencil case. Why is there a circuit board dangling?</p>

<p>Almost every article on this subject mentions a &quot;homemade&quot; clock, and this has now been proven to be entirely false. <a href="http://time.com/4036951/ahmed-mohamed-clock-bomb-school-safety/">This</a> Time article even suggests that the student built the clock using &quot;a circuit board and a spot welder.&quot; What a miracle, that the student was able to find a circuit board perfectly etched to fit all the components and connect them properly, and with the magic of a spot welder (at 2000 degrees in excess of a soldering iron, something that would vaporize the board), and come up with a fully functional clock. I&#39;m not sure if this is bad journalism, or just sheer lunacy. </p>

<p>While my theory has only circumstantial evidence behind it, it&#39;s still more likely than the scenario presented by the media. </p>

<p>High school freshman are, for the most part, idiots. I sure was. It&#39;s perfectly within the realm of possibility that this freshman thought it would be funny to disassemble a clock and put it in a case so that it resembled a Bond villain bomb. I could imagine freshman me doing something that dumb. </p>

<p>When Ahmed brought it to school and the police were called, rightfully so, as something intentionally resembling a bomb was inside the school, he realized the magnitude of his error, and either he or even the media could have said that he was profiled. Profiling of Muslims is a very real issue, but intentionally taking apart a clock and installing it into a briefcase in the style of a movie bomb, and being temporarily detained for it, is not profiling. </p>

<p>The media and Silicon Valley circlejerk immediately ensued, culminating in him being invited to the White House and essentially being offered an education at MIT. Unscrewing the case on an alarm clock and haphazardly screwing it in to a briefcase could only be construed as intentionally styling it to look like a bomb. </p>

<p>If he is interested in electrical engineering, by all means I encourage him to follow his passion. But what he brought to school is not by any means indicative of his abilities or interest in electrical engineering. Anyone with the knowledge of &quot;lefty-loosey, righty-tightly&quot; could have created what he did, and I maintain that he did not bring this device that clearly looks like a bomb to school in order to impress or demonstrate his skill level to an engineering teacher. </p>

<p>In all likelihood, this was intended to be a sophomoric joke on which he backtracked, and someone (not necessarily him) cried wolf which resulted in the story going viral. </p>

<p>DAE Texas is racist?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t think anything of this story until Obama tweeted an invitation to the boy. Then I read up on it and saw that the school said there was more to the story but would not release the info due to privacy for the student,  this got me thinking - why would the white house get involved when the story had not yet been fully vetted. it could still come out the kid really did want to scare people and - whatever - didn&#39;t consider the backlash - who knows, but the point is obama was way too confident to get involved without knowin the full story. This maes me think the story was controlled from the beginnig. the political father probably instructed to kid to take the item to school - whoever made it. And that photo of him being arrested - nice shot -- nice set up shot. I think the kid was really arrested - but I think it was a set up - and planned, and this insight on the clock not being from scratch confirms my suspicion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A: The transformer, as you should be able to see in the picture, connects to a standard wall outlet. The transformer ensures that both the voltage and current are appropriate for the circuit, as most appliances that plug into the wall are not designed to take 120 volts, including this alarm clock of course. </p>

<p>The 9V battery connector is for backup, so if the power were to go out, the internal time on the alarm clock would be maintained. The alarm clock does not function on battery backup power, but avoids inconviencing the user when the power comes back on by forcing them to reset the time. </p>

<p>Computer motherboards, for example, often have a small button/coin cell that maintains a system clock when the motherboard is not receiving power, whether from out outage or just the computer being powered off. </p>

<p>The clock cannot beep unless plugged in. The battery is just to keep the time and alarm tine from being reset if the power goes out so there&#39;s clearly BS happening... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was there a 9V battery in the clock when it was confiscated?  The police picture didn&#39;t show a battery.  I have the same clock but it doesn&#39;t beep even when I left the 9V battery on it.</p>

<p>Also, the alarm doesn&#39;t beep unless you set it.  When you  first plug it in the time is default to 12:00 and the alarm is also at 12:00.  However, the alarm doesn&#39;t make any sound unless the Alarm On switch is toggled to on and the Alarm time is set (press Alarm button and then set time).</p>

<p>It&#39;s suspicious to me that the alarm went off in the English class.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just found a way for the alarm to go off when not being plugged into the AC outlet.  If you set the alarm ahead of time and keep the 9V battery in the clock, the alarm will beep.</p>

<p>So it could be an accident that the alarm went off in the English class inside his backpack.  A couple questions come up here:
1) Did he set the clock to an actual time or it was just never set?
2) As I posted before, the alarm doesn&#39;t beep unless you set the alarm to on and the alarm time has to be set.  So why did he set an alarm at all?</p>

<p>Anyway, maybe it&#39;s just a perfect coincidence.</p>

Beyond that, you&#39;re a complete moron.</p>

<p>&#39;High school freshman are, for the most part, idiots. I sure was.&#39;
Pat yourself on the back for admitting it. Before I even went into high school I had taught myself PHP, SQL, JS, HTML and Photoshop and was making websites just for fun. I was also into robotics, which was hard to stay into with limited finances. </p>

<p>&#39;When Ahmed brought it to school and the police were called, rightfully so, as something intentionally resembling a bomb was inside the school&#39;</p>

<p>This is entirely assuming that he intentionally made something that looks like a bomb, which we don&#39;t know because he never said that and the damn thing looks like no bomb that has ever existed. You must be an idiot, because it takes a google image search to realize that the damn clock looks nothing like any real bomb ever made.</p>

<p>&#39;Unscrewing the case on an alarm clock and haphazardly screwing it in to a briefcase could only be construed as intentionally styling it to look like a bomb.&#39;</p>

<p>Or, more rationally, it could be construed as a kid wanting to appear smarter than he thinks he is.</p>

<p>Just because he didn&#39;t say it doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t true. Ahmed, or his father (who is likely guiding his every move), also stated that he made the clock, which utterly decimates any credibility that he has. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For such a pretentious asshat you sure seem unfazed by your gross amount of baseless assumptions. I&#39;ll go ahead and presume that you think very highly of your intellectual abilities. I must confess that I have my doubts.</p>

<p>BTW go look at the picture you linked me. Which one of those bombs is made from pure circuitry? The clock device in question may very well have intentionally been made to look questionable. The only thing more questionable is how educators, police and Internet geniuses like yourself don&#39;t have the capacity to look at something that is clearly not a bomb without determining that it was intentionally made to look like a bomb.</p>

<p>As far as the kid&#39;s credibility goes - who cares? Children do strange things for attention. Maybe the kid wanted to lie about making a clock? Even if we assume that the device was made to look like a bomb, you have to reach pretty hard to start making claims like &#39;his father (who is likely guiding his every move).&#39;</p>

<p>Whatever. The kid either 
A) Wanted to make people think he was smart enough to make a clock.
B) Wanted to intentionally make a device which idiots might confuse for a bomb.</p>

<p>Whatever his intention, he succeeded in both. I wouldn&#39;t assume that there is any greater conspiracy beyond that.  </p>

<p>The device&#39;s intention, however, was to convince someone not anywhere near well-versed in electronics that it was, in fact, a device intended to cause harm. </p>

<p>Even so, let&#39;s assume that all you say is true. In that case, all of those who called him a genius should still retract their statements, and Microsoft should request back the thousands of dollars worth of merchandise given to him, or donate to a more worthy cause, perhaps one that has not flat-out lied to an entire country. </p>

<p>Beyond that, I don&#39;t understand where you get the notion that the device was intended to appear as a bomb. There&#39;s absolutely no reason to assume that, or that his father had anything to do with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All is forgiven. </p>

<p>Of course my current theory is not entirely conclusive, but the fact that kid is still claiming it&#39;s his &quot;homemade invention built to impress his teacher&quot; when that&#39;s entirely false destroys the credibility of the rest of his story. </p>

<p>Therefore, if there are serious doubts (and discrepancies, like the clock going off in his bag despite needing to be plugged in to work) about his story, then alternate theories could be proposed. </p>

<p>Both my theory and the publicly accepted one rely almost entirely on circumstantial evidence, but two pieces of direct evidence that support my theory are the fact that the clock is not an invention (bringing into question why a disassembled clock was screwed into a pencil case and brought to school, especially after Ahmed specifically said that he &quot;held it together with a wire so it would look less suspicious.&quot; Why would he be thinking about whether or not it looked suspicious?), and the police statement informing the public that the photo that went viral was actually staged. </p>

<p>The fact that the photo-op was arranged by the father, <em>plus</em> the fact that the father has done a fair degree of speaking on Ahmed&#39;s behalf in a way that directly incites people crying wolf regarding Islamophobia, <em>plus</em> the fact that he has close ties to the local CAIR, who appeared in the press conference given at the Mohamed&#39;s residence, and <em>plus</em> the fact that a significant degree of the Internet backlash fits with CAIR&#39;s agenda, i.e. trashing the mayor instead of the local PD and SD. </p>

<p>Also, I&#39;d like to encourage you to take a look at the interview he gave to Good Morning America. He does not appear to be a native English speaker, which is fine, but some phrases that are recited effortlessly (and contrast with his normal manner of speech) <em>could</em> be a red flag for him being fed what to say. For example, during the part where he holds up a DVD player he took out of its case (again, it&#39;s fairly obvious that it&#39;s commercially manufactured) and says, &quot;this isn&#39;t my first invention and it won&#39;t be my last.&quot; </p>

<p>While it&#39;s fine for him to take stuff apart as many American children do, a high school student should have the maturity to understand that these small appliance skeletons are not by any means an invention on his part. There are eleven year olds working at a far higher level than Mr. Mohamed, and none of them received national media attention, because hobby projects do not look like bombs, even to a layperson. </p>

<p>Perhaps this entire situation is just a case of affirmative action. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was not a bomb, but this theory is more plausible than the publicly accepted one, which is based on a homemade clock. This is unequivocally false. Nobody else, of any race, created something this suspicious looking and brought it to school. Schools are well within their rights to search or consfiscate something that appears suspicious. Screwing a clock into a pencil case does not better him. It was intentionally created to look like a bomb, possibly to bait people like you to cry wolf and claim that this is racial profiling. I assure you that if freshman, non-Muslim me were to bring such a device to school I would be suspended. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you for the most part. Again, it&#39;s great that he&#39;s interested in electronics, but reinstalling the innards of a consumer alarm clock in an extremely suggestive way, at least to someone who does not live under a rock, is not worthy of an invitation to the White House. </p>

<p>Just Google &quot;14 year old invents&quot; to see what other people the same age as Mohamed are doing to help the world. I assure you that the percent of these kids who were invited to the White House, essentially guaranteed a full ride to MIT, and widely praised on social media is not 100%, and they <em>actually invented</em> something. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not the praise that he received for his interest in electronics I oppose, although there are tens or hundreds of thousands more children equally or more interested in electronics or STEM as a whole, but instead that it was sparked by him creating something that appears to be, beyond a reasonable doubt, a joke veiled as an electronics project. </p>

<p>A student interested in electrical engineering would not have intentionally screwed the innards of the clock into a briefcase (a common vector for bomb deployment, at least in movies), in a way such that only the display would be visible, again like in the movies, and the buttons used to operate the clock would not be accessible. </p>

<p>Rather, and I speak from experience here, a student in electrical engineering might instead take apart a clock, determine which wire connected what, determine which component does what, et cetera. They might bring a 555 Timer-based blinking LED on a breadboard that is the equivalent of &quot;Hello World&quot; for electronics beginners. They might have a notebook full of schematics, written in the almost-neat penmanship of a passionate student. </p>

<p>If a passionate student wanted to impress their engineering teacher (Mohamed&#39;s own words), they would not bring something that shows only a basic proficiency in screwdriver use. Half the screws are missing in the display mounting tabs!</p>

<p>This was not a project intended to impress an engineering teacher, although outwardly that may appear to be the case. Rather, this entire media frenzy is a result of backpedaling after a doofus freshman realized that bomb hoaxes carry a stiff penalty. </p>

<p>I think that says more about the standards of education. If something so simple can impress the teacher, the problem isn&#39;t the student, the problem is the course/school. </p>

<p>If he wanted to perform a bomb hoax, shouldn&#39;t he have planted it somewhere? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What he did has absolutely nothing to do with electrical engineering. This simple fact crushes the credibility of most of Mohamed&#39;s statements. His actions consist of using a screwdriver and nothing more, as is evident from the photo provided. </p>

<p>His life could be devoted to electrical engineering at this point, but his actions betray zero interest in electrical engineering. Getting a screwdriver does not constitute interest in electrical engineering, nor does unscrewing the screws that hold the alarm clock&#39;s chassis together. Nor does pulling apart the chassis, and nor does removing the PCB assemblies and display from the chassis. Nor does screwing the display into the side of a small briefcase, again, in the likeness of a bomb. </p>

<p>This is all that he has done. None of this shows that he is a &quot;maker&quot; or an electronics hobbyist, or even a student interested in STEM fields. </p>

<p>This does show, however, that he created a device very closely resembling a bomb and exercised poor judgement in bringing it to school for reasons not disclosed by him. </p>

<p>I maintain, because given the facts it is still the most likely option (as Mohamed&#39;s story has already been disproven), that this was intended as some kind of joke. Just because he thought it would have been funny to bring a clock in bomb form to school does not mean that it is necessary for him to go all-out Al Qaeda. </p>

<p>While not a bomb hoax in the traditional sense (planting a likeness of a bomb and calling a threat in), a likeness of a bomb was still brought to school in a way that convinced a person of authority that it was, in fact, a bomb. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I believe that the Constitution affords us equal protection under the law. I assume you missed my statements on the very real problem of racial and religious profiling. Regardless of race I believe that if someone brings something that a reasonable person would interpret as a likeness of a weapon than due process should be carried out pertinent to Texas and federal bomb hoax statutes. </p>

<p>Any reasonable person would construe this device, intended to look like a film-style bomb, as a bomb. Every single article calling this clock &quot;homemade&quot; or claiming that he built it is provably false, which greatly reduces the credibility of his claim that he &quot;built&quot; it to impress his teacher. Any engineering teacher worth their salt, or alternatively anyone who has taken apart anything after 1990 could tell that he was not the creator of the device within the briefcase. Therefore, is it no longer that far of a stretch to assume that the clock was intentionally reinstalled in a manner that suggests a weapon-like appearance, in which case the motive in all likelihood is an attempt at humor. His race or religion is in no way taken into account.  He had no legitimate reason to unscrew the chassis on an alarm clock and install it into a small briefcase, and especially in a way that impairs use of the clock. </p>

<p>A preponderance of the evidence supports the theory that this device was not a clock he &quot;built in 20 minutes to impress his teacher&quot;, but more likely an attempt at humor after which he backpedaled. </p>
