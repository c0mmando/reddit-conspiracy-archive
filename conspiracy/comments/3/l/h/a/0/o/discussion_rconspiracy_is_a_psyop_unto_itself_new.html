       No, he's a naive young kid at best or purposely pushes disinfo at worst. Why do the official story people and space beams/nuke theory people both attack the controlled demo theory? Because they are both on the same side. Most people have been researching 9/11 for years before these theories came out to discredit the truth movement and have seen what it has done to it. Its gone from knowledgeable people looking for real truth to disinfo agents pushing narratives that naive kids and young adults run with like its fact. Its pushed away a lot of older conspiracy researchers because there is no reasoning with mini nukers or the judy woods fan club. Its ok if you want to research it but there's very little information and a lot of fact claiming. Look at your boy he talks like it was fact that the towers were nuked. Where's the proof? There is none. There's plenty of evidence for controlled demo. Its already created division in the truth seekers, just like they wanted.

       Anything that amasses a certain level of social influence will be infiltrated and either controlled or destroyed. Simple as that. You could probably run a group of &lt;10 people if you knew them all, rolled your own forum code and encryption, etc. -- but even then you'll probably be monitored. Keyloggers for all!

       I remember when reddit was just that. It was an amazing source of information and community. Sadly the one thing that the 0.01%ers can't allow is the truth to be known.  If the truth got out they would be in jail.  Truth is their biggest enemy in my opinion.

       What's crazy to think about is that they have so much power, that no matter where we commune to discuss the truth, they will find us, infiltrate us, and ultimately disrupt close to all meaningful discourse. That is how powerful these people are. I feel like I do not even own my own thoughts anymore, because as hard as I try, I am still influenced by TPTB. What hope do we have? All we can do is meet in person, but even that could be infiltrated.

       Before she took down her site, anolen.com had posted a significant amount of research suggesting that reddit.com itself is a CIA front to a certain degree. It's a propaganda outfit to control the public mind. Just like Operation Mockingbird paid a lot of mainstream journalists in the various newspapers, during the internet age the CIA funds online news sites to push their propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       isn't a default sub, so it's essentially unimportant. EXCEPT that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has grown enough that it somewhat counters the CIA approved narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, we have this group of people trying to take control of the mod team so they can discredit the sub with Flat Earthers, Illuminatis, and 9/11 disinformation.

       Sorry if I came off a bit rude. After years of being a mod here I have learned that the majority of people disdain you for almost no reason at all, and a lot of people will start to make up reasons to dislike us. I assure you that the mods not only lack the power to change any votes, we also do not influence what topics are discussed here.

       Guys, it was never about the upvotes. It is obvious to say the least, that when you have a voting system, that system will become corrupted. It is about the information. You can do the research yourself. You do not need posts of endless links and discussion. You must read and attain information. Then what you do with it is up to you. You can post it here so some other individual can discover it for the first time, and entertain the ideas.

       Yes, but when a post is zeroed out to remain at zero, it only shows in new and won't make it to the front pare of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       So you just think it's upvotes? If this was a professional psyop, the organizers would generate all.or most of the content (and carefully select what they didn't produce) and you wouldn't be able to talk to the other people being mindfucked.  I assume there is a lot of this going on, but not complete. Mostly because I hope at least a handful of you are real people lying in bed or momentarily escaping your corporate shackles and not an army of sycophants in an all beige and grey temple to technocracy. If this is all for show, like each of us sees our own personal tailored version of the psyop, then cool. Congrats on that...

       The ideal people to spread disinformation are those that don't know they're doing it because you don't need to be paid to be a shill, you just have to be a believer. One need only look at the climate science "debate" to see this in action, but if that isn't enough, think about what those two Mormon guys are doing knocking on people's doors.

       I get that. I just think it's a good idea to seed the disinfo in a relatively closed and one-on-one environment. Schools are pretty good, too, as the children are totally ignorant, the teenagers are conditioned, and the college students are utterly indoctrinated and there is heavy bias against info that doesn't come from the indoctrination system.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it would be interesting if one site is used as the seeding ground and then the implanted then transfer that info to other spaces, like reddit is just the seed disinfo and people naturally spread it to facebook, real life, buzzfeed, etc. I understand that you don't necessarily need closed, personalized environments to achieve that, climate science as you stated being a great example, but it probably helps gather data on what propaganda techniques work best on which personality types/demographic profiles.

       Yes, totally idiotic even, but I don't consider myself the sole arbiter of what people should believe. You're even welcome to believe in flat earth if you like but there's no discernable conspiracy there (apart from the disinfo/psy-op angle) so maybe keep it in your own subs.

       There's a few misleading things here.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Front page or front page of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ? It doesn't take much to make the front page of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , but the top post does appear on the main front page of all subscribers.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Saying "not true" doesn't mean early downvotes have zero effect. I just wanted to make that clear. An early downvote will almost guarantee that a post will never hit the top of this sub (not front page, but top post on front page). You are correct that an enormous amount of upvotes can result in a ship not sinking, but the earlier the downvote, the bigger the hole in the ship.

       We need to train users that a post with 0 upvotes and many comments is a topic that's being suppressed -- and it's likely something they should look into, likely more important than a thread with 3000 upvotes.

       But I agree, it would be smarter to throw all the weight into debunking the "official science" to reinforce the call for a real investigation instead of coming up with speculative hypotheses left and right to divide the movement.

        <p>
         Nano-thermite alone cannot explain the lack of rubble and total pulverization of steel, office furniture, bathroom fixtures, and human bodies. The buildings turned to dust -- not piles of rubble, but
         <em>
          dust
         </em>
         100 microns in size. How did the nanothermite completely reduce the buildings to microscopic dust? Only a nuclear device is capable of that.

         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSjratvNGmo">
          here's an excellent video example
         </a>
         . First, notice the detonation causing a ground-based blast wave -- i.e., earthquake. Then about 10 seconds later, the ground collapses. Imagine one of these under each WTC building.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>

        Nano-thermite alone cannot explain the lack of rubble and total pulverization of steel, office furniture, bathroom fixtures, and human bodies. The buildings turned to dust -- not piles of rubble, but dust 100 microns in size. How did the nanothermite completely reduce the buildings to microscopic dust? Only a nuclear device is capable of that.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's not how you approach a subject objectively and honestly, Hacker. You make an observation: all the shit got pulverized and turned to dust. Not all of it, btw, to particles 100 microns in size, there's a wide range of other sizes the debris took. And there was lots of debris, and mangled steel, and the sintered "meteorites" and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you formulate the question: what could pulverize all the shit?
      </p>
      <p>
       One hypothesis says "gravity" and I find it as laughable as you do, and as it is the official theory everyone with a spark of intellect left in his brain disagrees with, we both should stand shoulder to shoulder in breaking up that misconception where it still has foothold.
      </p>
      <p>
       One hypothesis says "nanothermite" and I find it as non-explanatory as you do, because the experts that put forward that hypothesis never gave us a "model", a feasibility study, a "plan" on how and where and in which sequence this stuff was applied and ignited to make the collapse look like it did with the effects that are observed. And I am at least as paranoid about that organization being controlled opposition as you are. I do however acknowledge that they found stuff in the dust that simply does not belong there, after they predicted they would have to find something, and it is the best science in the sense of scientific method we have to date.
      </p>
      <p>
       One hypothesis says "Directed Energy Weapon" and I don't know what you think about it but in my book, if John Hutchinson and Judy Wood manage to dustify a 2 meter WTC model, a piece of steel beam or a chunk of concrete to prove their theory
       <em>
        in principle
       </em>
       , I'm all aboard the hype train. Choo choo!
      </p>
      <p>
       Your hypothesis says "only a nuclear device is capable of that" and that is exactly what "jumping to conclusions" was probably invented for. I don't rule it out, but I find it highly, highly unlikely for many, many reasons, the first and foremost of which is that the towers collapsed from top to bottom. The other major problem is that you do not have many nuclear explosions to compare effects and after-effects with - so many assumptions must be made that this hypothesis requires a HUGE amount of evidence.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It makes sense to take from the links you provided that the recovery workers show symptoms normally associated with great amounts of radiation, for example, the Chernobyl disaster, and that warrants deeper examination, no question. But it still takes a huge leap from the rescue workers' illness to a nuclear device, at least not until other causes (incorporation of dust particles, toxic fumes and gases etc.) have been investigated and excluded.

      <p>
       Sorry, man, I tried, but I don't. I saw a schematic of the complex with three red dots and a photo of the steaming rubble - nothing what would qualify as a "nuclear detonation point", especially since we're operating in a complete information vacuum, as we both have no clue how the typical "nuclear detonation point" is supposed to look like.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For those having trouble visualizing an underground nuke, here's an excellent video example. First, notice the detonation causing a ground-based blast wave -- i.e., earthquake. Then about 10 seconds later, the ground collapses. Imagine one of these under each WTC building.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       First of all, we have no confirmation that these are nuclear explosions in the first place. Secondly, we have no idea what exactly happens underground. Thirdly, the ground clearly is deformed in a rapidly expanding concentric pattern on a plane. I can easily see the whole complex being swallowed by a circular hole in the ground - but not a bathtub staying intact, nor the Twins disintegrating from top to bottom and ejaculating all their shit over the place.

      <p>
       That's quite interesting indeed. Is that pattern consistent throughout all the footage (not counting the one from the newscopters)? Could it be explained with more conventional explosives?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Here's an article explaining the demolition, originally in the German magazine NEXUS:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Ground Zero – Nuclear Demolition of the World Trade Center
        </li>
       </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not just am I German, there was a time also when I read stuff like NEXUS and MATRIX 3000 because I was disappointed by Der Spiegel's treatment of 9/11 - until I gave those up too. There is some interesting stuff in-between, but there are only so many pseudo-scientific articles about séances and ghost sightings one wants to have his monthly dose of alternative reality theories filled with.
      </p>
      <p>
       And believe it or not, I am familiar with Khalezov's theory, and re-read the article before I dismissed his theory again for the same reasons as the first time: the schematics do not explain how the destruction wave is supposed to run from below the tower,
       <em>
        invisibly
       </em>
       up the whole tower, and
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       initiate an obvious, smooth, linear motion running from the top down through an already fractured structure. It would be expected that such a mode of destruction would force the whole tower to be compressed uniformly, and synchronously, leading even to the tower toppling, not an axially symmetric avalanche from the top down.
      </p>
      <p>
       The glacial pothole in the Manhattan Schist Khalezov cites as evidence ("molten rock") was clearly situated under WTC4, even outside the bath tub, btw.

       In brief, you've narrowed down the "dustification" issue to either nukes or Judy Woods' energy beam. That's an excellent first step, and it strongly suggests (as I have) that AE911Truth is a limited hangout operation, intended to keep us from researching beyond thermite. Something to take note of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there is FAR more evidence, as I've presented, to suggest nukes than energy beam. Almost all of the energy beam support comes from this one person, interpreting collapse videos within her own frame -- careful not to mention nuclear possibilities. This suggests that Judy Woods is a disinformation agent, intended to explain the near-total pulverization of the steel structures.
      </p>
      <p>
       But look: If you fail to provide ANY supporting references for your negative claims (glacial pothole?? They'd really build the tallest buildings on the planet on a glacial pothole??), and you discredit information simply based on its presentation (you don't like the voice?? If I read it to you will that make it better?), I think your role here is clear for all to see. You're not interested in collaboratively arriving at truth. You're pushing an agenda, steering people away from something they're not supposed to see.

       Correct. Their primary mission appears to be supporting AE911Truth, which is itself a limited hangout government operation designed to keep people from learning about the nuclear demolition of WTC1, 2, &amp; 7 on 9/11. Yeah.. They fucking nuked us. Three times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually like AE911Truth. I think they're waking people up to the fact that their own government would attack them. I mean, that's a big damn deal in and of itself. But they're actively concealing the fact that three 150KT nuclear devices were set off in the middle of NYC.
      </p>
      <p>
       That deception has led to nearly 4,000 first responders getting leukemia, thyroid cancer, and prostate cancer -- all from radiation. (The media spins it as lung cancer from asbestos to conceal the radiation problem.) Much of this have been prevented with simple potassium iodide tablets.
      </p>
      <p>
       And their cries for a new investigation will never amount to anything. They're gathering up all the truthers into a net of false hope and impotence, while TPTB carry out their plans unhindered.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot of hate for vaccines and GMO threads too, but the anti-nuclear detonation sentiment appears to have mod support. I almost got banned for talking about it. Whole damn team turned on me at once. It was quite stunning, and it laid bare what this sub is all about. I ain't mad at em. If I get banned, that's what's up -- no matter how many of them band together to weave their own narrative. Anyhow, I think that's unlikely, but if that does happen, you can find me over at

       for the time being.

      <p>
       And, when you stop and think about it, is it even possible that a forum with this much influence among truth seekers (over 330,000 subscribers!) would
       <em>
        not

       be controlled?

       There is no psy-op or anything like that. Why can't you believe realize there's no one controlling anything behind the scenes? You all sound like a bunch of paranoid schizophrenics.

       Point 1 - I used the word "infanticide" as a metaphor (I told you to look that word up, and you clearly haven't). It alludes to the action of people killing posts in the new queue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point 2 - I am sorry. Sorry that you're too stupid to understand point 1.

       It does. That's why I'm still here. And I learn a lot in the "fight" -- even if it's against users that are only interested in discrediting and suppressing ideas, rather than collaboratively learning.
