       "1). Slave auctions were typically postponed in observance of Jewish holidays.
      </p>
      <p>
       2). Jewish SLAVERS (or merchants) were dominate within ALL American colonies, whether French (Martinique), British, or Dutch.
      </p>
      <p>
       3). During the 17th century, in places such as Curacao, and in 18th century Barbados and Jamaica, Jewish merchants played a major role in the slave trade.
      </p>
      <p>
       4). Jews were also active in the Dutch colonial slave trade. Bylaws of the Recife and Mauricia congregations (1648) included a "Jewish tax" of five soldos for each "black" slave from the West Indies Company a Brazilian Jew purchased.
      </p>
      <p>
       5). Jews participated in the 'triangular trade' which brought slaves from Africa to the West Indies and exchanged them for molasses. Molasses was then taken to New England and converted into rum later sold (or traded) in Africa while Jewish individuals such as Isaac Da Costa of Charleston in the 1750's, David Franks of Philadelphia in the 1760's, and Aaron Lopez of Newport in the late 1760's and early 1770's dominated slave trading on the American continent.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few inconvenient facts the Jews do not want known about their dominance and involvement within the "black" Atlantic Slave Trade:
The Jewish Onslaught: Despatches from the Wellesley Battlefront by Martin, Tony (1994). Dr. Tony Martin executed the brilliant indictment with irrefutable facts and evidence. Yet, the most overwhelming, compelling and condemning data comes from the Jew's esteemed scholar and beloved Rabbi Marc Lee Raphael through his book titled Jews and Judaism in the United States: A documentary history (Library of Jewish studies) (New York: Behrman House, Inc., Pub, 1983), pp. 14, 23-25. And finally, the despised "fact book" filled with Jewish scholarly arrogance and self-incrimination as revealed in the book The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews, Second Edition (Volume 2) presented by their ace nemesis the Nation of Islam has also provided convincing embarrassment... So much so, there have been a few blundering attempts to refute it --- like this one, but the damage sustained is irrevocable as it becomes known.
      </p>
      <p>
       JEWS clearly owned so many of the slave ships; The 'Nassau' owned by Moses Levy, The 'Four Sisters' also owned by Moses Levy, The 'Anne' &amp; The 'Eliza' owned by Justus Bosch and John Abrams, The 'Prudent Betty' owned by Henry Cruger and Jacob Phoenix, The 'Hester' owned by Mordecai and David Gomez, The 'Elizabeth' also owned by Mordecai and David Gomez...ï»¿"

       It's ok to blame slavery on all White European people and all of their descendants forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's NOT ok to mention that a single Jew ever owned a slave, much less ran the slave trade, because that would be anti-semitic.

       While only 1% of white Americans owned slaves, 22% of freed blacks did, and 40% of Jews did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kind of makes Jon Stewart [a gentleman of Jewish ancestry] disgusting for blaming Bill O'Reilly [an Irishman, whose ancestors were slaves] for slavery. Historically, it wasn't Bill's ancestors profiting from slavery, but Stewart's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stewart went one better by attacking O'Reilly's dad for living in the subdivision of Levittown [which had a provision whereby they weren't allowed to sell homes to blacks]. Who
       <em>
        created
       </em>
       Levittown? You guessed it! Not an Irishman, but a Jew [named William Levitt]. It was Levitt who put in the rider not to sell to blacks. Yet there was Stewart, blaming the host population for shit his people did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to beat up on our Jewish brothers [because there are many, many, many good people among their numbers], but yes: In the Age of Discovery, certain among their number were involved in the slave trade. And not just in the Atlantic with Africans. Jews were conspicuous in the Eastern European slave-trade, too, whereby Slavs would be kidnapped and sold to the Ottomans. (In the tense times of the 1400s when the Turks took over Byzantium, the Christian World and the Muslim world were on lockdown. It was very hard for a merchant from one group to pass into the territory of the other. In fact, that's why Columbus sought a new trade route going West: The Turks had cut off the Eastern Mediterranean.) At any rate, because Jews were neither Christian nor Muslim, they acted as go-betweens. They could slip easily from one sphere to the other. As a result, they became great merchants--and unfortunately one of the big things they dealt in were Eastern European slaves. It was so pervasive that the very word "slave" comes from Slav. So our word for it isn't a reference to Africans, but Eastern Europeans. See the etymology here:
       <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=slave">
        http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=slave
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short: A lot of Eastern European antisemitism didn't arise in a void, but due to the slave trade. When a child went missing shortly after a Jewish merchant passed through, the villagers would mount reprisals against local Jewish shtetls. See European slaves being branded by Turks:

       False. From a review of the book from an academic journal:
      </p>
      <p>
       Faber has looked at what appears to be every existing record involving slave trading ventures in the British West Indies and the mainland English colonies. He has also carefully analyzed the Jewish communities -- and their relationship to slavery -- in Jamaica, Barbados, Nevis, and the mainland colonies. He has counted and listed every known Jewish slaveowner and slave trader in England and British America. Faber provides 98 pages of tables and lists, with more numbers than anyone could ever want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Faber's numbers make his point, over and over again, that Jews were minor players in the African trade. Table 4, for example, shows that between 1728 and 1806 traders brought over 45,000 slaves to Barbados. Only 128 of these slaves were transported on ships in which a Jew had a financial interest. Similarly, Faber shows that importers brought 3,986 slaves into New York City between 1715 and 1765, and only 32 were carried by Jewish owned ships, while another 345 came in on ships owned by investor groups that included Jews. The story in Jamaica was similar. Between 1719 and 1806 Jewish ship owners imported 960 slaves, but in the same period non-Jews imported over 260,000 slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews were more involved in the inter-island and inter-colonial trade, but even here the numbers bear out the utter insignificance of Jews. No Jewish owned vessels carried slaves out of Barbados, and ships in which Jews had investments took only 291 slaves off the islands. This compares with over 5,300 slaves brought out by Christians. Jewish shippers carried over 2,700 slaves from Jamaica to other places, but non-Jews carried more than 32,400 from that island.
      </p>
      <p>
       Faber shows, in mind-numbing detail, that Jewish merchants in the New World were less likely that their Christian counterparts to be involved in the slave trade. In England Jews were also less likely than non-Jews to invest in the Royal Africa Company, which held the British monopoly on the African slave trade.

       You claim that no Jewish-owned slave ships "carried slaves out of Barbados," but that's patently false. Here's a list:
      </p>
      <p>
       Name Of Slave Ships And Their Owners:
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'Abigail-Caracoa' - Aaron Lopez, Moses Levy, Jacob Crown
Isaac Levy and Nathan Simpson
      </p>
      <p>
       The'Nassau' - Moses Levy
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'Four Sisters' - Moses Levy
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'Anne' &amp; The 'Eliza' - Justus Bosch and John Abrams
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'Prudent Betty' - Henry Cruger and Jacob Phoenix
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'Hester' - Mordecai and David Gomez
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'Elizabeth' - Mordecai and David Gomez
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'Antigua' - Nathan Marston and Abram Lyell
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'Betsy' - Wm. De Woolf
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'Polly' - James De Woolf
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'White Horse' - Jan de Sweevts
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'Expedition' - John and Jacob Roosevelt
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'Charlotte' - Moses and Sam Levy and Jacob Franks
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'Franks' - Moses and Sam Levy
      </p>
      <p>
       The source on that is a Jewish scholar [a rabbi in fact]. His name is Rabbi Marc Lee Raphael.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews were conspicuous in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Names like Aaron Lopez and Moses Rodriguez are all over the slave manifests. The famous mega-corporation Monsanto is named after a Spanish-Jewish family that ran slaves from the Caribbean to New Orleans.
      </p>
      <p>
       The earliest Jewish synagogue in America was founded in South Carolina (by Isaac Da Costa). Why South Carolina? Because it was part of the trans-Atlantic slave triangle. It went from South Carolina to Curacao to Brazil.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all three of these points, Jewish communities rose up. Why? Because they were slavers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Famous Jewish philosopher Daniel DeLeon was from Curacao in the Caribbean [born among a Jewish family with slaver roots].
      </p>
      <p>
       Alexander Hamilton's stepfather was also a Jewish slaver in the Caribbean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aaron Lopez was denied citizenship in New England when he applied for it precisely because he was a slaver. (Evidently the anti-slave New Englanders found it unsavory). Here's his Wikipedia write-up:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Lopez">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Lopez
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       To read more about this, see the aforementioned Rabbi Marc Lee Raphel's book
       <em>
        Jews and Judaism in the United States: A Documentary History
       </em>
       (New York: Behrman House, Inc., Pub, 1983), pp. 14, 23-25.
      </p>
      <p>
       He writes: "Jews also took an active part in the Dutch colonial slave trade; indeed, the bylaws of the Recife and Mauricia congregations (1648) included an imposta (Jewish tax) of five soldos for each Negro slave a Brazilian Jew purchased from the West Indies Company. Slave auctions were postponed if they fell on a Jewish holiday. In Curacao in the seventeenth century, as well as in the British colonies of Barbados and Jamaica in the eighteenth century, Jewish merchants played a major role in the slave trade. In fact, in all the American colonies, whether French (Martinique), British, or Dutch, Jewish merchants frequently dominated.
      </p>
      <p>
       "This was no less true on the North American mainland, where during the eighteenth century Jews participated in the 'triangular trade' that brought slaves from Africa to the West Indies and there exchanged them for molasses, which in turn was taken to New England and converted into rum for sale in Africa. Isaac Da Costa of Charleston in the 1750's, David Franks of Philadelphia in the 1760's, and Aaron Lopez of Newport in the late 1760's and early 1770's dominated Jewish slave trading on the American continent."

       That should tell you something about the state of discourse on these issues, shouldn't it?

       Around 1994, the American Historical Association passed a resolution essentially saying the same thing.

       Not really, it wouldn't matter. As we see on this thread, the author's research is already being dismissed, so it wouldn't really make any difference if you were given a source other than an Amazon review, you would react the exact same way - Psh!

       Some misleading stuff, but the general idea is correct (you could easily google this). Jews did dominate the slave trade, and I find it hilarious that they are not mentioned when discussing slavery. Everything is about how White people were the oppressors. Blacks and Jews were heavily involved as well.

       Here's an excerpt of a review of the  same book
       <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_jewish_history/v087/87.2finkelman.html">
        in an academic journal:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Faber has looked at what appears to be every existing record involving slave trading ventures in the British West Indies and the mainland English colonies. He has also carefully analyzed the Jewish communities -- and their relationship to slavery -- in Jamaica, Barbados, Nevis, and the mainland colonies. He has counted and listed every known Jewish slaveowner and slave trader in England and British America. Faber provides 98 pages of tables and lists, with more numbers than anyone could ever want.
       </p>
       <p>
        Faber's numbers make his point, over and over again, that Jews were minor players in the African trade. Table 4, for example, shows that between 1728 and 1806 traders brought over 45,000 slaves to Barbados. Only 128 of these slaves were transported on ships in which a Jew had a financial interest. Similarly, Faber shows that importers brought 3,986 slaves into New York City between 1715 and 1765, and only 32 were carried by Jewish owned ships, while another 345 came in on ships owned by investor groups that included Jews. The story in Jamaica was similar. Between 1719 and 1806 Jewish ship owners imported 960 slaves, but in the same period non-Jews imported over 260,000 slaves.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jews were more involved in the inter-island and inter-colonial trade, but even here the numbers bear out the utter insignificance of Jews. No Jewish owned vessels carried slaves out of Barbados, and ships in which Jews had investments took only 291 slaves off the islands. This compares with over 5,300 slaves brought out by Christians. Jewish shippers carried over 2,700 slaves from Jamaica to other places, but non-Jews carried more than 32,400 from that island.
       </p>
       <p>
        Faber shows, in mind-numbing detail, that Jewish merchants in the New World were less likely that their Christian counterparts to be involved in the slave trade. In England Jews were also less likely than non-Jews to invest in the Royal Africa Company, which held the British monopoly on the African slave trade.

       Why is anyone supposed to look at your research and give it credit and credence over any other conflicting research?  Just because your research isn't damning?  I dare say, that's usually how history is written - by the victors - and rarely are they critical of themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, Paul Finkelman was the author of your research, as well as the author of several books of a similar nature.  He's Jewish.  Are you sure there's no bias there?

       Isn't it interesting that this same blurb - with the same text as introduction - has now been posted under three different handles?

       Jews will say that Tony Martin's research on the Jewish slave trade is "anecdotal" and "discredited" and "flawed."
      </p>
      <p>
       But whichever Jew wrote the book against Tony Martin will be called "comprehensive" "scholarly" and "definitive."
      </p>
      <p>
       Now any time this issue comes up, you'll have half a dozen Jews pointing to the Jew that wrote the book "disproving" all those "anti-semitic conspiracy theories" by the goyim who are just "jealous" of how successful Jews are.

       I think that about covers it.

       Yes, but until yesterday, it was largely obscure. Now that it has been posted to Reddit, it has been exposed to thousands of people, many of whom will be HIGHLY OFFENDED by the implications made in the review.

       Those that would tend to be offended have a habit of launching coordinated campaigns to have "sensitive" material removed, and you can bet that Amazon is being bombarded with complainers, demanding that it be taken down.

       Hey this ancient history is very interesting but our ally, Israel is a slave holding country. This very minute people of disparate races are serving, without pay, in Jewish households. Oh, our other ally, Saudi Arabia even brought slaves in their 1000 person entourage on the most recent visit. Do you think their sons late at night are dumping their loads in the help male and female? You betcha.
      </p>
      <p>
       The United States, with its history should be ashamed, not of this ancient history, but of the history we make now supporting and facilitating and, very often, doing the will of these monsters. Shame on you for letting our leaders pander to these people, not to mention the "Royals" which we supposedly ridded ourselves of.

       Yeah but in this sense: if something happened and everybody involved is dead, what can you do about it? Fast forward to now. If the cat pukes on the carpet you either clean it up or you let it stain the carpet. Thus, you are an active participant in the now. And now, there are injustices. Why do we support or ignore these when we have the power to change them, or at least not support or facilitate them?

       I found this out from a lady at the Alexandria Historical Society. Turns out that our office was a room with staircases at either ends where Jews would bring in the manacled slaves, and other Jewish "middlemen" would bid for them, then sell them on to the plantations.

       Another review quotes the author 'To keep matters in perspective, we should note that in the American South, in 1830, there were only 120 Jews among the 45,000 slaveholders owning twenty or more slaves and only twenty Jews among the 12,000 slaveholders owning fifty or more slaves.'

       can you refute the numbers or not? because "only 1.4% of all caucasian people owned slaves" is certainly not a number I've ever heard of in modern history class. It would be nice to stick to the facts rather than the good old "he's X so he's lying" attempt at a defense. (.ie ad hominem defense)

       Modern history classes don't talk about the concentration camps america had in WW2, and if they do they don't mention that it was more than just Japanese, it was Germans and Italians as well. Even worse, try to find out how many people died in those camps. Those numbers have been almost permanently scrubbed away already. I would take what you get out of modern history classes with a grain of salt. Hell independence day isn't even on July 4th it is on July 2nd.

       In my public high school my history teacher made sure to teach us all she could about it (never mentioned that it was more than japanese) because in the new updated history book we received it mentioned more about the holocaust but didn't at any point mention the camps we kept in the US. These things go slow, changing words little by little then slowly taking out bits and pieces of history. Really though it is almost impossible to find out how many died in those camps, my teacher taught us about how many got shot and how many hundreds died of starvation. Now if you search you might find a low number of how many got shot, I can't find a total of how many died in total anymore. I don't doubt you learned those things, it depends on the year you graduated though (and area). These changes are not quick, history is changed little by little and revised while the facts get sent down the memory hole. Why do you think we get a different history book every year or so even in years they don't add anything to the newer history and "correct" the older events.

       Yeah, no. We did hear about all those subjects. I don't know if you're assuming I did my schooling in the US, but the rest of the world is not necessarily constrained by the same political correctness as US schools are.

       oh wow, amazing comeback. I see though that you only have the ad hominem in your bag of tricks, you might want to look into diversifying your attacks because the ad hominem is really not the one hit wonder it used to be back in the 90's.

       I like how you don't even try to make an effort in defending your claims though, at least it's easy to see where you stand in the quality of research department.

       Yeah... so again: DO YOU HAVE ANY LEGITIMATE SOURCES? because I'm really sorry to have to explain this to you, but an amazon review of a book is not a source.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, AGAIN: where are you pulling these numbers out if not from your arse? Because to be able to say so fervently that the slave trade was DOMINATED by jews you have to first establish the total amount of slave traders, and then the percentage of jewish traders from the overall number.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see any of this in the "texts" you've linked, and none of your texts give any sources except for other amazon books.
      </p>
      <p>
       So are you saying we have to have faith in your honesty? Or are you saying I should buy all those books to be able fact check your claim? Or are you saying that you don't need concrete sources to throw out claims on this subreddit?

       While 1.5 percent of the us owned slaves, jews were .64 percent of the population(200,000 of 31,000,000), so even if every jew owned a slave in America they still wouldn't be the biggest part of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really though saying 1.5 percent of Americans owned slaves is a bit misleading, as in the south that figure was 30% and as high as 50% in some states in 1860.

       But theses are well known facts, and come from the book "The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews."

       yeah, no, that book is opinion, not fact. the statistics are skewed to paint a picture that never existed. Jews owned slaves like everyone else, not more, not less. But obviously you wouldn't want to fact check all this shit... And why? Because this book is in accordance to your pre ordained belief that Jooooos are eviiiileeee !!!

       So yeah, this subreddit has a fucking problem (okay I'm generalizing here, a few individuals on this subreddit have a mental illness stopping them from fact checking anything related to Jews)

       A review of the book from an academic journal:
      </p>
      <p>
       Faber has looked at what appears to be every existing record involving slave trading ventures in the British West Indies and the mainland English colonies. He has also carefully analyzed the Jewish communities -- and their relationship to slavery -- in Jamaica, Barbados, Nevis, and the mainland colonies. He has counted and listed every known Jewish slaveowner and slave trader in England and British America. Faber provides 98 pages of tables and lists, with more numbers than anyone could ever want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Faber's numbers make his point, over and over again, that Jews were minor players in the African trade. Table 4, for example, shows that between 1728 and 1806 traders brought over 45,000 slaves to Barbados. Only 128 of these slaves were transported on ships in which a Jew had a financial interest. Similarly, Faber shows that importers brought 3,986 slaves into New York City between 1715 and 1765, and only 32 were carried by Jewish owned ships, while another 345 came in on ships owned by investor groups that included Jews. The story in Jamaica was similar. Between 1719 and 1806 Jewish ship owners imported 960 slaves, but in the same period non-Jews imported over 260,000 slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews were more involved in the inter-island and inter-colonial trade, but even here the numbers bear out the utter insignificance of Jews. No Jewish owned vessels carried slaves out of Barbados, and ships in which Jews had investments took only 291 slaves off the islands. This compares with over 5,300 slaves brought out by Christians. Jewish shippers carried over 2,700 slaves from Jamaica to other places, but non-Jews carried more than 32,400 from that island.
      </p>
      <p>
       Faber shows, in mind-numbing detail, that Jewish merchants in the New World were less likely that their Christian counterparts to be involved in the slave trade. In England Jews were also less likely than non-Jews to invest in the Royal Africa Company, which held the British monopoly on the African slave trade.

       Before you guys upvote this you must know that transcendreality is a batshit crazy racist, an actual quote of his from below:

      <p>
       <em>
        "Jews have long sought to destroy the white race by scapegoating us for their crimes. It's all laid out in the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, a document authenticated by it's stunningly accurate predictions into the future, and it's breadth, depth and understanding of human culture."

        If one were to inquire more neutrally into what role Jews played in the Atlantic slave trade, one would find that it was a considerable one during the formative years of the trade, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and a very small one when the trade reached much greater volume, in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. This change in the role of Jews relative to the roles of other Europeans had to do with shifts in power and culture that occurred among various Atlantic-European nations over a period of some 500 years. The trade was dominated first by the Portuguese, then by the Dutch, and then by the English and, to a much lesser extent, the French.

       <br/>
       Number of slaveholders in 1860: 393,975

      <p>
       Well, there were 26,922,537 white people in the United States, but that includes North and South, men, women, and children. Typically, the slaves in a family were all owned by the head of the household.

        looking at the 1860 census

       Here's how the census defines a "family":

       "A family or family household is defined by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes as "a householder and one or more other people related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption."

       By that measure, their statistics are terribly flawed.

       A last name does not consitutute one family unit. Furthermore, there's no way in hell they're counting single guys living alone, or unwed couples, and that's hugely misleading.

       If 393,975 people out of 26,922,537 white people owned slaves and literally accounted for 26% of all American families, that would mean each family constituted at least 25 people. Any idea how ridiculous that is?

       Are you sure these are Christians in name only?

       Luke 6:31
31 Do to others as you would have them do to you.
Luke 6:35
35 But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are unfortunately groups like westboro baptist church, and others like you linked to, who do not have love.
      </p>
      <p>
       "If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing." â 1 Corinthians 13:2
      </p>
      <p>
       Being a christian is all about LOVE. God is love, Jesus died for our sins out of love for us! Thats why the gospel is called good news, that there is a way to everything lasting life, and a way to know God, and a way to have all our sins and guilt and condemnation gone, through faith in Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior. Good news! To many people are sharing bad news, make no mistake we live in a broken world, but the good news shines through if we as christians share it : )
      </p>
      <p>
       God bless you and have an awesome sunday and a fruitful and enjoyable week : ). Thanks for your awareness and diligence to spread the truth of these hateful people, who do not love, christians should be known for their love, if you notice a christian without love, how can he be called a "little christ like one"? Christian means to resemble Jesus : ).

       I don't know how many muslims you've met and spoken to about religion, but most of them would say something similar to what you've said: Islam is not about hate, or violence, it is about the univeral love that God can provide. Muslims revere Jesus as an important prophet and messenger of God. They celebrate his message of love, and argue that those muslims who do not obey this underlying principle are

       I'll leave you with a couple of quotes, translated from the Quran:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        âAnd in their (the earlier prophets) footsteps We sent Jesus the son o Mary, confirming the law that had come before him. We sent him the Gospel, therein was guidance and light and confirmation of the law that had come before him, a guidance and an admonition to those who fear God.â Qurâan:5:46
       </p>
       <p>
        The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: âEvery believer who consoles his brother in distress will be dressed by God in an apparel of honor on the Day of Resurrection.â Fiqh-us-Sunnah:V4N80a
       </p>
       <p>
        The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: âReligion is very easy, and whoever overburdens himself in his religion will not be able to continue in that way. So you should not be extremists, but try to be near to perfection and receive the good tidings that you will be rewarded.â Bukhari:V1N38

       Thanks for letting me know. We all must be aware of those who would use books to better their ends of destruction and hate. We christians must speak out more against the extremist groups who call themselves christian. I would also like to see muslims do the same. The difference with christianity is that we dont force anyone to become christian and anyone is free to leave the church or the faith, but christians should hold to the commandments of Christ which is to love God and love others as ourselves.

       Because money is a tool you use to exploit others.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the basis of capitalism.  It's the whole
       <em>
        point
       </em>
       of capitalism.  When you pay for something, both parties get something they value more.  The merchant values your money more than you, and you value the goods more than the money.  You've exploited the merchant, and they've exploited you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more wealth you acquire, the more your capacity to exploit grows.  Hence the Biblical quote from Matthew 19, "I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."  When every moment of your life is defined by a well-honed practice of exploiting others, your destiny after death (if you have any) is going to reflect this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a hint to help anyone understand this principle.  Do you earn a paycheck?  Think of a day's work like this: "I traded a day of my life for $100."
      </p>
      <p>
       A day of your life for $100.  Think about this.  Who really benefits from this?

       I'm no proponent of capitalism, but trade benefits both parties.  Exploitation happens when someone else is at a trade disadvantage for something they badly need, which is where we're at currently with capitalism.  Increasing wealth is good as long as it's not at the expense of others.  It's not a zero sum game and can be done ethically.  The wealthy have a responsibility to the poor though, and would do well to heed the admonition in the bible about the rich.

       You have gotten confused in semantics.  The question was about sin and acquiring wealth, not trade in general.  Of course trade benefits both parties; it is foundational to our success as a species, and now our survival depends on it because we are no longer capable of individual self-sufficiency.

       Not necessarily.  I know people who trade a modest amount of work for food and shelter.  They pay nothing for either.  This allows them to spend a few hours every week at minimum wage jobs, the income from which amounts to $2,000+ every month directly into a savings account.  That's what happens when you change your focus from wealth accumulation to trade.

       And if there is not enough food, water, or shelter for everyone?  Do you not also have a duty to fulfill this obligation since you almost certainly have excess?  (Posting on Reddit is a pretty good indication that you have enough of all three to share.)

       It absolutely is.  People are creating wealth all the time (good) and often being exploited out of it (bad).  Both are forms of wealth accumulation.

       So there's no difference between a man that has a plot of land and just sits on it, and a man who has a plot of land and grows food on it?  Isn't one acquiring wealth - using freely available sunlight and rain - and the other not?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is basic economics, but it's so obvious that you must be talking about some other type of wealth.  Please define the term "wealth".

       To do "good" with? You mean "good" like Clive Davis? Perhaps you mean "good" by what Bill Gates does with his money? Or, perhaps it's the "good" of Sheldon Adelson? If you look very closely at the so-called altruistic actions of wealthy individuals, you will almost always find an ulterior motive that has something to do with self preservation, statistism, population control, tax write-offs, or some other nefarious motive disguised as altruism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, do you not see the loss of power the masses have experienced? Do you really think we have taxation with representation? Are you really that blind? It's time to wage war against ALL wealthy individuals, not just Jews. With regard to them, they must stop coveting wealth, or face the consequences of a very angry fucking world. Are you familiar with places like Kyras Joel NY?

       You made a blanket statement that wealth acquisition is sinful.  I disagree with that statement.  I don't necessarily disagree with the other things you're saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I disagreed is because it appeared you were judging me for wanting to save money and buy a house so I can have a farm.  I hope to be a net

       I was talking about a religion telling it's followers its perfectly OK to pursue wealth, as I did mention Jews. That's a green light to not only pursue it, but to peruse it with the blessings of the Creator. To pursue it with religious fervor.

       Look, I believe that capitalism (or whatever you want to call our global economic system) is destroying our world faster than any system imaginable.  Everyone involved in the system is helping that along to a certain degree.  But your claim is that you cannot ethically "acquire wealth"
       <em>
        in any context
       </em>
       .  Maybe I'm mistaken and that's not what you actually mean.  Please explain.

       If you don't know the difference between acquiring wealth, and acquiring wealth with religious fervor, I can't help you. We don't have capitalism, as there is no 'free market' for new competitors. The "free market" only exists for the largest companies, that's the economics of fascism.

       I said put Chomsky down because he somehow thinks we have capitalism, and rails against it incessantly. The only thing capitalism needs to work, and work perfectly, is a free market for small businesses, heavy regulations for large ones, and ethics. That's it! It's the best form of economics ever invented.

       Not true at all. You need money for a space to work in, you need money to purchase supplies (a computer, software, publishing, paint and canvas). And, even after you've done all that, and created a product,
       <strong>
        it can still fail

       I really don't understand where you're going with this. If you want to debate with Christianities views of possession, you're going to have to tackle the 10th Commandment. Anyway, I would like to point you towards the following comment:

       Ok, I have to ask: WHY THE FUCK DO YOU ALL HATE THE JEWS SO MUCH FOR? I don't get it. They've done nothing. If any one of you can point me to a NON CONSPIRACY, explaining exactly why they deserve your hatred, I will never bother correcting an anti-semite post again. I'll still think your wrong, because they've done nothing, but I won't harass you anymore.

       In all honesty, the last thing I want people to think is that I hate them. It's just not the case. I'm not here to upset anyone, or hurt anyone's feelings. I just speak what I see, and I see the slow genocide of my race. I see financial regression, intellectual regression, cultural regression. I see it in virtually all forms.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it's not organic, as only progression is natural in times of plenty, as we currently live, and have lived for quite some time. From the Great Depression, to the crash of 2008, these economic hardships were fully engineered to defraud our economy, and destroy the middle-class. It's been said that all wars are bankers wars, and I'd wholly have to agree with that. Unfortunately, Judaism has controlled world fiances since the days of the money changers in the temple courts.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the best of my knowledge, they developed the practice of fractional lending-- literally using Christian money to enrich themselves. In other words, lending other peoples money to clients, with interest. The reason you don't see other religions doing things like this with money is because it's considered a sin to hoard material possessions. Not only is it not a sin in Judaism, it's encouraged!
      </p>
      <p>
       It's encouraged so emphatically, that Jewish communities often adopt their communities wealthiest individuals as spiritual leaders. This has created a culture that is able to pursue monetary wealth with the same fervor of a religious zealot. This creates a problem for all peoples not in the circle as money does not grow on trees, it comes from other people and their labors.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I'm concerned, money is the single most powerful force in the world that you can hold in your hands. It has tremendous buying power. It can purchase:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        time
       </li>
       <li>
        influence
       </li>
       <li>
        labor
       </li>
       <li>
        speech
       </li>
       <li>
        people
       </li>
       <li>
        property
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It can even purchase murder. Money is literally power. Consequently, a concentration of it equals a concentration of power. More power for one group,
       <strong>
        is less power for another.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Do you really not know who holds the highest seat in British Parliament?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Do you really not know who runs the Crown City of London and the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        How about the Bank for International Settlements, do you know who runs it?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        What about the IMF and it's economic hitmen??
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, if you're not a Jewish elder, all of this is going to be hidden from you (if you even are Jewish). They expect young Jews to be a positive, passionate voice for their people, and so, their education has been whitewashed, and socially engineered (trips to Poland anyone?) to fit the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, Israel has long been anything but an ally. The Jewish super-state has been caught red handed, many times, spying on the US. They've instigated us into wars for their benefit, they've stolen nuclear secrets and operated illegal nuclear programs (Dimona).
       <strong>
        They have used to United States for their own benefit as if we were a nation of cattle to be poked, prodded, and slaughtered, for the sole benefit of the Jewish state.

       Irregardless if this is true or not - this subject comes out of my ears now. There where about 300 Million humans
       <em>
        on all Earth
       </em>
       and about 4/5 didn't even move further than their neighbor villages.
      </p>
      <p>
       But today, about ONE BILLION WHITES, some dozens of millions Arabs and a huge part of China has to pay ideologically for that.

       The fact that the writer of this post doesn't think Jews are white (or "Caucasian") earmarks him or her as a neo-Nazi. Also, while there were some Jews involved in the slave trade, the writer offers no proof that they were the majority.

       Jews in Israel refer to themselves as a race. Whether you are a Jew or not is not determined by which religion you observe, it is determined by who your mother was. If she was a Jew, you are a Jew by Israel's laws.

       It is possible that something known as The Great Plan was taken and turned into The Protocols, but either way, Judaism, or a rogue sect of Judaism, was involved. The Great Plan is a Masonic/Judaic conspiracy to create a Jewish super-state, and to subjugate all races under a one world government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anti-conspiracists assert The Protocols to be a forgery of the Soviet regime of the early 1900's. I think it was likely released there as a limited-hangout operation by elements of the early Bolsheviks to obfuscate authentic leaks that were soon expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       My rational is this: I'd much rather be paranoid delusional, than utterly subjugated. Just look at the state of this nation, of the world. Freedom and democracy is not something to be toyed with, or taken lightly. The worst must always be assumed, as the tyranny of man, and the non-benign nature of authority, are always just around the corner. In other words, tyranny and oppression are ever-renewable, freedom, on the other hand, is anything but.

       While only 1% of white Americans owned slaves, 22% of freed blacks did, and 40% of Jews did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kind of makes Jon Stewart [a gentleman of Jewish ancestry] disgusting for blaming Bill O'Reilly [an Irishman, whose ancestors were slaves] for slavery. Historically, it wasn't Bill's ancestors profiting from slavery, but Stewart's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stewart went one better by attacking O'Reilly's dad for living in the subdivision of Levittown [which had a provision whereby they weren't allowed to sell homes to blacks]. Who
       <em>
        created
       </em>
       Levittown? You guessed it! Not an Irishman, but a Jew [named William Levitt]. It was Levitt who put in the rider not to sell to blacks. Yet there was Stewart, blaming the host population for shit his people did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to beat up on our Jewish brothers [because there are many, many, many good people among their numbers], but yes: In the Age of Discovery, certain among their number were involved in the slave trade. And not just in the Atlantic with Africans. Jews were conspicuous in the Eastern European slave-trade, too, whereby Slavs would be kidnapped and sold to the Ottomans. (In the tense times of the 1400s when the Turks took over Byzantium, the Christian World and the Muslim world were on lockdown. It was very hard for a merchant from one group to pass into the territory of the other. In fact, that's why Columbus sought a new trade route going West: The Turks had cut off the Eastern Mediterranean.) At any rate, because Jews were neither Christian nor Muslim, they acted as go-betweens. They could slip easily from one sphere to the other. As a result, they became great merchants--and unfortunately one of the big things they dealt in were Eastern European slaves. It was so pervasive that the very word "slave" comes from Slav. So our word for it isn't a reference to Africans, but Eastern Europeans. See the etymology here:
       <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=slave">
        http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=slave
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short: A lot of Eastern European antisemitism didn't arise in a void, but due to the slave trade. When a child went missing shortly after a Jewish merchant passed through, the villagers would mount reprisals against local Jewish shtetls. See European slaves being branded by Turks:

       This same corridor is used to this day, as girls from the Ukraine and Belarus are kidnapped in Eastern Europe to end up in the sex trade of Tel Aviv, Israel:

       If you don't know the difference between acquiring wealth, and acquiring wealth with religious fervor, I can't help you. We don't have capitalism, as there is no 'free market' for new competitors. The "free market" only exists for the largest companies, that's the economics of fascism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said put Chomsky down because he somehow thinks we have capitalism, and rails against it incessantly. The only thing capitalism needs to work, and work perfectly, is a free market for small businesses, heavy regulations for large ones, and ethics. That's it! It's the best form of economics ever invented.

       Theoretically, sure.  In practice, that's not how it works.  And yes, I am aware that the rich provide far more assistance to the poor than everyone else combined.  Nevertheless, the relationship remains exploitive at the core.  Oddly, in both directions, since charity often creates dependents who exploit that charity.
