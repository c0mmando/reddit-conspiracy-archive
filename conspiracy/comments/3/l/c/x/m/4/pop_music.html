       Music may be the most powerful and prevalent art form.  People the world over are very angry with those who rule our society, yet the 'popular' music seems to only express the most petty and stupid ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I just wanted to share a few pop songs from the past which might resonate with you.  I'm not the biggest fan of all these artists in general, but clearly I dig these particular songs, and wish more such music were popular today.
      </p>
      <p>
       An all-time classic:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fWyzwo1xg0">
        <strong>
         The Sound of Silence
        </strong>
        by Simon &amp; Garfunkel
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       A serious song with undertones of conspiracy:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5hFMy4pTrs">
        <strong>
         Abraham Martin and John
        </strong>
        by Dion
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And a bit more upbeat, with some practical commentary on revolution--unlike the Hunger Games revolution bullshit we are fed today:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrkwgTBrW78">
        <strong>
         Revolution
        </strong>
        by the Beatles
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This next one was never a hit, but it's author has blown up in popularity, and the lyrics are absolute blasphemy by the standards of modern day radio stars--explicitly accusing the Bush administration of rigging elections and plotting 9/11.  It is also worth noting that Macklemore is the first artist to have multiple #1 hits in the US
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       signing a record label.  This gives some hope that the internet might be able to subvert the monopoly that the record companies have long held over deciding which music is popular:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2gkPGcGkLs">
        <strong>
         Bush Song
        </strong>
        by Macklemore
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       An huge hit from a decade ago, with the lyrics of a true protest song:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpYeekQkAdc">
        <strong>
         Where is the Love?
        </strong>
        by the Black Eyed Peas
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, a song who's story sheds light on the conspiracy of popular music.  This song was a tremendous international hit, but never topped the US charts, and abruptly ended the string of huge radio hits by it's author.  It is an unabashed expression of pure protest against established power by the most popular musician of the time.  This version is the music video which opens with a montage of police brutality and military abuse.  The only words censored for the music video are "Jew me, sue me" and "Kick me, kike me".  And interestingly Google Chrome appears to not have 'kike' in it's dictionary.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1pqi8vjTLY">
        <strong>
         They Don't Care About Us
        </strong>
        by Michael Jackson
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       tl:dr; Check out these tracks.  They are hits from the past which express ideas which you won't hear in modern pop music.

       The sound of silence is up there as one of my favorite songs ever. I agree, the pop music that is out now is all about retardation, excess, perversity, and narcissism. I'm sure it's all a part of the plan.

       I feel it would do so much good for the world if the pop music in peoples heads was replaced by songs like The Sound of Silence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the less serious songs by Simon and Garfunkel have so much more heart than today's radio shit.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Making love in the afternoon with Cecilia
Up in my bedroom,
        <em>
         Making love
        </em>
        I got up to wash my face
When I come back to bed,
Someone's taken my place.
Celia, you're breaking my heart,
You're shaking my confidence daily.
Oh Cecilia, I'm down on my knees,
I'm begging you please to come home.
Come on home
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       -Cecilia, by Simon and Garfunkel
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I want to leave with somebody.
I want to do shots with somebody.
        <em>
         SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS SHOTS.
        </em>
        We ain't gotta tell nobody.
We ain't gotta tell nobody.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       -Nearly the most popular song in the world right now

       Just now reading the lyrics to The Sound of Silence for the first time, it really is such a masterpiece.  It's meaning is so profound.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know the meaning of the song is not a simple idea, but I find myself relating to it so much right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       On nights like this, I wonder why I spend hours writing impassioned posts on reddit, often getting not a single real response.  I take the silence to mean that not a single person really read and felt what I'm trying to communicate.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Fools," said I, "you do not know 
Silence like a cancer grows 
Hear my words that I might teach you 
Take my arms that I might reach you" 
But my words like silent raindrops fell 
And echoed in the wells of silence
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, mindless entertainment is distributed and taken in by countless people.  They bow and pray to the neon god they made, while the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just such a powerful song filled with so much subtle truth.  The most meaningful truths are found in the silence.  The most prophetic words are either never spoken, perhaps they are written anonymously in graffiti or buried on the internet where no one will read them, written by an uncredited author.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure the song's meaning can be interpreted countless ways and I'm not even attempting to provide a general interpretation.  I'm just streaming out some thoughts before bed.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl:dr; whispered in the sound of silence

       I think your interpretation is pretty good.

       To me, this means reality. People are glued to their devices and "online" is not reality. People text/type chat each other online all day, but IRL (reality), most wont say a word to someone they pass in the street/store/etc.

       Real people are writing/saying it, not fake scripted TV "programming". I believe that's what they meant by that, and it's so true.

       It truly is. Much like Orwell, I see this as prophecy/warning of the time we are living in now, but was also relevant/beginning back then.

       Exactly, which is why people hate it. If there is silence, you are forced to actually think/contemplate, without interruption or background noise. I find silence peaceful, others go bat shit crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       All-in-all, love the song and you're right. People can interpret this song in so many ways. I really wish a new hippy movement comes to fruition here, like in the 60's (before being infiltrated). A real movement, not this faux hippy pop culture.

       Are there any artists out there today that aren't rap artists?  Flobots were about as close as I could go...There was something to be said about 60's music...

       There's a ton of new music outside of rap that I like, though it's all pretty random and can be tough to sift through.  I wouldn't even describe most of what I listen to today as "good music," but I still like it for whatever reasons.  Music taste is also very subjective, so I wouldn't assume you'd like most of these, but here's a short random sampling of new music I like.
