<p>This book is mine, I uploaded it 18 months ago, and it has gotten tremendously positive feedback. The last few weeks it has been gaining traction again after being shared in a few private circles, and I would like to share it with this community as well. My ideas and understandings have evolved significantly since releasing it, but I&#39;ve been told its still an excellent dissection of the &#39;Pathocracy&#39;, one layer at a time. </p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it :)</p>

<p>Love and Light</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I have to agree with gruasty, even if your spiritual experiences are profound and helpful for people on that path, those who are new to the conspiracies you&#39;re discussing will likely be turned off by it. Your personal communications with God would best be served with another book entirely, imo. Just a bit of constructive criticism ;) Great work anyway, this is the kind of stuff we need more of!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree as well, nix that chapter or designate it as an Afterword or something. </p>

<p>BUT, I&#39;m glad this version that I found included the &quot;Awakening&quot; part because it&#39;s poignant and familiar to the point of being eerie to me, especially considering the week I&#39;ve had (which started with me dusting off Synchronicity by the Police for the 1st time in 15 years, and ended with something I had already described as a &quot;waking up&quot; days before I even read this). Synchronicity indeed. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t even get me started on that lucky number stuff. It&#39;s just way too weird and similar to my own mind to acknowledge and still feel like I&#39;m being rational. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool, thank you for the book.  I read the introduction and I&#39;m going to continue.  Along with deciding what is and isn&#39;t the truth, filtering which sources are credible, I like to see how information like this is presented.  If you tell people too much at once, or one thing way out of their spectrum of perception, they shut down and you&#39;ve lost them.  The balance is difficult to hit and varies individually.</p>

<p>Again, thanks for the book.  I appreciate the amount of time that it takes to create anything significant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright people, this is a phenomenal book. </p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t read it, <strong>stop reading this comment and read this book.</strong> This is one of the best books I have ever read. It should be translated into at least a dozen languages and distributed to the masses. </p>

<p>It begins with a sharp geopolitical analysis of al Qaida and why it was created which was what got me hooked initially. Seriously, stop reading this comment and just read the first 15 pages. That way you will know you&#39;re in for a serious read here. I love the sourcing - all legit, drawn from credible publications. If the NSA had any sense they&#39;d DDOS the shit out of the server hosting this PDF. </p>

<p>The MK Ultra/sacrifice cult stuff is a mindfuck. But compelling. If you&#39;re familiar with all of this crazy shit already, this book is a goldmine of research and information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly after reading half of this, Even with topics I do not care about I still found the MK part the most stunning. I am flabbergasted by the amount of control that is being used on the general world populous. Its a fucking trip. I know things like how a bunch of small situations changing momentum can actually cause a normal reaction to be amplified. It really is amazing how things like this are listed in here. Im going to get some food and read the rest of this!

    <div class="md"><p>That was more sarcasm. Mk-ultra is probably one of the most profound discoveries in the history of this thing called life. There&#39;s a reason everyone kinda nixed bombs and started seeing the wars of the future fought on a purely biochemical rite of perception. The dna that governs the beings perception, will be the one that controls the being. The war of the future isn&#39;t country versus country, or even good vs evil. It&#39;s a battle between light and sound. Between fact and belief. Between deception and expectation.</p>

<p>Hoffmans juice AND the song of the tarsiers makes for quite the enlightenment. That makes sense I swear. I&#39;ll explain to anyone in private that at least makes the attempt to understand the riddle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just...thank you for writing this. You tied the ends up nicely. I remember when you started on the peoples history site. Yes I am a new poster, longtime lurker. Your research into the aftereffects of csa and programming just pointed me  to resources that I did not know exist. Thank you so very much.  Unlike you, after Snowdens revelations I abandoned all my açcounts and haven&#39;t interacted on the internets since. As I read in here, and yes, it triggered, we end up very afraid of govt and lawenforcement. Those that should help, either can&#39;t or don&#39;t, for whatever reasons. I believe, but can&#39;t prove that Aberdeen MD, yes home of Edgewood was also one of the daycare centers used by the nutters, and that the kids selected for the programing  were chosen based on preexisting knowledge of alcoholism, abuse or other dysfunction in the family unit. I still can&#39;t watch bad trip at Edgewood because I fear confirmation of and having to deal with my early childhood. Fuckall...damn psychopaths...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol I was like I should keep quiet since people may think I&#39;m crazy. I don&#39;t care all that much about it anymore. </p>

<p>THEY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY. They can read your every thought. They can feel your emotions. This I&#39;m sure. They may also have ability to directly control you. ability to lock you in your thoughts. </p>

<p>THEY CAN DO THIS THROUGH TIME. Did you just see what I wrote here??? THEY HAVE ABILITY TO MIND CONTROL THROUGH TIME.</p>

<p>Time? Did you say TIME? Like time? </p>

<p>LOL.</p>

<p>Just kiddin. No they don&#39;t have a time machine! They can&#39;t fuck with you from the future. Reality would be seriously fucked if they could huh... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things i learned about conspiracies.....</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There is no conspiracy. </p></li>
<li><p>There is good and there is evil. </p></li>
<li><p>There is light and dark. </p></li>
<li><p>There is hot and cold. </p></li>
<li><p>There is no enemy except the environment. Which we are not treating like an ally. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thus spoke zarathrusta. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>There is man, and there is woman. And theres an octopus that will bend those rules for the sake of reproduction.</p></li>
<li><p>There is only one thing <em>greater</em> than evil. That is the <em>greater</em> good.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Parse the world with that lens and you most certainly will see it for the first time. I went through all things conspiracy.... as a psychological battery of my own creation I assume.... and it didn&#39;t tell me much more than my thoughts lead my life so if i sew them with care and nourish those that are full of light and beauty... then my life will follow suit.</p>

<p>Just waiting for that to happen.</p>
