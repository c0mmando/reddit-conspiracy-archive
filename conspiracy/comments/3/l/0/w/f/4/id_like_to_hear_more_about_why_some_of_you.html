       I believe that I've never been to "space" to confirm it for myself one way or the other.   That said, graphic design and image editing have always been hobbies of mine (20+ years), and for that reason alone I don't trust any images I'm given of anything.

       I am not a troll and I think there are some interesting points that no one will answer satisfactorily (if even at all.)  I have a keen interest in space and planets and galaxies so I do not WANT to believe that the earth is flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I would like to understand the phenomenon that causes the horizon to remain at eye level no matter where you go.  I  have been to the beach, I work in a high rise, and I fly on occasion and the horizon always behaves the same from my perspective.  (Does that mean the earth is flat?  Nope, even that wouldn't sufficiently explain it.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The notion that all people who subscribe to the theory are trolls is not true, and it makes any discussion about this impossible to have on this sub.  I would try one of the many flat earth subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to thoroughly debunk this entire theory but it isn't possible here because any points you raise are answered with accusations of trolling, and claims that you are somehow cheapening the quality of the sub...   I am happy to discuss this further with you because there is much more to talk about than this minute point I mentioned above, but perhaps we could do it somewhere where it doesn't offend all of the sophisticated r/conspiracy users that blatantly ignore the rules on the sidebar.

      <p>
       Eye level is relative to
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       . In this case it's relative to the horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
       A simple bit of trigonometry will show you that the angular change from looking at the horizon in a building versus looking at it from an airplane is very small, not because the height change is small, but because the earth is proportionally so large in comparison to the height change that the change in angle of viewing the horizon is insignificant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you start going 20 times cruising altitude (ISS height) the curvature of the earth is noticeable, although even at that altitude it's still relatively minor. The horizon still appears "centered and eye level" because it's the predominant thing to look at.
      </p>
      <p>
       This "predominant thing to look at" is hardwired into how human optic system filters and processes visual data. In short, edge detection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Optical illusions abound. We all know the moon appears large on the horizon and smaller when high in the sky, right. Well next time, take the middle of a paper tower roll, or something similar, and look at the moon when its rising large on the horizon, and then look at it again when it's high in the sky. Surprise... they look the same size through the roll... because they
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       the same size.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't always trust your eyes, and doing so may lead to developing a sort of methodology that leads to flawed conclusions.

       You really have three choices for how to interpret it.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         1) Trolling, for lulz.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         2) True believers, either ignorant or mistrustful of science/pictures.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         3) COINTELPRO.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I'm going to say most of it is option 3. It's a blatant attempt to discredit 'conspiracy theorists' in the same way arguments for 'reptilians' and fake moon landing posts are.
      </p>
      <p>
       The average person just getting into conspiracies looks at the front page and goes.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Man, look at this shit. These morons believe the Earth is flat, the president is a reptilian, and the moon landing was faked. There's no way I'm going to believe them when they say 9/11 was an inside job now.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And so the purpose is served. Either outright discrediting the group as a whole or discrediting by association. It's surprisingly effective, seeing as people have been taught to scoff at the words 'conspiracy' and 'theory' their entire lives, even more so when the two are used together. Look at how many people refuse to believe evolution is real because "It's just a theory."
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a very big effort to make us look bad, has been for years, and it
       <del>
        is working
       </del>
       has succeeded. Keeping around fringe stuff like flat earth theories pretty much ensures the average person will never take us seriously--we lose all credibility, just by having it here.

       Yeah, it's not trolling. I'm convinced people do believe this. Reading some of these comments and doing a bit of research on it myself, I honestly can see why some people would believe this. Do I? I'm not sure one way or another. But I can say that if the earth is flat, that if we're really in a giant box surrounded by ice, I would be super depressed.

       Heliocentrism is an occultic form of Sun worship.  If you have studied the occult and secret societies then you have a decent base of knowledge and you might be able to breakthrough and understand the flat Earth, otherwise it will probably take you a lot of research.

       There is no evidence we've ever been space that holds up under scrutiny.  There is a clear agenda by the vatican to get us to accept aliens, and Pope Francis has recently said it's blasphemous not to believe in aliens, because it puts limits on God.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no pictures of Earth from space, only composites.  The moon landing was clearly fake, and so is the ISS.  Now there is an effort being made to privatize space because the government space agencies are dropping the ball.

       Any images we have of a curved horizon are produced by fisheye lenses, and when we get a lens without curvature, the horizon is always flat and level.

       The motions of the stars makes no sense under the heliocentric model where the only motion we see if from the Earth's 1000mph spin, despite the fact they claim is rotating around the sun at 66,000mph and spiraling through the galaxy at 670,000,000mph.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the major "scientists" that helped formulate the principles involved with the heliocentric universe have had occult connections, including Pythagoras and Newton.  What they were doing ultimately was trying to design another model that was more or less equivalent to the real one, but instead of basing it on the stationary and flat Earth, it's based around the Sun.  The two models are nearly equivalent in many ways but there are many major differences.  The spinning ball model really is a pretty good forgery or it would not have survived as long as it has.

This also includes a lecture in the last 20 minutes or so explaining the connection between the vatican, the pope, UFOs, aliens, and the new world order.

       You'll see a lot of people scream PSYOP at this movement - sorry but you're going to have to spend time investigating this for yourself.  I don't expect anyone to take my word for it, but I'm happy to point people in the right direction.  The Flat Earth Society actually is a PSYOP to try and discredit the movement - good information can be found at

       Novus Ordo Seclorum - the new secular order of the ages.  If we're a random assemblage of self replicating life forms descended from monkeys orbiting the third rock from the Sun then all the religious texts were wrong and many will toss them aside, embracing scientific atheism.  Remember how
       <a href="/r/atheism">
        /r/atheism
       </a>
       had a reputation for being extremely militant?  I myself am not nor have I ever been religious, so religion has nothing to do with this - the Earth is flat.  This is probably the greatest conspiracy of our time.  They have tricked us into mistrusting our senses and instincts and instead trusting their scientific experts - this is the base for the control system.

       My favorite thing is how IFERS believes things that are geometrically impossible. They believe the Sun is 3,000 miles away, yet somehow can be seen setting! In reality, people living near the equator see th Sun set below the horizon, yet IFERS's hypotheses say it shouldn't go below 14
       <sup>
        o
       </sup>
       ! Since that doesn't line up with what is observed in reality, we can say it's not a valid hypothesis.

       the Moon is reflective - there are no mirrors we placed there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gravity itself isn't necessary with the flat Earth model.  If we're not on a spinning ball then we don't need "gravity" to hold the water on the ball.  Centrifugal force
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       fling us and the water off of the ball - this is why the Theory of Universal Gravitation was conceived.  All we need to describe weight and mass and falling as we see it is the force of density.  Both of these are covered in the IFERS FAQ thread I linked in the previous comment with more complete answers if you'd like more information.

       Look up centrifugal force - it's a form of inertia that applies to spinning and rotating objects.  That's the reason water gets flung off of rotating out spinning tennis ball and it should apply to the Earth as well - if it were actually spinning :)

       For those that are curious, you can calculate the centrifugal force that should be applied to the water along the surface of the oceans (assuming the Earth is spinning at 1000/mph at the equator as the heliocentric model claims) - and it's a different amount of force than should be applied to the surface water nearer the poles.  Gravity should surely affect these areas both equally - so why isn't the water flung off of the spinning ball?  Cause it's fictional

       For anyone curious, the equation for centrifugal force is F = mv
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       /r. Dividing the mass out gives you the equation a = v
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       /r.
      </p>
      <p>
       The radius of the Earth is about 6,371,000 meters. The tangential velocity at the equator is about 464 meters/second. Plug that into the equation:
      </p>
      <p>
       (464 m/s)
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       /(6,371,000 m) = 0.03 m/s
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       radially outward
      </p>
      <p>
       Compared to the acceleration due to gravity of about 9.81 m/s
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       , that's nothing. The net acceleration is now something along the lines of 9.78 m/s
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       . That's why water isn't "flung off" - although it should be noted that the centrifugal force does slightly increase the radius through the equator vs the radius through the poles.

       The force is tiny, which you will see if you work it out. The earth isn't perfectly round precisely because it's spinning. It's slightly wider at the equator.
