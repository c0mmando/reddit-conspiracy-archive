       Go with visuals, and shorter videos of the events. NEVER start with trying to solve the whole scenario and answer who-done-it. That is guaranteed to shut most off. Who done it should be discussed at the back end after the newbie has a base foundation to work from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just ask common sense questions about the anomalies. If you only have fifteen minutes to peak some interest use low hanging fruit with these "openers", nothing too complex. If you have a mildly curious person and more time go into questions of how a jetliner can be flown at top speeds, steep banks and low altitude by untrained "pilots" into the Pentagon and WTC? Ask the viewer to explain how "office fires" and "jet fuel" caused this,

       In the last section of this article are various WTF visuals and images of various questionable events. WTFs are your starting points. Incidentally dishonest debunkers will insist you provide full evidence and yet never take the time to view or respond in an honest fashion to footage and WTFs. Stay away from the dishonest, it will drain your energy from more productive effort.

       Think about all the times that your mind was truly convinced of something that went against status quo. I'm guessing that it involved either a personal experience or lots of research.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not going to change someone's mind with a video or article. In fact, more often than not, providing these materials will only widen the distrust. If it's someone that you trust and love just let them know that you don't believe the official story that was sold to us about 9/11. If they ask why, just let them know that it's a subject that you've done a lot of research on and came to the conclusion that things just didn't add up. You don't need to be specific unless they really want details and you believe that they have an open mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't argue with anyone that looks like they're angry or annoyed... It's a losing battle. Every person knows that their is a fragment of population that doesn't believe the official story. It's doubtful that you will ever convince anyone, especially if they are already super opinionated.

        the 10-second video of WTC7
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't tell them what they are about to see, and don't say it has anything to do with 9/11.  Just show them the video and ask them what it looks like. If they are honest and have a little intelligence, they'll say it looks like a "controlled demolition". Then tell them the circumstances---that it happened about 5:20 on the afternoon of 9/11, 100 yards away from where the twin towers fell, and no plane hit the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a person agrees and admits in their own mind that WTC7 was controlled demolition, it's harder for them to back away from it. It makes their heads spin, but they get over it. And eventually they'll do their own research.

      </p>
      <p>
       Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth: Experts Speak Out
      </p>
      <p>
       This covers the demolition of the three World Trade Center buildings, 1, 2 and 7. AE911Truth is highly credible as it only deals with the actual, physical evidence. They don't go into "who did it" and they stay far away from disinformation like Judith Woods and her "space beams" or "mini-nukes."
      </p>
      <p>
       Hypothesis is the story of Dr. Steven Jones, who discovered thermetic material in the dust - something that would have been used to demolish the towers. It goes over how he was threatened by various "spooky" types, offered bribes to cover up his research, and eventually forced into retirement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zero: An Investigation Into 9/11 is a French film about the propaganda from the Bush administration and the neo-conservatives. It's quite good.

       These films are for people who are primed to learn more. The New Pearl Harbor totally absorbed me to the point of tears when I was ready to take off the blinders. But it and the others are too long and involved for most. I tried to use them too early with my son and some friends. The short WTFs did get their attention.

       I liked the BBC documentary "The Power of Nightmares" - it is not exactly a 9/11 Truth film but it goes over a lot of the "War on Terror" propaganda.

       Denial is a powerful protective instinct, talking to people outside the states isn't that hard, they don't have the same vested interest in avoiding such uncomfortable truths. My guess is that after a generation or so pass by, Americans will gain enough emotional distance from 9/11 to be able to look a little more objectively. It's so blatant that, like the story of the king's new clothes, sooner or later America is going to take a collective intake of breath and say, "Wait one minute.....his bollocks are hanging out!"

       Hit them with there quick facts to provide doubt and food for thought:
      </p>
      <p>
       1- Secret Service knew it was coming, or they would've hustled Bush right out of that school.
      </p>
      <p>
       2- Both the co-chairs of the 9/11 Commission have said they were set up to fail and that the investigation should be reopened.
      </p>
      <p>
       3- Larry Silverstein, owner of WTC 7, is on video telling PBS that the decision was made to "pull it" on building 7.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are a good three ways to start.

       I have success all the time. Just tell em about how people profited from knowing about the attacks before they happened, and how investigations into trillions of missing dollars disappeared during the attack.
Even dumbasses understand that you need to follow the money, understanding motive is the key.

       I lived in New York City for a decade after 9/11. At least half of the people in NYC are truthers to one degree or another. Virtually everyone I knew thought it was an "inside job" or at the least the Bush administration had advanced foreknowledge and didn't do anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2004 I met a bunch of FDNY - they were ALL truthers and they all thought the towers were demolished.

       The question is what do you hope to gain?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its now approx 15 yrs later and most of the people in office have escaped.
      </p>
      <p>
       So is your goal showing that these things can be planned? If so include info showing project northwoods, the sinking of the Maine , the Gulf of Tonkin incident,  info from the book  "Day of Infamy" showing Roosevelt knew Pearl Harbor was coming .
      </p>
      <p>
       If that isnt your goal, what is? Getting others to admit you are rightf and they were wrong? That never happens and just makes people dislike you becuase they were wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       S owhat is your goal? What do you hope to get out of it at this point?
      </p>
      <p>
       If i was hoping to convince anybody these daysi wojkd carry around a printed copy of Project Northwoods with the us.gov archive internet address intact on the top of the print out to show it was offical government document. Tha ttends to make the point that the people in government HAVE put in writing plans to impersonate other countries while destrying planeloads of is passengers in order to start a war.
      </p>
      <p>
       But actually i avoid thoseiscussions now. Its just not good interpersonal talk. 
In 2002 when there was the possibikity or getting some prosecution or stopping wars and more deaths there was more reason to care.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the response is more likely to be "meh, thats ancient history"
      </p>
      <p>
       It was FIFTEEN years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is your goal?  Go live your life.

       Avoid all personal references and insults as best you can. The challenge is that when you invest in their learning process it is easy to get frustrated and that's when the name calling can start. I have done that so I know, but take a deep breath, and come back later if you can.

       Recognize that some people are hopeless, and others need to protect their inner child (cognitive dissonance).  I had a friend admit that the WTFs were overwhelmingly suspect, but that she couldn't go any further down the rabbit hole for fear of disturbing her psyche.

       yes - this is why i stopped trying, i know my friends are super smart, but they reacted such a base putting hands over ears type way - i felt it was a different part of them reacting. calling it inner child seems appropriate. I don't want to injure them emotionally. when I learned about all this stuff i did it on my own at my own pace - granted once it clicked for me i devoured so much research material - until I found some semblance of a theory of who how and why that made reasonable sense to me - I could not stop reasserting for months. but for me it was like a mystery. the fear was intense but what drove my curiosity was the discovery of compounding evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you come at it too abruptly or at a pace you can't control I think its basically the most upsetting thing ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       so I feel the challenge is not just to "prove" there is something to learn - but to let it not be unbearable to learn it, and really to introduce the potential positives of knowing.

       Look, I'm an engineer and I do think about these things.  This nonsense that jet fuel doesn't melt steel is ridiculous.  Of course it doesn't melt steel but it doesn't have to.  Heating steel I-beams greatly reduces the structural integrity of the beam.  That's why in nearly all large structures, you'll see the I-beams covered with a material which resembles paper mache,  that's an insulating material to keep the steel strong long enough for the fire to be put out.
      </p>
      <p>
       A jet plane would knock that insulating material off the beams and then it would immediately be exposed to the tremendous amount of heat energy released from the burning fuel.  The beams don't have to melt to cause a structure to collapse.  An analysis of the steel in the Titanic hull said that a mere 40 degree shift in temperature greatly altered the integrity of the hull.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aluminum from the plane would easily melt in a fire.  Ever looked at the burned out frame and body left after a car fire?  There is always a puddle of melted aluminum under it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nutter part comes from the fact that there are explanations for these things and the "nutters" would rather think the world is a magical soup of endless conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy's certainly exist but not everything is a conspiracy but of course that's just my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look maybe there was some type of conspiracy to destroy the Twin Towers from within America but they were NOT blown up.

       that said - that's great you looked into it for yourself and see no issue that leads to contradiction to official story. i disagree with your conclusions. but you did what I want people to do which is look into it for yourself. so while you want to insult me - I'll take the high road and congratulate you.

       Well my "engineer" friend if your ridiculous premise is correct then the entire fire and building code for steel framed skyscrapers needs to be revised from the bottom up. While this is being conducted every skyscraper on the planet should be closed pending the new building and fire code. Incidentally I am a retired firefighter.  Some torquing or bend in steel beams or columns won't cause three buildings to completely dustify and implode except in the world of cartoon physics.

       As an engineer, what do you think caused the molten steel in the rubble weeks later?

       First, I don't believe the molten steel exists but if it did, it was likely the result of resistive heating when the main power feeder shorted to the steel girders.  Steel can have enough electrical resistance that it can take a direct short circuit to ground without tripping the main breaker, especially if it's a high current breaker.  It causes the steel to super heat, glow red hot and eventually melt.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's one of the reasons why the old style BX cable is so dangerous.  The old style armored electrical cable used to use the steel armor as a ground.  When the hot wire would short to the armor, it would allow current flow but not enough current to trip the breaker.  The cable would super heat and would catch the house on fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       A coworker who was a forensic engineer used to work insurance cases.  He was investigating a house fire which started in the ceiling.  The structure was still intact and the power was still on.  He climbed a ladder and saw that the BX cable appeared to have been very hot (had since cooled).  He reached over and picked up the cable and immediately the steel casing began glowing red hot.  He said he never climbed down a ladder so fast in his life to turn off that power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, amplify the power available by 100,000 times and that is potentially the electrical energy which was dissipated into the steel from the main feeder coming in to that ruble pile.

       Why don't you believe the molten steel existed? There was video of it.

       As far as your explanation goes, it sounds plausible. I don't really knows much about electricity other than to not play with it so ill have to do some reading. Thanks.
