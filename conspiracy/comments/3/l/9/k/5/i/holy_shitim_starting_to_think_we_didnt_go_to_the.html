       I think the reddit conspiracy may be that it's mostly filled with content from automated scripts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Used to think people like this were posting using some software that strips away context.  Like the computer displays a potentially controversial message, and they are asked to give a response, without telling them what website or even country they are posting to.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, what's with the OP question even?  Looks like a poll.  And, it's stupid questions like this posted here all day, every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there are shill accounts here, and they are getting slicker too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be surprised if it is some bit of robot tech posting.

       It's odd because your question was straight forward. Go back and check op's other comments; person does not seen stupid. Idk, we're getting to a point where it is hard to discern humans, paid humans and bots.

       Heres something to consider...I frequent r/movies and there a lot of posts asking "whats your favorite (insert anything about movies actors directors etc.)"or "who would be a good actor vs actor" type question. At first I thought: these posts are just karma whoring. But then it dawned on me; what better way for movie studios to get a feel/idea of what movie goers would like to see content wise. This not only benefits them with source material but they can gain this knowledge for Free. Key word being free.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now take r/conspiracy and posts like this. Op's asking, "what is your opinion on this theory or that; what got you into conspiracy" or even the troll post every so often that bashes the sub and its users.
      </p>
      <p>
       If what we know about data collection/analyzation to be true, then certain posts asking for specified opinions need to be taken with an err of caution. This is the correlation I am making to the movies sub. What better way to get inside our heads and build upon that already present profile then to pose as users and generate user content. Being able to trace our search histories only gives them a glimpse as to what we are thinking. They lack the "why." I believe in understanding the why, you understand what drives your opponent and that my friend is something that will ultimately lead you to either win or lose a battle.
      </p>

       It is almost like we are feeding the machine its oil while bitching about the machine needing less. Just food for thought I suppose.

       How long have you been around here?  Six or seven years ago, they did a April fools day joke where you got to see some of the admin interface.  Everyone had a probability of being human score.  Wonder how that evolved.

       Slip, you've been around for a while.  Tell me, do you remember the days when reddit was so "fast" that you couldn't keep up with the postings?  Compare with today where everything seems regulated and constant.  Do you notice this as well or is it just me?
      </p>

       This has a lot to do with what we're talking about here.  Bots to generate crap content, control the media that comes in and out, that kind of thing.

       I stopped trying to submit stuff or contribute content many years ago.  I noticed that my post to the main sub were delayed.  It seems like they have  a live filter or live censor before content goes to the
       <em>
        new
       </em>
       section.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the thing... I truly believe that reddit from many years ago was a truly valuable tool.  The reddit with only one or two subreddits was really useful.

       Oh absolutely.  That's why this is a problem for us.  It was a problem for "them", whomever that is.

       The internet is a tool.  This is a fantastic extension of that tool's ability to help the masses communicate.  Can't let that get too far without regulation.  Control it.  Just like Digg, I started on digg and watched that go down the tubes.  I just didn't know what was really happening.

       Thanks very much for your reply.  I've been on r/conspiracy for as long as I can remember.  It's all I'm here for, mostly.  Though, I haven't seen you much.  What would cause a 8 year vet to start commenting here, or comment more?

       My post history has been whipped many times in the past.  My account is actually older; I deleted once, and convinced one of the moderators restore it for me (and they did after I bought a bobble head).
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally don't comment anymore (past few years), because I'm creeped out about it all.  The overt shilling is a mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, I've come to this sub since day one, just looking for interesting and hidden truths.  I believe that it's worthwhile to try to figure out our situation.  Truth is stranger.  But, I also enjoy understanding, and think this place is behind.  For instance they are publishing photos from that book the b-thing for the past two days, and I've owned a copy of it since 2008 or 2009.  It's rare, expensive, and creepy.

       Wow, appreciate that.  Appreciate your comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth is stranger.  That is it.  That really is it.  We are fed such a dose of fiction, when we see the real thing it seems foreign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, thanks again and this next request might sound a little strange but, anyway...  Do you have anything else to say?  I mean, if you had a chance to say something for posterity so people could learn from it and hopefully head in a better direction, what would you say?  Something you've always wanted to say?  Some bit of truth you've gleaned so far in life that you want to share?  I don't want for that to sound condescending.  Honest question and no pressure.  I'm hugely interested in hearing people's thoughts.

       For some esoteric advice, I'd say the mind is powerful, and positive thinking (read magical thinking) leads to real world outcomes, if only because you are more willing to accept risk and opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Discovering is often realizing ignorance; you shouldn't jump to conclusions about motivation.

       For posterity, pay your bills/taxes or lose your country/head.  I'm starting to fear/anticipate a version of the French Revolution happening in the US.

You have shills attempting to troll OPs, OPs sarcastically responding to them as a prescripted bot lol, confused part time posters, rude downvotes for those posters for simply adding to the discussion, irrelevant shill 'facts', its got everything.

       This hypocritical statement, from you, is baffling. Consider all your efforts to get people to fall in line with the "right" way of thinking around here. "Yes man."

       You've made my point. Because I agree that things have been hidden from us on that day. I said earlier that I guarantee there are things we can agree on. But because I don't agree with you on every other thought you have you find it easier to call me a shill. It's the easy way out, and you take it often. At least when it comes to me. Many people here have taken that road with me. A challenge = a shill to some people. My opinion/thoughts have been change on some topics here, but only when I feel there is enough evidence to sway me. I'm not a part of the "every shooting is a false flag" crew that hangs out here, and that rubs people the wrong way. I believe that the Boston Bombing resulted in real injuries, and I've provided evidence for it, and been called a shill. I've even said I believe there were likely government hands possibly complicit with these brothers, but that isn't good enough. Im supposed to believe it was all a theater production or I'm a shill. I'm not a flat earther or a moon hoaxer, and that gets me shit. "Don't trust the government" is a fair statement, but when it's the only piece of evidence people site to support something I won't jump on the bandwagon.

       I was on this topic for a while and
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1&amp;amp;v=NxZMjpMhwNE">
        THIS
       </a>
       video changed my view.  It shows the gravity on the moon as shown by an item being tossed in the the "air" and falling back down again.  There is some math and it does it for you.  I'm not a professional but I'm stuck with this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think gravity can be faked, but that's just me.  Don't take my word for it, watch and decide if they can fake gravity on earth and thus, fake a moon landing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all for knowing for sure, if someone has all the math and knowledge to show this video incorrect, I'm game.  Just need that video.

       Video proof, photographic proof, thousands of people who worked on the moon landing missions, the fact that the soviets didn't jump up and yell "America is lying they never went to the moon!", every other country on the planet confirming the signals from the landing were indeed being broadcasted from the moon and not Earth. Just to name a few.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moon landing hoax has been debunked thoroughly, many times over the years. There is
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       more evidence to suggest we went to the moon than there is to say we faked it.

       I tried telling you 6 months ago u/FutzBucket. The earth is flat and that is that. There is a treasure trove of information on youtube and hundreds of experiments you can do to prove it to yourself. Not to mention Zetetic Astronomy. Everyone is so god damned deeply mind controlled and full of themselves or the TV that they can't even fathom it.

       OP posting on the subject and then replying with one single robot-like statement isn't helping.

       I know I was a big supporter of the moon landing and NASA...but lately I'm starting to doubt them.

       It's true.  Things are much slower.

       I stopped trying to submit stuff or contribute content many years ago.  I noticed that my post to the main sub were delayed.  It seems like they have  a live filter or live censor before content goes to the
       <em>
        new
       </em>
       section.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the thing... I truly believe that reddit from many years ago was a truly valuable tool.  The reddit with only one or two subreddits was really useful.

       What do I shill about? You claim it's obvious what I do here. What facts do I try and hide? What writing on the wall am I being intentionally blind to? Fucking tell me. That nukes were used on 9/11? That's the story you're going with on 9/11? Take ten minutes to go through my history and tell me what I try and conceal here. Tell me what misinformation I push here. Tell me what facts YOU have that I choose to ignore. Stop being so goddam vague, man the fuck up, and say what you want to say. Tell me what I'm wrong about. About ANY topic. Tell me what my role is here. I don't post any content, so I'm not swaying opinions that way. Please, tell me what I'm hiding from the world in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       People like you get so sensitive when one person disagrees with you, when one person doesn't agree with what you agree with. The average person isn't going to respond well to you when you call them a "fucking shill" when they don't see something you're way. It's sad. Sheep on both sides. Bahh.
