    <div class="md"><p>After watching the documentary &quot;Let&#39;s Talk About Sandy Hook&quot; you realize how much preparation is involved to pull this Huge hoax on the American people. Almost as big as 9/11. Like changing the Connecticut state law that made  obtaining birth and death certificate of citizens illegal. Birth and death certificates are public records and any citizen should be able to get them. That&#39;s because no kids died and the families were fake. Or  The super professional United Way campaign that went online the same day as the so called massacre. It takes more than a couple hours to do that. The crazy circling of people in and around the fire department. As for your question. No actual footage of pretty much anything they claimed happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would change my opinion on Sandy Hook if we had some photos or videos of the shooter and the dead kids. Columbine I know is real because there was horrible images.</p>

<p>But if you dare ask for such things trolls come out of the woodwork and say &quot;why would you want to see pictures of dead kids?&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did see it.  I didn&#39;t see any real evidence of a hoax.  I think if the government or whoever wanted to have an event so they could pass laws or raise money or whatever the reason may be they would really have a building get shot up.  They wouldn&#39;t fuck around with actors that would require hundreds of people to keep a secret.  Plus I know that at least one person died at Sandy Hook so if 1 person died I reckon they all died.  The whole hoax thing never seems to really add up.  The government would kill their own president and kill 3000 American citizens on 9-11 and lie to get us into a war in Iraq where more Americans died and hundreds of thousands of innocent Middle Eastern civilians but they will use actors and have people play dead for something like this?  They&#39;ll rely on everyone involved to just never say anything?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they were little kids with parts of their heads missing.  They were dead.  Plus at the time they didn&#39;t know that it was only one shooter.  The police were chasing down a guy running thru the woods after the building had been evacuated.  It was still an active scene where nobody knew how many gunmen were involved or if there was still an immediate threat.  This wasn&#39;t a car accident where the paramedics know what they are dealing with.  This was an active murder scene.  The paramedics can&#39;t do shit until the police are done clearing the entire area and by then it&#39;s a body count.  </p>

<p>Me thou I want to know why they closed the school. They didn&#39;t with columbine. Or any others. Also the familo home was destroyed. Doesn&#39;t that make you at least think about wtf did they do that for?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If 20 little kids were massacred in a school I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it got closed down at all... Who the hell would want to go back into that school?  Nobody would ever feel safe or comfortable in there again.  This was different than columbine.  These were little kids.  And I know they were blown to bits because that&#39;s what the autopsy said.  If you really think they are going to release pictures of dead children to satisfy the curiosity of a small group of people who think everything is a hoax you are mistaken.  I don&#39;t need to see a little kid with his head blown off to believe he is dead the same way I don&#39;t need to go to Antarctica to believe that it&#39;s cold.  The idea that hundreds of people would decide to hoax this event and not a single one would come forward and talk just doesn&#39;t work for me.  I have no reason to believe that nobody died and there is no evidence to support that claim.  If the government or whoever wanted to have a mass shooting event for whatever reason they would really shoot a place up.  They wouldn&#39;t put on a stage show and count on a town full of people to keep their mouths shut.</p>

<p>And as far as the Lanza home being destroyed that wouldn&#39;t surprise me either.  The homeowner is dead by murder and the son is a psychopath murderer who killed himself.  Nobody would ever buy that house.  It&#39;d be cheaper to tear it down and re-develop the land than to maintain a property that nobody will ever use.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there any actual evidence that someone died at the scene?</p>

<p>What I find odd about it is the children missing from all images and video footage, including helicopter, tv and police car recordings.</p>

<p>Also, nobody got hurt but not dead? You&#39;d think the paramedics were there for those ones, but they had a total of zero patients if the video footage is to be believed.</p>

<p>The Parker guy faking his sorrow before the interview / announcement whatever..</p>

<p>Whatever happened, either something crucial was not told to us or it was some sort of a false flag / fake. For what reason would people fake this stuff I have nothing but guesses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The evidence is the hundreds of people (family/friends of the dead kids) that would all have to be lying the rest of their lives while the &quot;dead&quot; kids stay hidden somewhere.  He was shooting high capacity rounds at little kids.  You could shoot a little kid in the arm and it would kill them.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, according to the report he didn&#39;t get buzzed in.. he shot his way thru the glass panel that was next to the front door.  The firemen busted open the door so they wouldn&#39;t have to be squeezing thru the glass panel that Adam went thru.  The &quot;hoax&quot; people say &quot;he was too big to fit thru this panel!&quot; but then 2 seconds later they say &quot;Adam Lanza was so small and weak he couldn&#39;t have carried the amount of weapons/ammo they said he had.&quot;  So when it helps their version of events he is too big to fit thru the panel he broke but then they turn around and say he was too small to carry so many supplies when that helps their conclusion.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it did.  The front bottom left corner glass panel by the door was smashed and glass was in front of it... Google image search it.

    <div class="md"><p>So why not really shoot up a building?  Why do a hoax where you&#39;d have hundreds of loose ends?  Why not have the media sensationalize every shooting that occurs across the country every day?  We have 11,000 gun homicides a year.  That is about 30 gun homicides a day.  The national news could be broadcasting <em>actual</em> gun violence all day every day.  Why don&#39;t they just do that instead of risking getting caught pulling off hoaxes?

<ul>

<p>But somebody would have definitely come forward in a much smaller event right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was much different.  Compartmentalization was used during the Manhattan Project.  The people working on the project had no clue what they were working on.  The Vice President of the US didn&#39;t even know the Manhattan Project existed... that&#39;s how well that secret was kept because only a very few people actually knew what was going on.  Even if somebody wanted to talk they wouldn&#39;t be able to say they were working on the bomb because they didn&#39;t know they were.  Also they were kept on bases with their families and rarely allowed to leave.  The people who knew that the atomic bomb was being built were very top level generals and scientists and the President.  These are people who were trained to keep their mouths shut... it wasn&#39;t a handful of random families and a local coroner and police department. Sandy Hook is hundreds of actors playing like their kids/friends are dead.  I would think somebody coming forward here would be much more likely since A. they know they aren&#39;t dead and B. they know it isn&#39;t a war time national security project.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think of it this way. The United States, for all its fault, was arguably the greatest experiment in freedom the world has ever known. They are also the most heavily armed citizenry on earth. To disarm them, which <em>is</em> the goal, will take more than one false flag. It will take many. It will take lots. It will take conditioning, and more and more, until finally the public has &quot;had ENOUGH&quot; and DEMANDS, SCREAMS and BEGS Bernie Sanders or whatever traitor politician to come along and do the &quot;hard job that no one wants to do but must be done&quot;. </p>

<p>Yes, they could broadcast gun violence all the time, but what gets people to really change their minds about things are these &quot;events&quot; like 9-11, or whatever. It&#39;s not about proportioanlity, numbers or the logic of reality, it&#39;s about creating a pyschological &quot;movie reality&quot; in a way, for trauma based mind control. The idea of a maniac going into a childrens school is something that is genuinely going to horrify pretty much everyone, especially parents and <em>especially</em> mothers. And we all know how shrill and crazy organized soccer moms can get. </p>

<p>You also asked why they would use crisis actors, and such, the risk of &quot;loose ends&quot; well my thought on this is that perhaps they are experimenting with new methods of &quot;event creation&quot; and also at a certain point the people doing these things <em>are</em> human and it&#39;s a lot easier to argue that it is for &quot;the greater good&quot; when you don&#39;t actually kill a classroom full of innocent children to advance your political cause. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well after Sandy Hook, for example, the public support for a Universal background check law being passed was 90%.  If the goal is to disarm America why didn&#39;t they pass that Federal Universal background check bill while the public was begging them to do it?  They will never get that kind of support for a bill like that again.  They pulled off the &quot;hoax,&quot; the public reacted like they wanted them to and begged for new gun laws and Congress couldn&#39;t even manage to pass 1 single federal law with 90% of the public asking for it.... That certainly doesn&#39;t seem like a government hell bent on taking our guns... that seems like a government who is bought by the NRA doing what they are told...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So that would require a hoax?  We have 11,000 gun homicides a year in America.  If they want to keep Americans afraid they can  broadcast <em>real</em> shootings on the news 24/7 and it would never require performing a hoax that would include hundreds of people needing to be in on it and never talk about it.  It would be much easier/less risky to just have the media sensationalize the daily shootings that happen around the country.  And if they really wanted a mass shooting event to &quot;terrorize&quot; people why wouldn&#39;t they just really shoot up a building?  What advantage is there to having hundreds of loose ends?   </p>

This was pulled off by a group of people who decided they&#39;d make money from starting a non-profit by pretending they had a local school get shot up?  This is getting more and more bizarre.

    <div class="md"><p>None of this &quot;weird&quot; stuff is evidence that everyone involved is just an actor and an entire school district and city is in on a massive hoax.  This is just people who concluded that this was a hoax and so they look for things to support that idea and ignore everything to the contrary.. But they can&#39;t find anything to support that theory so they use &quot;isn&#39;t this weird?&quot; as evidence.  None of it adds up.  And of course the media sensationalized the shooting and pumped it up for ratings with blanket coverage.  Our media always does a terrible job.  CNN broadcasted 24 hour coverage of MH-370 missing for about a week straight even when there was no new information to offer because it got ratings.  The media does whatever gets people to watch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Parker is widely believed to be a crisis actor from the event. One of the main reasons why is footage of him being interviewed right after the event. He allegedly lost his daughter Emilie. The footage shows him joking around and laughing before trying to put on a serious sad face to talk about his daughter. </p>

<p>Just answering your question, not sure how i feel about the whole crisis actor narrative, though i do feel that Sandy Hook was influenced in some way outside of just the lone gunman to push an anti gun agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the reason sandy hook gets questioned is because if you open your eyes and question what you are TOLD and ask for PROOF it is usually hidden from you, redacted, or denied even if it qualifies for the truth in information act. The sandy hook facts are pretty evident for a hoax:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The building looked to be in disrepair and even in the official medical examiners photos, there are signs of this. No papertowels in any dispenser in the entire school, moss growing up the sides, construction workers report here signs when there was no record of construction, which is required for active education centers.</p></li>
<li><p>Strange behaviors of all the victims families that were in the media. Conflicting stories. Youtube videos found before the event that seem to rehearse lines.</p></li>
<li><p>All the families involved were new to Newtown.</p></li>
<li><p>No tears. Anywhere.</p></li>
<li><p>No attempt to save the children. No medical attention given to anyone. </p></li>
<li><p>Active shooter drill in the town on that day. The fire department with the same people walking out one door, around the building and back in the other door over and over and over.</p></li>
<li><p>Pictures released of children that were alive and well in other parts of the country, when discovered were attributed to a &quot;mistake.&quot; as well as admitted photoshops where certain children were added to photos.</p></li>
<li><p>lack of proof of existence of most victims and the perpetrator and his mother.</p></li>
<li><p>Immediate propaganda from the victims families - without any time to grieve.</p></li>
<li><p>Charities launched the day of or day after the incident.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These things all lead you to believe that something fishy is going on. The fact that death certificates were hidden initially, and that no proof of an event at the school, not even a drop of blood is a bit discerning.</p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t asking questions, you are a much bigger fool than someone that believes there is a cover-up or false flag going on here.</p>

<p>All the parents whose kids were used for this took the money but too dumb to see that they were just pawns in another &quot;perfect scheme&quot; but we all figured out it was fake so it was useless. </p>

<p>I&#39;m happy to pull my veins out and braid a rope I don&#39;t need hope to know that you die slow. </p>

<p>I think maybe that people will do anything for enough money. Not too sure on this line</p>

<p>Then the chorus. Which is what makes me think it&#39;s about it the most</p>

<p>Then we met our brand new parents and didn&#39;t know it yet, so we chanted wed wed wed, but they didn&#39;t know they were dead</p>

<p>All those kids got &quot;new families&quot; for this and were wed to them for the story, but they died. But they don&#39;t know it cause they prolly don&#39;t know they were used for the story. </p>

<p>Then a witch tied her fruit to a stick when her coin was looking to thin. 
Like winter in hades, we drooled for the ladies as if the apple was owned. By God. </p>

<p>The powers that be needed to take our guns and make more money, so they tied the fruit to a stick and promised these people something to keep them quiet and they all accepted as if the powers that be were God. Which they aren&#39;t. </p>

<p>Slave never dream to be free
Slave only dreams to be king</p>

<p>This speaks for itself. </p>

<p>it&#39;s a counterclaim. without the original EXTRAORDINARY claim, there would be no need for one. so lets have the proof.</p>

<p>And you&#39;ve been given the proof. In the form of crime scene photos, eyewitness testimony, coroner&#39;s reports and countless 911 operator recordings and police response videos. </p>

<p>I suggested digging up graves. since then they&#39;ve been altered and changed, but hey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah?  How has this changed my life in any way?  I haven&#39;t run into any of these paranoid full-time Sandy Hook Promise people.  Where are their commercials on TV?  Where are the Hollywood celebs talking about Sandy Hook Promise?  Where is the media talking about them?  I never even heard of this website until you just sent it to me.. that&#39;s pretty piss-poor marketing for their cause after pulling off a mass shooting event.</p>

<p>People signing that promise is no different than high school kids signing the &quot;prom promise&quot; saying they won&#39;t drink on prom night and then they do anyways.  It is a symbolic gesture.  Nothing has changed since Sandy Hook.  </p>
