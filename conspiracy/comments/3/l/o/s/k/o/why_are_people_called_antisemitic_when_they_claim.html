Comcast is sometimes described as a family business.[23] Brian L. Roberts, Chairman, President, and CEO of Comcast, is son of co-founder Ralph Roberts. Brian owns or controls just over 1% of all Comcast shares but all of the Class B supervoting shares, which gives him an "undilutable 33% voting power over the company".[24] Legal expert Susan P. Crawford has said this gives him "effective control over its [Comcast's] every step".

       The only Jews in your list are Papal hofjuden. Rupert Murdoch is a Vatican Knight and Redstone is Jesuit-trained for example. Do you really think some Jews sit around and talk about how they are going to devise an on-air false flag like in Virginia last month? No the CIA and intelligence agencies do that and they tell these news companies how to cover them and guess what the CIA has always been controlled by the Jesuits ever since its creation and the big players in these news companies are Roman Catholic or Jesuit-trained and also the government officials who enable these psy-ops to take place are Jesuit-trained Roman Catholics like David Bowers, the Mayor of Roanoke.

       Anyone in a position of power must be subservient to Rome. Doesn't matter if you're Jewish or Arab like Sheikh Hamad bin Thamer Al Thani who owns Al Jezeera (which broadcasts the same news as the western stations) or Asian like Park Geun-hye who is the President of South Korea and was Jesuit-trained out of Sogang University. Besides modern-day Israel, when have Jews autonomously run any Kingdom of sovereign territory? Not since the Kingdom of Judah. But the Jesuits specifically put Jews in places of power to act as scapegoats. That's why all these Jews are somehow connected with the Jesuits/Papacy usually through a Knighthood or an educational institution. Look into some of the Jewish Pontifical Knights of Saint Gregory the Great who have fostered relations between Roman Catholicism and Judaism. Also look into the ADL and how until recently it was headed by Abe Foxman who is a racial Jew but is a Roman Catholic Knight of Malta and how the ADL gives out the “The Cardinal Bea Interfaith Award” named after Jesuit Augustin Cardinal Bea. "Augustin Bea was a German Jesuit, an intimate
collaborator with brother Bavarian Jesuit Robert Leiber (the confessor of Pope Pius XII),
and a trusted subordinate of Superior General Ledochowski.
Ordained a Jesuit priest in 1912 at the age of 31, Bea proved to be an invaluable warrior
during the Second Thirty Years’ War though suffering a heart attack in 1942.
Collaborating with Leiber, Bea secretly worked with Himmler’s “sole point of contact”
Nazi statistician in numbering victims of Gestapo and SS “extirpation”—“traditionalist”
Roman Catholic Dr. Richard Korherr. After Germany’s cold betrayal by Masonic Hitler and
unconditional surrender, Bea orchestrated the Pope’s Vatican Ratlines escorting top
Nazis to safety in Italy before they departed to foreign ports. The confessor of Pius XII
shortly before he died in 1958, Bea was promoted to the Masonic office of Cardinal
Secretary of State in 1959 serving Masonic Popes John XXIII and Paul VI. For Jesuit Bea
was a member of Italy’s Masonic P2 Lodge headed by SMOM Licio Gelli, the protector of
SS/SD Captain Klaus Barbie. During Vatican II, Bea was the Jesuit who led a pretended
reconciliation with the hated Jews." Jesuit General Ledochowski was revealed in David Kertzer's latest book "The Pope and Mussolini" to have been markedly pro-facist and antisemetic and in fact he disseminated the Protocols of Zion to American Jesuit Charles Coughlin who was the father of "Hate Radio" and then to Henry Ford. Within weeks, the Protocols were being used by Hitler and Himmler in their attacks on the Jews. The holocaust was caused by the Jesuits and not only did they want to kill Jews but Protestants, liberals, heretics and Orthodox Serbs the latter of which were slaughtered by the Vatican's Ustaše in Yugoslavia.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, please do not conflate all Jews with being traitorous. It is true that many are apostate Sabbatean-Frankists and some of them will be in the arms of the Papacy working in the media or government, but there are true Jews who do not condone the Israeli government or their political system which was designed to be controlled by Jesuit-aligned Sabbateans like Shimon Peres who gave legal custody of 60% of Jerusalem to the Vatican in the Oslo Accords. Barry Chamish is perhaps the most well-known Israeli whistle-blower who exposed how it was Peres who had Yitzhak Rabin assassinated. Chamish got national news coverage in Israel and subsequently his life was threatened and he moved to America. He tells the true history of the Jewish people and Israel and admits that the Vatican is in control of Israel and is behind this New World Order. Also note that the
       <em>
        very high
       </em>
       government/intelligence positions are never filled by Jews but by white Gentiles.

       Your comment does not illustrate what if any issue you take with Revisionist Zionism or the great Jewish patriot Jabotinsky. If you would identify exactly what it is, I would be happy to discuss it. By the way, Jabotinsky is a central figure only of Revisionist Zionism and is not in any way associated with Labor Zionism or modern prostitute Revisionist Zionism.

       is wrong it's just that these are traitor Jewish Papists and do not represent all Jewish people; failure to distinguish that is why criticism of this is conflated with antisemitism.

       You've got a pretty crazy definition of theory there!  According to Merriam-Webster:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <ol>
        <li>
         <p>
          an idea or set of ideas that is intended to explain facts or events
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          an idea that is suggested or presented as possibly true but that is not known or proven to be true
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          the general principles or ideas that relate to a particular subject
         </p>

       No, it's just that the definition of theory according to merriam-webster is vague and more appropriately identifies a hypothesis. It defines theory in the way it is used colloquially; but it's a corruption of what a theory actually is, and the reason it's so is to discredit scientific theories such as the theory of evolution.

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory">
        A theory is not the same as a hypothesis. A theory provides an explanatory framework for some observation, and from the assumptions of the explanation follows a number of possible hypotheses that can be tested in order to provide support for, or challenge, the theory.

       yeah, that was kind of my point from the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
       And since you don't seem to understand, I'll explain the relevance. The word "theory" was intentionally corrupted from it's original meaning in order to discredit scientists and scientific theories in the same way that the word "conspiracy" was corrupted in order to discredit people who call out hoaxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make sense now?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: People say "conspiracy theory" and what they think it means is "incorrect idea" but what the technical meaning would be is " the generally accepted assertion that there is a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful that is substantiated by facts and evidence"

       My understanding is that the people who are running hollywood are talented people. And if they HAPPEN to be Jewish, then that doesn't mean Jews are running hollywood. The accusation of Anti-semitism come from the fact that you're saying they're in hollywood BECAUSE they're Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the media/news channels, rich people own corporations and media is one of those corporations. Like many others in oil, diamond, defense industry etc. Obviously, they're going to use THEIR companies to benefit them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is true that most of the world's most powerful people are Jewish. Now, no one except from themselves say how Jewish they actually are. I was born a Muslim but i can't hate that culture/religion more. I would be pretty pissed if i was called a Moslem and sidelined because i just happened to be born in a Muslim country/household.
      </p>
      <p>
       But another interesting thing you have to note is that George Soros is also Jewish and anti-Israel. IIRC, some Rothschilds were hardcore Zionists and some/few family members were against such a policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line is that they are powerful because they were persecuted and they used their intelligence to get power. Other people who were intelligent fucked over the rest of us as well. So give credit where its due. It's not like those "sneaky Jews" had super powers. They were just more intelligent than the rest of us.

       Why do you mention

       here?  It doesn't follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you mention it as a form of priming -- I'm starting to recognize a pattern.  Any time anybody brings up any subject that Jews or Israel are associated with -- somebody inevitably brings up general persecution or if they want to break out the big guns, the holocaust.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're saying that they have sought power
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       of persecution -- the obvious question is "to what end?"

       They were persecuted. Most people who doubt the holocaust also tell about some 100 countries they were banished from. Some which one is it? If they have weren't persecuted and always had power, then still they get the credit for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       By denying historical facts, regardless of whether you believe in the holocaust or not, you won't be able to determine the future. I haven't looked into the holocaust being fake or not because i think there is sufficient evidence that they were persecuted so it doesn't matter whether the holocaust happened or not. I personally think i did happen. There is plenty of evidence it happened. You can doubt whether 6 million were killed or 2 million but Jewish people of Europe were rounded up and killed on an industrial scale. But that is not the discussion. The discussion is their power.
      </p>
      <p>
       To what end? I dont know. Maybe they want to play god. Probably like a lot of people who have held even a tiny shred of power.

       It's not a term.  He's putting two words together in a sentence.  People who are Jewish that are doing things they shouldn't.  People are going to use "anti-Semite" when Jewish people are called out for criminal activities.  If it was an US Army officer they'd probably say "unpatriotic" or "terrorist".  You did a good job proving his point though.

       If it is some Jewish people - then why is it "Jewish misbehavior"? Is there something only Jews do? Or is there something only Jews are not allowed to do? Because if there is neither - then "Jewish misbehavior" should not be a thing.

       Of course there's WASP, black, and Arab misbehavior, when members of those groups act immorally or unethically. Obviously, immoral and unethical are subjective terms defined by the person making the claim, but we understand what is meant.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a WASP kills a man in cold blood, that's WASP misbehavior. The institution of slavery in America is an example of WASP misbehavior on a collective scale. Likewise with blacks and Arabs.

       Criminal activities.  Particularly white collar and organized crime.  I think we can agree that those are things that people shouldn't do.  Again, it isn't related to a person's race/religion/ethnicity apart from how they use it as a shield to deflect criticism.  They will attempt to discredit whistle blowers through defamation of being a 'racist' or 'anti-Semite'.
      </p>
      <p>
       All groups of people do it.  Christians will claim persecution, military will point out their rank and service, women cry misogyny, men cry misandry, the KKK will call you a white hating bigot.

       Apartheid is an example of misbehavior.  And when practiced in Israel, could legitimately be called Jewish misbehavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has very much to do with racism -- not by the people calling out the misbehavior -- but rather, by the people misbehaving.

       You can candy-coat Hafrada all you want.  It's most definitely the same as apartheid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quoting a newspaper article from last year:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Apartheid" isn't just a term of insult; it's a word with a very specific legal meaning, as defined by the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid, adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1973 and ratified by most United Nations member states (Israel and the United States are exceptions, to their shame).
       </p>
       <p>
        According to Article II of that convention, the term applies to acts "committed for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically oppressing them." Denying those others the right to life and liberty, subjecting them to arbitrary arrest, expropriating their property, depriving them of the right to leave and return to their country or the right to freedom of movement and of residence, creating separate reserves and ghettos for the members of different racial groups, preventing mixed marriages — these are all examples of the crime of apartheid specifically mentioned in the convention.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And while most Jews don't live in Israel, Israel
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a Jewish State.
      </p>

       Yes, I see where you going with this. All Jews have to pay for something, whether they are individually involved. Like the killing of Jesus, destruction of Germany, crimes of Israel...

       None of this is hate.  It's simply people asking why nothing related to that race can be discussed at all without being called anti-semitic (or in your case, stating that there's an obvious taste for hate).

       The OP asked 'why are people called anti-semitic when they claim that Jews run the Media and Hollywood?' -- and clearly not all Jews could possibly be involved in the media or hollywood.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is intuitively obvious to the most casual observer.
      </p>
      <p>
       When somebody notes that most of the people in charge of the media are Jewish, is that talking about the whole race?

      <p>
       Of course not!

       the word conspiracy has lost its meaning over the years. for something to be a "conspiracy", that something just needs to be conspired/planned. if a bunch of people got together and planned to cheat on an upcoming exam, then they are all a part of a conspiracy.

       It's a great tactic. Over many years, they have put a lot of energy into making the connection that Jews were and still are the biggest victims. So when they call others anti-semetic, it used to mostly turn observers away from the conversation in order to not be linked to the victimization. Now, the tactic doesn't work as well. The conversation will usually still continue without people trying to tip-toe around the topic, and people don't react as much to the accusations and will stick around.

       It's a tactic to discourage people from uncovering and speaking the truth. . So even if Zionists control the world financial institutions, and we think that's unfair, you sir are anti-Semitic. . The "Jew card" never expires. . And I would like to state, I have no problem with Judaism - only Zionism. . Really though its any organization who seeks complete domination through the manipulation of any and all facets of civilization, especially economics. .

       America is a majority Christian nation. No one is going around pointing out how many major corporations or industries are run by people who go to church every Sunday.

       I myself am an atheist and find American Christianity to be oppressive and judgmental (in our house we call it the American Taliban).
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aren't you worried about fundies? Why aren't you pointing out how many congressmen/women are going to make oppressive medieval laws based on their interpretation of a 3,000 year old book? Why are you so obsessed with another person's private beliefs?

       All those things may be interesting too. I stumbled in here because the OP posed an interesting question.  The comments have proven far more interesting than I'd have expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of all the flack.  WWII bomber pilots had a saying:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <h1>
        <a href="http://i.imgur.com/PpClngU.jpg">

        </a>
       </h1>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If I asked how many major corporations or industries are run by people who go to church every Sunday -- I'd probably have people falling over themselves to give me the most up-to-date lists.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this kid asked why nobody is allowed to mention apparent Jewish  control over the media -- and people come out of the woodwork to distract people from the question.
      </p>
      <p>
       They go on the offensive to paint anyone who simply wants an answer precisely as the OP's question indicated they would.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything to deny, to distract, or whatever to get people away from the question. Even your comment does that.

       Regarding Jewish culture: it is cohesive and strong (I'm generalizing a little here). And there isn't a strong belief in the afterlife, so they push their kids to excel academically and improve the family situation generation by generation. They also push their kids to college degrees like engineering &amp; science. These things taken together are why you see a disproportionate number of Jews in so many fields.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've stated here before: I am a big critic of Israel's politics and behavior in the middle east. It's unbelievable what they get away with, specifically in regards to human rights. But part of the reason they get away with it is people shouting "the Joooz! The Joooz did everything!" and being so anti-semitic. This discussion will never rise above the petty until we take the racism out of it.

       See, the answer is simply that the culture is cohesive.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a simple answer.  If left at that, it's innocent enough.  I too, have preferences for who I work with.

       But the Army that swoops in to vigorously deny any suggestion that Jews might like to hire other Jews -- well you see,

       You've completely missed the point.  It's not about jealousy over someone's station in life.  None of us were ever going to be a Fortune 500 CEO anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when an identifiable demographic has a stranglehold on the channels through which almost everybody gets their information -- then it is automatically suspicious.  And because Jews make up only 1.4% of the US population, it is extraordinary that they'd overwhelmingly control the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can control those information channels you control public discourse -- you control what conversations are even possible -- you control the democratic process.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure all those people have worked very hard and deserve all the success they've enjoyed.  Nobody as far as I know has ever said otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it doesn't require racism to wonder why the number of people of any demographic in any position of influence is wildly out of sync with that demographic's percentage of the general population.
      </p>
      <p>
       And by wildly out of sync, we're looking at 100% of reputable media being controlled by an identifiable group that only represents 1.4% of the general population.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is unquestionably extraordinary.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it would not be unreasonable for someone to wonder if any
       <strong>
        overwhelming disparities like that also exist in banking and law.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean,
       <strong>
        <em>
         can you imagine a world in which a tiny population with strong in-group preferences controlled MONEY, LAW, and INFORMATION?
        </em>
       </strong>
       That group would be able to control everything that depends on money, law and/or information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even whether it's socially acceptable to question whether such a disparity exists.

       Why would such a group be limited by ethnicity, religious beliefs or anything other than the sociopathic tendencies of its members? Claiming that the media and banking system are fucked up cause Jews is grounds for accusations of racism. Claiming that they're fucked up cause they're run by a bunch of assholes is being observant.

       Nobody is talking about any of that mishigas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, we're discussing the observation that a social group with strong in-group preferences has overwhelming control over money, law, and information.
      </p>
      <p>
       One observation about the people with that control, is that they're all Jewish.  It is not antisemitic to recognize that a person's name is a Jewish name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither is it antisemitic to wonder why anyone who observes that all the people in control of our information are all Jewish -- is called names like 'anti-semite'.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not anti anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a reasonable question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the answer is that other people don't pursue that line of work.  Maybe other people are incapable of the work. Or maybe, just maybe, other people are somehow excluded from positions of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if that were the case, it would be reasonable to wonder whether it were some sort of conspiracy -- and if so, what is the purpose of the conspiracy.  And what, if anything, is their agenda.

       Nobody in this thread has suggested that either the media or banking is fucked up.  I think direct deposit, ATM cards, and Game of Thrones are all wonderful.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question was about why nobody is allowed to observe that those in control of those things are overwhelmingly members of a demographic that represents only 1.4% of the population.

       Because Jews are in these industries, does that make it conspiracy? Then because there are more Jewish Nobel Prize winners, a conspiracy? Because the NBA is 100% tall blacks, a conspiracy? Maybe a lot of convenience stores are owned by Indian immigrants? Conspiracy or just result of history and circumstance? Point is that if some group is successful at something, you can interpret it as their talent if you like them, or a "conspiracy" if you hate them. That's why.

       America is still a white country. The majority of the population is white and Christian. Moreover, America has always been a white Christian country, and was founded by white Christians. The culture of America is white Christian culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews don't like this. They've been trying to destroy America's culture for decades, via their almost total control over the mass media. Jews make up around 2% of the population. Why should they control OUR MEDIA? It doesn't make sense. Why should the white majority give over almost total control of the most powerful propaganda and brain-washing tool in the world to an alien tribe that constitutes only 2% of the population? Answer: it should not.

       We can easily explain the NBA:  the hoop is 10' off the ground.  A person who can reach closest to that has an obvious advantage.  Clearly not a conspiracy.

       The question of the disproportionate number of Jewish Nobel Prize winners is less obvious, but also less interesting -- because Nobel Prize winners don't have much control over the democratic process or society as a whole.

       I suppose the reason that Israel gets such unsympathetic press the world over is because .. Jews control the media? .. right

       To say that Jews are 'running' Hollywood implies there is a collaborative agenda, which is theorical. Yes there are a lot of Jewish media moguls but that doesn't not confirm they conspire to do anything but make money.

       There may be a lot of Jews in Hollywood.  However, values portrayed in the majority of Hollywood films do not reflect beliefs of Judaism, Zionism,  or any other religious agenda.  Actual output does not correlate with allegation that Hollywood is run by Jews with an agenda that is not profit based.  So allegation is considered to be a conspiracy instead of true.

       How many hollywood movies have been critical of Israel?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am only aware of one such film to ever even make it to American theaters:
       <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2125423/">
        5 Broken Cameras
       </a>
       and it was not produced in Hollywood at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there are loads and loads of films that paint Israel in a positive light.  If there were no agenda one would expect the numbers of positive/negative portrayals to be roughly equal.

       How did we go from
       <strong>
        <em>
         Israel is an apartheid state
        </em>
       </strong>
       to some incoherent babbling about "all jews" and "having to pay" something or other?
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        You know
       </em>
       you're making up the shit you're supposedly arguing against.  We're in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       where everybody knows it. It's not even a novel tactic.  We've all seen it before.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, do you have a coherent argument about why you think
       <strong>
        <em>
         Israel is
        </em>
       </strong>
       not
       <strong>
        <em>
         an apartheid state
        </em>
       </strong>
       ?  Or are we meant to use up readers' attention span on your attempts to confound the issue?
