       I never thought I'd be a holocaust denier, but the more independent studies I've done, the more it seems obvious that the holocaust was an amazing propaganda piece, just like most of history is. And the fact that it's illegal to deny the holocaust in some countries? I was just telling my little brother yesterday that it's the questions you're not supposed to ask that matter the most.

       My head is spinning and I'm looking for input, not judgments. I'm not anti-Semitic (although I'm anti-abrahamic religions  in general) I'm just looking for the truth. I'm open minded either way.

       There is no proof whatsoever of three main claims regarding the Holocaust---that (a) six million jews were killed, (b) many in gas chambers, (c) due to an order by Hitler.
      </p>

       It appears these three claims were wartime propaganda.

       No proof, as in the hundred of pictures of theses camps taken upon discovery? The people who survived emaciated and devastated, a look in their eyes that couldn't possibly mirror some several countries wide conspiracy to just make up some stuff and get a German war-monger in a little trouble? Sure, maybe you can't make an exact number of the deaths, but you at least know it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno, I'm pretty sure you can't fake that. There have even been pictures of the interior walls of the gas chambers covered in claw marks from people trying to escape or otherwise panicking as they lived their last moments.
      </p>
      <p>
       To create a conspiracy on that scale would simply be nearly impossible, much less managing to maintain the veil of secrecy for years afterwards.

       Yes. You are correct. This was the toughest one for me to swallow by far IMO and actually almost made me go a little insane. However you are right, in the sense that this poster outlined:
      </p>
      <p>
       "There is no proof whatsoever of three main claims regarding the Holocaust---that (a) six million jews were killed, (b) many in gas chambers, (c) due to an order by Hitler."
      </p>
      <p>
       Bingo. This is totally true. 100%. Even Ellie Wisel says the 11 million number is fake, but this will basically get you crucified out in the streets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said this is a big pill to swallow so don't rush it. You will come out the otherside better than before. Stay safe brother and godspeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just remember, this is the lynchpin of modern society, so fight your urge to tell the others. They won't understand and this WILL get you dismissed as insane. Just a warning from someone a little further down the road.

       Word. I mean honestly just since you posted this here and I guess are looking for some perspective...

       The Holocaust is easily the defining event bar none of our society. Hitler is our devil and the Nuremberg trials were where modern man made the devil real. That is essentially what defines modern times. For example, someone I know studies theology, and they now define modern theology as post-holocaust theology. Go up to someone in the street and say, there's never been an evil man alive, everyone is good.
      </p>
      <p>
       What will they say? "Well what about Hitler?". In this way, you are checking into literally THE DEFINING MYTHOLOGY OF MODERN MAN, the Holocaust. That is why I said take it slow, it is literally a whole nother world once you see that the biggest dragons of modern times do not actually exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, the Nazis did some bad stuff, but it's nowhere near the putting cigarettes out in babies eyes image that the media portrays.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet we live in the shadows of the Nazis, in the shadow of this myth. I could go on forever about this so feel free to hit me up if you want to talk, but I'll just say that this myth of complete evil manifest that is the Nazi  myth defines modern man and society, and we live under it's tyranny MORE than any society you could ever imagine being oppressed by any ideology. Catholicism, fundamentaist Islam, ANY IDEOLOGY YOU COULD THINK OF will never hold a candle to the level of slavery that exists between us and the myth of the Holocaust.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just saying. Fun to connect to a fellow truth seeker. It's a strange ride but it's the only game in town, most nights I enjoy it - just for the record.

       It's true though. The only boogie man to rival Hitler is Satan himself. And I learned a long time ago that boogie men aren't real. I just had never applied that to Hitler. I think that's why I'm honestly not

       Hitler killed a lot of people, there's no question about that. But whether he killed them specifically because they were Jewish is something there really isn't any hard evidence to support. He had over 100,000 partial Jews fighting for him in the German army so his policy on Jews can't have been that bad. Communism, on the other hand, is something he openly called for the extermination of. When the Reichstag was burned down, for example, it was Communists he blamed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no particular expertise in that part of history, but if I had to make an educated guess I'd say there was a real genocide which was then exploited by Zionist Jews looking for more power.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Is reason alone to question the story in the history books. If it really happened the way they say, then why is fascism still legal, but questioning the Holocaust illegal? What? You can do it again, but you can't deny it happened the first time?

       I see you have spectacularly ignored the point.  Why would Jews want to fight for Hitler if Hitler was exterminating all the Jews? That makes absolutely no sense. Some of these guys earned medals fighting for Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why you even bothered to comment. Oh wait, yes I do. It was to try to merge the established fact that Hitler persecuted Jews with the myth that he intended to exterminate them all.

       .  Under the Nazis it was your jewishness that generally superceded everything else. It didn't matter what your views were or if you even practiced.   And that's the whole point. Yes some
       <em>

       who may have had some "Jewish blood" in them earned accolade digging for Nazi Germany.

       hypocrtical and narrow minded?

       They also had thousands of slavic untermensch fight for them, when it suited them (when they started running out of Germans).

       Strange though, how it "didn't matter what your views were or even if you practiced" and yet they let 100,000 Jews join the military anyway. In fact, I'd go so far as to say these two claims contradict one another.

       And of course, as many stated in the same book you drew that figure from, they did so to protect not only themselves but their families.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course that someone who had some distant claim to being related to someone who was Jewish doesn't subscribe them to some monumental, immediate identity. Many couldn't care less abot Judaism. They were Germans first and always.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, as also stated in Rigg's book, many did it to prove their Aryan blood was stronger than their Jewish blood. Those were the lucky ones of course.

       No, you're simply speaking out of your fucking arse, which I am assuming you do a lot, given the length of your reply.

       Not a "hoax", per se, but twisted to hide the true intent. They were labor camps, not death camps. Still a crime against humanity, but there's a very different narrative: People were rounded up against their will into labor camps, which worked like labor franchises for hire.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's another iteration of slavery - extracting the maximum labor out of the public at the minimum cost. The first third of this excellent documentary explains this very well:

      <p>
       The US prison industry is the modern version of this. Put you in prison for possessing or selling the wrong plant, then pimp you out to corporations at a cost of pennies per hour. Stack em 5 to a cell, feed em the cheapest food available. Very efficient.

       not right or wrong but I will give a different view maybe?
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of new Arab and African nations were developing a Fascist system which scared the British powers at the time. So there was a push for a Jewish Nation to keep a regional allied power in the middle east. To do this, you have to highlight the cruelty of mankind which was pretty easy given the German treatment of the Jewish people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say this because there isn't a Gypsy nation, or a Gay nation or a Free-mason nation even though they got the gas shower too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at groups that everyone knows about and still no nation: Kurds, Hmong?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at genocides that don't get  get much mention: Armenian, Pl Pots various?
      </p>
      <p>
       out of almost nowhere, a nation can form in an already populated area but we cant stop slaughters like in Rwanda. How shitty does that make us look to the survivors of these atrocities?
      </p>
      <p>
       So I believe the holocaust happened and it was a bad thing but I think it is a marketing scheme now for someone else's agenda and has nothing to do with helping Jewish people. Otherwise we would have just given them central New Jersey and cut down on the bloodshed.

       Interesting. Thanks for your insights, and I agree- the holocaust is highlighted whilst other ones are overlooked for political (rather than unbiased, historical) reasons.
      </p>

       So, can I ask- what if the gas chambers weren't real? What if there were no death showers?

       We are always finding some cost effective way to kill people we don't like. I think they put in the showers because a couple of guys with a machete is not efficient and when you just try to starve people, real estate cost is major overhead. There is also the problem with vectors of disease and the like. If you want to kill a lot of people ad have the initial resources to get it set up, assembly line murder is the way to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are implying that the Holocaust was some sort of sandy hook, moon landing staged event....that doesn't change my opinion of anything at all. For me, it isn't a political group killing a religion or a race killing another race. It is people killing people. If I went to kill your spouse, it doesn't matter that your spouse was a certain color or prayed to some Norse god. What matters is that your spouse is gone and now you suffer that loss. That is the great tragedy. But I am a libertarian so I'm against forming any sort of government most of the time. I think governments are just a racket to keep a couple from feeding their children.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no showers, still the same overall philosophy.

       Right, you think that the reason they put them in the showers is "x." But the presupposition is that there
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       showers in the first place. You're trying to determine their motive. What I am suggesting is, there was no motive for the showers because the showers
       <em>
        weren't real
       </em>
       . And that's why I suggest you do some independent digging. The logistics of the "gas shower" narrative makes it seem to me to be fraudulent. Kind of like how the logistics of the official 9/11 narrative don't add up.

      <p>
       I'm not suggesting it's the same in that I'm not suggesting it was a staged event. I'm suggesting it never happened, that's totally different. It's like... the difference between putting on a play and telling a lie. Sandy Hook was a skit that was actually acted out vs the Holocaust was just a story that was made up. However, they'd both share the similarity of being falsified narratives used as political propaganda.

       True, if you killed my spouse, it doesn't matter to me
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       you did it so much as the fact that you did it. But it makes a very big difference to me whether you killed my spouse or my spouse died due to entirely different causes (i.e. you were falsely accuse, or it was manslaughter vs murder, etc.)

       Only if they were murdered. But what if they weren't murdered?
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear, I'm not suggesting that none of them were murdered. They definitely were. But I'm suggesting the systematic mass murder didn't occur. The showers didn't occur. The pits with emaciated bodies? Were they people who starved to death? Or did they die of a disease? That makes a

       </strong>
       difference.

       I didn't respond to that the first time because it's not relevant to what I was asking. I'm asking about the validity of a historical event, not the validity of the nation-state. No offense. You don't have to believe in the Jewish people but that doesn't affect whether or not the Holocaust happened.

       ok, then I guess....so what? History is written by the victor and all that jazz. We live in a world of myths. I can't tell you that WWII happened because I wasn't there. I've met people that claimed to be there. I have seen the sites like Suicide and Bonsai Cliffs in Saipan and where they hid Jews at the Vatican. But I wasn't there and like bigfoot plaster of paris casts, I have to entertain the notion that it might be one big hoax. But I choose to live in that myth. I like to think that Andrew Jackson was a badass and that Lenin was true to his ideals living a simple life as head of state. So the detail of  a couple million people people living or dying being misrepresented in history is to be accepted.

       Depends on how you look at it. A lot of civilians in German occupied areas starved to death because the the allies chose to include civilian infrastructure in the war; some of those people were trapped in concentration camps. Is that really much different than what the allied propaganda says the Germans did to them?

       That's why we have science. Dachau had a similar death rate to concentration camps that existed during the US civil war. Also PS. there is eyewitness testimony for the Dachau gas chambers, yet now mainstream scholars agree there were no gas chambers at Dachau.

       They're not really jewish then perhaps israeli or hebrew, rather they are considered "anti-semetic", because "the promised land" aka zionism is a central tenant of judiasm, and a 'jewish state' isn't possible with full Palestinian rights.

       I have a question:
Did you ever ask yourself that maybe denial of the holocaust is illegal in many countries, not because it never happened and the shadow masters want to trick us, but rather because many societies have come to the conclusion that any exculpation or romanticization of National Socialism and its gastly legacy are a danger to the very existence of said societies?

       Did you ever ask yourself if it's possible to not romanticize national socialism but also not believe everything you hear about them? I saw a documentary once about Nazis where they kidnapped  an archaeologist and

       Your analogy is really lacking.
You're comparing disbelieve in something that is admittedly fiction (a movie) to disbelieve in something that is regarded as proven fact by not only the vast majority of society, but also almost every historian and scholar in the world.
While the Holocaust isn't
       <strong>
        everything
       </strong>
       , denying that the Nazis were genocidal is not a minute detail, but rather a giant chunk of what is bad about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I, for example, were to deny the existence of the Gulags and claim that the phase of the Stalinist terror is all a giant lie, concucted by anti-Stalinist "reactionaries", would you then defend me from all accusations that I am being lenient and somewhat sympathetic towards totalitarian Stalinism?

       Your imagination is perhaps lacking. My point is, I can believe that someone, someones, or somethings are terrible without believing
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       about them. I can believe that Ted Bundy was a monstrous necro-rapist-serial killer without believing that he killed JFK. The fact that he didn't kill JFK doesn't make him a goodperson. It just means he didn't happen to do
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       particular crime.

       So what? That doesn't change the fact that the holocaust did or didn't happen. If it didn't happen, that doesn't mean I'm a Nazi sympathizer. Guess what? Turns out that Sadaam didn't do 9/11. Doesn't mean that I view Sadaam as a good guy.

       I beg to differ. 
One can't deny the arguably biggest, most heinous and most important crimes of an ideology/country/system and at the same time claim that one isn't white-washing or exculpating said ideology. To do one is to do the other, because that's the very definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who says that the Rwandan genocide is a big lie, most likely made up by Tutsies is automatically exculpating the Hutu regime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who says that there were no Gulags, that the Red Terror never happened and that the NKVD murders are false propaganda is automatically white-washing Stalinism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who says that there was no attempt at a "Endlösung" (final solution), that there were no death camps and no gas chambers is automatically white-washing and exculpating the Third Reich and the hideous ideologies that underpinned it.

       it was officially three million Jews according to historians and experts in the UK in 1980, magically during the 1980s due to Spielberg &amp;co, six million Jews is now the official number, in the US at least.

       Interesting. Thanks for your insights, and I agree- the holocaust is highlighted whilst other ones are overlooked for political (rather than unbiased, historical) reasons.

       No proof, as in the hundred of pictures of theses camps taken upon discovery? The people who survived emaciated and devastated, a look in their eyes that couldn't possibly mirror some several countries wide conspiracy to just make up some stuff and get a German war-monger in a little trouble? Sure, maybe you can't make an exact number of the deaths, but you at least know it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno, I'm pretty sure you can't fake that. There have even been pictures of the interior walls of the gas chambers covered in claw marks from people trying to escape or otherwise panicking as they lived their last moments.
      </p>
      <p>
       To create a conspiracy on that scale would simply be nearly impossible, much less managing to maintain the veil of secrecy for years afterwards.
