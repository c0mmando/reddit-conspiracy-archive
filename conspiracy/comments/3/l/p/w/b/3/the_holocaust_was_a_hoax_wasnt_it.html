The people who survived emaciated and devastated, a look in their eyes that couldn&#39;t possibly mirror some several countries wide conspiracy to just make up some stuff and get a German war-monger in a little trouble? Sure, maybe you can&#39;t make an exact number of the deaths, but you at least know it happened.</p>

<p>I dunno, I&#39;m pretty sure you can&#39;t fake that. There have even been pictures of the interior walls of the gas chambers covered in claw marks from people trying to escape or otherwise panicking as they lived their last moments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. You are correct. This was the toughest one for me to swallow by far IMO and actually almost made me go a little insane. However you are right, in the sense that this poster outlined:</p>

<p>&quot;There is no proof whatsoever of three main claims regarding the Holocaust---that (a) six million jews were killed, (b) many in gas chambers, (c) due to an order by Hitler.&quot;</p>

<p>Bingo. This is totally true. 100%. Even Ellie Wisel says the 11 million number is fake, but this will basically get you crucified out in the streets. </p>

<p>Like I said this is a big pill to swallow so don&#39;t rush it. You will come out the otherside better than before. Stay safe brother and godspeed.</p>

<p>Just remember, this is the lynchpin of modern society, so fight your urge to tell the others. They won&#39;t understand and this WILL get you dismissed as insane. Just a warning from someone a little further down the road.</p>

<p>Thanks for the warning. I understand the societal consequences. I was raised Mormon and tried to share the truth when I was a kid haha...</p>

<p>Plato&#39;s Cave has more significance than any other parable I&#39;ve ever heard, because ultimately people really <em>would</em> prefer to kill you for sharing the truth than allow you to save them from the lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Word. I mean honestly just since you posted this here and I guess are looking for some perspective...</p>

<p>The Holocaust is easily the defining event bar none of our society. Hitler is our devil and the Nuremberg trials were where modern man made the devil real. That is essentially what defines modern times. For example, someone I know studies theology, and they now define modern theology as post-holocaust theology. Go up to someone in the street and say, there&#39;s never been an evil man alive, everyone is good.</p>

<p>What will they say? &quot;Well what about Hitler?&quot;. In this way, you are checking into literally THE DEFINING MYTHOLOGY OF MODERN MAN, the Holocaust. That is why I said take it slow, it is literally a whole nother world once you see that the biggest dragons of modern times do not actually exist.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, the Nazis did some bad stuff, but it&#39;s nowhere near the putting cigarettes out in babies eyes image that the media portrays.</p>

<p>Yet we live in the shadows of the Nazis, in the shadow of this myth. I could go on forever about this so feel free to hit me up if you want to talk, but I&#39;ll just say that this myth of complete evil manifest that is the Nazi  myth defines modern man and society, and we live under it&#39;s tyranny MORE than any society you could ever imagine being oppressed by any ideology. Catholicism, fundamentaist Islam, ANY IDEOLOGY YOU COULD THINK OF will never hold a candle to the level of slavery that exists between us and the myth of the Holocaust.</p>

<p>Just saying. Fun to connect to a fellow truth seeker. It&#39;s a strange ride but it&#39;s the only game in town, most nights I enjoy it - just for the record.</p>

<p>It&#39;s true though. The only boogie man to rival Hitler is Satan himself. And I learned a long time ago that boogie men aren&#39;t real. I just had never applied that to Hitler. I think that&#39;s why I&#39;m honestly not <em>that</em> surprised to learn what I&#39;m learning... although it obviously does shake my paradigm to the core. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hitler killed a lot of people, there&#39;s no question about that. But whether he killed them specifically because they were Jewish is something there really isn&#39;t any hard evidence to support. He had over 100,000 partial Jews fighting for him in the German army so his policy on Jews can&#39;t have been that bad. Communism, on the other hand, is something he openly called for the extermination of. When the Reichstag was burned down, for example, it was Communists he blamed.</p>

<p>I have no particular expertise in that part of history, but if I had to make an educated guess I&#39;d say there was a real genocide which was then exploited by Zionist Jews looking for more power.</p>

<p>This here:-</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the fact that it&#39;s illegal to deny the holocaust in some countries?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is reason alone to question the story in the history books. If it really happened the way they say, then why is fascism still legal, but questioning the Holocaust illegal? What? You can do it again, but you can&#39;t deny it happened the first time?</p>

<p>I see you have spectacularly ignored the point.  Why would Jews want to fight for Hitler if Hitler was exterminating all the Jews? That makes absolutely no sense. Some of these guys earned medals fighting for Germany.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re surprised that a hypocritical, narrow minded regime was..<em>gasp</em> hypocrtical and narrow minded?</p>

<p>They also had thousands of slavic untermensch fight for them, when it suited them (when they started running out of Germans).</p>

<p>Allowing someone to die in your army isn&#39;t the same as affording them basic civil rights and freedoms.</p>

<p>Just what the fuck. You&#39;re saying that 100,000 Jews decided to fight for Hitler&#39;s plan to kill all the Jews, because they were German Jews?</p>

<p>That&#39;s... Difficult to believe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And yet despite this, they needed a special exemption or a lot of lying to fight for Germany.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A special exemption from what exactly? Twice you&#39;ve made this deliberately vague claim, without explaining what the fuck you mean, or how it disproves that, according to the history books, over 100,000 Jews joined in the genocide against their own race. </p>

<p>Well, you seem to have pretty thorough knowledge of Hitler&#39;s philosophy. Especially for a man who has never met fucking Hitler.</p>

<p>Strange though, how it &quot;didn&#39;t matter what your views were or even if you practiced&quot; and yet they let 100,000 Jews join the military anyway. In fact, I&#39;d go so far as to say these two claims contradict one another.</p>

<p>Hang on, you&#39;re the one arguing that we shouldn&#39;t question the motive for the Holocaust, even when it emerges that Hitler had over 100,000 Jews fighting for him. Exactly how the fuck can you accuse anybody else of being &quot;narrow-minded&quot; and, for that matter, &quot;hypocritical&quot;?</p>

<p>Yes, around 100,000 people, probably more fought for Nazi Germany, who had at least some jewish blood. Most had little to no interest in Judaism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A special exemption from what exactly?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A special exemption to serving in the military, as non aryans were banned from doing so as of 1935.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Twice you&#39;ve made this deliberately vague claim, without explaining what the fuck you mean,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you actually <em>read</em> Bryan Rigg&#39;s book or are you just regurgitated stormfront talking points? Because Nazi racial laws are a major focus in his, and numerous other works on people with jewish blood fighting for Nazi Germany. Of course, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re well aware of the various distinctions about what amount of jewish blood was acceptable for a  German?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>over 100,000 Jews joined in the genocide against their own race.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And of course, as many stated in the same book you drew that figure from, they did so to protect not only themselves but their families.</p>

<p>And of course that someone who had some distant claim to being related to someone who was Jewish doesn&#39;t subscribe them to some monumental, immediate identity. Many couldn&#39;t care less abot Judaism. They were Germans first and always.</p>

<p>Or, as also stated in Rigg&#39;s book, many did it to prove their Aryan blood was stronger than their Jewish blood. Those were the lucky ones of course.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, you seem to have pretty thorough knowledge of Hitler&#39;s philosophy. Especially for a man who has never met fucking Hitler.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, unlike you, I&#39;ve actually read the book(s) in question.  Here&#39;s an interesting article about Crimean Jews being allowed to continue practicing their religion</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4467254?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">http://www.jstor.org/stable/4467254?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents</a></p>

<p>In fact, a number were given the okay to do so directly by Himmler when the served in an SS unit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hang on, you&#39;re the one arguing that we shouldn&#39;t question the motive for the Holocaust,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>huh?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>even when it emerges that Hitler had over 100,000 Jews fighting for him</p>

<p>How is a self-serving, hyptocritcal fool doing something self-serving, hypocritical and foolish surprising?</p>

<p>Go away please. It is lies like this which really fucking irritate me. How could you possibly be aware of the private thoughts of 100,000 different Jews who lived 75 years ago in a different country? Are you saying you time-travelled and mentally tapped into to their most private thoughts about Judaism?</p>

<p>No, you&#39;re simply speaking out of your fucking arse, which I am assuming you do a lot, given the length of your reply.</p>

Still a crime against humanity, but there&#39;s a very different narrative: People were rounded up against their will into labor camps, which worked like labor franchises for hire.</p>

<p>It&#39;s another iteration of slavery - extracting the maximum labor out of the public at the minimum cost. The first third of this excellent documentary explains this very well:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Qt6a-vaNM">JFK to 911 Everything Is A Rich Man&#39;s Trick</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The US prison industry is the modern version of this. Put you in prison for possessing or selling the wrong plant, then pimp you out to corporations at a cost of pennies per hour. Stack em 5 to a cell, feed em the cheapest food available. Very efficient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not right or wrong but I will give a different view maybe?</p>

<p>A lot of new Arab and African nations were developing a Fascist system which scared the British powers at the time. So there was a push for a Jewish Nation to keep a regional allied power in the middle east. To do this, you have to highlight the cruelty of mankind which was pretty easy given the German treatment of the Jewish people. </p>

<p>I say this because there isn&#39;t a Gypsy nation, or a Gay nation or a Free-mason nation even though they got the gas shower too. </p>

<p>Look at groups that everyone knows about and still no nation: Kurds, Hmong? </p>

<p>Look at genocides that don&#39;t get  get much mention: Armenian, Pl Pots various?</p>

<p>out of almost nowhere, a nation can form in an already populated area but we cant stop slaughters like in Rwanda. How shitty does that make us look to the survivors of these atrocities?</p>

<p>So I believe the holocaust happened and it was a bad thing but I think it is a marketing scheme now for someone else&#39;s agenda and has nothing to do with helping Jewish people. Otherwise we would have just given them central New Jersey and cut down on the bloodshed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are always finding some cost effective way to kill people we don&#39;t like. I think they put in the showers because a couple of guys with a machete is not efficient and when you just try to starve people, real estate cost is major overhead.

<p>If you are implying that the Holocaust was some sort of sandy hook, moon landing staged event....that doesn&#39;t change my opinion of anything at all. For me, it isn&#39;t a political group killing a religion or a race killing another race. It is people killing people. If I went to kill your spouse, it doesn&#39;t matter that your spouse was a certain color or prayed to some Norse god. What matters is that your spouse is gone and now you suffer that loss. That is the great tragedy. But I am a libertarian so I&#39;m against forming any sort of government most of the time. I think governments are just a racket to keep a couple from feeding their children. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Right, you think that the reason they put them in the showers is &quot;x.&quot; But the presupposition is that there <em>were</em> showers in the first place. You&#39;re trying to determine their motive. What I am suggesting is, there was no motive for the showers because the showers <em>weren&#39;t real</em>. And that&#39;s why I suggest you do some independent digging. The logistics of the &quot;gas shower&quot; narrative makes it seem to me to be fraudulent. Kind of like how the logistics of the official 9/11 narrative don&#39;t add up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are implying that the Holocaust was some sort of sandy hook, moon landing staged event.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting it&#39;s the same in that I&#39;m not suggesting it was a staged event. I&#39;m suggesting it never happened, that&#39;s totally different. It&#39;s like... the difference between putting on a play and telling a lie. Sandy Hook was a skit that was actually acted out vs the Holocaust was just a story that was made up. However, they&#39;d both share the similarity of being falsified narratives used as political propaganda.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>True, if you killed my spouse, it doesn&#39;t matter to me <em>why</em> you did it so much as the fact that you did it. But it makes a very big difference to me whether you killed my spouse or my spouse died due to entirely different causes (i.e. you were falsely accuse, or it was manslaughter vs murder, etc.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So no showers, still the same overall philosophy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only if they were murdered. But what if they weren&#39;t murdered?</p>

<p>To be clear, I&#39;m not suggesting that none of them were murdered. They definitely were. But I&#39;m suggesting the systematic mass murder didn&#39;t occur. The showers didn&#39;t occur. The pits with emaciated bodies? Were they people who starved to death? Or did they die of a disease? That makes a <strong>huge</strong> difference.</p>

<p>Were the showers used to kill people en masse? Or were they actually de-lousing showers? That makes a <strong>huge</strong> difference.</p>

<p>You see what I&#39;m saying?</p>

I can&#39;t tell you that WWII happened because I wasn&#39;t there. I&#39;ve met people that claimed to be there. I have seen the sites like Suicide and Bonsai Cliffs in Saipan and where they hid Jews at the Vatican. But I wasn&#39;t there and like bigfoot plaster of paris casts, I have to entertain the notion that it might be one big hoax. But I choose to live in that myth.

Did you ever ask yourself that maybe denial of the holocaust is illegal in many countries, not because it never happened and the shadow masters want to trick us, but rather because many societies have come to the conclusion that any exculpation or romanticization of National Socialism and its gastly legacy are a danger to the very existence of said societies?</p>

<p>Did you ever ask yourself if it&#39;s possible to not romanticize national socialism but also not believe everything you hear about them? I saw a documentary once about Nazis where they kidnapped  an archaeologist and <a href="http://cdn.bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/8632915_4-620x400.jpg">tried to use the ten commandments</a> to gain the power of God, but I didn&#39;t believe that.

    <div class="md"><p>Your analogy is really lacking.
You&#39;re comparing disbelieve in something that is admittedly fiction (a movie) to disbelieve in something that is regarded as proven fact by not only the vast majority of society, but also almost every historian and scholar in the world.
While the Holocaust isn&#39;t <strong>everything</strong>, denying that the Nazis were genocidal is not a minute detail, but rather a giant chunk of what is bad about them. </p>

<p>If I, for example, were to deny the existence of the Gulags and claim that the phase of the Stalinist terror is all a giant lie, concucted by anti-Stalinist &quot;reactionaries&quot;, would you then defend me from all accusations that I am being lenient and somewhat sympathetic towards totalitarian Stalinism?</p>

<p>Your imagination is perhaps lacking. My point is, I can believe that someone, someones, or somethings are terrible without believing <em>everything</em> about them. I can believe that Ted Bundy was a monstrous necro-rapist-serial killer without believing that he killed JFK. The fact that he didn&#39;t kill JFK doesn&#39;t make him a goodperson. It just means he didn&#39;t happen to do <em>that</em> particular crime.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So what? That doesn&#39;t change the fact that the holocaust did or didn&#39;t happen. If it didn&#39;t happen, that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m a Nazi sympathizer. Guess what? Turns out that Sadaam didn&#39;t do 9/11. Doesn&#39;t mean that I view Sadaam as a good guy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I beg to differ. 
One can&#39;t deny the arguably biggest, most heinous and most important crimes of an ideology/country/system and at the same time claim that one isn&#39;t white-washing or exculpating said ideology. To do one is to do the other, because that&#39;s the very definition.</p>

<p>Anyone who says that the Rwandan genocide is a big lie, most likely made up by Tutsies is automatically exculpating the Hutu regime.</p>

<p>Anyone who says that there were no Gulags, that the Red Terror never happened and that the NKVD murders are false propaganda is automatically white-washing Stalinism.</p>

<p>Anyone who says that there was no attempt at a &quot;Endlösung&quot; (final solution), that there were no death camps and no gas chambers is automatically white-washing and exculpating the Third Reich and the hideous ideologies that underpinned it. </p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>One guy who had never operated GPR or knew how to look at its results found this. When people who knew how to read GPR results looked at it they found  both evidence of human remains and large deposits of ash.</p>

<p>It hasn&#39;t even been proven by a shadow of a doubt.</p>

<p>Perhaps a few pieces of circumstantial evidence don&#39;t result in (dis)proving something beyond a doubt. That&#39;s not what those words mean.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &quot;six million&quot; number existed even before WWI.</p>

<p>Well yes, so did the number four. And the number five million. And the number three hudred and ten thousand. So did the numer nine.</p>

<p>Which happened after WW2 began.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Holdolomor&quot;--the killing of tens of millions of Ukranians (primarily) by Jews in Russia?</p>

<p>We hear about both Bromberg and Holodomor just about any time Nazis are brought up and some kneejerk nazi apologists are looking for false equivalencies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. Thanks for your insights, and I agree- the holocaust is highlighted whilst other ones are overlooked for political (rather than unbiased, historical) reasons. </p>

<p>So, can I ask- what if the gas chambers weren&#39;t real? What if there were no death showers? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No proof, as in the hundred of pictures of theses camps taken upon discovery? The people who survived emaciated and devastated, a look in their eyes that couldn&#39;t possibly mirror some several countries wide conspiracy to just make up some stuff and get a German war-monger in a little trouble? Sure, maybe you can&#39;t make an exact number of the deaths, but you at least know it happened.</p>

<p>I dunno, I&#39;m pretty sure you can&#39;t fake that. There have even been pictures of the interior walls of the gas chambers covered in claw marks from people trying to escape or otherwise panicking as they lived their last moments.</p>

<p>To create a conspiracy on that scale would simply be nearly impossible, much less managing to maintain the veil of secrecy for years afterwards.</p>
