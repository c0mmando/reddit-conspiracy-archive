    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my theory on the moon landing.  I believe the official story is a mix of both fact and fiction.  To ensure American supremacy and limit the possibility of leaking Classified information, it&#39;s reasonable to assert that TPTB might have filmed a fake moon landing as a backup/insurance package.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Izq_3hbRE-o">This vid sums up Stanley Kubrick&#39;s possible involvement in a digestible, humorous fashion</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s my opinion that we did land on the moon, and that some of the original (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/20/us-nasa-tapes-idUSTRE56F5MK20090720">now deleted</a>) footage of the moon landing was real.  That being said, I also believe fake footage/photos were inserted into the narrative.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlkV1ybBnHI">I believe the astronauts of Apollo 11 encountered highly sensitive National Security related issues</a>, and that this blending of fact and fiction was planned (in advance) to conceal those issues from leaking to the public.</p>

<p>Remember this is 1969 we&#39;re talking about.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BqLB72wtgc">Foo Fighters</a>, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe0_wbVYIQ0">Battle of Los Angeles</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WugJoLib5k">Roswell</a> were considered old-hat.  It seems reasonable to suggest TPTB were aware of possible encounters, and planned accordingly. </p>

<p>Today the hard part is getting past the dumbed down people who don&#39;t understand that all we really did was crossed all the T&#39;s and dotted all the I&#39;s and got it right the first time, with an unlimited budget the best educated collection of professionals the world has ever seen.  Then the powers that be decided to change the US from the #1 educated country in the world to #23, that&#39;s where we are today. It makes sense that the young people today don&#39;t understand how things get done when they are not taught how to do them.  The US has had it&#39;s day as #1  for over 100 years, those days won&#39;t be back for a long time, if ever. </p>

I think we went to the moon but the footage they showed was fake as shit. A lot of the tech they used to get there is still unavailable to the public and they want to keep it that way. It&#39;s not that we couldn&#39;t go to the moon it&#39;s more that the way they said we did it is bullshit.

    <div class="md"><p>Two things you can research.
1) The Lunar laser ranging retroreflector array. This is to accurately measure the distance to the moon. 2) They took samples of moon rocks with them back to earth. There will be evidence of this. Either it&#39;s sitting in a museum somewhere and / or there will be peer reviewed scientific journals with detailed compositional analysis of each rock. If you&#39;re still not convinced, find a peer review from a country like Russia with whom they were competing with at the time. The Russians wouldn&#39;t have no issues calling bullshit if it was fake. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.</p>

<p>Argument:  Most people think that landing a small ship on the moon was a hard thing to do.  Not at all true.  The hard part was the 7 or more years of engineering and manufacture of the launch vehicle, the small ship that took the landing craft and rover to the moon.  They had to get it all right the first time.  The second hardest part was the successful launch of the moon rocket that was eye witnessed by over 300,000 people who stood on the beach and saw the moon rocket leave the Cape, without blowing up.  Pointing the small ship at the moon and waiting a couple days to get there was not hard at all.  The landing on the moon had extra good shock absorbers to help.  The scary hard part was when the Eagle left the moon to rendezvous with the space craft to take them home.  If the Eagle failed to dock with that ship it would probably have crashed back into the moon and would still be there. </p>

<p>ALL the video that has been called into question could have been edited far more easily than the moon rocket launch being faked.  Touching down was too easy.  Getting back was harder than touching down.</p>

<p>Yes, we went there and people who want to bring ruin to a great achievement hope to change our minds.  </p>

<p>No one has tried to prove the launch was a fake.  That was the hardest, and most expensive, part of the whole trip.     </p>
