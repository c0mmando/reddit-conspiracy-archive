       This is an easy grenade of common sense that can be tossed into conversations about the economy. Take the topic in a new direction.

       Legalizing drugs at large might.
      </p>
      <p>
       So first of all, no more enforcement on drugs. Saves us a few billion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police are free to concentrate on real crimes and the jails are less clogged with drug war cannon fodder.
      </p>
      <p>
       You offer amnesty to non-violent cartel members to produce, ship, market, and distribute the now legal drugs. Thus increasing employment and tax revenue.
      </p>
      <p>
       You sell the drugs to users 21+ and they pay a tax.
      </p>
      <p>
       To boot, we no longer have nearly the insane level of laws and searches thus saving tax payers billions more over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
       The drug war really ties into so many parts of our society in ways we cannot understand. Imagine if our vices became our societal income.
      </p>
      <p>
       Legalizing (instead of decrim) makes the cartels turn to dust and downsize.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the cartels are gone, border tensions can calm down a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tax money on Cocaine alone would fund rehab and education and help pay for other public projects.

       And it's always sad to hear things like "pharms will never let it happen". It really shows how impotent we all feel in this scam of a society. It's a plant. A gift to us from nature. And we have been brainwashed into fearing it.

       Youre completely right, pharm companies have tried to make thc pills or what not but havnt been able to replicate it. They are so against it because you can grow it yourself and can exclude them as the middleman. Our country is so fucked its not even funny anymore

       It's a plant. You can grow it in your yard and process it into medicine yourself. The sheer simplicity of this I hope would be enough to prevent a GMO power play from being effective.

       While I'm for legalization, nothing will save the economy until we are off a complete fiat monetary system. The debt is needed to keep the currency's worth. The more debt, the more our currency is worth. When you hear pundits and politicians talking about reigning in the debt, they are either lying or ignorant of how our fiat currency works.  Get back on a gold/silver standard and this could help, until then, there is no saving our economy. It will balloon out of control, until it pops.

       I don't really understand how this would work.. for it to save the economy people would need to spend money on marijuana.. but people have to have enough money to be able to afford it in the first place.. so in essence you are trying to claim that the economy would be saved simply by getting people to spend money.. but they need to have money in the first place.. the economy won't be saved this way..

       Yes, but there has to be money available to spend on it in the first place, in order for that money to then be taxed.. as though people are just sitting on cash waiting for weed to be legalised so the economy can be saved.  There's got to be more to it than that.

       By legalizing it everywhere you would reduce far too many inmates sentences and our for profit prison system would lose half of its "made in USA" slaves -- I mean, workers.

       It is foolish for you to want one new source of revenue to eradicate all of the debt at once.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am absolutely opposed to taxes but I realize their current necessity. That being said, the legalization and taxation of a multi use crop could significantly reduce the burden of our national debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       If legalization happens it wouldn't just open the doors for stoners it would open new research and development of the versatile plant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Textiles, pharmaceuticals, plastics, etc would all benefit from the common knowledge benefits of this single plant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your argument that it won't be the magic bullet of total debt reduction is ridiculous and shows your lack of knowledge on the subject.

       What attack? The dismissal of your fallacious logic isn't an attack it's called debate. Do you profit from drug prohibition? If not, it costs you.

       Your points are valid, but short sighted:
      </p>
      <p>
       The drug war is a massive chunk of our spending that is not necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marijuana cures cancer and a myriad other ailments that are currently being "treated" with vast amounts of poisonous pharmaceuticals. Huge savings in medical spending.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hemp is a new crop with myriad uses that would stimulate small businesses and farms and completely new markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tourism dollars as a marijuana destination would bring in huge money from outside.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vast amounts of fear and anxiety would be released by marijuana users.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other thoughts to add to the list?

       Legalizing just marijuana isn't enough. The global drug trade is $84 billion annually.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your math also doesn't include saved law enforcement time and money since they don't have to focus on drugs as much.
