       I really don't know what to say. Recently I seem to make people cry or take offence just by speaking on how I see the reality that they refuse to look at.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a teacher with a 10 year career in tears earlier this week when I pointed out to them that if they need me to bolster their confidence then they are obviously not suited to teaching.
      </p>
      <p>
       My intention was to invoke a 'fuck you' gag reflex, wake them up a bit and boost their self confidence. Instead they said that I might be right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps it was the fact that I told them that if they don't have complete control over their own syllabus and that the school won't suspend trouble makers for fear of loosing tuition fees that they were just another cog in a machine with an agenda and no matter how posh it might sound, a private (US = private, UK=public) school is just about profit and status.
      </p>
      <p>
       I told them that in this day and age, as a teacher their only purpose is to create young people who are easily suggestible and who will not go against the grain when they enter into society.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was at that point that they admitted they knew that to be the case. My reply was that the difference between you and I is that upon becoming aware of such a scheme, am unable to be part of such a system whereas for commercial gain and whilst purporting to have the interests of your students at heart, you have knowingly partaken in the systematic brainwashing of young adults for 10 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       OODA loop flipped. Brain scrambled.
      </p>
      <p>
       People often say knowing the way is one thing. But living the way it is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say knowing the system to be corrupt and yet still opting to profit from it at the expense of others is not submitting to the system. It's empowering the system itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a problem solver, a go getter, a self starter, continuously self educating. Regularly approached by energy vampires attempting to rope me into helping them get something done or people in trouble that say they want advice when in reality they want to dump negative energy my way whilst getting a confirmation that what they are doing or about to do is the correct choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The look on their faces when I hit them with a koan of truth.
Oh crap. Wrong question wrong person. Or I just wanted you to say I was doing ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        It seems many people have no foundation, no core beliefs. That they need to be hooked up to an external energy or self confirmation source (the TV?) in order to function without having mini breakdowns.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I read that Nelson Mandela once said that illusion is of great comfort to he who might be imprisoned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I now get why so many people I respect are essentially hermits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for your time. This isn't a rant. It's a vent.
Perhaps some of you can relate.

       In this world you have to be part of the system.  The system is connected and we're all a part of it.  That's just the way it is.  We all must work within the system in order to fix the system, because like it or not, we are the system.

       You sound like a twat.  You might want to consider whether you have a personality disorder.  Whilst I appreciate that in your mind a teacher is there soley for your development, for some people it's just a job.  The hours and holidays suit them and their own children's needs.  Personally there are wankers in every workplace, it just so happens that you are the one in theirs.

       You and you alone truly understand what is going on. You carry with you The Truth and all people around you are simply cattle, "sheeple" that you are burdened to enlighten. I do not envy your position, it is a monumental task ahead of you. Being The One is a task that only you are intelligent enough to manage.

       Until an ounce of humility is added to the discourse, no one will listen to what you say. Do you listen to preachers on television? Neither do I. What makes you think preaching is effective? You say "I" and "me" constantly. When do you say "us"? Until this fundamental issue shifts and people stop seeming so fucking arrogant, no one will truly listen to what we say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, that's my opinion and I guarantee it will cause discomfort.

       This should be a trap in Saw, there's so much edge. Seriously though, you'll outgrow all that Fuck the System shit like everyone else. Sure, we're all cogs in the machine, but the machine is civilized society and we all need it. Is it perfect? No. It's not even good most of the time. The alternative is fucking worldwide Somalia, though, and mad max isn't as cool when you're living it.

       Public education has had nothing to do with teaching our children for a very long time. Today education is about training children and young people into subservience. To create good little obedient workers. 
The main part of this training is to quash any sense of individual thought or critical thinking skill. School does not teach kids how to think, it teaches them how not to.
We are born with an innate sense of curiosity and creativity. if this were allowed to flourish as it should we would see wonderful things in our world.
As it stands, we end up with zombied robot workers, who allow themselves to be controlled with little to no resistance.
It's generation after generation of pee-on soldiers who follow the crowd and never question their place and purpose in life.

       Kids don't do much individual thought or critical thinking. They more like to goof off or jump around the classroom or generally act the fool. Teachers spend a lot of time and effort trying to control the classroom so that a little learning can take place.

       The key word is "control". The kids must be controlled. the kids must be obedient.  Maybe the kids jump around because they feel like they are in cage?
Why must the kids follow orders? why must the kids be institutionalized?

       Here is the thing: most teachers are trying, in their own way, to do some good for their students. It does not always work and some teachers are just incompetent like any other job. But most try to do the best they can in the situation they find themselves in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Teachers are human too. They need a job, an income, etc. They have families to raise and bills to pay. There are a few things that they can change because they control, and lots of things that they cannot change because they do not control them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people just struggle along, trying to muddle forward a bit if they can.

       I think that is the main thing. I believe A Brave New World is more like what we are experiencing now, rather than 1984 (Maybe a love child between the two?). Our society is littered with distractions to keep people from actually realizing how bad things really are and how unhappy we all really are. Some people will never wake up, some will wake up then hit the snooze, then there are people who stay awake because they've had enough sleep.

       You have no idea how much this resonates with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the worst when it is someone in your family, and they behave as if your truth is a weapon against them when you're only trying to help them. Then their argument to completely ignore or disagree with you is "everyone else says or does this".

       It's all about your approach.  If you really try and approach with love,  I've found it to be much more successful.  Also it's imperative not to make people so uncomfortable that they just completely shut down.  The more you can relate to the person and their own lives,  the better you'll be. Smile,  be happy,  make others believe that you're happier and more free in your own life (and if you're not free and happy,  find it!) after you've come to believe the things you do, and they too can experience that same freedom and happiness.  If they see an angry, bitter person, it's an immediate turn off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if you notice any discomfort,  stop right there.  Go back to selling your self.  These are the things which help me.

       I always approach it with love. I wouldn't waste the energy if there wasn't any love.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, say that you have done a lot of research on the medical/pharma industry and you have witnessed what the cancer industry and their treatments are all about. What if one of your family members went through those treatments in a span of 1 year, and they went from having absolutely no symptoms of disease, other than a small lump, to all sorts of health issues?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if they want to continue following their treatments, despite all the failure that has occurred so far? What if they can't even face the truth about what has even happened to them? The infection that occurred after the biopsy, which now allowed the tumor to fungate outside of the incision site. The anemia, neuropathy, and pain from the chemotherapy. What if they want to do surgery now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you just give up trying to teach and show them more information?
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand what you're saying, but not all matters of truth are so easily handled or in the same way.

       I feel you.  I really do.  I had a very similar experience.  My mother was diagnosed with lung cancer just over a year and half ago.  She's 72 years old.  She was fully ready to go through chemo and radiation, because the doctors told her that's what she needed to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried,  and tried to talk her out of going through all of that,  because I had researched how negatively her quality of life would be afterwards.  It was only after her first chemo treatment when she would finally listen to me.  She subsequently refused all further chemo and radiation treatments,  and insisted that they surgically remove the tumor from her lung.
      </p>
      <p>
       The doctors finally ended up conceding to her,  and scheduled a surgery.  She is still cancer free,  almost a year and half later!  PTL!
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is,  don't give up,  don't ever give up,  they'll come around when they are ready.  Just plant seeds,  that's all you can do.

      <p>
       Yea, I won't. It's just not easy dealing with. I wish i could just smile and believe that these treatments are doing good, but this entire situation has been a nonsensical nightmare and I haven't seen a single good thing come out of it for her.

       I really do empathize with you,  and with what your going through.  A smile will go such a long way at the end of the day for the person battling.  Transcend that frustration. Ultimately, whether you can convince them before it's too late or not,  that decision is entirely up to them,  not you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it's difficult. I really hope that everything will work out for you.

        It seems many people have no foundation, no core beliefs. That they need to be hooked up to an external energy or self confirmation source (the TV?) in order to function without having mini breakdowns.

       So your mind-bending truth is that individual teachers don't control the syllabus?  It appears that you are discussing high school, where curriculum is debated and adopted by state boards of education and implemented by school districts.  This is not a secret.  To the extent that you are revisiting the incredibly well-plowed ground of the argument over skills training vs. critical thinking as the goal of public education, you could consider reading one of the kajilliôn books written on both sides of the discussion, instead of being narcissistic about your oh so advanced understanding of how the world works.

       This recently happened to me when I questioned the official numbers of the Holocaust. People got severely severely butt hurt. They actually had to leave the room. This was actually a guy that taught for 30 years. I said if the holocaust is a pure truth - why is it illegal to talk about it in so many "educated" countries.

       three million was the official number in the UK thirty or so years ago, NOW the official number is six million (US).

      <p>
       the numbers are adjusted to fit the age old Jewish persecution meme.

       I feel you.  I really do.  I had a very similar experience.  My mother was diagnosed with lung cancer just over a year and half ago.  She's 72 years old.  She was fully ready to go through chemo and radiation, because the doctors told her that's what she needed to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried,  and tried to talk her out of going through all of that,  because I had researched how negatively her quality of life would be afterwards.  It was only after her first chemo treatment when she would finally listen to me.  She subsequently refused all further chemo and radiation treatments,  and insisted that they surgically remove the tumor from her lung.
      </p>
      <p>
       The doctors finally ended up conceding to her,  and scheduled a surgery.  She is still cancer free,  almost a year and half later!  PTL!
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is,  don't give up,  don't ever give up,  they'll come around when they are ready.  Just plant seeds,  that's all you can do.
