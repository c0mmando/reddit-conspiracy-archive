       I have been following the Snowden story since the day it broke. At first I thought, like many, that he was a hero. After a while a few things just didn't add up, but this isn't what this post is about. See
       <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/my-creeping-concern-that-the-nsa-leaker-edward-snowden-is-not-who-he-purports-to-be/5339161">
        Naomi Wolfe's article
       </a>
       from 2013 to get some idea of what concerns people have had about the Snowden story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden is neither hero or traitor. If anything, he is merely a messenger, here to tell us that Big Brother is watching us. In 1984, citizens were constantly reminded that they were being watched. In that Orwellian dystopia it was just as important that people were being told constantly that they were being watched as it was that they
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       being watched.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden fulfills the role of the messenger that constantly reminds us we're being watched. He isn't a genuine whistleblower. He'd be dead by now if he were.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden has an unusual name. In my time, I had never really seen the name before, but there is an interesting literary connection: Snowden was a crucial though marginal character in Joseph Heller's Catch-22. Snowden has a secret which he reveals to Yossarian. Yossarian is attempting to treat Snowden's wound but in the process discovers a fatal wound, which leads to Snowden literally spilling his guts to the floor of the plane.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Here was God’s plenty, all right, he thought bitterly as he stared — liver, lungs, kidneys, ribs, stomach and bits of the stewed tomatoes Snowden had eaten that day for lunch. "
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       With Snowden's guts on the floor, Yossarian has a realization:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Yossarian was cold, too, and shivering uncontrollable. He felt goose pimples clacking all over him as he gazed down despondently at thegrim secret Snowden had spilled all over the messy floor. It was easy to read the message in his entrails. Man was matter, that was Snowden’s secret. Drop him out a window and he’ll fall. Set fire to him and he’ll burn. Bury him and he’ll rot, like other kinds of garbage. The spirit gone, man is garbage. That was Snowden’s secret. Ripeness was all."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       See
       <a href="http://www.deathdyinggriefandmourning.com/Death-Dying-Grief-Mourning/100-Joseph-Heller-Catch-22-Death-of-Snowden.htm">
        http://www.deathdyinggriefandmourning.com/Death-Dying-Grief-Mourning/100-Joseph-Heller-Catch-22-Death-of-Snowden.htm
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So it seems to me that the name "Snowden" was chosen and isn't the real name of the famous whistleblower. The name was meant to evoke the character from Catch-22, who is already associated with "spilling his guts" and in the process revealing a message about our humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       But why choose a character from Catch-22 at all?  I think they key to that question lies in the logic of a catch-22.
      </p>
      <p>
       From Wikipedia:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Catch-22s often result from rules, regulations, or procedures that an individual is subject to but has no control over because to fight the rule is to accept it. Another example is a situation in which someone is in need of something that can only be had by not being in need of it. One connotation of the term is that the creators of the "catch-22" have created arbitrary rules in order to justify and conceal their own abuse of power."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So are the so-called "Snowden revelations" themselves actually a catch-22? It seems clear that as a result, we are constantly aware that we are being watched, but we are powerless to do anything about it. We have no control over what is described as pervasive government surveillance and we can't even fight it. It seems that Snowden, who is rarely out of the limelight, is constantly telling us we are being watched, while also making us aware of how powerless we are against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In considering all of this, I see Snowden as possibly serving two objectives:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Making all of us aware of the omniscience of the government. The government knows and sees all and Snowden is reminding us of this just about every week.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Creating a sense of powerlessness in people. We are being watched, but can do nothing to stop it.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I realize for many here, Snowden
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a hero because he confirmed what many of us had suspected all along, but this doesn't mean we should just accept what he is at face value. The truth is, as I discovered when I read Robert McChesney's
       <a href="http://thenewpress.com/books/digital-disconnect">
        Digital Disconnect
       </a>
       , is that much of what was initially revealed by Snowden was well known. McChesney's book was written prior to Snowden's sudden appearance on the scene, and it covers a great deal of what was known about NSA surveillance. Snowden threw in some extras to keep us interested, but much of it wasn't new.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether you believe Snowden is the real deal or not, I think it's clear that he hasn't really provided us with any substantial intelligence that is truly damaging to the United States. In that respect, I don't see him as a traitor. But he isn't a hero either, just a single face we can now put to the government's message to us all: "You are being watched".

       Your post is so cool. Even if it's not true, you've touched upon an angle of this story that I had never, and likely would not have ever, considered by myself. If you're correct about the conscious decision to name the messenger Snowden, then it would be another example of the big Chiefs dangling the secret to their methods directly in the public's faces. Almost like a taunt or a challenge. It fits in with the widely accepted narrative of how they supposedly operate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I especially like your quoted reference to the character of Snowden literally "spilling his guts" to reveal a terrible secret about the vulnerability of humans. Catch 22 is one of the most well read and greatest literary achievements of our time. If this naming of Snowden is not intentional, then it's a tremendous coincidence that is intensely ironic. In any case, I thank you for sharing your insight, and I'm very glad that I happened upon your well thought out post! I hope you will continue posting in the future because this thought provoking supposition is very welcome here among the rest and is the exact type of reading that keeps me coming back here for more. Bravo.

       Thank you for the kind words! Means more than a bunch upvotes!  I've been thinking about this for several months now and still trying to figure this out and put out there. It's as if Snowden is a code word, and like you say, it could be yet another example of "the big Chiefs dangling the secret to their methods directly in the public's faces." Hiding in plain sight, as always.

       It truly is! I might be wrong, might be right, but I really think it's worth thinking about what Edward Snowden means with reference to the literary Snowden. Notice that character has no first name, it's just "Snowden". Today, people say "Snowden" and we know exactly who that is: Edward Snowden, NSA whistleblower.  Yossarian's Snowden is forgotten, butI think we should remember him and his "grim secret".

       I can tell you've given this a great deal of thought, which is why it's so good to read. As you say, it is a strange name that I have never encountered casually in my regular day. It sounds like the name of a character in a spy novel or a comicbook.  When you step back from the whole thing, it really does feel artificial.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so frustrating not knowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it must be a real hoot for these people (these hypothetically powerful people) that could be behind it all. I imagine it would make one feel extremely powerful to know for a fact that most of what everyone else considers to be real is in actuality nothing more than a lie. Not just any lie either, it's a lie that is so blatantly artificial that it alludes towards its own falseness. It's a terribly manipulative method to lie poorly and give someone no choice but to swallow it. It's demeaning and shameful for the person being forced to believe something they know deep down to be a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, if you are correct, they truly want people to know they are lying. They didn't choose some obscure title that only fringe niche groups would connect to the truth, they chose a literary masterpiece that most educated individuals of age have at least encountered once in their lives. It's the part that really stings. It's using the truth as a weapon to be lorded over the populace. They put it within reach, but they don't allow you to accept it without the tremendous cost of collapsing your worldview and your status as a sane, functioning member of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, it's like lying poorly just to laugh at anyone stupid enough to believe you. That way it has the added bonus of insulting the intelligence of anyone (the majority of the human race) who follows the mainstream. Mind games. It makes sense. The most powerful people in the world don't have to deal with the taxing struggles of survival most humans deal with, they have a lot of time on their hands and they're probably extremely bored. Knowing the truth is a powerful feeling. We, as a public, are far from empowered, and things like this are reminders. Just as you said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nice rabbit hole you came across here! Honestly, I'm very glad you took the time to share it. Thank you.

       Snowden is Daniel Ellsberg.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Whistleblower" Daniel Ellsberg "revealed" the Pentagon Papers but actually worked for Bill Colby (later CIA director) in Vietnam helping to organize the Phoenix Program,
       <em>
        an extermination program against specifically targeted, identified leaders of society
       </em>
       , which was sanitized in the "Pentagon Papers".
      </p>
      <p>
       The Phoenix Program later went by other names:
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor">
        Operation Condor
       </a>
       , the "Salvador Option" and
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/07/world/the-struggle-for-iraq-killings-assassinations-tear-into-iraq-s-educated-class.html">
        others without a name
       </a>
       .  Breivik's massacre was essentially a Phoenix Program operation eliminating future leadership.  There are many other examples, and
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/04/14/fugitive.arrests/">
        U.S. domestic examples being prepared for
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Ellsberg's "Pentagon Papers" was a limited hangout that re-wrote the history of the Vietnam War to exclude the JFK National Security Directives, and sanitized the massive role of the Phoenix Program.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ellsberg's "Pentagon Papers" were sleight-of-hand to misdirect your attention into thinking you were being given ALL of the secrets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden's "whistleblowing" is sleight-of-hand to misdirect your attention into thinking you are being given ALL of the secrets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden, like Ellsberg, is a limited hangout.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden, like Ellsberg, defines the FALSE parameters of debate about the full extent of NSA (and other) surveillance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden, like Ellsberg, may be covering up the existence of a much larger program -- a domestic Phoenix Project:  a domestic program to identify a list of individuals to be exterminated "in the fog of war" and "in the chaotic aftermath of a domestic nuclear terrorist attack".
      </p>
      <p>
       William Binney has identified
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000001733041/the-program.html">
        "The Program"
       </a>
       as being a comprehensive file on
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       American citizen.  Binney's revelations do not suggest the full extent of the program either, but suggest the first stage of a domestic Phoenix Program/Operation Condor.

       So you're stating here that Snowden whistleblowing the NSA was intentionally planned to let us believe we were being "leaked" all the secret information when in reality they are simply trying to create limitations and parameters around our beliefs in order to stifle our ability to truly perceive the full extent of the situations at hand?

       In part, yes, it's a limited hangout &amp; that's why there's a name for it.

       But like all black-ops, there are many birds being killed with one stone.  Also:  Snowden needn't be a witting collaborator or an unwitting collaborator.  He could be partially witting.  He could end up like Oswald (or Obama, as I suspect we will see before it's over) -- a partially-witting collaborator who was set up to walk into a trap, which in Snowden's case may not have sprung yet.

       Sadly we live in an age so bereft of heroes that the people will simply jump to attention as soon as someone seems to go against the establishment.

       This post is well written and presents the topic well enough, except for one detail: Snowden has only revealed different code names, the actual existence of these programs was confirmed before the year 2000 passed us by the scandal surrounding project Echelon.
      </p>

       u/northamerimassgrave put it perfectly, Snowden is a limited hangout like Ellsberg. Ellsberg removed the CIA from the narrative and put the blame entirely on the military and the public chain of command, Snowden shows us a tidbit of information confirming the Orwellian surveillance state but hides, by omission, anything relating to 9/11, state sponsoring of terrorism and the use of these terrorists to overthrow different governments on the enemy list of the CIA (Libya, Syria, etc..).

       That was awesome to read, and now I think I want to read Catch 22 again.

       I've wondered about Snowden's true purpose myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes I think that the leaks were deliberate, a show of force meant to hammer home the message of Total Information Awareness, and that we are completely and utterly under their thumb. (But in a way we're not, we
       <em>
        choose
       </em>
       to be. Don't wanna opt in? Well, live without using the Internet.)
      </p>
      <p>
       When you look at all the obviously feigned outrage by Germany and other nations, and the total lack of anything being changed, well, it all rings a little false.

       I believe that Snowden was used to stifle organized dissent. Say you're a middle class member who is fed with the inequality and corruption. If you wanted to organize some type of protest, you'll think twice now.
