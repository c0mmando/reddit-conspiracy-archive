       there is an energy photon wave coming, that will hit the earth and "upgrade human software" and we will become more spiritual being rather than physical and material as we are now. CERN are trying to stop that wave and that is what they are going to do between 23-28th of Sept. - that is what I know will happen :)

       Isn't that why we invaded Iraq to liberate the population from their countries natural resources....I mean evil dictator?  Why does SA get a free pass on brutal execution of their own countrymen?  Will sanctions be enacted against SA, doubtful, will the UN have public outcry, doubtful, will Obama shed a tear on national broadcasts like he did for trayvon, highly doubtful.

       The pope is traveling around the world in order to let world leaders know, that hes going threw with a type of disclosure, since it will start a new order as well as let everyone know that all their believe systems are lies and that were basically stuck with each other, since hes already given the all clear on the rfid for humanitarian reasons a new currency will be implemented.  If done right and for the good of everyone than it cant fail but we dont live in a perfect world unfortunately.

      <blockquote>
       <p>

       The google algorithms works the same way a person does. Repeat something long enough and often enough and eventually it will be presented as facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       It probably started with the CERN announcement that they were going full power on the 23rd and because so many people were talking about it those two got connected by google.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying there won't be a demonic gateway to another dimension opening up at CERN this Wednesday, but please do not parrot everything you hear on the internet without doing some critical research first.

       I think everyone here understands that these are only theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason they're probably making these claims is because people have been predicting the coming of the New World Order for a long time. This would mean the end of nation sovereignty and the rise of global governance via leaders like the UN and the Pope.
      </p>
      <p>
       How this would come about is anyone's guess (some argue it's already here).. but this week would be as good an opportunity for a big announcement as anything else.

       Why the fuck would the Pope announce that? He's the head of the Catholic Church. Anyone who is not Catholic doesn't give a fuck what he says.

       I've literally seen people say that the world will end because Ned Flander's alarm clock reads 9/23 in an episode of the Simpsons. Or that America is somehow about to pull off a total invasion of Iran in the next few days. Or that CERN is going to open a gateway to hell because they don't understand what the LHC actually does.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's wild speculation, confirmation bias and unsubstantiated hysteria. The world is not going to end in September.

       I know you didn't necessarily direct the rest of your response to me, but I said nothing of an invasion of Iran, CERN or that the world is going to end. Some people do, but I think you'll find that many here are rational in their thinking.

       Are we going to nuke Iran on the 23rd?. No, but is Iran in our crosshairs?

      <p>
       Is CERN going to open a gateway to hell on the 23rd? Anything is possible, but no.

       As for Pope Francis, he's actually one of the most popular Pope's, so he does have a lot of influence. There has been a clear rise in the role/influence of the UN and the Pope on the global stage (among other players). It's not unreasonable to suggest that his visit to the UN in New York City is a good opportunity for an announcement for some global initiative, policy, or something significant.

       I'd like to see the Pope try and get Muslim nations like Saudi Arabia to lie down to a world government. I imagine their response would be something along the lines of 'lol no'. He might be popular to certain secular individuals and forward thinking Catholics, but conservative Catholics are mostly opposed to his reformist ways. He also still heads an organisation vehemently against homosexuality and embroiled in child abuse scandals. Even the most popular Pope doesn't hold much influence, especially amongst non-Catholics. I imagine he'll talk vaguely about world peace, tolerance and the necessity to end persecution at the hand of IS. Don't expect global political reform...
      </p>

       U.S. Policy on Iran is to prevent them constructing a nuclear bomb. The new deal is achieving that diplomatically. There is no logical or strategic purpose in carrying out an unprovoked nuclear strike or invasion. For one thing, the U.S. public aren't interested in another war in the Middle East, and it would do very little but severely piss off Russia.

       The LHC has been running at a constant power level since July. There are no planned changes in operations in September. All the LHC does is emulate particle collisions that occur naturally on a regular basis in the upper atmosphere and across the universe. These collisions are not destructive, because if they were their sheer frequency would mean there wouldn't
       <em>
        be
       </em>
       a universe. It's impossible to open a gateway to hell because hell doesn't exist. While creating micro-black holes is a possibility, the would be stable phenomena and a huge breakthrough in the study of physics, giving scientists a greater understanding of gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scheduled economic crash didn't happen, there is no tangible evidence that a world destroying asteroid exists and it is now 12:45AM on Wednesday the 23rd of September where I live (Australia) and the world is still here.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for John Hagee's prophecy, I'm not inclined to trust vague metaphorical literature written 2000 years ago, or inaccurate astronomical observations.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no hard, indisputable evidence that the world will end this month. There is rational, indisputable and logical reasons why it won't.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I understand that you and many others don't subscribe to the theory that the world will end on the 23rd of September. But these threads are still being made and idiots with no real evidence other than 'there are signs!' keep responding with the same shit. It's frustrating, and it causes a lot of anxiety in people who take stuff on the Internet a little too seriously. Sorry if it seemed like I was directing my anger at you.
