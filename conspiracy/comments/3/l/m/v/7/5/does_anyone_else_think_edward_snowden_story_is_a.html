       He releases a bunch of documents saying what the government is doing then goes to Russia. Is on the run and can't be found but is able to be on the news do ama's meet with John Oliver. Most people don't know who he is or what he did and really has no knowledge of what he leaked.pi don't know maybe It's just me thinking nonsense.

       He is America's disclaimer. He told the people what America was doing and no one revolted, so it gives permission for the government to continue. They just use him to say what they are doing and instead of voting yes, they take that the people are ok with it since no one opposed it to a vote to stop it. the new "by continuing to use this service, you agree to terms and conditions"...

       Snowden received all the press coverage because he provided the hard evidence in the form of official government documents that previous whistleblowers didn't have.  He may very well be a limited hangout but his media coverage need not be explained entirely as an orchestrated psyop

       That was a media circus, not terribly unlike the Boston bombing or Sandy Hook PR campaigns. Personally, I think Snowfen was created to dissuade any potential dissenters.

       Not sure why you're being downvoted. It seems this sub likes to find a conspiracy within a conspiracy until eventually there's no story. Bill Binney worked at the NSA for 30 years and did public talks at hacking conferences explaining how they keep profiles on people and all of their social connections, etc. He had no documents, so nobody believed him.

       In fairness to him, he didn't leak anything until he went to HK. From HK to Moscow, I don't know that the US could have done anything without creating an international incident. At this point, I'm sure the US intelligence community knows where he is, but has weighed the benefits and costs and determined it better not to intervene.

       All that assumes Snowden is legit, and not part of some limited hangout. He's former CIA, which is somewhat a contradiction of terms.

       Agreed. Remember, they did have the Europeans ground the offical plane of a South American president (Morales?) when they suspected Snowden of being onboard, so they weren't completely unwilling to try. But as far as violating Russia's soil, even that they have not done.

       Yep..my father works for Booz Allen Hamilton currently and has been in the government's pretty paws since his ROTC days. I've never been privy to anything he was ever working on except when he was contracted to help organize NASA's Constellation program which was supposed to send us back to the moon. The only reason he ever told me about it was because I had an interest in space research in my high school days and he wanted to try to connect with me. Since they scrubbed that program, he's been supposedly in cybersecurity, or at least that's all he could tell me and my family. He's never getting away from the government, whether he likes it or not. His security clearance doesn't allow that. Anyway,
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booz_Allen_Hamilton">

       Snowden is what is called a limited hangout, they are extremely easy to notice: whenever some random dude pops up shouting about shit everyone in the know knew 10-15years ago and he's accepted like the new messiah by the mainstream media, then you have a limited hangout.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean that he himself knows it, he is probably himself persuaded that he is the messiah of freedom or some shit, but he's being spoon fed baby information  as if it's ground breaking news.

       You know what? I don't care. I don't care what he thinks about himself, I don't care if he is a government hired shill [yeah right], I don't care if he's mad, I just don't care.
Because it doesn't matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does matter is that he single handedly let us know about something we have all suspected for a long time. He made it big headlines, he made normal people suddenly aware of government snooping.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without him we wouldn't still be in this place of suspicion but no mainstream news would have reported anything and the thought of being spied on would still only be a Conspiracy Theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       So whatever he thinks or wants to do, I don't care, his message is bigger than him and has its own life now, thanks to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       So thank you Snowden!

       It does matter. Because what has changed since he released the information? Absolutely nothing. People started saying "wow, the government spies. That's a surprise. I am outraged" Then went back to their morning coffee and the governing bodies continue to do the same shit. This let them know they can get away with it.

       Yes, and before that only a handful of people worried. I'd say it is now pretty much mainstream knowledge that the government spies. SO any next step will be looked at completely different, thanks to making it public. Even if it seems that nobody seems to care, it is now in the public knowledge, a big step better than before.

       wtf? we knew all that since the australian government publicly acknowledged project echelon around the end of the 90's. you must be too young to remember this I guess, but all snowden gave you was the names of the programs, the existence of those programs has been known literally for decades, that's why it's so fucking easy to see he's a limited hangout. right around mid 2001 the indignation was rising world wide about the US spying, 9/11 put an end to all that.

       I've talked to tons of programmers and tons of conspiracy theorists, and almost all of them consider him a hero. I find it curious that there would be enough support to get this onto the front page. If there is a revolution or a real demand for change, I will thank those people who woke my friends up... and the two groups that did are Infowars and Snowden. A few were also woken up by wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       It hasn't incited any of them to violence. Some are getting involved in politics. Some are filing freedom of information act requests. Some are starting YouTube channels or Blogs or getting involved in a hundred different ways... and they typically get pretty active on Facebook defending ideas that they used to discount.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, thanks, limited hangout shill plant whateveryouare's. Maybe it was intended to familiarize people, or maybe it was done to incite violence... but not this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know anyone that woke up and went violent. Some people just got up and left... but no one started a militia =P.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe Alex Jones is controlled op, and Snowden was a limited hangout... but they let it out too quickly, or too roughly... or they just misplanned, because people go from Alex Jones and Snowden to just plain researching everything and questioning everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for meeting with John Oliver... what is this supposed to be? Is Snowden on the run from CIA assassins? Hiding in caves near Moscow? He's safe in Russia because it would be politically expensive to get him... it's not because our military/cia couldn't kill him or extract him or hold him down and tickle him as quick as a hummingbird fart... it's just because this is the modern world, and the NSA/CIA/Mossad aren't controlling John Oliver or restricting access to Russia on the idea that a comedian may go talk to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what are they going to do to him when he gets back? As for AMA's, you can easily hide your IP through an onion router like TOR, and you can broadcast video... as if he needed to hide his IP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe he's a hangout. Maybe not. Keep em coming.

       Alex Jones may have awoken
       <em>

       and some others, and in that sense it may seem he has done good.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, he is completely unpalatable to the vast majority and because of that, he paints a bad image for conspiracy theorists as a whole. He makes conspiracy theorists look like nutjobs in the eyes of the general public and turns off far more people to truth than the few he draws. He also spreads a lot of misinformation to the people he does wake up.
      </p>
      <p>
       So before you thank him for waking you up- keep in mind, he does the movement? overall a great disservice. And in that sense, he's fucking you over too.

       It's good and bad. Out of a few dozen alt media sources, I actually recommend four. Rudkowski, Corbett, X22 and SCG, and I've met one person who was woke up by Luke and one by Corbett... and several from Alex. Strangely, one from Mark Levine and one from Coast to Coast =P I have a lot of problems with a lot of these dudes... but whatever works.

       After people are done getting shocked by Snowden, just make sure to steer them towards solid people in our community... even if he's a limited hangout, a lot of the information has been useful. 75% of America believes that there is widespread corruption in the government. It hasn't incited a violent revolution or passive submission.

       You say that he "is on the run and can't be found."  that is nonsense.   Russia gave him asylum.  He is under their protection.  He's not running anywhere and everybody certainly knows where he lives.  People fly over and do interviews with him all the time.  People call him up on his phone and do interviews with him all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       America does not have jurisdiction over the entire world.  If a criminal steps foot on American soil we can arrest him.  Beyond that the only way to take them into custody is if another nation extradites him back to the United States, something many countries are not willing to do under any circumstances and others that do or do not do so depending on the circumstances of the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Roman Polanski is still living in France and was even awarded an Oscar 30 years after he fled to avoid prison after raping a 13 year old girl.    France won't extradite him.  The U.S. tried to get Great Britain to extradite Gary McKinnon for 14 years before finally giving up.  Great Britain would not extradite him.   As with Snowden, we know exactly where these people are.  They do interviews, Polanski even makes movies.  Doesn't help us at all in arresting them if their host country won't put them on a plane and ship them back to American soil.

       In fairness to him, he didn't leak anything until he went to HK. From HK to Moscow, I don't know that the US could have done anything without creating an international incident. At this point, I'm sure the US intelligence community knows where he is, but has weighed the benefits and costs and determined it better not to intervene.
