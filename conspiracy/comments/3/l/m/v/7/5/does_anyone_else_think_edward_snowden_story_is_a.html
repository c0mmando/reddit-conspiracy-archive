    <div class="md"><p>In fairness to him, he didn&#39;t leak anything until he went to HK. From HK to Moscow, I don&#39;t know that the US could have done anything without creating an international incident. At this point, I&#39;m sure the US intelligence community knows where he is, but has weighed the benefits and costs and determined it better not to intervene.</p>

<p>All that assumes Snowden is legit, and not part of some limited hangout. He&#39;s former CIA, which is somewhat a contradiction of terms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Remember, they did have the Europeans ground the offical plane of a South American president (Morales?) when they suspected Snowden of being onboard, so they weren&#39;t completely unwilling to try.

    <div class="md"><p>Yep..my father works for Booz Allen Hamilton currently and has been in the government&#39;s pretty paws since his ROTC days. I&#39;ve never been privy to anything he was ever working on except when he was contracted to help organize NASA&#39;s Constellation program which was supposed to send us back to the moon. The only reason he ever told me about it was because I had an interest in space research in my high school days and he wanted to try to connect with me. Since they scrubbed that program, he&#39;s been supposedly in cybersecurity, or at least that&#39;s all he could tell me and my family. He&#39;s never getting away from the government, whether he likes it or not. His security clearance doesn&#39;t allow that. Anyway, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booz_Allen_Hamilton">Booz Allen Hamilton</a> is mostly owned by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlyle_Group">The Carlyle Group</a>, which has had its own shady ties to a terrible lot of awful things and people in this country (including 9/11)...think Ian Brzezinski, James Clapper, Dov Zakheim, etc. I don&#39;t trust that Snowden is anything <em>but</em> a clever psyop/limited hangout.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Snowden is what is called a limited hangout, they are extremely easy to notice: whenever some random dude pops up shouting about shit everyone in the know knew 10-15years ago and he&#39;s accepted like the new messiah by the mainstream media, then you have a limited hangout.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean that he himself knows it, he is probably himself persuaded that he is the messiah of freedom or some shit, but he&#39;s being spoon fed baby information  as if it&#39;s ground breaking news.</p>

Because it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>What does matter is that he single handedly let us know about something we have all suspected for a long time. He made it big headlines, he made normal people suddenly aware of government snooping.</p>

<p>Without him we wouldn&#39;t still be in this place of suspicion but no mainstream news would have reported anything and the thought of being spied on would still only be a Conspiracy Theory.</p>

<p>So whatever he thinks or wants to do, I don&#39;t care, his message is bigger than him and has its own life now, thanks to him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve talked to tons of programmers and tons of conspiracy theorists, and almost all of them consider him a hero. I find it curious that there would be enough support to get this onto the front page. If there is a revolution or a real demand for change, I will thank those people who woke my friends up... and the two groups that did are Infowars and Snowden. A few were also woken up by wikileaks.</p>

<p>It hasn&#39;t incited any of them to violence. Some are getting involved in politics. Some are filing freedom of information act requests. Some are starting YouTube channels or Blogs or getting involved in a hundred different ways... and they typically get pretty active on Facebook defending ideas that they used to discount.</p>

<p>So, thanks, limited hangout shill plant whateveryouare&#39;s. Maybe it was intended to familiarize people, or maybe it was done to incite violence... but not this time.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anyone that woke up and went violent. Some people just got up and left... but no one started a militia =P.</p>

<p>Maybe Alex Jones is controlled op, and Snowden was a limited hangout... but they let it out too quickly, or too roughly... or they just misplanned, because people go from Alex Jones and Snowden to just plain researching everything and questioning everything.</p>

<p>And as for meeting with John Oliver... what is this supposed to be? Is Snowden on the run from CIA assassins? Hiding in caves near Moscow? He&#39;s safe in Russia because it would be politically expensive to get him... it&#39;s not because our military/cia couldn&#39;t kill him or extract him or hold him down and tickle him as quick as a hummingbird fart... it&#39;s just because this is the modern world, and the NSA/CIA/Mossad aren&#39;t controlling John Oliver or restricting access to Russia on the idea that a comedian may go talk to him.</p>

<p>And what are they going to do to him when he gets back? As for AMA&#39;s, you can easily hide your IP through an onion router like TOR, and you can broadcast video... as if he needed to hide his IP. </p>

<p>Maybe he&#39;s a hangout. Maybe not. Keep em coming.</p>

<p>However, he is completely unpalatable to the vast majority and because of that, he paints a bad image for conspiracy theorists as a whole.

<p>So before you thank him for waking you up- keep in mind, he does the movement? overall a great disservice. And in that sense, he&#39;s fucking you over too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s good and bad. Out of a few dozen alt media sources, I actually recommend four. Rudkowski, Corbett, X22 and SCG, and I&#39;ve met one person who was woke up by Luke and one by Corbett... and several from Alex. Strangely, one from Mark Levine and one from Coast to Coast =P I have a lot of problems with a lot of these dudes... but whatever works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After people are done getting shocked by Snowden, just make sure to steer them towards solid people in our community... even if he&#39;s a limited hangout, a lot of the information has been useful. 75% of America believes that there is widespread corruption in the government. It hasn&#39;t incited a violent revolution or passive submission. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is growing. People are waking up. Give them something positive to turn to :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say that he &quot;is on the run and can&#39;t be found.&quot;  that is nonsense.   Russia gave him asylum.  He is under their protection.  He&#39;s not running anywhere and everybody certainly knows where he lives.  People fly over and do interviews with him all the time.  People call him up on his phone and do interviews with him all the time.  </p>

<p>America does not have jurisdiction over the entire world.  If a criminal steps foot on American soil we can arrest him.  Beyond that the only way to take them into custody is if another nation extradites him back to the United States, something many countries are not willing to do under any circumstances and others that do or do not do so depending on the circumstances of the case.</p>

<p>Roman Polanski is still living in France and was even awarded an Oscar 30 years after he fled to avoid prison after raping a 13 year old girl.    France won&#39;t extradite him.  The U.S. tried to get Great Britain to extradite Gary McKinnon for 14 years before finally giving up.  Great Britain would not extradite him.   As with Snowden, we know exactly where these people are.  They do interviews, Polanski even makes movies.  Doesn&#39;t help us at all in arresting them if their host country won&#39;t put them on a plane and ship them back to American soil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch Scandal S2;E3. This episode came out several months before Snowden hit the news. It&#39;s about a government whistleblower who reveals a program called &quot;Thorngate&quot; that is used to spy on citizens. 
Episode aired October 2012
Snowden disclosed his info Summer of 2013</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In fairness to him, he didn&#39;t leak anything until he went to HK. From HK to Moscow, I don&#39;t know that the US could have done anything without creating an international incident. At this point, I&#39;m sure the US intelligence community knows where he is, but has weighed the benefits and costs and determined it better not to intervene.</p>

<p>All that assumes Snowden is legit, and not part of some limited hangout. He&#39;s former CIA, which is somewhat a contradiction of terms.</p>
