    <div class="md"><p>Read <em>Flashboys</em> by Michael Lewis. It details how the stock market can be somewhat rigged. It is not some nefarious government agency with a secret switch to make or break the stock market, and crash it at will. That&#39;s how this article/sub is likely going to interpret it. The article itself is pretty click-baity: The title implies the whole thing is rigged, which is to say it&#39;s all just a show put on. Then it doesn&#39;t even really elaborate what Grasso was talking about, only the click-baity soundbite &quot;NYSE is rigged&quot;. That&#39;s not the case. There are criminals out there who are skating on the boundaries of insider-trading with new technology and computing power. They&#39;re &#39;rigging&#39; certain sales, not the whole market.</p>

<p>It&#39;s HFT or High Frequency Trading. This is why most people won&#39;t actually look into this type of corruption: It&#39;s complicated. Most people barely understand how stocks work, let alone how gaming the system works.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/23le1j/eli5_what_are_the_flash_boys_and_how_does_that/">ELI5 had a good explanation of the book I mentioned above.</a> It&#39;s basically &quot;the rich staying rich&quot;. These guys rely on being a few hundred feet closer to the trades than others, so their data transfers from one computer to the next just milliseconds faster. That&#39;s how sophisticated the scam is. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s on-going. Even with books like <em>Flashboys</em> and <em>Dark Pools</em> exposing these scams, it&#39;s still on-going with no politicians really making that big a fuss: They know it&#39;s complicated too, and know their constituents don&#39;t want to hear about it. But it&#39;s the same types of corrupt Wall Street fatcats as the likes of Enron, Tyco, and the rest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I know, I just wanted to tag along to clarify that many Americans saying &quot;the market is <em>not</em> rigged&quot; aren&#39;t entirely wrong. But they aren&#39;t entirely right either. This is a complex bit of crime that&#39;s only recently become possible (last decade), so combating and protecting against this kind of crime is not very easy. SEC regulators can&#39;t act too quickly, else they might leave holes on a job they call patched. But it&#39;s inevitable. HFT is a bubble, and when it pops, expect to see a Bernie Madoff or two take the fall for the rest and end up in prison while the bigger roaches scatter off from the light to develop their next scheme. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Richard Grasso acted as the chairman and chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange from 1995 to 2003, and he has come out in a recent interview saying that the stock market is rigged. Considering that he spent nearly a decade at the head of the institution, he would obviously have legitimate experience to speak on.</p>

<p>The interview was reported by the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/fast-market-not-necessarily-a-fair-market-former-nyse-chief-says-1441992084">Wall Street Journal</a> this week and is set to appear on the television show “Wall Street Week” this Sunday.</p>

<p>During the interview Grasso said, “A fast market is not necessarily a fair market, as evidenced by that Monday open. Frankly, some of the things that went on that day need very close scrutiny.”</p>

<p>Speaking of the erratic stock activity that occurred in late August, he said that “A day like that, where Facebook’s shares go from $86 to $72 to $84 in a matter of minutes will cause the public to lose confidence in the markets.”</p>

<p>Grasso also spoke of how the game was rigged to create an advantage for certain players.</p>

<p>“Creating an advantage to an institutional user or a particular type of trader that disadvantages the retail investor is bad for the country, bad for the markets and bad for your business,” he said.</p>

<p>Grasso has not been absent of controversy himself, he was actually forced to step down from the NYSE back in 2003 after he was accused of embezzling millions in retirement pay from the organization.</p>
