<p>If you are a kid and a conspiracy theorist youre the smart guy.  You are on the Scorpion team. You are right there with the hit show Scandal in the know and not niave. Its assumed that the usa is secretly run by a group even the president doesnt dare cross.</p>

<p>Its the new best thing to be. Kids laugh when old news guys like Anderson Cooper look incredulous when someone tells them the truth. (Even Tom Cruise has been shown to have been right about psychoactive drugs proving Matt Lauer WAS glib.)</p>

<p>So how will those who invented the term conspiracy theorist to discredit those who look deeper now seek to discourage or discredit such active truth seeking?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I&#39;m seeing more and more people becoming uncomfortable when confronted with the facts of numerous conspiracies, and more and more of them willing to listen. </p>

<p>Literally in the past week, I&#39;ve had TWO people who used to mock me on Facebook tell me that they were increasingly disturbed by what they&#39;ve learned about 9/11.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a slow process, but then things will reach a tipping point. &quot;Gradually, then suddenly,&quot; as Fitzgerald wrote. Like Bill Cosby, gay marriage, the Confederate flag. It can&#39;t happen, it&#39;ll never happen until suddenly....it happens. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to believe us, or you can pretend you don&#39;t believe us because your livelihood depends on it. But the arc of justice will bend to the truth. Maybe not this year, but fairly soon, I have little doubt. </p>

<p>If the things billy says bother you, stop going to Billy&#39;s house.  Then you don&#39;t have to hear billy say things any more and you don&#39;t get bothered by the things billy says.</p>

<p>But if you decide to keep going to Billy&#39;s house then I don&#39;t want to hear you complain about the awful things billy says.</p>

<p>This is where you&#39;ll here the anti-conspiracy commentor, say it&#39;s all for their entertainment. Bullshit.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never in my life seen the effort I see put forward in this sub to discredit or &quot;debunk&quot; conspiracy theory done for someones casual entertainment.</p>

<p>People that come here to mock and argue with conspiracists do so for one of two reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try: 1. Because the rampant narcissism undergirding conspiracist claptrap (&quot;I have delved deep into secret knowledge, and now I am Aware&quot;) corrupts public discourse and should be confronted.  For a given set of extreme cospiro-narcissists, these beliefs are a prelude to violence.  Anders Brevik:  &quot;I understand the Muslim threat, and only I am wise enough, strong enough, to do what must be done!&quot; Or Dylan Rooffs: &quot;Black people are destroying America, and only I (thanks to my studies and wisdom) can bring on the race war we must fight!&quot;  The <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> shooters expressed a similar sense of righteous wisdom.

    <div class="md"><p>The term conspiracy theorist still has the same power it always has... when ordinary people hear the word &quot;conspiracy&quot; they don&#39;t think of a plot against them, they think of the proposed conspiracy as if it&#39;s just a &quot;theory&quot;, as if all evidence leads to a possibility at best. Take 9/11 for example... there&#39;s enough evidence there to at least mount a serious investigation into those potentially accountable, and yet because it&#39;s a &quot;conspiracy&quot; all what would be considered evidence under different circumstances is considered unfounded speculation instead.</p>
