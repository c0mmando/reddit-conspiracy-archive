<p>These 27 facts are what is going to happen. The unveiling of the Bapohmet statue in Chicago is when Satan took over. The Pope meeting with Obama is also another thing. Antichrist, Satan, and end times. It is all here. Please open your mind. (If you are reading this, then your mind is probably open anyways.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Come September 24th nothing will be different. October will pass and so will November. December will come and it will all be the same. Then 2016 will be here and nothing will be different. What are you going to say then? You can say whatever you want now but what about after nothing happens? Will you just dismiss it and stick to another random date warning people for no reason? This is a serious question. </p>

<p>You seem very easily agitated so I&#39;ll try very politely, most if not all of what you&#39;re showing us is very easily explained away (Chicago just being Satanist attempting to prove a philosophical point about religious equality, CERN is just business as normal if we haven&#39;t gotten hell gates yet why would that change now).   I think you may need either a break from your religion or a break from the constant stream of information your getting.  </p>

<p>Yep, I do this on and off every few months. You gotta get back to real life stuff but then I binge watch politics/conspiracy/world news like it&#39;s nothing. Something about watching the real world is way more fascinating then TV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem is these kinds of &quot;doomsdays&quot; dates come up a lot.. I remember the CERN blackhole fears being huge a few years ago, nothing happened.. Asteroid collisions were constantly predicted before too..never happens.. Hyperdimensional election of Barack Obama, disclosure imminent, Fema camps, Jade Helm, shemittah 2015, earth quake predictions, Mayan 2012, Y2K, etc - </p>

<p>What seems to happen is a few predictions are made, then there&#39;s tons of people focusing on these dates, coming up with predictions using &quot;evidence&quot; that fits the dates, sort of riding the hype train. Everyone gets whipped up in a frenzy and posts all these youtube videos get popular.... then nothing happens. Everyone forgets and moves on.</p>

<p>Of course there will someday be huge disasters, and of course we are slipping into potential nightmare scenarios all the time, but these predictions don&#39;t have any certainty beyond all the past failed predictions. These videos feed on people wanting something exciting or world changing to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has already begun. Look at these wildfires in California today all on the news!! Like nothing they have ever seen!! This is God&#39;s way of talking to us. He is NOT happy. There was also a professor shot in a University today. Although not as nightmarish, it&#39;s still a public shooting to take note of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But there&#39;s always &quot;disasters like we&#39;ve never seen&quot;.. as long as I&#39;ve been alive its been that way. I was in the worst hit area of Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and that was most costly storm ever seen at the time... but since there have been many worst ones. That&#39;s the chaotic and evolving nature of the planet, made worst by our larger population. Yes there are more disasters now, due to climate change, population increase and just more media spreading the stories as well, so things will continue to amplify. But they are localized to regions, its not like the whole world is burning.</p>

<p>No offense but if god wanted to speak to us couldn&#39;t he be more obvious rather than a subtle increasing of natural disasters in localized areas? Lone gunmen going nuts is God&#39;s best way of communicating? Why not do something truly impressive that couldn&#39;t be explained by natural weather &amp; geological processes. But, as you say, God will do it this month and I won&#39;t be able to argue with it any more... so we&#39;ll see.</p>

<p>I agree, on average, the world&#39;s fucked up and getting worse every day, but I don&#39;t think this is going to culminate in some big supernatural, alien or holy event. I think people just <em>want</em> that so they believe it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK? A few weeks ago a drunk American trucker heard from a drunken British soldier that Jade Helm is going to attack/detain American citizens?... Why would the British guy have such high clearance info yet go blabbing about it to random strangers? </p>

<p>Are you sure you sent me the right video?</p>

<p>Either way I&#39;m staying tuned over the next few weeks, but like I said I&#39;m extremely skeptical. If something bad happens I think It will be a random coincidence and very unlikely to be ANY of the things that were predicted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s going to be your excuse as to why nothing is different come January? It&#39;s easy to say stuff right now but how do you play it off after nothing happens? I guarantee you have stuck to specific conspiracy dates in your past that came and passed and nothing happened. What did you think then? And don&#39;t tell me you haven&#39;t. If you&#39;re sticking to this so hard you have definitely stuck to previous dates where nothing happened.
