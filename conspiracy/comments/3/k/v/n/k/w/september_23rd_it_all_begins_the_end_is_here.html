       These 27 facts are what is going to happen. The unveiling of the Bapohmet statue in Chicago is when Satan took over. The Pope meeting with Obama is also another thing. Antichrist, Satan, and end times. It is all here. Please open your mind. (If you are reading this, then your mind is probably open anyways.)

       Come September 24th nothing will be different. October will pass and so will November. December will come and it will all be the same. Then 2016 will be here and nothing will be different. What are you going to say then? You can say whatever you want now but what about after nothing happens? Will you just dismiss it and stick to another random date warning people for no reason? This is a serious question.

       CERN starts their machine on the 23rd. If you put in September 23rd on Google Maps, it pulls up CERN. The black holes will open a portal to Hell itself.

       ......the LHC?   The machine they've been running and testing for over a decade now?  And you also understand the size of these "black holes" is microscopic they cease to exist at a point because they're size can't support them.

       You seem very easily agitated so I'll try very politely, most if not all of what you're showing us is very easily explained away (Chicago just being Satanist attempting to prove a philosophical point about religious equality, CERN is just business as normal if we haven't gotten hell gates yet why would that change now).   I think you may need either a break from your religion or a break from the constant stream of information your getting.

       Yep, I do this on and off every few months. You gotta get back to real life stuff but then I binge watch politics/conspiracy/world news like it's nothing. Something about watching the real world is way more fascinating then TV.

       Problem is these kinds of "doomsdays" dates come up a lot.. I remember the CERN blackhole fears being huge a few years ago, nothing happened.. Asteroid collisions were constantly predicted before too..never happens.. Hyperdimensional election of Barack Obama, disclosure imminent, Fema camps, Jade Helm, shemittah 2015, earth quake predictions, Mayan 2012, Y2K, etc -
      </p>
      <p>
       What seems to happen is a few predictions are made, then there's tons of people focusing on these dates, coming up with predictions using "evidence" that fits the dates, sort of riding the hype train. Everyone gets whipped up in a frenzy and posts all these youtube videos get popular.... then nothing happens. Everyone forgets and moves on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course there will someday be huge disasters, and of course we are slipping into potential nightmare scenarios all the time, but these predictions don't have any certainty beyond all the past failed predictions. These videos feed on people wanting something exciting or world changing to happen.

       It has already begun. Look at these wildfires in California today all on the news!! Like nothing they have ever seen!! This is God's way of talking to us. He is NOT happy. There was also a professor shot in a University today. Although not as nightmarish, it's still a public shooting to take note of.

       But there's always "disasters like we've never seen".. as long as I've been alive its been that way. I was in the worst hit area of Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and that was most costly storm ever seen at the time... but since there have been many worst ones. That's the chaotic and evolving nature of the planet, made worst by our larger population. Yes there are more disasters now, due to climate change, population increase and just more media spreading the stories as well, so things will continue to amplify. But they are localized to regions, its not like the whole world is burning.
      </p>
      <p>
       No offense but if god wanted to speak to us couldn't he be more obvious rather than a subtle increasing of natural disasters in localized areas? Lone gunmen going nuts is God's best way of communicating? Why not do something truly impressive that couldn't be explained by natural weather &amp; geological processes. But, as you say, God will do it this month and I won't be able to argue with it any more... so we'll see.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree, on average, the world's fucked up and getting worse every day, but I don't think this is going to culminate in some big supernatural, alien or holy event. I think people just
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       that so they believe it.

       OK? A few weeks ago a drunk American trucker heard from a drunken British soldier that Jade Helm is going to attack/detain American citizens?... Why would the British guy have such high clearance info yet go blabbing about it to random strangers?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you sure you sent me the right video?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way I'm staying tuned over the next few weeks, but like I said I'm extremely skeptical. If something bad happens I think It will be a random coincidence and very unlikely to be ANY of the things that were predicted.

       What's going to be your excuse as to why nothing is different come January? It's easy to say stuff right now but how do you play it off after nothing happens? I guarantee you have stuck to specific conspiracy dates in your past that came and passed and nothing happened. What did you think then? And don't tell me you haven't. If you're sticking to this so hard you have definitely stuck to previous dates where nothing happened. Tell me how you made sense of those days you were afraid of yet nothing happened and your life continued

       You WANT something to happen? While I understand what you mean about the excitement, that doesn't really mean I WANT this stuff to happen. Sure I'm bored as hell all the time and some big crazy stuff happening would be exciting (yet probably terrifying once the reality of it all really sunk in), but do you actually WANT it to happen? I don't know man

       Even if it does, google maps is programmed by people, and works off algorithms and runs on a computer. It's insane to think god's way to communicate the future is to speak through google maps.

       Anyone who has ever developed software before knows that bugs work in mysterious ways! Sometimes they can be the most insane number of coincidences that lead to a bug that seems random or even "super natural".

       There is a LOT of stuff happening. I really suggest you get on a desktop or a smartphone and watch these videos. It's really too much to explain. It involves the Antichrist, the New World Order, Pagan Rituals, the Bapohmet statue in Chicago, CERN launching it's terrible machine that will cause black holes, among many many other factors.

       I still think that global financial collapse (dollar vanish?!) will happen very soon but i got a strange feeling that with everything that is on the net about next two months i think that either legit alien arrival event might happen or they are going to make a fake "alien" invasion for their own insane agendas :[
