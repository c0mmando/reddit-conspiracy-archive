    <div class="md"><p>The truth about Bernie Sanders? He can&#39;t make a lick of difference.</p>

<p>Nobody that is running for President can make a lick of difference. The powers that be are too engrained into our current political system. It&#39;s corrupted, it&#39;s rigged, it&#39;s political theater to make you think that your vote makes a difference. It doesn&#39;t. At least not on it&#39;s own.</p>

<p>But Sanders has come out and said it... hiding the truth in plain sight, and all that. </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And now let me tell you something that no other candidate for president will tell you, and that is that no matter who is elected to be president, that person will not be able to address the enormous problems facing the working families of our country. They will not be able to succeed, because the power of Corporate America, the power of Wall Street, the power of campaign donors is <em>so great</em>, that no president <strong>alone</strong> can stand up to them. That is the truth. People may be uncomfortable about hearing it but that is the reality. And that is why, what this campaign is about, is saying loudly and clearly ‘it is not just about electing Bernie Sanders President, it is about creating a grassroots political movement in this country.’</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Whatever your thoughts on Sanders might be, whatever the truth about him may reveal, he&#39;s absolutely right about this. We need to stop thinking that we&#39;ll miraculously find some diamond in the rough that can magically eradicate the influence of money in politics. The only thing that will enact any sort of change is for people to put aside their petty differences and come together to stand against the inequality of wealth, the inequality of power, the inequality of justice, and the inequality of law that corporations, government officials, and wealthy billionaires have worked so hard to implement. This not only means casting a vote every few years, it means getting involved with the political process. It means educating yourself and making wiser decisions about which companies you do business with. It means writing letters and calling your representatives. It means peacefully protesting, engaging in public awareness campaigns, and educating others. As long as those of us in the 99% remain divided, lazy, lethargic, and content, we will remain defeated.</p>

<p>Is Sanders the idyllic diamond in the rough that will save us from TPTB? Fuck no. <em>We</em> are. We&#39;re the only ones that can make a difference. I mean, we aren&#39;t actually going to do anything about it, but at the end of the day, we&#39;ve got nobody to blame but ourselves. </p>

<p>We can vote for whoever the fuck we want to. But, if after election day we sit back on your asses and remove ourselves from participation, then things will continue as they have been.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie Sanders would agree with you on many points. And it&#39;s not even a conspiracy. It&#39;s blatant robbery and no effort is being made to cover it up. Citizens United is in and of itself a grand conspiracy, except that it&#39;s not. It sounds like one, but it&#39;s right there out in the open and there isn&#39;t a damn thing you can do about corporate buying power and heavy lobbying. That is what runs this country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where do you get that feeling from? Literally his biggest corporate campaign donor was some relatively small association of American based sugar companies, but that was when I checked him out last year when signed up for his campaign. I&#39;ve been supporting him since I first saw him on cspan with an I next to VT years ago when I was getting into politics. He&#39;s a good man. People are skeptical of his popularity but this has been a long time coming. </p>

<p>Oh yeahs hes Jewish, so there will be alot of mistrust on these boards. Whatever you say about this place, there are some racist fucks. </p>

<p>But Sanders is literally clamoring the same rhetoric Obama did, &quot;Believe in change! it&#39;s all you guys you just gotta have hope!&quot;  Oh yeah? Aside from gay rights, what has Obama actually accomplished in office besides tearing the Constitution to shreds.</p>

<p>And his stances are unreasonable just like Obama&#39;s.  Free tuition for our entire country?  That doesn&#39;t even make sense logistically.  Just like Obamacare, which is currently falling apart, these ideas are idealistic at best, but could never(and should never) be introduced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what about the kids that don&#39;t extend their education through college?  Are they to receive some set of 4 year package for their time or is it tough shit for them?

<p>The answer is not &quot;Make tuition free&quot;.  The answer is make education continue through a person&#39;s early twenties and make it accessible to them so that they can be who they want to be.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, its &quot;make public school tuition free&quot;.  No, they aren&#39;t to receive a set of 4 year package for their time, because they didn&#39;t apply to a college.  &quot;The federal funding for Sanders’s proposal would come from a tax on financial transactions. Stock trades, bonds, and derivative trading would be taxed at rates of 0.5 percent, 0.1 percent, and 0.005 percent, respectively. Supporters of the financial transaction tax, which they call the “Robin Hood tax,” say it is not only a progressive way to raise revenue but would also discourage dangerous levels of Wall Street speculation.&quot;  You also don&#39;t appear to have an answer.  I&#39;m not saying I know for a fact the man is perfect, but he certainly appears to me to be the best candidate and you&#39;re offering no alternative.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what happens when a university is full?  You just go to the next one?  That plan does not take into account the influx of out of state applicants, especially from the foreign sector.  And if your response is to build more schools, why would that make sense?  Spend MORE public funds to create MORE schools that cover the tuition?  </p>

<p>Sander&#39;s &quot;plan&quot; is one page long and doesn&#39;t offer any actual solid figures apart from the $47b price tag.</p>

<p>And my solution is the current system we have in place which allows kids to continue an education if they so desire.  When it comes to finances, there are many easy way to get grants and scholarships.  If you have the take loans out, that&#39;s probably the best thing that can happen for you because you&#39;re basically forced to integrate yourself into society from the get go.  When I graduated college, I had no incentive to go into the work force because I had a full scholarship.  The same applies to many other graduates who then don&#39;t have the drive to go out there and make their careers.</p>

<p>My point about the college system is that you&#39;re buying into the same bullshit lies that politicians use to get you to vote for them.  He has a &quot;plan&quot; but it&#39;s in no way shape or form an actual solution.</p>

<p>And I would vote Gary Johnson before any of these assholes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think when a university is full it stops accepting applicants, the same thing they&#39;ve always done.  Middle class incomes cannot afford to put someone through school with the amount of inflation in cost that&#39;s occurred so everyone is doing what you suggest and taking out loans to be &quot;integrated into society&quot;.  You really think being indebted is integrated?  Nah.  Also, I think Gary Johnson is plenty great and all, but he&#39;s unelectable in 2016 as the head of a marijuana company.  You wanna talk about idealistic?  Finally, I really don&#39;t give a hoot about Bernie&#39;s education plan, I&#39;ve graduated as well, and from a stupidly expensive private school that I&#39;m currently paying for and will be for the next 20 years or so.  Bernie speaks out against the Citizens United ruling and he stands a real chance at becoming the president.  This isn&#39;t true of any other candidate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree in that regard.  But just because he&#39;s the lesser of the evils doesn&#39;t mean I have to endorse him.  Obama was the lesser of the evils and that&#39;s turned out rather dandy.  </p>

<p>I think debts should be eliminated after 10 years of paying them if they&#39;re not already covered.   To me, that would provide a better solution than to make it free altogether.  </p>

<p>Yes, I do feel like you should work your ass off in your twenties to: </p>

<p>-establish a solid work ethic to provide for your family</p>

<p>-make yourself a professional</p>

<p>-keep yourself out of trouble</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe in much of anything.  But I believe Bernie Sanders is a good man without any ill-intent.  Not the lesser of many, many evils, but in fact a good man with a chance to win.  Take a closer look.  Also, I&#39;m really curious as to your age demographic.  I&#39;m 24.  I think you think &quot;work your ass off&quot; and &quot;endure soul-crushing debt&quot; are the same thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, what took me off the Bernie train is when he let the BLM people dismantle his speech.  To me, that showed me that when the time came, Bernie would not have the balls to stand up for what is actually right.  So to me, he is just another puppet that will not actually enforce what he believes.  He will just continue the government&#39;s agenda.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m 25.  What&#39;s your degree if your debt is soul crushing?  Because unless you went to Full Sail, your debt should reflect your potential career earnings <em>to an extent.</em>  </p>

<p>As in, if you went to law school, yeah your debt is insane, but you should also be able to make the type of money to cover that.  </p>

<p>And yes, I would say that a huge amount of debt is definitely the American way(look at the country&#39;s spending).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I pretty much went to full sail :-) .  Stupid fucking move.  I&#39;m an idiot, I&#39;m not trying to argue the contrary, but I&#39;m a happy idiot.  I&#39;m not a career oriented person, I&#39;m just a damn good waiter and an independent musician hack.  Also, since this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, have you considered that the BLM people at that event were maybe not genuine and were paid to do that stunt?  He doesn&#39;t have a bunch of security at his events because that&#39;s not what his campaign spends its money on.  It could&#39;ve gone much worse, he showed his character as a decent, reasonable, unconfrontational when it doesn&#39;t matter kind of person.  Most politicians by today&#39;s standards wouldn&#39;t let people get that close to them, would&#39;ve had body guards take the women away, or lashed out at least verbally in some way.  Bernie is the puppet of the people, not the defense lobby, not the marijuana lobby, not the &quot;powers that be.&quot;  Unlike the sitting president, he&#39;s spent decades in congress fighting for what he believes in and making REAL and difficult compromises when he absolutely must, not compromising his values.  His record checks out, you really can&#39;t ask for a much better candidate, in my opinion.  Its all shit anyway.  He&#39;s the obvious vote.  I believe the powers that be will do anything and everything to see that he isn&#39;t elected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, man, your time right now as a server is the best you&#39;ll have it flexibility wise.  Adjustable hours, the ability to make money on a whim, getting paid cash daily.  If I were you, I&#39;d just stay a server if you can deal with the social stigma attached to it.</p>

<p>I was a server for 7 years and I fucking hate my &quot;job&quot;.  I get a bullshit check every 2 weeks and I&#39;m always broke 2 days after payday.  </p>

<p>And yes, the BLM move was orchestrated to discredit Bernie by the Clinton camp.  But I want my leader to be strong, not a pushover.  If he wanted to &quot;let them speak&quot; and continue he would have done so.  But he got figuratively pushed off the stage.  </p>

<p>And I haven&#39;t even gotten to his gun stance yet!
Agree to disagree though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m taking down over 40k this year with it and I like it, so I&#39;m thinking this might be the good life.  I think Bernie actually believes 9/11 was what they say, all the shootings are real, ISIS is exactly what they say...bla bla bla.  I think people who genuinely believe these things come to the same conclusion about guns and terrorism as I did before I questioned things.  But yeah, I agree that his gun stance and minimum wage hike are cringe-inducing (mom and pop shops cannot survive $15 minimum wage), but I think citizen&#39;s united is more important than both.  Minimum wage and gun rights are fought in congress.  As president, he can personally make a difference in taking the money out of politics via supreme court nominees.  That&#39;s his platform, we all know it, and it doesn&#39;t matter to me if he sat one speech out because some hired protestors went and were paid to make him look bad no matter how he responded.  I don&#39;t see a better choice and I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a bad one.  That&#39;s my pitch, maybe i should join his campaign, sheeeit.  Also, this has truly been a nice discussion and thank you.</p>

<p>edit: maybe if he truly believes in 9/11 and stuff he would go into cardiac arrest, like, day one in the white house.  I dunno, he certainly needs to prove himself more, but I&#39;m probably voting for him and I did donate ten bucks the other day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, everything is public record and his campaign donations from corporate sponsors are miniscule compared to grass roots support. So you know anything about Sanders? He got elected in Burlington VT for mayor, being out a decade long incumbent as an independent nobody and did the same thing in the House. He&#39;s a perfect example of public financing for elections, which is also one of his ideas for reform, which is huge, cause not even this board talks about campaign finance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie Sanders has been in Washington for 30 years.  His answer to this country&#39;s problems is to feed the beast more.  The answer to him, is just to give the federal government more money, and more power, and that will fix everything.</p>

<p>It&#39;s laughable that people really believe that this already corrupted to the core system, just needs more money, and more power.  </p>

<p>Sander&#39;s is a fraud, and the only reason he&#39;s doing well is because people see that Hillary Clinton is more of a fraud, and are desperate for an alternative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;ve read that all US presidents are related through family bloodlines, if Sanders isn&#39;t, he won&#39;t be elected, when both candidates have bloodlines (&amp; that would make them related), the one with the more influential relatives would probably be chosen.</p>

<p>edit: unless the matrix cracks &amp; shatters.</p>

<p>&quot;Barack Obama often jokes in his campaign speeches about a genealogical survey last year that found he is a distant cousin of Dick Cheney.</p>

<p>Now there is more bad news for Obama: a study published yesterday found he is related to George Bush as well.</p>

<p>Researchers at the New England Historic Genealogical Society, founded in 1845, said Obama, the son of a white woman from Kansas and a black man from Kenya, can call six US presidents his cousins: both Bushes, Gerald Ford, Lyndon Johnson, Harry Truman and James Madison. The society, a non-profit organisation, found he is also related to Churchill.</p>

<p>It said it investigated the blood lines of the three presidential hopefuls. One of the oddest connections is that Obama is related to Brad Pitt and Hillary Clinton to Pitt&#39;s partner, Angelina Jolie.</p>

<p>Clinton, who is of French-Canadian descent on her mother&#39;s side, is a distant cousin of Madonna, Céline Dion and Alanis Morissette. Other distant cousins include writer Jack Kerouac and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.</p>

<p>Obama and Bush are 10th cousins, once removed, linked by Samuel Hinkley of Cape Cod, who died in 1662. Pitt and Obama are ninth cousins, linked by Edwin Hickman, who died in Virginia in 1769. Clinton and Jolie are ninth cousins, twice removed, both related to Jean Cusson who died in Quebec in 1718.</p>

<p>While family trees such as these throw up interesting links, genetically they are meaningless. While children carry half the genes of their father, cousins as far removed as Obama and Bush would have no more genetic link than someone they bumped into at random in the street.</p>

<p>The Republican candidate, John McCain, had claimed to be related to the Scottish king Robert the Bruce but, as the Guardian disclosed last week, British genealogists debunked that. The New England genealogists found no royal strain either but established yet another Bush connection: McCain is a sixth cousin of the first lady, Laura Bush.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Because marriage is a civil contract between two people. All sorts of ramifications occur if a group is denied marriage, from medical benefits, hospital visitation, housing, wills, taxes etc.</p>

<p>Religious freedom exists in the US. Your cult/church can still have a marriage ceremony excluding gay marriage, but the government cannot deny certain rights to entire groups of people. </p>

<p>And you can still choose not to get married. Or be married several times, like Kim Davis.</p>

<p>Its only a big issue because some intolerant tax exempt groups choose to make it so. It is settled law now.  </p>

<p>On the other hand he votes with the militant factions of government and is far too  friendly with the military Industrial Complex.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I pretty much went to full sail :-) .  Stupid fucking move.  I&#39;m an idiot, I&#39;m not trying to argue the contrary, but I&#39;m a happy idiot.  I&#39;m not a career oriented person, I&#39;m just a damn good waiter and an independent musician hack.  Also, since this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, have you considered that the BLM people at that event were maybe not genuine and were paid to do that stunt?  He doesn&#39;t have a bunch of security at his events because that&#39;s not what his campaign spends its money on.  It could&#39;ve gone much worse, he showed his character as a decent, reasonable, unconfrontational when it doesn&#39;t matter kind of person.  Most politicians by today&#39;s standards wouldn&#39;t let people get that close to them, would&#39;ve had body guards take the women away, or lashed out at least verbally in some way.  Bernie is the puppet of the people, not the defense lobby, not the marijuana lobby, not the &quot;powers that be.&quot;  Unlike the sitting president, he&#39;s spent decades in congress fighting for what he believes in and making REAL and difficult compromises when he absolutely must, not compromising his values.  His record checks out, you really can&#39;t ask for a much better candidate, in my opinion.  Its all shit anyway.  He&#39;s the obvious vote.  I believe the powers that be will do anything and everything to see that he isn&#39;t elected.</p>
