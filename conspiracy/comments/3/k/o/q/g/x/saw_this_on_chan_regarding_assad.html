       Motherfucker just wanted to stay the hell away from politics and be an eye doctor, but when his older brother died he was called back to Syria and had this life thrust upon him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now he's trying to hold together a country that is being ripped apart by fanatical Muslim death cultists, using justifiably brutal means to beat back several different insurgencies and armed militant groups who'd like nothing more than to decapitate him on live television and continue their march towards the rest of the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to top it all off, every western media group is vilifying him as though he's the next Hitler, and that he needs to "step down". Which is really code word for getting locked away for the rest of his life, or getting butchered.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the country that he never really wanted to rule is getting war-raped by a dozen different armed insurgent groups, each funded as a proxy by numerous regional and global powers, and the media is working day and night to make sure history remembers HIM as the monster.

       That's what I don't get about people discussing this issue as if Assad has any option of stepping down. Not only is he defending a sect of people that ISIS is trying to eliminate but he's also going to be brutally killed if captured.

       Proxy war with Russia just like Ukraine. I believe that the US doesn't want Russia running gas lines through to Europe one way or the other, but refuses to be open about it. The underestimation of the American public's intelligence re:supplying ISIS and Al Qaeda is really insulting, but people keep lapping it up somehow...

       I agree completely that this is the situation, especially with oil and gas. Russian economy thrives on it and there very much is a trade/currency war going on between the two. The US is trying to collapse the RF yet again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is the US doesn't really have any moral leverage with ISIS within the global community, so they have to at least "appear" to be combating them. Russia is calling their bluff and has leverage because everyone "should" be fighting ISIS, including Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when Russia wants to join the fight against ISIS, the US can't really say "sorry, you're not allowed" without raising eyebrows. Especially after the US "ineptitude" (read: intention) is what caused ISIS to form and grow in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       You and I both know the realities of the situation, but what is truly interesting is what events are to come in the next month. Russia's largest sub, which is also the largest in the world, left port on 9/4 and will reach the Syrian coast tomorrow (9/14). It is armed with several nuclear ICBMs and there are reports of

        Russia setting up a forward operating base in Syria (including an airstrip)
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia has already told the US to

       ISIS is not the enemy of our enemy. ISIS is founded, funded, and supplied by the CIA, Israel, and Saudi. ISIS hates the west, supposedly. Then why do they never attack Israel or Saudi? You only have take a step back and look it the situation as a big picture. Who makes money? Who gains land? Who's agenda will succeed when ISIS threat is "stopped". ISIS was invented to fight the west by the west. So the west has a reason to dump mind boggling amounts of money into the military. If you kill enough innocent people, for long enough, they want to fight. Go figure...

       I'm so glad that people see Syria truth. Assad is being demonized in western MSM splurge because he is not a Zionist puppet.
      </p>
      <p>
       At first the rebels were non-Syrian mercenaries. We know now they are ISIS fighting for the Zionist agenda to take out Assad. The MSM is full of shit as per usual. They are only reading from a script that the dumb ass masses will believe as truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assad is defending the nation of Syria from a zionist take over. He is not a murdering freak as MSM likes to portray him as.

       Very true. Unfortunately many people in america have a form of cognitive dissonance. They still think that America is immune to all of the failings of past empires and tyrannical regimes. Totalitarianism, authoritarianism, fascism? That could never happen here! Its sad, especially when you can find evidence of it in the news almost daily :(

       it is for sure nice to sit in front of a computer thousands of miles away from an event and judge things based on what our jewish media feeds us. however, these things are part of the great mid east project sponsored by cia, mossad and many others in which is an attempt to redraw borders to get last piece of oil resources available. so, fall of iraq, libya, egypt, and syria and soon turkiye are all part of this fascist movement. so, enjoy your jew propaganda.

       heres what I don't understand:  for decades now, Russia has had a hands off approach to conflicts around the world. but here, they suddenly want to back a specific pony.  why assad and why now?  are they trying their hand at a proxy war?  I know a lot of russias economy is oil.  maybe that's why?  but then, why not do this with ghadafi instead?  there is something that im either missing here or that just isisnt revealed yet.  can anyone shed any light for me here?  thatd be cool of you.

       It's the naval base they have in syria that is so important, it's their only major one in the middle east. And they aren't really trying their own hand at proxy war, just rebutting up against the US/Israel's attempt at one with ISIS.

       I just read that they are flying tanks in.  I don't know much about their military protocol so as far as I know this could be standard procedure for them and the MSM is only reporting on it because of the shock and fear factor.  but lets say its not normal for Russia to fly tanks in like this:  that seems like a heavy handed way to shore up defenses for a naval base.  a naval destroyer or some kind of battleship would make more sense to me.  tanks to me speaks to anti-personnel or anti-tank situations.  also, did they already have tanks there or is this a new development?  because that could really paint this whole conflict in a different light.

       It's definitely a new development. They are giving direct on ground russian support to the SAA because of their investment. The best defense is a good offense, and they need to take the offensive to ISIS.

       then that definitely complicates things on a much more broad scale.  it seems the west is backing the anti assad rebels to take out both isis and assad, while Russia is backing assad to take out isis.  a clash between Russian assets and western assets would be inevitable.  can anyone post a link that states that this has already happened? (im at work right now and don't have time to look.)

       this oil pipeline to me seems like so many others.  i dont see how it would be of special use to russia.  this pipeline isint something that would bring russia out of the woodwork after all these years just to begin re enacting the cold war.  yes i know oil means $$$$$, but even this pipeline is nowhere near enough for them to act like this.  it may be a part of the reason for their actions but it just strikes me as an added bonus, not the impetus.
