      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The neo-Nazi site Daily Stormer has a long article about Goldberg today, saying that they were duped into carrying articles by him under the alias "Michael Slay". The Stormer article says they've now deleted all of his articles, but a few can be found on archive.is, including one in which he encourages "white nationalists" to infiltrate and recruit new members on reddit. A quick search of reddit shows that the reddit user name associated with "Michael Slay" was
        <a href="/u/European88">
         /u/European88

       have a lot in common with Joshua Goldberg. They will be mourning not so much his loss, as his discovery, because the uncovering of his toxic modus operandi puts the spotlight on THEM.

       purely to attack and discredit another sub (ours), as they have, will use all sort of lies to achieve their objective.

        The Australi Witness persona fooled members of the international intelligence community as well as journalists, with well-known analyst Rita Katz of SITE Intelligence Group saying the "IS supporter" held a "prestige" position in online jihadi circles and was "part of the hard core of a group of individuals who constantly look for targets for other people to attack".

       This is interesting. I assume that she, or someone with a company like hers, was his handler.

       Do I like you?  My RES suite is broken, but aren't you LETSOWNTHENWO, or something like that?  Weren't you banned by a mod for being a suspected troll at some point, or were you just calling everyone shills?  I always kindof assumed you were supposed to be the hyperactive conspiracy theory kid character who smokes too much weed and thinks eveyone is a crisis actor.  You're a character and anyone who sticks too close to a character is probably doing it intentionally.

       You post a ton of content, some of which is good, and I tend to upvote your comments more than I downvote them.

       Ah, now I see, you are full of hate for the "goyim" - likely, you were brought up in the hateful, supremacist religion and culture of Judaism. Likely, you've been brainwashed your entire life to hate non-Jewish people.

       Glad to know you are a supporter of racism, apartheid, and Jewish supremacism.

       You calling other people "racist" is hilarious.

       Choosing to not demonize an entire race of people for the actions of a few in their government is the opposite of racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       By your logic ISIS is justified because of things Bush did, or things Congress does. My government doesn't represent me very well - and I don't know of a government in the world today that does represent its people all that well.
      </p>
      <p>
       You justify hating all Jews because you don't like what the government of Israel does. That's crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all crazy to put words in peoples' mouths and make all kinds of accusations because they are trying to be fair and moderate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I happen to be an atheist who believes religion in almost all forms is a great source of evil in the world. BUT: I also think that your sort of thinking is just as evil. It's just a different, perverted type of religion.

        He was NOT a Troll.
       </strong>

       Saying different shit on the net for the lulz and having a net persona is one thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Telling people to blow stuff up, TO KILL PEOPLE, teaching them how to do it, is quite another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, the jared scumbag was not a kiddie porn watcher - he was a kiddie FUCKER, despite the media (again) trying to downplay this.

      <p>
       I might disagree with you on many things - but I draw the line at violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I might call you names - but I won't raise my hand against you in anger (only a self defense situation is an exception).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an old tactic, used by the various scum (see, there I go using meanie words, natch!) in the alphabet agencies to put a provocator (or two... or more) in there and rile people up to violence, with the provocator being the first one doing the actual violence, beatings, stone throwing and crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is used during popular protests, it is also used on internet forii.
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually the "super-racist", "kill-them-all, who's with me guise?" is a provocator.  Normal people DO NOT go to a violent solution ASAP no matter how passionate they are of a cause, any cause.

       I wonder if commondreams.org would be willing to admit at this point if their "hambaconeggs" troll was the same guy?

      <p>
       If it was the same guy, then the fact they protected his identity must be making them feel pretty guilty, even more so if he had been caught AFTER he successfully encouraged a real terrorist to blow up a crowd of innocent people.

       They wrote in some detail about their communications with the university that hambaconeggs worked for though. They said he was in his mid 30s. I doubt that they would spin such a complex lie to protect his identity.

       Don't even use the numbers as a gauge.   Just vote and know that you're doing a small part.  Get the info out.  The own this site, they manipulate it.  I'm not saying they manipulate the numbers directly I'm just saying you can't trust and you don't need to "trust" the numbers.  You just need to push it because that's the end goal.

       The Jews of Old are no more. The people who currently identify as 'Jewish' have no connection to the original Jews who either all died out or converted to Christianity/Islam. The current Jews are the descendants of a group of people who chose to take up the faith around the turn of the last millennium and then altered and added on to it with the self-serving Talmud becoming the focus of their religion

       What is both funny and disappointing is the way this has been mentioned on twitter and other feeds. This guy is being equated to the GamerGate/Men's Rights trolls. While I suspect this guy didn't do it for the lulz but for some cold hard cash.

       This is not uncommon, many Jews have been caught out painting swastikas and posing as Muslims to incite hatred but I'm not sure I understand the motives for a lot of his posts.  I'm surprised he was arrested instead of offered a job though, the FBI set people up like he did all the time.

       Not naturally.  But a few years of bad luck has led to me being a home body of sorts, who doesn't get out nearly enough.  So to be blunt, maybe a little.  Getting back into the groove of DJing and gigging, so hopefully I can shake it off.

       Yet you fail to realise that without fail, people accused of being jewish are, in fact, acting jewishly or in a typical jewish fashion. It takes
       <em>
        even more
       </em>
       jewishness for a goy to be rightfully accused of being jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why the defensiveness? Why is it that if you people supposedly believe there's nothing wrong about the jews, you're so revolted by the concept of being a jew?

       How do you figure that exactly?  Nobody trolled me.  Some dude
       <strong>
        easily

       trolled you and in doing just as easily exposed the racism which inundates your sub and related subs.

       The best insult you have is try and turn the tables and call out people parodying your racist rhetoric as the racists you really are.

       Ah, now I see, you are full of hate for the "goyim" - likely, you were brought up in the hateful, supremacist religion and culture of Judaism. Likely, you've been brainwashed your entire life to hate non-Jewish people.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are a supporter of the apartheid regime of Jew bigotry in Zionist-occupied Palestine, and you have the nerve to call OTHER people "hateful" and "racist?"

       By your logic ISIS is justified because of things Bush did, or things Congress does. My government doesn't represent me very well - and I don't know of a government in the world today that does represent its people all that well.

       I happen to be an atheist who believes religion in almost all forms is a great source of evil in the world. BUT: I also think that your sort of thinking is just as evil. It's just a different, perverted type of religion.
