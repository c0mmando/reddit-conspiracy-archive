        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The establishment neurolinguistically programmed the term &quot;Conspiracy theorists&quot; to give a negative connotation to those seeking answers outside of official stories. Then, they recently coined the term &quot;denier&quot; for those who do not accept official stories (climate change denier). Now, we can add these terms together and use &quot;conspiracy denier&quot; for one who blindly accepts a mainstream narrative without research or consideration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think &quot;conspiracy denialist&quot; has a more satisfying ring to it, and I also agree with &quot;coincidence theorist&quot;.</p>

<p>However, I think <strong>conspiracy apologist</strong> is even better, because the word apologist has negative connotations anyway, but the expression &quot;conspiracy apologist&quot; also suggests that these individuals are supportive of a real, often criminal phenomenon (and thus complicit).</p>

<p>The active shilling and trolling activities we see on this subreddit could thus be referred to as <strong>conspiracy apologetics</strong></p>

<p>To my mind a &quot;conspiracy apologist&quot; is somebody who knows conspiracies are real, and is excusing them or diminishing their significance, even to the point of outright denying their existence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. I think coining little petty terms to define people doesn&#39;t help. Stooping to the same level as the people that write off conspiracy theorists as nutjobs is counterproductive. Would it not be better to be respectful (even when you receive no respect) when discussing theories with people that disagree? Labeling people won&#39;t change their view, and it only makes us look like children. Just explain your case in an articulate manner, answer all questions to the best of your ability and leave it at that.</p>

Did you have a mental association between them and &quot;tin-foil&quot;?

    <div class="md"><p>And that&#39;s great that you&#39;re aware of this, which brings me back to my initial statements. If someone disagrees with conspiracy theorists, ganging up on them will not change their minds, it will actually have the opposite effect. We can&#39;t stoop to their level; just because they do it to us doesn&#39;t mean we should do it to them. That&#39;s childish. If we want to educate people, we can&#39;t treat them like crap and expect them to see things our way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In all actuality, I didn&#39;t want to speak of 9/11 ever after the event. I was meeting with military personnel the day before and was to meet them on the 11th to decide if I&#39;d join. I decided not, since I was just confused for days. I wanted to ignore it all. It took some time before I looked into it. I assumed everything was under control and that we would get to the bottom of it. It wasn&#39;t until I realized in 2006 that they hadn&#39;t really done shit that I started reading anything. I used to ignore the conspiracy talks. I wouldn&#39;t bash them, but I definitely didn&#39;t have time for them. </p>

<p>I honestly can&#39;t tell you at this point what persuaded me to seek more. I really think it was basically the lack of willingness from the bush admin to actually look into it and be honest. </p>

<p>If you let people get away with their own simple-mindedness and don&#39;t  show contempt and disgust for those who continue to allow these things to happen, then you are as guilty as they are of perpetuating the lies that lead to the deaths of real people.</p>

<p>While you remain civil and get no results, people die.  There needs to be a social cost for those who are blinded by their own bias just as they would impose on you by calling you a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; as a pejorative to marginalize you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On a more serious note, the dark powers that carried out 911 are very likely still in place.  Perhaps they are disappointed that military adventures in the mid-East have not worked out so well but they are as eager as ever to give billions of taxpayer dollars to their defense contractor friends.  If you aren&#39;t worried about another 911, you aren&#39;t thinking.  I have read websites that suggest a briefcase nuke is the next horror of choice.</p>

<p>That story has been going around for years. As I remember it, the Soviet Union developed and built some breifcase nukes in the 1970s. By the time the Soviet Union collapsed, most of the devices were unable to be accounted for. I remember it being mentioned in an article about the general breakdown of Russian nuclear security thanks to the economic problems of the 90s.</p>

<p>No offense, but I rarely see original research here. All I see are talking points parroted from prominent and totally random bloggers and YouTubers. A lot of times I can even track where a poster&#39;s particular beliefs are sourced from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Loving these comments on both sides. I am not a fan of labels, and I always notice when conspiracy deniers bust out terms like &#39;nutjob&#39; to try and win a debate for a point they can&#39;t logically argue against. Only, nowadays, I call those people out on it when they say it in the moment, and I show them how they are being neurolinguistically programmed to avoid the real questions by using these labels... and that&#39;s no way to spread truth, just win a debate in front of someone who doesn&#39;t understand NLP tricks... then they realize... they have been programmed! It sheds light on it and keeps the debate more real. 90% of these conspiracy debates are &#39;won&#39; by someone brandishing these NLP phrases used to discredit people who question the official stories, but when you call them out that namecalling is just a logical fallacy, then it has no effect and even makes them look bad for using it. That was kind of my point here. Inventing and using a term in the opposite way that it has been done for decades by government agencies brings awareness to the situation so the &quot;Asleeple&quot; (i heard this one this week for the first time and like it better than sheeple because it implies that these folks are inherently smart, just  not conscious) can wake up.</p>
