       The establishment neurolinguistically programmed the term "Conspiracy theorists" to give a negative connotation to those seeking answers outside of official stories. Then, they recently coined the term "denier" for those who do not accept official stories (climate change denier). Now, we can add these terms together and use "conspiracy denier" for one who blindly accepts a mainstream narrative without research or consideration.

       I think "conspiracy denialist" has a more satisfying ring to it, and I also agree with "coincidence theorist".
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I think
       <strong>
        conspiracy apologist
       </strong>
       is even better, because the word apologist has negative connotations anyway, but the expression "conspiracy apologist" also suggests that these individuals are supportive of a real, often criminal phenomenon (and thus complicit).
      </p>
      <p>
       The active shilling and trolling activities we see on this subreddit could thus be referred to as
       <strong>
        conspiracy apologetics

       Got a lot of tagging to do as a new subscriber here then. Seems to be a lot of these in certain threads. I don't pretend to know what happened in any historical situation. I wasn't there, all I have are the stories I've been told. But I'm open-minded and I like hearing what are essentially theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't like is "Oh, not this again. There's a private website that debunks everything! See, no conspiracy here!"

       Yes, using RES is pretty crucial on this sub - tagging is a very effective way to track the apologists.

       Interesting find. In this context they are using the term to mean Akroyd is a "conspiracy theory promulgator", which is quite different.
      </p>
      <p>
       To my mind a "conspiracy apologist" is somebody who knows conspiracies are real, and is excusing them or diminishing their significance, even to the point of outright denying their existence.

       Or just call them what they truly are (without using expletives) "coincidence theorists". Because they think all the anomalies in the "official" interpretations of the events of that day are all "just a coincidence".

       You're supposed to kill 'em with kindness. I wouldn't call anyone who doesn't see it my way a derogatory term in any sense of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply state, "well I'm sorry you don't see it my way, but give it some time"

       The more courteous you are, the more someone may think about what you said. Its a shame, because the nature of all people is to manipulate. Its what we all do. But you don't want to manipulate people about this, because you may appear deceitful.

       I agree with you. I think coining little petty terms to define people doesn't help. Stooping to the same level as the people that write off conspiracy theorists as nutjobs is counterproductive. Would it not be better to be respectful (even when you receive no respect) when discussing theories with people that disagree? Labeling people won't change their view, and it only makes us look like children. Just explain your case in an articulate manner, answer all questions to the best of your ability and leave it at that.

       It likely has, before you became aware of the programming. Before you started looking into conspiracy theories, what was your opinion of "conspiracy theorists"? Did you have a mental association between them and "tin-foil"? Once you become aware of the verbal manipulation, it loses power over you, but before you are conscious of it, it will have, sometimes subtle, effects on how you think.

       And that's great that you're aware of this, which brings me back to my initial statements. If someone disagrees with conspiracy theorists, ganging up on them will not change their minds, it will actually have the opposite effect. We can't stoop to their level; just because they do it to us doesn't mean we should do it to them. That's childish. If we want to educate people, we can't treat them like crap and expect them to see things our way.

       In all actuality, I didn't want to speak of 9/11 ever after the event. I was meeting with military personnel the day before and was to meet them on the 11th to decide if I'd join. I decided not, since I was just confused for days. I wanted to ignore it all. It took some time before I looked into it. I assumed everything was under control and that we would get to the bottom of it. It wasn't until I realized in 2006 that they hadn't really done shit that I started reading anything. I used to ignore the conspiracy talks. I wouldn't bash them, but I definitely didn't have time for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly can't tell you at this point what persuaded me to seek more. I really think it was basically the lack of willingness from the bush admin to actually look into it and be honest.

       If you let people get away with their own simple-mindedness and don't  show contempt and disgust for those who continue to allow these things to happen, then you are as guilty as they are of perpetuating the lies that lead to the deaths of real people.

       While you remain civil and get no results, people die.  There needs to be a social cost for those who are blinded by their own bias just as they would impose on you by calling you a "conspiracy theorist" as a pejorative to marginalize you.

       On a more serious note, the dark powers that carried out 911 are very likely still in place.  Perhaps they are disappointed that military adventures in the mid-East have not worked out so well but they are as eager as ever to give billions of taxpayer dollars to their defense contractor friends.  If you aren't worried about another 911, you aren't thinking.  I have read websites that suggest a briefcase nuke is the next horror of choice.

       That story has been going around for years. As I remember it, the Soviet Union developed and built some breifcase nukes in the 1970s. By the time the Soviet Union collapsed, most of the devices were unable to be accounted for. I remember it being mentioned in an article about the general breakdown of Russian nuclear security thanks to the economic problems of the 90s.

       What do you think words are? They're simply labels for things and phenomena we experience in this world, allowing us to communicate with other people. Some have become thought-terminating cliches, turning people's minds off to any real critical thought. These can be problematic, or we can understand the psychology behind them and try to "culture jam" the program they have written.

      <p>
       No offense, but I rarely see original research here. All I see are talking points parroted from prominent and totally random bloggers and YouTubers. A lot of times I can even track where a poster's particular beliefs are sourced from.

       Yeah, a theorist implies that you're putting forth your own theories and independent research and

       investigation into them like a theoretical physicist would. I don't think I've done the necessary work to earn that title.

       Public information analyst... yeah, I think I've looked into enough publicly available stuff and spouted my opinion on it to call myself that.

       Why would I want to insult someone for having a different point of view than me?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like they punched me, in which case I might call them a jerk. What are they doing which I don't like, disagreeing with me? If I think a particular rock is blue, and they think it's red, should I call them a rock denialist? Nah. Either I'd try explaining my viewpoint, find some evidence that they can look over on their own time to maybe change their viewpoint, or find something else to do. Or (and I know this isn't a popular option) I might ask why they think the rock is red.

       Loving these comments on both sides. I am not a fan of labels, and I always notice when conspiracy deniers bust out terms like 'nutjob' to try and win a debate for a point they can't logically argue against. Only, nowadays, I call those people out on it when they say it in the moment, and I show them how they are being neurolinguistically programmed to avoid the real questions by using these labels... and that's no way to spread truth, just win a debate in front of someone who doesn't understand NLP tricks... then they realize... they have been programmed! It sheds light on it and keeps the debate more real. 90% of these conspiracy debates are 'won' by someone brandishing these NLP phrases used to discredit people who question the official stories, but when you call them out that namecalling is just a logical fallacy, then it has no effect and even makes them look bad for using it. That was kind of my point here. Inventing and using a term in the opposite way that it has been done for decades by government agencies brings awareness to the situation so the "Asleeple" (i heard this one this week for the first time and like it better than sheeple because it implies that these folks are inherently smart, just  not conscious) can wake up.

      <p>
       Not exactly. "9/11 denier" is not a thing, because although conspiracy theorists believe all sort of stupid shit about 9/11, they don't deny it happened. The term "denier" is applied to people who don't believe in a very real event, like climate change or the holocaust.
