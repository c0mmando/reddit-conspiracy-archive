<p>And that the people who made us (see: like, every religion ever) interbred with us, fought battles for and against us and eventually dipped out pretty much completely because they couldn&#39;t deal with the mess they&#39;d made or agree on whether or not humanity should be exterminated, left alone, aided or if we should have ever been jump-started in the first place.</p>

<p>Also that the &quot;elites&quot; of the world are fully aware of human origins and are a bunch of unrelenting shit bags because they think their supposed bloodlines will save them if and when &quot;the gods return&quot; and they&#39;ll be able to hand Earth back over to our forefathers for whatever purposes they may have, if any, and the &quot;Illuminati&quot; will be able to sit pretty in their gilded cages, maybe get some back patting and atta-boys from the people they&#39;re trying to impress.</p>

<p>And maybe all the theories and rumors about government cooperation with extraterrestrials is a thing.</p>

<p>ridiculousness aside, if you were a super intelligent, space dwelling race, or maybe just a singular company owner and you needed something from a planet, a natural resource of some type.... How would you get it? </p>

<p>My money is on gene-splicing the best natural form on the planet because it is already adapted to breathing mostly nitrogen and a bit of oxygen (which you may not be) and adding a bit of yourself to it to make it smarter. Then have them do the work. Profit.</p>

<p>If I were a super race, learning about intelligence, morals, thought patterns, and hell, even unique philosophy, inventions, art, music and novels, through a genetically engineered race would be reason enough to run the experiment labeled the Human Race on Planet Earth.</p>

<p>They might even have shielded us from ever being able to contact other civilization including other experimental races, which is one solution to the Fermi Paradox.  A bonus would be the extraction of natural resources, but that is obviously not necessary for such advanced races.</p>

<p>So yea, I never mentioned &quot;slaves&quot;... I&#39;d prefer &quot;experiment.&quot;</p>

<p>I used psychology.  I didn&#39;t tell them what they were about to see, or that it had anything to do with 9/11.  I just showed them the video and asked them what they thought it was.  Everyone agreed it was a &quot;controlled demolition&quot;.  Then I told them the circumstances---that it happened about 5:20 on the afternoon of 9/11, 100 yards away from where the twin towers fell.</p>

<p>Since they had already agreed and admitted it was controlled demolition, they couldn&#39;t back away from it.  It made their heads spin, but they got over it.  And eventually they did their own research.</p>

Even without direct evidence such as a body or poop, the mark such a creature would have on the environment would be noticed. We know how far salmon protein makes it into the forest. Every year new species of plants and animals are found. Mostly through the work of biology students throughout the continent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it seems that Bigfoot people like to keep this alive. 1929 was the first capture of a living specimen but they were classified in 1869 and being in the Chinese mountains made it a myth in the West. </p>

<p>But we also have fossils of pandas showing their evolution over millions of years. So unless you believe Bigfoot are some super elusive homo giganticus  then we still have not one shred of evidence (other than Billy Bob&#39;s word) for any such animal. Which is twice the size of a panda.</p>

<p>British people thought elephants were a myth at one time, fanciful stories from sailors and the like. But I would like to think we are a little better than that now.</p>

Probably to the point of giving all sorts of LSD to the astronauts so even they believed it.

<p>The motive to do such a thing is easy. Up to that point, we lost literally every achievement of the space race to the russians. All of the sudden he hit a grand slam to the moon, which the russians (space champions) have always said couldn&#39;t be done.</p>

<p>Aliens are demons and fallen angels.  They&#39;ve always been here.  They deceived ancient populations into believing they were star people from outer space.  They&#39;re doing it again today.

Governmental officials and the people behind them that really hold the power participate in occult rituals to gain knowledge and instruction from them.  They want to make the world believe in aliens and the idea that all religions are one so they can return to the physical realm as extraterrestrial saviors and preach that we can become gods ourselves by following them.

    <div class="md"><p>We live in a post fossil fuel world since the 1980s and oil is being dumped on the market as rapidly as possible to maximize profits for as long as possible. This explains why oil is being dumped in mass in investment portfolios. Allowing for a smooth economic transition is almost impossible and why so many wealthy, and the government, are planning accordingly for massive civil unrest.</p>

<p>In the decades to come water will become the next precious resource displacing oil from this mantel. This is why the oil industry fights so hard for the right to poison water supplies. Processed and safe potable water for everything from agriculture to drinking will become progressively more expensive as time goes on. CEOs, like that at Nestle, already see the writing on the wall and have declared clean drinking water is not a human right. The market players are already taking position.</p>
