    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying the official story has to be true, but the explanation that it was a missile seems to be a fairly reasonable explanation. There are videos all over Youtube of missiles malfunctioning and spinning incredibly quickly in one stationary location in the air. The exhaust pours out of the missile as it spins, and the result is a spiral of missile exhaust that looks very much like that Norway spiral. Look it up and you&#39;ll see what I mean.</p>

<p>The hole &quot;grows&quot; because the material the rocket is venting is being thrown away from the axis on which the rocket is traveling.  Once it runs out of material to vent the &quot;hole&quot; appears and it appears to grow.

<p>What happens after it stops spiraling is that the rocket runs out of fuel.  There is nothing left to vent.  The hole appears as the material in the spiral continues to travel away from the rocket, as it had always been doing as the spiral was forming.</p>

<p>Both are being illuminated by the sunlight.  The event is happening nearly due east, several hundred miles above the surface of the earth at dawn.  The rising sun is below the horizon from the point of view of those photographing it (though you can see the faint twilight of the sunrise just appearing on the horizon) but the sun is well above the horizon from the point of view of the rocket and the material that it is venting.</p>

<p>The whole thing is actually a very beautiful display of some <em>very simple</em> orbital mechanics.  </p>

<p>Both are being illuminated by the sunlight.  The event is happening nearly due east, several hundred miles above the surface of the earth at dawn.  The rising sun is below the horizon from the point of view of those photographing it (though you can see the faint twilight of the sunrise just appearing on the horizon) but the sun is well above the horizon from the point of view of the rocket and the material that it is venting.</p>

<p>The whole thing is actually a very beautiful display of some <em>very simple</em> orbital mechanics.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not explaining anything... Sharp blue lines do not simply appear because &quot;the sun is in the right position&quot;. I still very much doubt you&#39;re talking about the same blue lines I&#39;m taking about, ie NOT the white spiral that is seemingly formed by the exhaust.</p>

<p>There is no mechanism to make the spiral grow from just rocket exhaust, not before it runs out and not after it runs out of fuel. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t think of the spiral as an &quot;object&quot;, think of it as being made up of particles.  as the rocket rotates it is throwing off those particles in a straight line away from the rocket.  Because the rocket is rotating it is creating a trail of particles in a spiral shape.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing there to propel what is essentially vapor in air.</p>

<p>The vapor is not in the air, it is in a vacuum, it is far above the atmosphere.  That is an important thing to realize.  Because it is in a vacuum, it really simplifies the whole problem.  The momentum of the rotation in the rocket is what propels it away from it&#39;s source. (And the venting itself is what is creating the rotation!)  It is in a vacuum so there is nothing to <em>stop</em> it from being propelled away from it&#39;s source.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m not explaining very well.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, I&#39;m not trying to say that they are being created by the sun, merely illuminated by it.  If this rocket launch was done in the middle of the night it would have all fallen in the earths shadow and we never would have seen it.  As it happens it was in the perfect location to be launched out of the shadow of the earth and is perfectly illuminated by the sun.</p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about both the white spiral and the blue helical beam.  If you want to delve in to the blue beam then call it something other than just &quot;the spiral&quot; because most people will assume you are talking about the white spiral.   The mechanism between both the white spiral and the blue beam are essentially the same with the difference that the white stuff is being chucked out from the side and the blue stuff is being chucked out the bottom (and as such doesn&#39;t have as much momentum imparted to it, so it creates a much smaller spiral.)</p>

<p>If a rocket like this is venting something it will tend to impart a rotational momentum on the spacecraft, so it&#39;s inevitable that it will create a spiral.  The same thing happened to Apollo 13 when it began venting on it&#39;s trip to the moon.  If you want a demonstration of how this can happen fill up a bathtub with water, take a can of soda pop, shake it up a lot, stab a hole in it and throw it in the water.  It will begin venting the soda pop and more importantly it will spin.</p>
