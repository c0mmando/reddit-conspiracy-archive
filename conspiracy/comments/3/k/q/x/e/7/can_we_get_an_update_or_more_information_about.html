    <div class="md"><p>Searching through these files I found a grant in the amount of $14,250 from AE911Truth.org to the 911 Information Foundation in 2013.  The stated purpose of the grant is &#39;support for complementary organization.&#39;</p>

<p>Is this the argument being presented?</p>

<p>Edit: Going back to 2011, I was only able to locate one other grant in the amount of $2,430 in 2012.  It&#39;s not listed who received the grant as it was under the $5,000 threshold.  I&#39;ve not yet located the 2014 filling.  If you know where I could find it could you shoot me a link?  please.</p>

<p>Yeah. My partner at 9/11 Blogger has connections with AE911Truth. Or had them for awhile, not currently. So there have been mixed finances in that regard. I personally have not and have not personally benefited from any relationship with AE911Truth or 9/11 Blogger.</p>

<p>Plus, a single link to a T-shirt in the AE911Truth shop on a thread about the subject is going to be cause to get rid of me? The allegations that I am taking bribes from anyone or have used alternate accounts on here are false.
In fact the &quot;9/11 Information Foundation&quot; is something that is strictly run by Justin and I have no relationship with that whatsoever, so this is a real stretch in my opinion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firstly I don&#39;t know how the word bribes was ever introduced into this issue, those weren&#39;t my words.</p>

<p>The quote above is from orangutan.</p>

<p>The problem arises when users demanding an AE911 litmus test when deciding which mods to keep and which ones to get rid of are consistently protected by orangutan.  When witch hunts asserting that I&#39;m a Nazi (which certainly isn&#39;t true) are protected as &quot;legitimate criticisms&quot; when they clearly violate our rules here.  When users disrupting AMAs are protected and their deleted comments are restored because they keep bringing up the fake gage ama over and over again even though that mistake has been apologized for and our verification process for amas has been streamlined to guard against such bullshit from happening again.</p>

<p>Then stuff like this</p>

<p>Its too much of a conflict of interest to ignore in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the jist, as far as i can make out.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Flytape thinks he turned into some sort of detective and got Orangutan&#39;s 1099s via some sort of public available method, this can not be correct because 1099s can&#39;t be obtained by the public, for a whole bunch or reasons.</p>

<p>With this non-information in hand Flytape informs AATA, who instead of dealing with this in modmail, literally pisses his pants and makes a thread making unsubstantiated allegations against another mod and then takes the madness one step further and actually de-mods Orangutan.</p>

<p>This rightfully results in AATA having all his mod permissions revoked and hopefully will be removed as moderator from here permanently </p>

<p>Let&#39;s us not forget that AE911Truth, is a 501c3 non profit educational organization and a look over Orangutan&#39;s post history reveals that anything that he posted in regard AE911Truth, was all publicly available information anyway.</p>

<p>This begs the question, why would a non-profit pay someone to post there own information to a fucking subreddit on the internet? Let&#39;s disregard the fact there are literally thousands of us who would do that for FREE anyway.</p>
