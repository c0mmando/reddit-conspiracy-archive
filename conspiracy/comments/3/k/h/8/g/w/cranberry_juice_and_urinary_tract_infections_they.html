        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>EDIT &#39;&#39; not looking for a cure!!!
 this cranberry rant is about the geopolitical ramifications of the historical past and present of marketing bitter, inedible berries that grow in cheap north american swamp land as a &#39;medicine&#39; to sexually active north american women... 
cranberries are proven inneffective to this potentially lethal infection yet extremely prevalent problem in young women.., yet still widely toted as a remedy. whats the deal? i think its a capitalist scheme and clever and totally evil and sexist.</p>

<p>Seriously-- marketing to women ashamed of the sexual nature of their bodies is easy peasy..</p>

<p>so i&#39;m going to just assume you have never come in contact with a urinary tract infection-- they are as painful as they are common in sexually active women, and women who wipe backwards. i don&#39;t do that though.
. basically, bacteria from your colon may get into your pee hole and the infection ravages and burns. it can damage your kidneys, make you pee blood and ultimately die. its not an std. go read wiki for a better description.</p>

<p>Some women like me get sick so often, and must take antibiotics every time they have sex. Sometimes, its just a result of the shape and size of your urethra. A UTI is extremely painful. you can&#39;t walk, you can&#39;t go to work. Even laying down or in a tub you will cry.</p>

<p>it used to be called &#39;the honeymooner&#39;s disease&#39; because people before the sexual revolution were more careful and more often waited until marriage to have sex.</p>

<p>Now with casual sex normal a mundane thing, uti&#39;s are very common. you either go to a clinic for antibiotics, or you drink insane amounts of fluids trying to flush out the build up of e coli in your urethra.</p>

<p>so then, Everyone in choir tells you &#39;CRANBERRY JUICE&#39; without hesitation. like they are calling on a goddamn saint for you to pray to. its medieval.
but its been proven over and over that
 cranberry juice 
is not effective.
but why oh why on earth does everyone tell you to drink it?</p>

<p>as a chronic sufferer of honeymooner&#39;s disease, I totally don&#39;t do cranberry juice anymore.
 it sucks, its expensive, doesn&#39;t work, and you only really load up on calories, put money into ocean spray... even with the hippy dippy cranberry Acid, which also is more burning. maybe it burns the bacteria in the pee hole off. nice image. not scientific though.. i like the idea of natural, that markets well to women, but... the scientific community has run many trials and its really negligeable and therefore denounced as treatment.. SO</p>

<p>why is cranberry juice still on a pedestal and why is that pedestal even there in the first place??</p>

<p>..i am figuring now, that from a purely economic perspective, cranberries are an example of a new world fruit that grows in abundance. 
Some guy in the course of capitalist colonialism (yes the world does work like mad men) says.. &#39;hey we gotta find a way to sell all these really fuckin&#39; bitter berries....&#39; </p>

<p>cranberry juice is sold as a tonic to women who are having sex, and suffering insane amounts of pain with their life threatening sickness as a direct result of making love. (imagine for a sec the world pre antibiotic)
why not market cranberry juice ....to ...vulnerable people.. umm...women who may be in danger of death from indulging in sex?</p>

<p>in the pain of a UTI, (which in my personal exp. ranks but second under a bad episode of Lyme&#39;s disease), you will throw money at whatever you&#39;ve been told... </p>

<p>tldr; fuck cranberry juice as &#39;&#39;medicine&#39;&#39;. its not. its juice.
they seriously had to sell berries that grew in cheap New World swampland, and they capitalized off of women&#39;s illness and subsequent shame of sex and their body, which has inhibited us from questioning medicine... and it still goes on. </p>

<p>seriously UTIs are soo common, its the only reason even the shittiest grocery store ever keeps it in stock. 
the fucking guy at the counter in a store even makes a sorrowful face at me and whispers &#39;get well&#39; when I bought it.
Everyone knows what its for, but its not actually medicine. </p>

I never really had a problem with UTIs but I have friends who did - they drank a lot of diet soda and not much water and often got antibiotics, kinda wondered if there was a connection. I just drink a crapload of water if I feel a twinge and it seems to nip it in the bud, so to speak, hahaha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>im not asking how to treat a UTI. 
i&#39;m really just questioning why cranberry juice, if totally ineffective, has been marketed and recommended even by doctors for so long. I suspect it has to do with how cranberry crop was abundant in new world bog land, which was otherwise worthless. owners of these plots of land had to find ways to sell the inedible, bitter berry, so why not as &#39;medicine&#39;... to an target group (sexually active women who are ill as a result of dirty sex, but not necessaily. you can see where this is going) If I was born 100 years ago, id be dead.
the less effective the medicine, the more you sell to a fool </p>

    <div class="md"><p>cranberry juice does NOT make a UTI go away.  anyone who tells you it does is mislead.  what it does do is coat the lining of your urethra with an acidic coating.  may types of bacteria don&#39;t like to stick to things that are coated in acid, so they cant colonize easily.  is it possible that you have been trying to use it to cure a UTI instead of prevent one?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree!! and yet l&#39;ve talked to many nurses, doctors, and yes friends, and many make the recommendation to guzzle Ocean spray and i look at them like, &#39;why dont people get it?&#39;
 im concerned about how and why the heck even professionals worship this berry and where on earth did this inacurrate claim come from... if it is empirically invalid.
 its a conspiracy about conquest of exploiting a crop that grows on marshland, (owning a bog is otherwise land worth nothing). i would say very clever and suave way of making money is selling inedible fruit as a cure all for &#39;female trouble&#39;. and no one seems to have made a fuss about it. most people don&#39;t even know how a UTI feels, so they dont know what it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah you have a fabulous point. i would like to put ocean spray out of business because im 90 percent sure that is their fortune.
 you can find cranberry juice in even the scuzziest gas station here in north america. i swear its because there is always a desperate lady who had sex the night before, tried to follow uti protocol, and then wishing she was dead. i dont know anyone who just drinks it for fun. i swear the bottle is always dusty when you pick it up too.. anyways that girl was me............</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be the change you want to see. Like stereotypes (sadly) there is a base of truth to them. Research 18th/19th/20th century cranberry tonics/tea mixes and see what you come up with. Natural is always better than artificial and there has to be truth behind it, or the story wouldn&#39;t have been preserved (no pun intended). I&#39;m not a female, but I can imagine if you found out what our ancestors knew, you&#39;d could help a lot of people and make a few bucks. Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the unsweetened natural cranberry acid you get at the health food store is also defunct. you&#39;re better off drinking water. this type of juice would have been like my ancestors tonics.
what absolutely Nobody tells you to do in life or on the wealth internet babble is to chew the berries raw-- raw food is more powerful as a supplement than processed, if we&#39;re talking berries as medication talk.
which also leads me to believe its a conspiracy to sell more manufactured industrial products at the expense of women&#39;s health. .. remember that before antibiotics in the 30s, women died of this type of infection.</p>

<p>We live in a society that is the exact opposite of the &quot;patriarchal puritanism&quot; of leftist&#39;s fantasies.</p>

<p>we aren&#39;t at &#39;dove commercial&#39; level of body acceptance, just cause those dove commercials were manufactured.
Also with this post, i&#39;m talking about history of women here, so i&#39;m more interested in the past-- pre dove soap commercial times-- women were super repressed and not taught much and the lady orgasm was fiction.. 
-- people in the 19th century between Europe and the Americas, like us, were trying to sell anything for any reason in the new world so... this is my shot in the dark on cranberries as fake medicine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cranberry juice, sweetened or unsweetened (reference: go wiki cranberry juice) is an item recommended to women by friends, nurses, and doctors (maybe more so in North America since the berry is from here). It&#39;s ineffective yet historically marketed for medicinal properties, just as Lysol was for douching!! (Google the ads!!) and smoking was considered a healthy past time. Anyways cranberry juice, in my experience and research is being added to the list of crap marketed to unethically a cure to people (in this case, the tenure of this folk remedy spans way back to sexually active young women, pre antibiotic, pre sexual revolution in at least North America). A bacterial infection, before the 1930s could kill you. It wasn&#39;t marketed to women as Lysol was for douching, but it&#39;s another item women traditionally have used in hopes it would cure them. Women&#39;s medicine is insane and you could do worse than check out what was happening in the Victorian era. That should not still be happening. Lastly, if you don&#39;t understand the prevalence of this remedy, just go read internet literature... Every lady discusses the validity just as men are hoping that taping a garlic clove to their nutsack will cure what shameful growths ail them. Certain medicinal dialogues, especially women&#39;s sexual health really stay on the DL, so of course you have no idea what I&#39;m talking about until you get a girlfriend or close female friend who discloses it. Buying juice as medicine should be officially debunked by now, but it&#39;s not a big enough issue (it&#39;s a woman&#39;s problem) to get attention which leads to me to believe it&#39;s a huge conflict of interest with ocean spray and smuckers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A-ha... an old wives tale that originated where though? is my question..... I think it has economical underpinnings in Supply and Demand in the US and Canada. There was a large supply of a bitter berry (I grew up in this territory; seas of red and overwhelming.. the Atlantic Canadian land is poor, salty soil land economically good for nothing else-- and that is the root of the equation!), and then we have it paired with a large demand to solve a very painful bacterial infection-- extremely common!</p>

<p>I believe that like food items in the USDA food pyramid, there is a constant corporate agenda to push the consumer to buy domestic produce (manufactured juice, corn products, dairy,
 products, tobacco, beef raised in factory farm) in quantities that are higher than practical for a consumer, but WONDERFUL for the unreglemented expansion of a capitalist country&#39;s economy !</p>

<p>So finding ways to market  domestic produce to trusting consumer is the name of the game (if you can make a product that generated routine or dependence, you win the game!). An the best part, is that as a corporate lord, back then in particular, you arent held responsible for even telling a consumer a scientifically valid reason to consume your product-- so, Cranberry juice is sold as medicine for bladder infections... When really it&#39;s consuming the water that is solving the problem. Water is free and it solves the disease! lol. Can you see how this is kind of unethical ?</p>

<p>So I am proposing that it&#39;s a corporate conspiracy-- a ploy to sell one man&#39;s bulk of bitter fruit. </p>

<p>Business and landowners are both men and women-- (all chromosomes are involved here). So I am proposing a capitalist and geopolitical new world theory -- </p>

<p>Cranberries are a new world (meaning not European, thus &#39;discovered&#39; by landed Europeans in the Americas, and subsequently appropriated into the North American capitalist shit show)... Cranberries grow in bog and marshland-- the cheapest (or crappiest!) land to own. White businessowner men CREATED A DEMAND (fabricating demands and baiting a consumer is all economics 101 btw, not me being dark).... for cranberry juice by graduating it to the world of medicine (lovely Vaseline has a similar story-- &quot;What do we do with petroleum byproduct building up on our factory machines?&quot; &quot;sell it as a salve for burns!&quot; and boom; it&#39;s a wrap. Sometimes a cure-all like Vaseline works, other times it becomes... an old &#39;mans&#39; tale! Cause an old man&#39;s tale can equally be simply a tale of fraudulence or quackery)</p>

<p>So it&#39;s 2015, and Smuckers and Ocean Spray is subliminally sold largely as medicine to women. (anyone with a UTI will tell you it&#39;s the number 1 home remedy everyone tells you). 
It is only normal that as an XY, you may not know this because E Coli buildup in one&#39;s urethra isn&#39;t exactly water cooler talk... just like hemorrhoids, or your cute psoriasis flakes. </p>

<p>This just happens to be gendered, and I hate to be that guy, but I don&#39;t see why this is XX when this also includes the medical community and the history of corporate america too, which is to this day still pretty XY. It&#39;s all good. Also, I&#39;m mostly interested in information travelling in the cosmos, and why not include all the genderz?!! 
I&#39;m just saying that supply and demand fit too well into this.. and it&#39;s totally plausible as old fashioned conspiracy theory talk.
 i posted this theory to see people discuss the Theory instead of tell me how to cure it, because we aready know that.
 I don&#39;t have a urinary tract infection. </p>

<p>Will cranberry juice cure bladder infections?
Cranberry juice is a folk remedy for bladder infections. Research has found it effective only to prevent such infections, but not to cure them. (Kilbourne 1991; Kilbourne 1986; Sobota) In one study, 4-6 ounces of a commercial cranberry juice daily significantly prevented infections in a nursing home population (Kilbourne, 1991). Another study used doses ranging from 5 to 20 ounces a day.</p>

<p>But I guess it&#39;s easier to rail against the capitalist patriarchy than to look for the answer, eh comrade?</p>
