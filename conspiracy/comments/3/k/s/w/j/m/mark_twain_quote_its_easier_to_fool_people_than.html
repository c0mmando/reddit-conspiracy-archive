    <div class="md"><p>There was a very famous book published in the 1950&#39;s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Prophecy_Fails"><em>When Prophecy Fails</em></a>. Two sociologists infiltrated a cult that believed the world was going to end on a certain date. When that date passed, they were astonished to find the beliefs among the cult members grew even stronger.</p>

<p>I would point out, however, that this idea goes both ways--many people on this subreddit will fight for what they &quot;know&quot; to be true against all evidence. Those that buy official explanations are just as certain as you are--remember that.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps.  When it is sufficiently developed into super ego, however, it can be an effective boon toward a decent and flourishing being and, ultimately, civilization.  This is, of course, the great task we have before us, however - to develop our fledgling, self-interested egos into the type of super egos that can help not only ourselves, but our world and fellow beings as well.  As such, it is not so much that the ego is the most perverse mechanism of humanity.  It is that an overbearing ego is a hallmark of a very underdeveloped species - which we most definitely are at the current moment of our evolutionary progress.  If we do not kill ourselves first, that ego can eventually evolve into a properly balanced superego, and it can then find its proper place amongst our civilization not as &quot;the most perverse mechanism&quot; that it justifiably seems like now, but as a tool that can be used to cause us to continue becoming even better, more advanced beings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright I did you a favour and read the conclusion of that study and the scientific american journal and part of the Slate article. The scientific american journal was pretty useless. No sources at all. Just an opinion. The study confirmed that scientific minded people are more open-minded on social media than conspiracy theorists.. I mean. Yeah. Duh?</p>

<p>The general gist I&#39;m getting from the slate article is that it&#39;s kind of a snowball effect. Believing in one conspiracy theory opens the floodgate for others which can get you in a very tunnelvisioned mindset of accepting everything that confirms your worldview. Fair enough. That&#39;s completely human. I&#39;ll admit that if you&#39;re interested in conspiracies preserving your (actual) critical thinking is important. The danger in generalizing everyone with an actual critical attitude towards official narratives into one pile of conspiracy nuts still exists.</p>

<p>Aliens aren&#39;t secretly in charge of our world. Hollywood stars are probably not illuminati puppets. Cancer is not made up to make money and eating vegetables won&#39;t cure it. However the CIA has had (though hopefully ineffective) brainwash programs. The US has commited false flags to overthrow governments more than once in history (as a well documented fact) and US politics are based on manipulation by freudian psychology. There are some super rich people with doubtful agendas in the world. One conspiracy theory =\= the other. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a sad fact that there are cover ups, we are being lied to. Not all the time. Not by everyone, but it happens. You can&#39;t look for truth without finding a lot of bullshit, no matter where you look. Engage your critical thinking, whatever you read. That&#39;s a concept everyone should be reminded of as much as possible. I&#39;ll agree with that.</p>

I do agree with your point, it applies to all people though. &quot;Leftists are dumb, we are smart&quot; &quot;Rightists are assholes, we are compassionate&quot; &quot;Conspiracy theorists are nutjobs, fuck yeah &#39;murica&quot;

<p>it&#39;s all a grand conspiracy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, yes and no.  Not EVERYTHING is a conspiracy, but that doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t in fact things going on behind the scenes that you aren&#39;t aware of.  I would <strong>love</strong> to be as certain as you are. I would love to believe that everything takes place and happens just the way the state and corporate media says it does. But the proof is in the pudding, man. History has shown time and time again that there are many many things we are lied to about, and many many things held out of the light from public scrutiny.</p>

<p>Now, what I find interesting is that people like you can drink the juice so damn easily <strong>without</strong> questioning anything along the way. </p>

<p>Being a skeptic is actually very hard work. It is met with opposition from the status quo (such as yourself) at every turn.  Personal attacks through fear of social alientation is <strong>all you have</strong> for a defense against those that would step out of line to challenge the norms, values and the beliefs manufactured and/or shaped by the corporate, and state narrative for nearly everything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s just one big grand Jewish conspiracy to silence the truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could be. Maybe. Maybe not. You don&#39;t know for a <strong>matter of fact</strong>  if it is or it isn&#39;t.  People only know (you included) what they&#39;ve been told, shown, what they&#39;ve read, watched, or experienced, etc. in their lives on this planet. You go ahead and come on down from your ivory tower whenever you&#39;re ready there, bud.</p>

<p>Perhaps, just perhaps someone has done more groundwork on certain matters than you have. <strong>Who? What? When? Where? Why?</strong></p>

<p>These are questions that should be asked ANYTIME information comes across your lap, <strong>regardless</strong>of who or where it comes from, or what you looking at. Critical thinking is imperative.</p>

<p>As I state again, being a skeptic is hard work. And understanding what is or isn&#39;t reliable information is all part of the work of being a thinking human being.</p>

<p>Now, to say that EVERYTHING is a conspiracy would be overreaching.  But to say that there are NO conspiracies, or there is NOTHING hidden from the public, would be just plain stupid. </p>

<p>That&#39;s just stupid.</p>

<p>The two may or may not be mutually exclusive, depending on the person. There is no strict black and white, and they are absolutely interrelated. It&#39;s called linguistics. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics</a></p>

<p>Here let me help you out here, as you don&#39;t seem to actually know what the terms mean.</p>

<p><strong>skep·tic/ˈskeptik/</strong></p>

<p>noun</p>

<p>-a person inclined to question or doubt all accepted opinions.</p>

<p>-an ancient or modern philosopher who denies the possibility of knowledge, or even rational belief, in some sphere.</p>

<p><strong>conspiracy theory</strong></p>

<p>-an explanatory hypothesis that accuses two or more persons, a group, or an organization of having caused or covered up, through secret planning and deliberate action, an event or situation which is typically taken to be illegal or harmful.</p>

<p>Yawn.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now if you want to become an actual skeptic I can help you maybe, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clearly, you are the one that needs help here, kid.</p>

<p>&quot;Actual skeptic.&quot; You don&#39;t even know what that means. You pigeon hole anyone that questions the status quo as a conspiracy theorist but not a skeptic.  </p>

<p>See: above definitions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but what you are my friend is not a skeptic and I learned that after going on your post history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah? Read all 25,000 comment karma worth of posts? I would actually like to see that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing infuriates me more than conspiracy theorists on here claiming to be skeptics, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am a skeptic. If that ties to conspiracies now and again, so be it. Skepticism holds no bounds. I think that&#39;s what you don&#39;t get.... And probably never will.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>don&#39;t you dare compare yourself to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Baaaaahahaha. Wouldn&#39;t dream of it. </p>

<p>Although life probably would be much easier to live like you do, Forrest Gump.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not a skeptic, a conspiracy theorist is not a god damn skeptic.</p>

<p>There is literally a skeptic sub on reddit that makes fun of this sub and people like you, it isn&#39;t because skeptics consider themselves conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>If you went where the scientific evidence took you, then you wouldn&#39;t be a truther.</p>

<p>Yes. They are. By the very nature of language, they are. It cannot be denied for it would be a paradox.</p>

<p>Actually, I find the opposite true. You think 911 happened exactly the way the government says it did. </p>

<p>Whereas, I don&#39;t. There are too many holes and coincidences for the official story to be true. Any skeptic would see that.   Period.</p>
