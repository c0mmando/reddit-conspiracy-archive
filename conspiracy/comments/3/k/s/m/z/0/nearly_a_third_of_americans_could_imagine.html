       Just wanted to point out and help your logic: if people are not aware (of the MIC) then they cannot forget - the act of forgetting requires the knowledge. Because your general concept is acceptable, you should have the right justification. Sorry to be an ass...

       There is this ridiculous fantasy that just about everyone in US is united against the federal govt, that somehow the problem is just 537 people in Congress and 2 guys in the White House and 9 people in the Supreme Court.  There is no such unity, in the citizenry or the police or the military.  We're split, in many ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plenty of the general citizenry is in favor of more money for the military, teaching creationism in the schools, outlawing atheism, more guns for everyone, kicking out all immigrants, letting big business do whatever it wants, ignoring climate change, keeping marijuana illegal, etc. I think this mantra of "the people are being oppressed, and everything would be great if only the people's desires were enacted" is nonsense. There is no one unified "the people", and many of "the people's" wishes are stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       A revolt would split the citizenry, the police, the military.  They wouldn't instantly know who "the people" were and what they wanted, and line up behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The aftermath of a successful violent revolt would be hideous. All sorts of groups would take the opportunity to carve out enclaves, steal stuff, kill opponents or perceived enemies. The country would fragment into pieces by religion, race, wealth, region, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one would agree on what the new government or political structure should be. Everyone would take the opportunity to try to write their favorite position into the Constitution or laws: anti-abortion, anti-gay, anti-GMO, anti-immigrant, anti-fossil-fuel, pro-fossil-fuel, anti-gun, pro-gun, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The economy would tank, the dollar would tank, the world economy would tank. The killing would go on for a long, long time. USA is the most heavily-armed country in the world, civilian, police and military.

       There's usually a winner after the revolution and since a lot of people think the constitution is good but needs more protection we'd probably use it but add a new bill of rights on top of the amendments we have. Like guarantees against domestic spying and reduction in presidential powers like executive orders. You'd see them I limits or something on supreme court justices, even though the idea is that they're there for life so they can't be bought by anyone, so they don't need to think about their future after making decisions.

       Sounds like you're skimming over a decade of slaughter, and assuming your pet clauses will be in the new Constitution.  Perhaps things could go the opposite direction, we get the War on Terror codified into the Constitution, it becomes illegal to criticize the govt, etc.  Anything could happen.

       Some things people talk about as much or more: outlawing guns, making guns unrestricted, outlawing abortion, regulating money in politics, regulating corporations, eliminating large chunks of the federal govt, legalizing marijuana or keeping it illegal, legalizing or outlawing gay marriage, declaring this a Christian nation, etc.  I think you would find little agreement on what should be in the new Constitution.

       Okay, take the opposite of everything.  Plenty of the general citizenry is in favor of less money for the military, outlawing creationism in the schools, instituting atheism, banning guns, reforming immigration to provide a path to legality, heavily regulating big business, carbon tax to fight climate change, making marijuana legal, etc.  Think that platform will get general agreement from all the citizenry ?  No conflict or disagreement over those positions ?

       This may have to do with the 'trust' bestowed on the military by the populace through very good propoganda. 
Also, many people (normies) today wouldn't have the balls for an all out revolution - thus they'd rather suppose the military and trust them to take the country back from the evil politicians. These same people are completely unaware of how deep the rabbit hole goes. No military-backed revolution would be beneficial - it's all a product of the MIC. 
The truth is that any revolution would be very ugly. It's a rough movie to get thru, but it's worth checking out; it's titled Southland Tales. Sean Williams Scott and a bunch of others are in it. It was a fun watch.

       Yeah because obviously once you know about the conspiracies and war provocations our governments have been up to, the best solution is to have the armed branch of our government take over everything... Amazing logic.

       anyone would think this is a 'good' idea. why the military? imo, i doubt this would make the world better. this is 'crazy making', jumping out of the pan into the fire.

       Yeah but the military itself couldn't.  We're diverse as we're supposed to be, and even if half the military might decide to go along with this, there would likely be just as many who would stand in the way and say, we need to stop and think about this, because I may not agree with your plans for everyone, and neither might everyone else.  It's doomed for failure as soon as it starts, unless everyone is mad enough to blindly allow for such things, which would like need a catalyst like 9/11, that affects the mentality of our society, and maybe a bunch of small catalysts building up over time as well, a perfect storm so to speak of chaos.

       Of course, if you took a nationwide, or military-wide, poll of who "the bad guys in the government" are, you'd probably find not so much agreement.  Divisions on religious grounds, racial grounds, political grounds, geographic, etc.

       I'm all about division, don't get me wrong. Diversity is the prime indicator of ecological health. Perhaps the divide and conquer strategy is self-defeating. Certainly it's feasible that different people's can unite against a common oppressor. Problems rarely arise until one faction or another takes up residence in the shell of the opressor.

       Okay, take the opposite of everything.  Plenty of the general citizenry is in favor of less money for the military, outlawing creationism in the schools, instituting atheism, banning guns, reforming immigration to provide a path to legality, heavily regulating big business, carbon tax to fight climate change, making marijuana legal, etc.  Think that platform will get general agreement from all the citizenry ?  No conflict or disagreement over those positions ?
