       So I've been noticing that in big threads about geopolitical shit, I'd see the same comments more than once, never really investigated though cause I often flip from best to new to controversial and just figured I was rereading the same comment more than once, I don't always take notice of usernames. Well today in
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3kq0wr/sweden_wants_russia_to_explain_threats_over_nato/">
        this
       </a>
       thread about Russia and Sweden's little kerfuffle, I found the exact same comment posted ten hours apart, the first one garnering over 900 upvotes and the second one had just been posted so I think it had none. I made
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3kq0wr/sweden_wants_russia_to_explain_threats_over_nato/cuzwybb">
        this
       </a>
       comment and got the response that you can read. So my question is, what's your take
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ? I originally thought it was either just a guy with an alt who wanted to reap some more lovely karma off of his successful comment so he reposted it under his newer account, or a blatant plagiarist tryin' to reap some points, but then when I got the response I did from PraetorRU it made me realize how often I see the same or similar quotes on big threads. I know governments have keyboard warriors to help the cause, but would they be so obvious as to repost a comment verbatim? The second commenter's account is only 12 days old, with cheesy posts until bam, regurgitated shit. The first guys account is 2 month's old and he comments heavily on geo-political shit, constantly. Are they this fuckin' cheesy about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR same comment twice in the same thread, shills or just a loser?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, credit where credit is due; I come in here occasionally with a dissenting opinion and you guys have never once deleted my comments or blatantly attacked me for it, that to me says a lot about what you guys value and that you're not afraid of speech. I've strayed off of the narrative in quite a few subs and been insta-banned immediately more than once; it says a lot about the people you're dealing with when they can't even stand to have a dissenting opinion in their thread, and if you have those opinions you're simply not welcome. Thanks for that and keep it up; it says a lot about your motives and who you guys are, even if I disagree with you most of the time,
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       if I disagree with you most of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR hallelujah free-speech

       Ive seen it as well. Same comment posted under many accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       My take is that they are paid commenters with canned responses to certain topics, sort of like a telemarketer scripts with verbatim rebuttals. At first its hard to notice them, but once the shills started piling up and the paid responses started coming out of the woodwork, we're starting to notice the verbatim scripts.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good telemarketer will take the scripts and make them their own, so it doesn't sound canned and you are more likely to believe them, but the less skilled just use the script as written, and thats okay too because it all reinforces the same ideas. I think there is a paralell here, in that the good shills will take the script and re word it to make it their own, while the mediocre college student shill in israel is just going off the script as they were given, and we are seeing the overlaps now that it is such a common job.

       This is interesting, but I'd be ready to heavily bet on the fact that most keyboard warriors are simply there for the upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The perfect example is this sub whenever there's a spike of 9/11 posts, you'll have 1k+ up votes on comments from apologists of the official version, where usually this sub doesn't see more than a few hundred up/down votes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply copy/pasting comments seems a bit too obvious and less effective.

       Also thanks for your words about this sub. All threads here sure aren't equal in quality, but we stay for the rare nuggets of intelligence regularly displayed here, glad you appreciate them too.

       My guess is that the accounts are running a script that searches threads for highly-rated comments and automatically reposts them in the same thread. Then, when the account has something to say, and someone looks at his post history to see if it's a trustworthy account, he sees a bunch of posts that seem to be thoughtful and on-topic, and he believes it's a legitimate user.

       A lot of people don't realize what's really going on. They view life as a bunch of unconnected incidents and things. They don't realize that there's this, like, lattice of coincidence that lays on top of everything. Give you an example, show you what I mean: suppose you're thinkin' about a plate of shrimp. Suddenly someone'll say, like, "plate," or "shrimp," or "plate of shrimp" out of the blue, no explanation. No point in lookin' for one, either. It's all part of a cosmic unconsciousness.

       Unfortunately, this is simply untrue. While it's fun to assume all coincidences are linked, that is completely false. First,
       <em>
        multiple
       </em>
       cognitive and heuristic biases are at play here, especially in the plate of shrimp scenario. We think things all the time and so many of those thoughts go uninterrupted by coincidences, that when a coincidence like that happens we tend to overstate it. It's a weird occurrence, but by no means is it proof, or even evidence of a collective consciousness. Mathematicians would be baffled if these occurrences didn't happen, because it's all part of statistics. If one random number generator, which selects 1 of 1,000 numbers picks the same number as another RNG that does the same, do these RNG's have to be linked? Or was it simply a 1,000 coincidence? What if we ran these machines 1,000 times. Or 10,000, or 1,000,000. You'd expect them to hit the same number, even though they aren't linked. I'd be baffled if they didn't after all those trials.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, another bias at play is the ability and inclination to see and hear things that you are thinking. If you're walking through a crowd thinking about the false flag of 9/11, you're not going to process the information that you are hearing that pertains to something else. You're not going to take note of every leaflet of every conversation that is going on around you, but once someone says "Jet fuel can't create iron microspheres found in the Deutsche Bank building", then you'll hear that. It's hardly even a coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thirdly, we severally underestimate unlikely probabilities. Scientists have done the math: assuming an event occurs in the daylight hours, and has a 1/1,000,000 chance of occurring, this event will happen once a month.
