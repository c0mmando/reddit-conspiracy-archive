       Average difference -.45.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meaning that if the average in one area is 122 then it's 121.55 in the other area. So the difference is less than a rounding error because you'd generally round 121.55 up to 122.
      </p>
      <p>
       With a difference that small it becomes very challenging to prove a causative relationship. They controlled for some things but it's impossible to control for everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that I don't quite understand the insistence on fluoridating water. If people really want it they can find fluoride in toothpastes and mouthwashes. Adding it to the water supply seems like a gigantic amount of overkill. Further, there is ample evidence now to show that areas without mass fluoridation aren't suffering a huge increase in dental problems.

       I don't think it's a conspiracy...I think it's just inertia. "well we have always done it this way..."

       There seldom a single financial beneficiary of high-level corruption.  The dental and health (read: sick) care industries benefit grandly as a result of spiking the tap water with industrial waste product.  Then you have every career criminal in DC who benefits by the blanket decrease in IQ.

       Yes! I agree with everything you just said:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Fluoridating water makes no sense
       </li>
       <li>
        They can't control the dosage
       </li>
       <li>
        It's being equally distributed regardless of age/health/etc
       </li>
       <li>
        97% of western European countries do not fluoridate their water
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This list goes on. Fluoridate activism is a global thing, and I believe the most recent country to ban it was Israel. But for some reason, the U.S. has always insisted on fluoridating, and actively fights against anyone who tries to get this drug out of the public water supply. It just doesn't seem right to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yea, I'd at least need a better explanation than "I think it's just inertia".

       I'll respond elsewhere to some of "their" comments, but I actually agree. Whatever "shills" are, they definitely have a M.O. when it comes to their shilling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perfect example here:
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        itisnotatumah and asiltopbr BOTH open with:
       </strong>
       "Average difference -.45".
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        itisnotatumah then closes with:
       </strong>
       "I don't think it's a conspiracy...I think it's just inertia. "well we have always done it this way..."
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Really? Inertia? Sounds like a rehearsed cop out to me. And then both of those comments get the most votes (currently +9 and +13).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, this isn't the first time I've seen this, especially when talking fluoride. It's the same thing when you post a new comment now.. shit gets instantly downvoted to 0:

       Shills actually exist and this is admitted in the mainstream media all of the time. Many countries and corporations hire shills, and I compiled all relevant information about shills from the mainstream media into one subreddit:

       You misunderstand me. Shills come from everywhere in SUPPORT of fluoride use.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am opposed to its use. It is only a topical treatment, why ingest it? 
I personally think we get plenty of fluoride from our toothpaste, plus, why ingest more toxic chemicals than we need to.

       Average difference -.45

       Was comparing areas with fluoride hitting more than 10 times the amount found in our drinking water.

      <p>
       Didn't actually account for any other factors.

       Authors of the study have come out telling fluoride tards to stop using it.

       What your title should have read "Study finds a very slight difference in IQ between areas with 4 times as much fluoride as our drinking water and areas with 10 times as much fluoride as our drinking water, while not account for any heavy metals or accounting for the fact people burn fluoride loaded clay inside their houses inhaling massive amounts"

       Fluoridated water is just adding more unnecessary fluoride to your system. You already get an overload through food, depending on your specific diet. Two main reasons for this is the use of cryolite on food crops as a pesticide and the fumigation of food warehouses using profume, or sulfuryl fluoride, which leaves a sodium fluoride residue directly on the food.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, green/black tea has extremely high amounts (not listed in my link). Up to 9 ppm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would estimate that the average person could be consuming upwards of 8 or 10 milligrams per day, depending on how close farmers and food manufacturers approach fluoride residue limits. It could be much more than 10, but that is a reasonable conservative estimate. Fluoridated water will add 1 milligram per liter of water consumed, on average.

       Is a Harvard study funded by the NIH not legit? You can read the study
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=10.1289/ehp.1104912">
        here
       </a>
       if you care to. Here's a summary:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        To summarize the available literature, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies on increased fluoride exposure in drinking water and neurodevelopmental delays. We specifically targeted studies carried out in rural China that have not been widely disseminated, thus complementing the studies that have been included in previous reviews and risk assessment reports ...
       </p>
       <p>
        Findings from our meta-analyses of 27 studies published over 22 years suggest an inverse association between high fluoride exposure and children's intelligence ... The results suggest that fluoride may be a developmental neurotoxicant that affects brain development at exposures much below those that can cause toxicity in adults ...
       </p>
       <p>
        Serum-fluoride concentrations associated with high intakes from drinking-water may exceed 1 mg/L, or 50 Smol/L, thus more than 1000-times the levels of some other neurotoxicants that cause neurodevelopmental damage. Supporting the plausibility of our findings, rats exposed to 1 ppm (50 Smol/L) of water-fluoride for one year showed morphological alterations in the brain and increased levels of aluminum in brain tissue compared with controls ...
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, our results support the possibility of adverse effects of fluoride exposures on children's neurodevelopment. Future research should formally evaluate dose-response relations based on individual-level measures of exposure over time, including more precise prenatal exposure assessment and more extensive standardized measures of neurobehavioral performance, in addition to improving assessment and control of potential confounders.

      <p>
       The study is legit, but Mercola (the author of the HuffPo piece linked) is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Among other things:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The paper only reviewed research from China and Iran.  Most of these were in very rural areas where children were exposed to fluoride and other chemicals not just in the water but also in the air (from nearby coal plants.  with regulation very lacking in China, there's a significant chemical effect from hundreds of miles around these plants)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         China stopped adding fluoride to their water in 2002.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There is no control.  They're essentially taking research that shows an outcome (lower IQ) and arbitrarily choosing a cause (fluoride) without examining the other surrounding factors.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       None of these things independantly are bad - but in the context of Mercola's interpretation of the meta-review by Harvard, he's just painfully wrong.

       I still say users like you should have some type of flair attached to your posts here in r/conspiracy.  Any other sub, the mods quickly ban those who deride the sub and users.
