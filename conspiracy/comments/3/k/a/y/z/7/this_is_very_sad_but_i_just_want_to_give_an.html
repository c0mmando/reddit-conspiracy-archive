I think it&#39;s worth comparing to fake stories. as sad as it is. :( rest in peace little kids. </p>

<p>ugn I don;t know how to post a link. the story is all over. If you google &quot; three kids stabbed los angeles&quot; you will see tons of articles. </p>

<p>it grabbed my attention because I can tell it&#39;s real. very fast, just the way I am learning to tell if something is fake very fast, maybe you will see the same and we can talk about how to tell the difference. my reason for wanting to do this - is a lot of people are saying - those who see hoaxes just think every serious crime is a hoax, which of course is not true, and this could be a good way of showing the difference between real and fake. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>for virginia shooting,for me, it was watching the video and seeing nobody was actually shot. is was also the super clear &#39;good guys&#39; bad guys narrative. tons of work to paint image of victims as just about the most perfect go lucky people possible. and bad guy as nonsensically evil. and zero layers of complex information - all it appears to be is what it is. it&#39;s a &quot;story&quot;.  a melodrama written for an audience. real crime involves a lot more complexity, mystery, texture, and information that remains hidden. </p>

<p>when you start to recognize the difference it&#39;s like seeing the difference between a cartoon strip and a series of  photographs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me guess, you believe the moon landing was faked as well?</p>

<p>In any case, the burden of proof lies upon you. Why? Because you&#39;re the one challenging the official story. You&#39;re the one accusing the whole thing of being a cover up. Just like the burden of proof lies on 9/11 truthers to shut down and blow up the official report. </p>

<p>So here&#39;s the conclusion. If you can prove to me that no shots were fired, no one was killed. If you can prove that these people were convinced/paid off to keep silent and leave their whole lives behind. If you can prove that the families were bribed or threatened into going along with the story and acting, as well as the news station and other media outlets that were reporting on it. If you can prove that the police were in on the whole thing. If you can prove that the whole thing was a false flag operation for some insane reason...</p>

<p>Then I might begin to take part in this echo chamber you call r/conspiracy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my point is that this is easily recognizable as divisive bullshit. The elite know that if they can keep us fighting with each other, as in racial divisiveness, left versus right, etc., that we will be too busy fighting each other and will be unable to direct our anger where it really belongs--at THEM. I call bullshit on this whole refusal to marry gays. It&#39;s purpose is to divide the people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes even this simple fact adds validity, interesting I just realized in none of the hoaxes are the perps ever caught in presence of victims. interesting I never thought of that before.though it&#39;s probably something they could do if they wanted to - it&#39;s interesting so far they have not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, they have been coming really fast lately but I haven&#39;t figured out how to anticipate their occurrence. I do think we are getting a lot of them on foreign soil. for example that story of the refugee washed up on beach seems possible staged, though there are surely plenty of real drowned refugees. I just caught glimpses of the father holding his face against a wall in photos - and had my doubts, but I didn&#39;t look deep into it. just that I wondered about it. </p>
