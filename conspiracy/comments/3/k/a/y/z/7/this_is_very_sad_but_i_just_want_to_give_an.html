       three boys stabbed in LA. the story has all the hallmarks of a Real story . not a Hoax. good example for those who think people who see hoaxes think all stories are hoaxes. first - actual name of cop giving information is reported. second motives are unclear. only information that can logically be known at this early stage is revealed. no agenda of how you are supposed to react as a public is forming, though arguably this is more tragic than some other recent hoaxes, it's a - just the fact ma'am - story. and it's real. this is how a real story should look. I think it's worth comparing to fake stories. as sad as it is. :( rest in peace little kids.

       huh? quite to the contrary, I'm showing the contrast - so it's easier to recognize fake stories like the virginia shooting. when you can see the difference between fake and real - that's power. what do you think of this story?

       ugn I don;t know how to post a link. the story is all over. If you google " three kids stabbed los angeles" you will see tons of articles.
      </p>
      <p>
       it grabbed my attention because I can tell it's real. very fast, just the way I am learning to tell if something is fake very fast, maybe you will see the same and we can talk about how to tell the difference. my reason for wanting to do this - is a lot of people are saying - those who see hoaxes just think every serious crime is a hoax, which of course is not true, and this could be a good way of showing the difference between real and fake.

       Is it shilly types, or just people who challenge you? Im the guy who believes there were actual victims, sure. And I substantiate my claims. You're the type who calls "bullshit" immediately and leaves it at that. If that's how you want to go about stuff like this, go for it.

       for virginia shooting,for me, it was watching the video and seeing nobody was actually shot. is was also the super clear 'good guys' bad guys narrative. tons of work to paint image of victims as just about the most perfect go lucky people possible. and bad guy as nonsensically evil. and zero layers of complex information - all it appears to be is what it is. it's a "story".  a melodrama written for an audience. real crime involves a lot more complexity, mystery, texture, and information that remains hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       when you start to recognize the difference it's like seeing the difference between a cartoon strip and a series of  photographs.

       Watch the video again with your eyes opened. Just because it doesn't look like what you'd imagine a shooting would look like does not mean it's conclusive evidence that the whole thing was staged.

       You're ignoring the fact that the shooters POV was filmed on a camera phone, what were you expecting?

       Yep, the video shows someone getting murdered. Again, just because it doesn't look like what you imagine a murder would look like doesn't prove it wasn't real.

       Let me guess, you believe the moon landing was faked as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, the burden of proof lies upon you. Why? Because you're the one challenging the official story. You're the one accusing the whole thing of being a cover up. Just like the burden of proof lies on 9/11 truthers to shut down and blow up the official report.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here's the conclusion. If you can prove to me that no shots were fired, no one was killed. If you can prove that these people were convinced/paid off to keep silent and leave their whole lives behind. If you can prove that the families were bribed or threatened into going along with the story and acting, as well as the news station and other media outlets that were reporting on it. If you can prove that the police were in on the whole thing. If you can prove that the whole thing was a false flag operation for some insane reason...

       I don't know, they have been coming really fast lately but I haven't figured out how to anticipate their occurrence. I do think we are getting a lot of them on foreign soil. for example that story of the refugee washed up on beach seems possible staged, though there are surely plenty of real drowned refugees. I just caught glimpses of the father holding his face against a wall in photos - and had my doubts, but I didn't look deep into it. just that I wondered about it.

       I don't recognize propaganda as being liberal. that doesn't make sense to me. propaganda is unto itself tyrannical. and while I support gay marriage, I can see the politics around it are being used to distract from more important issues like the wars - I don't really care about this one. sorry to disappoint, Or maybe I don't know what part you are referring to, as the propaganda. but I support gay marriage and rights, etc. because it's the right thing to do, not for any political reasons.

       my point is that this is easily recognizable as divisive bullshit. The elite know that if they can keep us fighting with each other, as in racial divisiveness, left versus right, etc., that we will be too busy fighting each other and will be unable to direct our anger where it really belongs--at THEM. I call bullshit on this whole refusal to marry gays. It's purpose is to divide the people.

       yes even this simple fact adds validity, interesting I just realized in none of the hoaxes are the perps ever caught in presence of victims. interesting I never thought of that before.though it's probably something they could do if they wanted to - it's interesting so far they have not.

       I don't recognize propaganda as being liberal. that doesn't make sense to me. propaganda is unto itself tyrannical. and while I support gay marriage, I can see the politics around it are being used to distract from more important issues like the wars - I don't really care about this one. sorry to disappoint, Or maybe I don't know what part you are referring to, as the propaganda. but I support gay marriage and rights, etc. because it's the right thing to do, not for any political reasons.

       if you can prove that I care what you believe I might make an effort . 
to do any of those things for you,
      </p>
      <p>
       But I don't care what you believe. You are lucky I am even responding to your comment. , if you are genuinely curious about why people say these events are fabricated do your own research. if not - stay you. just as you are. ain't no thing. different strokes. go forth.
