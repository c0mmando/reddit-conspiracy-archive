       Readers: AssuredlyAThrowAway has unilaterally banned Orangutan after calling for a vote of the mod team to occur this coming Monday.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has also unilaterally banned AE911Truth posts unilaterally without any discussion of the matter with the rest of the mod team.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've protested to him in modmail and do NOT approve of this post or AATA's actions. Looks like he and I are going to go round and round again. Damn.

       This part makes no sense. It's not him that doesn't allow doxxing, it's the site's rules. What would you expect him to do, reveal the info and get permanently shadowbanned?

       As for the rest he said right in the title that he removed him

       For the record.  I make no money from AE911Truth or 911Blogger.  My activism is entirely and strictly on a voluntary basis, just like this mod position here.  This was a witch hunt against me by mods who have tried to get me off the mod team for awhile now.  I was a good mod who represented the users of this subreddit first and foremost and didn't overly try to make friends with the mods to keep my impartiality.  I brought us good legitimate AMA's from people such as James Corbett, Russ Baker and Bill Still.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep an eye on the mod team : )  and Thanks for voting me on as a mod and an eye on there for as long as I was!!  It was no problem.

       After being here for almost 6 years, I absolutely agree. He's a plant, if anyone, and I have a very good idea who he really represents. They've been trying to take over this sub for years, and he managed to squeeze in pretending to be one of us. He clearly isn't.

       has 948,780 link karma and submits A LOT. If a few of those posts are from ae911 Truth, so what. AE911 Truth is the most effective of the 911 Truth organizations and the one the real conspirators would most like to suppress.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have given them money myself. There is no one who believes in 911 truth who doesn't appreciate and respect them and the work they have done. Just as I respect the work /user/Orangutan has done on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The killers who organized 911 must be celebrating the suppression of this source of information. And on 911, what a triumph for them.

      <p>
       Just as the banning of
       <a href="http://www.bradblog.com/">
        http://www.bradblog.com/

       was a triumph for those that have fixed our voting system.

       The timing was deliberate, certainly.
      </p>
      <p>
       So? People work for a living. Orangutan posts so much that what he/she has posted on 911 is a minor thing. But this is clearly an op to attack the 911 truth movement and to block the information they produce. How else does someone get someone else's 1099, except as a deep, state back op? Especially someone as private as Orangutan. Hell, I don't even know his/her gender.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, we have journalists who come to reddit and post their own articles. But "Feel free to post links to your own content (within reason). But if that's all you ever post, or it always seems to get voted down, take a good hard look in the mirror — you just might be a spammer. A widely used rule of thumb is the 9:1 ratio, i.e. only 1 out of every 10 of your submissions should be your own content."
      </p>
      <p>
       So there was no problem with Orangutan posting as little 911 info as he/she has.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have let yourself be used. For evil purposes.

       So? I think it was last year I gave them $50. There are people, maybe even affluent people, who believe 911 was an engineered event and still want information about it spread. If you feel that way and look around for who to fund, it's AE911 truth that is the best organization. If I was rich, I'd give them money too. And that we know about their funding, doesn't that mean there are moles in their organization? And who would be funding these moles but states that want to suppress this information?
      </p>
      <p>
       So you object to someone rich giving them money? Or what? Do you think they've put out any information that isn't true? Or just that you disagree with. I've bought CDs from Ryan Dawson even thought I often disagree with what he says (He's a bit too "the Joos did it" for me). But often he makes good points. I don't have to agree with everything some one or some group thinks to support them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an op to hurt AE911Truth and block them from
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and reddit. And in the process hurts Orangutan.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if I could work for them I would. Though they wouldn't have to pay me. They are an honorable group who have done great work.

       What next, they go after the Sanders candidacy as it exists on Reddit?

        Technique #6 - 'GAINING FULL CONTROL'
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the 'ultimate victory' as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms.
