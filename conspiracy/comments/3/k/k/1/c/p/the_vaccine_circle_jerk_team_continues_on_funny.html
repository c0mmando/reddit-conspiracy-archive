    <div class="md"><p>I feel like I should of made a copy of my mothers summary report from loyola hospital yesterday where it clearly lists her reaction of paralysis from the tetanus toxoid vaccine. I will say I find it funny that at the clinic we have charts for animals showing just how many vaccines we can give them depending on age, weight, and breed in order to watch to combat the possibility of negative reactions. If anyone here has a pet they can&#39;t tell me they never got the talk from the Dr. or the tech about vaccine reactions to look out for when we send them home. IF you haven&#39;t you need to find a new vet. That nifty post from a couple weeks back that had a link directly to the FDA website for the tetanus toxoid vax that clearly states in the warning label that such effects such as for example :hydroencephalopathy and autism are indeed possible side effects. 
How do people not connect that if a pet can have a reaction then why can&#39;t people. Btw I am not advocating you should not vaccinate your pets. The reactions they can have are nowhere near as serious for the most part. I think some of that lay in the fact that if our pets were suffering from horrible reactions that we could trace easily to the vaccines it would start a ripple effect to far more people wondering about the vaccines they get.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I agree. I am not about to put hours of my time to drive over there right now and hope she didn&#39;t toss it because she has no reason to keep it. She was in for a colonoscopy and under history of adverse/ allergic reactions on her summary report was where it stated it. Also if he clearly can&#39;t read and notice I already put up the name Tetanus toxoid in my original comment i&#39;m especially not bothering. I&#39;ll call her and ask if she has it. If she does i&#39;ll tell her to keep it and i&#39;ll pick it up the next time I have a chance. However I don&#39;t even think thats worth it because I could probably sit here and use word to make something that looks just like it. It&#39;s not as if a medical summary report has anything fancy on it to discern it except for the Loyola symbol which isn&#39;t hard to copy and paste so I don&#39;t see the point. He&#39;ll probably just say it&#39;s fake as you have said.  I will say he can easily look up adverse reactions to vaccines for animals. We are animals. Is it so hard to believe that if a pet can have a bad reaction that we can&#39;t?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Update. While I jetted out to the aldis down the street I called my mother. She does indeed still have it so when I can I will procure it. I need to make one correction however. As she read it she stated tetanus antitoxin. It&#39;s important I make this distinction because there are 2 versions of this vaccine as I know from working with large animals: tetanus toxoid and tetanus antitoxin. One is given in short term in the event of some kind of wound say a laceration to a horses leg to a horse that is late on vax or coming due. the other is the standard prophylactic vaccine. However there is no difference in the potential for side effects for either humans or animals.</p>

<p>I remember upvoting that post myself - does that mean I&#39;m part of the conspiracy and getting paid by some shadowy, nefarious medical company?</p>

<p>No - it means I found the post amusing.</p>

<p>Also, see how you downvote each of my comments? - notice I haven&#39;t been doing the same. Because I&#39;m not so petty that I feel the need to downvote someone just because they disagree with me. </p>

<p>I even upvoted the thread - I tend to do that if I join in the discussion.</p>

The concept is they want to waste your time and distract you from posting informative and useful information, just block him</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should refine you tests.  Because apparently everyone fails it shill or not.
If I were to believe you, Lucy and harvardgrad 95 % of accounts on this sub are shills.
Calling people shills, puts moderate people like me off.
Beat them with facts not accusations.
I tried to explain this to Lucy but she went back to calling me a shill after I told her I was a RN.
I only believe a couple conspiracy theories.
The antivax one I don&#39;t buy.  Big pharma is bad but so are most corporations.
Direct to consumer advertising is what I don&#39;t like.
And, I can see the vaccine schedule is messed up but I don&#39;t know that that is a conspiracy.  Probably just clustering of care to ensure children are vaccinated.</p>
