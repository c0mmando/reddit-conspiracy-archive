        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When I first heard of the shooting, and saw the news footage, I was obviously shocked as I&#39;m sure many of you were. Even though I consider myself a conspiracy theorist I believed that this was a genuine occurrence and not some very well planned out false flag operation. With that said however, curiosity got the best of me and I decided to watch the first person footage of the shooter actually carrying out the &quot;attack&quot;. Everything seemed to add up, the timing of the shots, the reaction time of the anchor, etc. Even though I wanted to believe this wasn&#39;t a pre-planned event, there were certain details from the body cam, and on-air, footage that I just couldn&#39;t get over. </p>

<p>First of all in the body cam footage when the assailant comes up to the news crew, they are completely oblivious to his presence. While this may just be the news crew choosing to ignore him because they thought he was some prankster, it was almost like he was invisible. None of them, including the interviewee, so much as glanced at him for a moment even after he pulled out his gun and essentially waved it around for a good 4-5 seconds before he started shooting. This is up for debate, but I still think its odd how even though the shooter was easily in the reporter and interviewee&#39;s peripheral vision, they remain oblivious to him standing 6-7 feet away holding a clearly visible firearm. </p>

<p>The other major thing that left a bad taste in my mouth dealt with the unfortunate death of the camera operator. In the &quot;live&quot; news footage as soon as the first shot is fired you can see the camera jolt as if the camera man has been hit by a bullet. The same goes for the second shot, and by the third the camera/cameraman is already on the ground. So one can assume that the first two/three shots were intended for the cameraman, not for the reporter. However, in the body cam footage you can clearly see the shooter aim only for the reporter. You can also see that the first three shots, and others after that, are all aimed specifically at the news reporter. So how did the shooter manage to hit and kill the camera operator with the first two/three shots, if every shot according to the body cam was aimed at the news correspondent?</p>

<p>This whole event just seems very fishy, and I believe now more than ever that this was a very elaborate planned out false flag. Just like the majority, if not all, of the recent tragic events that have transpired.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which if anyone paid attention to are visible in all pictures. </p>

<p>Yes they run in line with her.  Look closely at the first picture and the bottom. There are perpendicular boards that run up the centre walkway and you can clearly see the end of one or two from the shooters perspective before the pattern switches to running in line with the reporter. </p>

<p>In the final picture you can see this exact same change where the centre walkway meets the other walkways. </p>

<p>Where she happened to be standing the camera didnt catch much of the pattern underneath her, and just the pattern behind her. </p>

<p>This isnt proof of anything except for peoples confirmation bias and rush to jump to conclusions. Please review the pictures  carefully.</p>

<p>Edit: loving the downvotes. Anyone downvoting me care to explain why i may be wrong instead of assuming im wrong because it doesnt fit beliefs? The pattern is blatantly visible on the floor below which is actually lit up enough  to make things out. I work construction and a big thing is consistency. There is no logical reason why the planks would be different on the each floor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bigger question, without even arguing about what you in your non expert opinion  (if there are secretive groups running false flag operations, how sloppy do you think they are , do you really think theyd miss such pbvious things) percieve tobe sketchy,  is what is the motive? </p>

<p>What is there to gain from this specific false flag operation? </p>

<p>What i being pushed because of this event?</p>

<p>What would any group have to gain from committing a false flag like this?</p>

<p>From my perspective the answer to all of those is &quot;nothing&quot;. </p>

<p>False flags arent done for shits and giggles. Its good to question everything but if you cant figure out a motive or way to gain, it probably is not a false flag. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so they did this because people are afraid of terrorism/gun violence, and the only way we think there is to stop these violent attacks is with government intervention. Think about it. This is the first on-air shooting to occur on (almost) any media station; and they plastered it everywhere and tabloidized (if that&#39;s a word) it. Why would they want everyone to see something this horrific over and over again? To instill fear in our hearts that either a. make us afraid of guns increasing the chances of gun seizure, and with that comes essentially martial law. Or b. we become more afraid of &quot;terrorism&quot; coming into our borders, which will again lead to more governmental oversight. That&#39;s why they did this, so we will agree with the government to increase its power.</p>

<p>with 9/11 for example you have the Patriot act,  the wars in afghanistan and iraq, and an entire excuse to start the bullshit  &quot;war on terror&quot;</p>

<p>A vague &quot;so the government can extend their power&quot; is nothing but paranoia. We cant draw conclusions from vague guesses. We needs facts or atleast logical proofs if you want to be taken even half seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s follow this out.  You seem to agree the reporter, cameraman, and interviewee were actually killed and wounded - so they&#39;re not part of the conspiracy - you call it &quot;tragic&quot; and &quot;horrific&quot;.  Yet your problem is that they seemed oblivious to shooter when they shouldn&#39;t have been.  So what gives - what is the substance of the conspiracy?  The people were killed, but they somehow knew that they were going to be killed and so acted oddly?  The cause of your skepticism (the victims react oddly to the shooter) doesn&#39;t gel with any actual conspiracy motive or goal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said the interviewee was killed, because she wasn&#39;t she was only injured. The substance for the conspiracy is the fact that they weren&#39;t acting natural per say. They honestly probably aren&#39;t dead, just paid off and given new identities like they faked their own death or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right - the interviewee was wounded which is why I said killed and wounded to distinguish between the injured vs killed.  So was the interviewee part of the conspiracy?  I mean, seems she would have to be since she was an eyewitness to the whole thing.  But if so, what&#39;s her motive? </p>

<p>And so reporter and cameraman aren&#39;t dead, so are their families and loved ones not in on it then?  Are they going to fool everyone involved in preparing the memorial service without bodies?  And how did they fool all the police and investigators involved who would&#39;ve seen and examined the bodies at the scene?</p>

<p>Do you see how convoluted and far-fetched this is becoming as it is further examined and implications drawn out?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, I do agree its very strange that nobody looked at the guy as he was standing there, as they weren&#39;t even on camera at the time and it wouldn&#39;t have detracted from the shot.</p>

<p>But, the first shot was right in the camera man&#39;s ear and was unexpected.  That&#39;s enough to make anyone react sporadically. Also, just because the camera man&#39;s footage shows the camera drop, doesn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t just put it down at waist level before being shot.  Seems from watching the videos, the fourth shot was for the camera man, and probably a few after that.</p>
