       When I first heard of the shooting, and saw the news footage, I was obviously shocked as I'm sure many of you were. Even though I consider myself a conspiracy theorist I believed that this was a genuine occurrence and not some very well planned out false flag operation. With that said however, curiosity got the best of me and I decided to watch the first person footage of the shooter actually carrying out the "attack". Everything seemed to add up, the timing of the shots, the reaction time of the anchor, etc. Even though I wanted to believe this wasn't a pre-planned event, there were certain details from the body cam, and on-air, footage that I just couldn't get over.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all in the body cam footage when the assailant comes up to the news crew, they are completely oblivious to his presence. While this may just be the news crew choosing to ignore him because they thought he was some prankster, it was almost like he was invisible. None of them, including the interviewee, so much as glanced at him for a moment even after he pulled out his gun and essentially waved it around for a good 4-5 seconds before he started shooting. This is up for debate, but I still think its odd how even though the shooter was easily in the reporter and interviewee's peripheral vision, they remain oblivious to him standing 6-7 feet away holding a clearly visible firearm.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other major thing that left a bad taste in my mouth dealt with the unfortunate death of the camera operator. In the "live" news footage as soon as the first shot is fired you can see the camera jolt as if the camera man has been hit by a bullet. The same goes for the second shot, and by the third the camera/cameraman is already on the ground. So one can assume that the first two/three shots were intended for the cameraman, not for the reporter. However, in the body cam footage you can clearly see the shooter aim only for the reporter. You can also see that the first three shots, and others after that, are all aimed specifically at the news reporter. So how did the shooter manage to hit and kill the camera operator with the first two/three shots, if every shot according to the body cam was aimed at the news correspondent?
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole event just seems very fishy, and I believe now more than ever that this was a very elaborate planned out false flag. Just like the majority, if not all, of the recent tragic events that have transpired.

       Which if anyone paid attention to are visible in all pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes they run in line with her.  Look closely at the first picture and the bottom. There are perpendicular boards that run up the centre walkway and you can clearly see the end of one or two from the shooters perspective before the pattern switches to running in line with the reporter.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the final picture you can see this exact same change where the centre walkway meets the other walkways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where she happened to be standing the camera didnt catch much of the pattern underneath her, and just the pattern behind her.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isnt proof of anything except for peoples confirmation bias and rush to jump to conclusions. Please review the pictures  carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: loving the downvotes. Anyone downvoting me care to explain why i may be wrong instead of assuming im wrong because it doesnt fit beliefs? The pattern is blatantly visible on the floor below which is actually lit up enough  to make things out. I work construction and a big thing is consistency. There is no logical reason why the planks would be different on the each floor.

       The bigger question, without even arguing about what you in your non expert opinion  (if there are secretive groups running false flag operations, how sloppy do you think they are , do you really think theyd miss such pbvious things) percieve tobe sketchy,  is what is the motive?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is there to gain from this specific false flag operation?
      </p>
      <p>
       What i being pushed because of this event?
      </p>
      <p>
       What would any group have to gain from committing a false flag like this?
      </p>
      <p>
       From my perspective the answer to all of those is "nothing".
      </p>
      <p>
       False flags arent done for shits and giggles. Its good to question everything but if you cant figure out a motive or way to gain, it probably is not a false flag.

       The motive is, and always has been, control. It's really as simple as that. Control over the masses so they can do as they please, while using us as labor.

       Ok so they did this because people are afraid of terrorism/gun violence, and the only way we think there is to stop these violent attacks is with government intervention. Think about it. This is the first on-air shooting to occur on (almost) any media station; and they plastered it everywhere and tabloidized (if that's a word) it. Why would they want everyone to see something this horrific over and over again? To instill fear in our hearts that either a. make us afraid of guns increasing the chances of gun seizure, and with that comes essentially martial law. Or b. we become more afraid of "terrorism" coming into our borders, which will again lead to more governmental oversight. That's why they did this, so we will agree with the government to increase its power.

       But where i the government trying to increase its power? What have they done using this as a justification?
      </p>
      <p>
       with 9/11 for example you have the Patriot act,  the wars in afghanistan and iraq, and an entire excuse to start the bullshit  "war on terror"
      </p>
      <p>
       A vague "so the government can extend their power" is nothing but paranoia. We cant draw conclusions from vague guesses. We needs facts or atleast logical proofs if you want to be taken even half seriously.

       Dude its not about me not bring eilling to hear you out. I read your view and there is not much of a basis in reality.

      <p>
       Im asking because i want to hear you out. Im asking if there is any legitimate reason that can be pointed to, other then a vague guess. If there is this should be taken seriously. If you dont have one and think there is then do nore research and find it. But don't expect me or anyone not jumping to conclusions to take such a vague guess as anything to actually consider.

       Let's follow this out.  You seem to agree the reporter, cameraman, and interviewee were actually killed and wounded - so they're not part of the conspiracy - you call it "tragic" and "horrific".  Yet your problem is that they seemed oblivious to shooter when they shouldn't have been.  So what gives - what is the substance of the conspiracy?  The people were killed, but they somehow knew that they were going to be killed and so acted oddly?  The cause of your skepticism (the victims react oddly to the shooter) doesn't gel with any actual conspiracy motive or goal.

       I never said the interviewee was killed, because she wasn't she was only injured. The substance for the conspiracy is the fact that they weren't acting natural per say. They honestly probably aren't dead, just paid off and given new identities like they faked their own death or something.

       Right - the interviewee was wounded which is why I said killed and wounded to distinguish between the injured vs killed.  So was the interviewee part of the conspiracy?  I mean, seems she would have to be since she was an eyewitness to the whole thing.  But if so, what's her motive?
      </p>
      <p>
       And so reporter and cameraman aren't dead, so are their families and loved ones not in on it then?  Are they going to fool everyone involved in preparing the memorial service without bodies?  And how did they fool all the police and investigators involved who would've seen and examined the bodies at the scene?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you see how convoluted and far-fetched this is becoming as it is further examined and implications drawn out?

       First, I do agree its very strange that nobody looked at the guy as he was standing there, as they weren't even on camera at the time and it wouldn't have detracted from the shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, the first shot was right in the camera man's ear and was unexpected.  That's enough to make anyone react sporadically. Also, just because the camera man's footage shows the camera drop, doesn't mean he didn't just put it down at waist level before being shot.  Seems from watching the videos, the fourth shot was for the camera man, and probably a few after that.

       You bring up very valid points and I totally agree with you. The only thing is that the camera wasn't gently placed on the ground, you can see it literally fall to the ground with the camera man. That's why I assumed that the first two/three shots killed him

       They were focused. Have you never had anyone snap you out of a trance while you were focused on something?  Your assumption that the camera man was shot on the first few shots just seems completely wrong.

       There is nothing wrong with being suspicios, especially with all the obvious bullshit the media pushes, but sometimes it is what it seems to be.

       I don't know about you, but I'm pretty fucking aware of my surroundings. The lady in the interview should have seen the man (pointing a gun), whether she was focused or not (not a professional, just a normal person), it's a human reaction. As for the reporter, it's possible she did not see him, was trained to not look.

       The point that the OP and others who post stuff like this need to understand is at the end of the day, it's purely speculative. You're not going to be in court one day: "exhibit A: She should have noticed, I find that odd, so foul play." You're assuming a lot about how people deal with and react with their surroundings.

       They're trained professionals, how often do you see idiots in the background during live broadcasts and news crew can completely ignore their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine you're holding and looking through a camera you basically have tunnel vision. You don't think a gun going off a couple feet from your head would make you jump/flinch. There's you're jolting camera movement. Also then dropping the camera to try to run away, there's the camera hitting the ground.
