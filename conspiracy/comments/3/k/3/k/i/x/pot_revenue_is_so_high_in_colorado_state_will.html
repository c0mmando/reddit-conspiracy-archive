    <div class="md"><p>When Colorado decided to legalize the recreational use of marijuana, everyone expected the state’s tax revenue to increase. </p>

<p>What they didn’t realize at the time was that the state government might actually make too much money. So far the state has earned over <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/colorado-raises-150-million-marijuana-more-states-legalize-191729332.html">$150 million</a> from the 30% tax on pot, which exceeded expectations.</p>

<p>Now they may have to pay <a href="http://countercurrentnews.com/2015/09/colorados-revenue-is-so-high-the-state-has-to-give-residents-money-back/#">some of that money back</a> to the taxpayers. According to a 1992 amendment to Colorado’s constitution called the ‘Taxpayer Bill of Rights’ when the state earns more than they anticipated from a given industry, they have to return the difference to the people. </p>

<p>When pot was first legalized the state didn’t expect a whole lot of money, so they underestimated future profits. Now they’ll have to find some way to give $50 million back to the public.</p>

<p>What’s especially funny about this situation, is how the money-grubbing politicians in Colorado are reacting to the news. Neither political party wants to give up the money, and lawmakers are currently working on a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/us/colorado-lawmakers-scramble-to-keep-millions-in-marijuana-taxes.html?_r=1">bipartisan bill</a> that would ask the voters if they can keep their loot. </p>

<p>I guess there’s only one issue that is guaranteed to unite Republicans and Democrats, and that is taking more money from the public. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I think it’s appropriate that we keep the money for marijuana that the voters said that we should,” Republican Senate President Bill Cadman said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure the voters only voted for the tax because it would be going toward schools, not some slimy pockets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I have no problem paying taxes if they’re going to schools,” a Colorado marijuana consumer, Maddy Beaumier, 25, said as he shopped at a local dispensary.</p>

<p>David Huff, 50, a carpenter from Aurora, said that this is the least they can do. The state taxes add 30% more onto the price of marijuana, he explained. That’s too much.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if they write me a check, or refund it in my taxes, or just give me a free joint next time I come in. The taxes are too high, and they should give it back,” Huff explained.</p>

<p>This is what we have to look forward to if cannabis is legalized in other states: useful idiots in suits arguing over whether the people&#39;s money should go back to the people when the state is inevitably receiving too much in taxes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The funny thing about all this is how all the opted out cities changed their tune.  When they first introduced this in Colorado, the State gave each city an opportunity to decide if they wanted pot shops in their town or not.  Some cities opted out and banned pot shops out of fear that having weed shops in their town would lead to more crime and the end of the world.  </p>

<p>Well, two years later after <a href="http://www.mintpressnews.com/new-schools-less-crime-colorado-sees-benefits-of-marijuana-legalization/208751/">crime went down</a> and they made 150+ million dollars, these cities want a piece of the tax pie.  But they cannot have it, not at least until they allow pot shops in their town.  The grass is literally greener on the other side of the fence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last year i owed the state like $700..  the years before i usual get a rebate of  a few hundred dollars from the state and then the rest of the the tax i overpaid.  But when we get rebates from the surplus of tax it was just around $70 - $400 or so.. but i don&#39;t believe we have ever had such a large surplus in the past.  </p>

<p>But right now Whole Sale Price Per Pound of Mairujana is 1200-1400 and dropping..   Recreation you can buy 3.5 grams out the door for  $30 dollars including tax.. and as it saturates prices will keep falling.. but not much more.</p>

<p>Out of Towners: Well for some people that come here just hitting random shops not doing any research.. you are going to pay a premium  for the marijuana.. like 18 or 21 per gram. </p>

<p>When you see prices like that laugh and walk out. </p>

<p>If you have a medical card in CO its pretty much whole sale prices. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>CO schools will need to start teaching their kids a better more progressive curriculum asap to see results any time soon. The education problem is going to take a WHOLE lot more than money being thrown at it. But It is a start that I agree is fantastic, we just need to make sure that money gets allocated effectively in order to meet goals. Goals I don&#39;t think school systems or the government&#39;s educational bureaucracies even have in mind, education is stuffed so far back on the burner. </p>

<p>This is a man who is apparently incorporating his violent philosophy into his teaching at West Point. He started on August 1st 2015 — after he published his article.</p>

It doesn&#39;t meant the guy isn&#39;t a shitheel - he clearly is. But the rampant criticism of his ideas and his service record embellishment that forced him to resign clearly indicate that this is not as widespread in military academia as Antimedia would like you to think.</p>

<p>On top of that, they lied/denied that this plant would provide income streams for the States that legalized it.</p>
