    <div class="md"><p>Thanks to DHS’s own <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology">research &amp; development department</a> if you’re arrested, cops can now read your bank balance!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/prepaid-card-reader-aids-seizing-fraudulent-cards">Police are now able to read our bank credit and debit cards, retail gift cards, library cards, hotel card keys, even magnetic-striped Metrorail cards instantly!</a></p>

<p>Did you catch that? Police will even know the balance of your commuter train/bus cards, all without a WARRANT!  </p>

<p>DHS and Technology Directorate’s Electronic Recovery and Access to Data (ERAD) Prepaid Card Reader is now being used to read EVERY magnetic-striped card.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/prepaid-card-reader-aids-seizing-fraudulent-cards">The ERAD Prepaid Card Reader is a small, handheld device that uses wireless connectivity to allow law enforcement officers in the field to check the balance of cards. This allows for identification of suspicious prepaid cards and the ability to put a temporary hold on the linked funds until a full investigation can be completed.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reading between the lines, once you’re arrested if you’re carrying a ‘suspicious credit or debit card’ police can put a temporary hold on your account! Which begs the question, how the hell can you bail yourself out if they’ve frozen your accounts? What’s to stop a prosecutor/judge from demanding you pay a certain amount in fines or bail? After all they know EXACTLY how much money is in your bank account.</p>

<p>The project, developed by DHS’s Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/first-responders">First Responder Group (FRG)</a>, began in March 2012. The S&amp;T is led by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_Secretary_of_Homeland_Security_for_Science_and_Technology">Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Science and Technology</a>.</p>

<p>According to DHS since ERAD was put into field testing, police have seized approximately $1 million dollars in ‘suspicious bank cards, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The Prepaid Card Reader has generated a lot of interest from our state and local law enforcement agency partners, and there is a growing demand by these agencies for use of this technology by their personnel,” said Deso. “It provides a unique tool for when they encounter suspect cards with magnetic strips during the performance of their duties.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course ERAD is generating a lot of interest from state and local police, they need to find new ways to balance their budgets and keep the American police state going.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The stupid of r/conspiracy not to see the repercussions of this technology is astounding. Or perhaps these low information people don&#39;t travel and fail to realize the implications of these card reading financial data extractors.</p>

<p>The government with various legislation is attempting to corral the money of Americans, in America (for what purpose you might well ask-?). You cannot move cash without the overhang of Civil Asset Forfeiture, you cannot move your money on a card without having the information extracted now off the card remotely and without a warrant, and then having the assets seized under the provisions of Civil Asset Forfeiture.</p>

<p>How does this seem even remotely sane? How does this not reek of theft by the state? Why are there virtually no comments on this thread? Why are Americans so ignorant and unconcerned by this surveillance and confiscation of their personal finances?</p>

<p>Why are you people not fucking outraged by this???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a missleading misunderstanding of the technology.</p>

<p>Credit cards, bank cards, gift cards, and even library cards have no information on them except a serial number. Even if they had some identity confirmation data as well, it does not contain a balance or transaction history of any kind. You need access to the payment processor&#39;s database for that (Visa, Master Card, Walmart&#39;s gift card network, the Library&#39;s user database). The card&#39;s magnetic strip merely has a serial number.</p>

<p>This is simply a card reader. You - anyone - can buy one for about $60. They are using these devices to read the serial number for documentation, comparison, and investigation in junction with these payment processors.</p>

<p>There are several fraudulent scams that involve buying your own card reader and writer (more like $300), to make copies of cards. Copying credit cards are more tricky since they usually require a signature, which means you are on camera, or a pin number. So, many scams involve copying gift cards. You steal a stack of gift cards from Walmart. Copy half of the cards magnetic strip data to the other half, then return that half to the shelf in Walmart. When someone activates that card and loads money on it, then you have a copy of that card to use. People taking pictures of the cards and using the numbers to make purchases online in a similar fashion is why they started making the numbers scratch off to see. You can see easily why duplicating hotel key cards could make for some lucrative looting.</p>

<p>I think this is just a misunderstanding of what is this technology is capable of and what it is really used for.</p>

<p>&quot;The ERAD Prepaid Card Reader is a small, handheld device that uses wireless connectivity to allow <strong>law enforcement officers in the field to check the balance of cards</strong>.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it does say that on the DHS site, but obviously they aren&#39;t telling the whole story. Obviously a card reader cannot possibly read the balance without a partnership and connection to payment processor networks like Visa and Mastercard. Anyone can buy a card reader; not just anyone can check balances. Visa/Master card or some other 3rd party entity with their blessing, is allowing the police to do this. The balance is not on the magnetic strip. This may be more inline with <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/11/07/department-of-homeland-security-to-scan-payment-cards-at-borders-and-airports/">verifying declared values when crossing the boarder,</a> with the manufacturer&#39;s pie-in-the-sky hopes of a broader market by regular law enforcement using their product to fight fraudulent cards. With  FinCEN declaration laws, it would be easy to authorize partnerships with payment processors to check declarations of money when crossing the border.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for clarification of your point. I agree that they likely have MOU&#39;s or something similar with these payment processors, etc. to get the balances.</p>

<p>I have filed a FOIA request with DHS to get docs related to this device, so I will report back in a few months if I hear anything.</p>
