       There's a remarkable statement buried at the bottom of Boston Globe columnist Kevin Cullen's
       <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2015/08/08/retiring-boston-fbi-chief-shares-some-things-but-not-all/BDZjxwyvJgYJvvqhJhGBzI/story.html">
        farewell
       </a>
       to the soon-departing special agent in charge of the Boston FBI office, Vince Lisi. According to the law enforcement friendly Cullen, Lisi was uncharacteristically open during their interview. "Lisi is the most candid FBI leader in Boston, ever," Cullen writes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the friendly goodbye column closes with reporting that strikes a vastly different tone:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For the record, Lisi denied that Tamerlan Tsarnaev, killed in a firefight with Watertown police, was an FBI informant. He also denied that Ibragim Todashev, a suspected accomplice of Tsarnaev in a triple murder in Waltham, was an FBI informant.
       </p>
       <p>
        Todashev was shot dead by an FBI agent in Florida two months after the Marathon bombings, after he allegedly attacked the agent and a Massachusetts state trooper.
       </p>
       <p>
        That I had to ask the question — and that there are others in law enforcement who suspect that one or both were FBI informants — suggests whoever replaces Vince Lisi has their work cut out for them. Like statutes, candor has its limitations.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Talk about burying the lede.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suspicions
       <a href="https://privacysos.org/node/1704">
        have long swirled
       </a>
       in Boston about the true nature of Tamerlan Tsarnaev's relationship with the FBI, dating back to at least 2011. In March 2014 the defense team for Tamerlan's younger brother
       <a href="https://privacysos.org/node/1365">
        filed a brief
       </a>
       in federal court asserting that the FBI had tried to recruit the elder Tsarnaev.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI has always denied that Tamerlan ever worked for them in any capacity as an informant. In response to the Tsarnaev defense motion, the DOJ reported that it could discover "no evidence" to support the claim that the Bureau approached Tamerlan with such a request.
      </p>
      <p>
       But despite these denials, the rumors Globe columnist Kevin Cullen reports do not constitute the first public questions government officials have raised about the FBI's conduct—or honesty—in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in October 2013, Senator Chuck Grassley wrote the FBI a public letter asking,
       <a href="https://privacysos.org/node/1704">
        among other questions
       </a>
       , whether Tamerlan was ever approached to inform for the FBI—and if not, why not. Grassley's letter was apparently prompted by concerns brought to the Iowa republican by Cambridge law enforcement whistleblowers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Among those whistleblowers may have been an MIT police officer who was on duty the night officer Sean Collier was killed on campus. The officer later told local reporters that he and other MIT cops suspected the
       <a href="https://privacysos.org/node/1385">
        FBI knew where Tamerlan
       </a>
       was that fateful night, and that the bomber was under FBI surveillance. (This is notable in part because the FBI's official narrative states that the Bureau did not know who the brothers were until much later, after a firefight in Watertown that ended with Tamerlan's death and Dzokhar's escape.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Watertown police chief Ed Deveau has since publicly
       <a href="https://privacysos.org/node/1722">
        questioned
       </a>
       the FBI's conduct that week, suggesting that had the bureau recognized the man they'd previously investigated, Collier would be alive and the shootout in his town never would have happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rumors about Tamerlan's involvement with the FBI are nothing new. Despite having paid very close attention to the case over the past few years, however, I've never heard that Ibragim Todashev, the man killed by FBI agents in Orlando just a month after the marathon attacks, could have also been an informant.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the Tsarnaev trial, Todashev's mother in law stood outside of federal court in Boston
       <a href="https://privacysos.org/node/1561">
        holding a sign
       </a>
       emblazoned with a photo of her deceased son in law, along with the words "I am dead because I knew the Tsarnaevs. I knew the truth." (Read much more about the strange case of the Todashev killing

       ,

       <a href="https://privacysos.org/node/1704">
        here
       </a>
       .)
      </p>
      <p>
       Russian American journalist Masha Gessen wrote a book about the Tsarnaev brothers, in which she
       <a href="https://privacysos.org/node/1707">
        asserts
       </a>
       that "the explanation that best fits the facts" in the case is "a cover-up."
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon the publication of Gessen's book in April 2015, none other than former DHS head Janet Napolitano
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/books/review/the-brothers-masha-gessens-book-about-the-boston-marathon-bombers.html">
        took to the New York Times
       </a>
       opinion pages to slam the author as a conspiracy theorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       But according to local gumshoe Kevin Cullen, there are plenty of local cops in the Boston area who think there's something to that theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in a few weeks, the Hollywood film about the Boston FBI's most infamous informant ever, Whitey Bulger, airs in move theaters nationwide.

       If I may quote the first paragraph from that article you linked:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no episode more disturbing and disruptive in Boston’s history than the April 15, 2013, bombing that killed three and injured more than 260 — including 16 who lost limbs. It was followed by a violent, chaotic escape attempt during which an M.I.T. police officer was killed, an exhaustive manhunt took place and the governor ordered those in greater Boston to “shelter in place.” By the time Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving brother of the two bombers, was discovered hiding in a boat dry-docked in a backyard, everyone in the region was touched, either physically or emotionally, by this crime.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Paint the picture Janet. Good, good.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Up to this point, Gessen’s narrative is straightforward and captivating. In the final chapters, however, the book becomes curiouser and curiouser; Gessen seems to become a conspiracy theorist. She postulates that the F.B.I. recruited Tamerlan as an informant during their visits to the Tsarnaev home in 2011. She then surmises that Tamerlan went rogue and participated in the killing of three friends with whom he dealt marijuana. She goes further, and suggests that after the bombings, the F.B.I. delayed telling Boston law enforcement about Tamerlan’s identity because they wanted to reach him first, kill him and hide his presence as an informant. Gessen likens this alleged behavior to the F.B.I.’s use of sting operations, and she implies that the bureau has been entrapping defendants as opposed to finding real terrorists. And, finally, relying on the words of “several” unnamed explosives experts, she asserts that the Tsarnaevs must have had help constructing the bombs, despite the presence of explicit instructions on the Internet and in Inspire, a jihadist magazine.
       </p>
