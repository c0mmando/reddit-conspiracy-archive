       Tsunamis and floods, and men's hearts are certainly fearing what is happening to this world. In America in 2010, a record was set for the number of Federal Disaster Declarations given over a year. That number was 81. In 2011, that number was broken again, with 99 Disaster Declarations given, costing over 32 Billion Dollars. And 2012 produced another year of record breaking disasters. Dr. Robert Hartwig states ... "The number of U.S. disaster declarations has been trending sharply upward, particularly over the past 15 years." (Source) ...

       <strong>
        "Please behave in this manner so you will be easier to control. That whole 'eye-for-an-eye' thing is too troublesome for us, so now we need you to just 'turn the other cheek.'"

       Therefore, you should take prophecy seriously. I've always thought about it in this fashion anyway. It's the followers that make it all happen according to their beliefs.

       Great post - agreed. Also, add the ridiculous amount of predictive programming that's blatant in dozens of movies related to 9/23 (9/22-9/24). This has been thoroughly outlined in many well-done videos.

       I can tell you that lots of shit dying in California.  The coastal tide pools are dead.  The fish are sick and in low numbers.  We saw leopard seals in Fort Bragg recently.  The trees are all sick and weak from drought.  Don't forget that if you type 9 23 2015 into Google, it brings you right to CERN.  The stage is set for a change.  But like always, I'm not going to hold my breath.

       Do you think the rapture will happen? That seems to divide the current religious theorizers. Some think there will be a rapture some think that the rapture is a lie planted by satanic forces.

       The Bible clearly states we all have to experience Revelation.  There is no Rapture.  This is a lie by false prophets to steal your money.

       Matthew 24:41 says, “Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left.” This verse links with a similar illustration in verse 40. A key to understanding the Bible is to examine a verse in its context. The full context begins in verse 36 with, “But of that day and hour [of Jesus Christ's second coming] no one knows.” It ends in verse 44 with, “Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.” Clearly, the topic is preparedness for Christ's second coming.

       Yeah I guess I mean a spiritual transformation or maybe even unveiling of powers or false miracles, definitely I think he will call for global peace through the UN after some sort of muslim false flag a la 9/11, except this time it will be all religions fault, and religion is bad.  The antichrist is here, but he is not in his full satanic form yet

       I swear I read quite a few doom posts like this that had September events leading right up to October 25th, and since you'd collected a lot of this data I was wondering if you knew anything beyond this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason I ask is because I personally liked Russell Brand's "The Trews" YouTube show... I feel like he spreads a good message to people about corruption in society and how we should all fight against it in positive ways.... but there are a lot of people that think he is a psy-op that dances around issues and provides a false sense of leadership so people constantly feel like they are on the verge of change but then do nothing about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well I don't believe that's true, but strangely enough out of nowhere he ended his YouTube program and disappeared after spending all this time rallying people up. I thought he was just being an ass and running off to make money from touring instead of focusing on YouTube, but his latest "world" tour is short as shit - he's doing nothing in September at all, and it only starts in October where he does a few short dates with his last in Australia on Oct 24.
      </p>
      <p>
       This makes me curiously wonder if maybe he and other celebrities/wealthy folk/etc are getting the hell out of dodge for the moment... I mean it's probably just coincidence but it does make me think that if we watch the social elite and a lot of them are going quiet for the next month or two it would actually add some weight to these otherwise far-fetched conspiracy theories revolving around sept-oct.

       Honestly, I havent heard anything about october.  I only know september, through the lunar eclipse on the 27th.
      </p>
      <p>
       Youre absolutely right, I would call them false prophets.  Obviously none of them claim to be prophets, but they use the media to turn celebrity worship into a religion in its own right, and then they continuously let us down (hope and change?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me know if you find anything interesting about the elite changing plans, fleeing, doing anything unusual.  Keep an extra eye on Denver airport

       I don't think many historians would agree with you on that, although I have read and entertained the Roman christ conspiracy theory.  The whole "give unto ceaser what is ceasers" and "no authority exists except which god has chosen"  are kinda suspicious.

       I don't really know much more then that, just the general fact that you can always look to the people in power when huge "totally unexpected" things like this happen, like 9/11.  That would be the romans.  Honestly though, I don't believe it.  I believe he was real, and was really the son of god, but his message was twisted and distorted by the satanists who have been bringing the plan I wrote about to fruition. The most compelling evidence for me though is those two verses I quoted in my last post, cause those definitely dont seem like words jesus would say if he was for real, being the anarchist he kinda was.  Whatever you believe, its fascinating stuff and its hard to think of anything more meaningful to talk about.

       The weird and seemingly paradoxical thing about this is that even the anti-God
       <em>
        is still God

       , for God is everything, and "everything" includes the yin and the yang, the positive and the negative, the up, the down, and everything in between.

       As such, perhaps the true lesson is not necessarily one of choosing the positive over the negative...but of transcending both.

       Unity can compartmentalize itself and create a myriad of separate identities, yet
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       be one.  Take people with schizophrenia, as but one indicative example.  Sybil Dorsett was said to have as many as sixteen different personalities - various of which had exactly no idea about the existence of the others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, God can be visualized as a Sybil Dorsett that separated Itself out into a googolplexian identities throughout existence.   Just as Sybil’s 16 different personalities were each at different stages of awareness with regard to who/what they were and what their relationship was to the true, “host” identity that they in fact were ultimately one with, each of the limitless number of identities that God separated Itself out into is at a different level of awareness and understanding with regard to its ultimate unity with and

       God, literally by definition, is the word that humans have for “Everything that is”.  In other words, God is omnipotent (all powerful), omnipresent (everywhere), and omniscient (all knowing).  Again, strictly Philosophically-speaking, this is the case
       <em>
        necessarily
       </em>
       .  If the thing a person calls “God”
       <em>
        doesn’t
       </em>
       have these qualities, then it, by definition, cannot be “God” (i.e. the word humans have for “everything that is”).  As such, since God
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       indeed all powerful, God
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       in fact very much in control and in charge of everything there is.  In fact, “everything there is” actually
       <em>
        IS
       </em>
       God Itself.
      </p>

       God is not only the source of all energy, God - of necessity -
       <em>
        IS
       </em>

       <em>
        you

      <p>
       There absolutely is.  It’s just that Source is also
       <em>
        beyond
       </em>
       such descriptions.  Source is comprised of the descriptions given to It, but It is also yet more still.  Its being more still, however, does not contradict a limited description of It - so long as that limited description is acknowledged as such.  Therefore, while limiting descriptions used here do apply, they are not ultimately all-encompassing.  In other words, they are “necessary but not sufficient” descriptions of God.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

      <p>
       This is 100% correct, but applies most saliently when attempting a cosmic illustration of Source.  Within the context of limited human understanding, however, there are at least logical, rational implications that the words used to attempt to describe God of necessity have.  Those logical implications can be either logically valid, or logically
       <em>
        in
       </em>
       valid, and they can be judged and assessed on those particular merits.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is understood that in the
       <em>
        ultimate
       </em>
       end of things, our little, human descriptions here on this planet are all for naught.  However, our grasping of certain perspectives from this lowly vantage point still should nonetheless be as clear as they possibly can be.

       There is nothing I’ve stated that should lead anyone to think that I was implying anything other than this.  God being Everything does not abdicate the responsibility that the individual themselves has to still manifest Cosmic Consciousness as best as they possibly can.

       Divine?  No less than any other manifestation necessarily is.

      <p>
       Superior?  Well, some beings are much more evolutionarily advanced than others.  That much is certainly true.  That might be classified as “superior” by some.  That need never keep anyone from still becoming as competent and self-guiding a being as possible, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fearful and disconnected?  Perhaps.  Perhaps not.  I imagine some beings manipulating humanity might very well be fearful and disconnected, but I wouldn’t supposed all of them to be.

       I loved this. I have had many of the same ideas myself. If is where not for the separation of identity there would be no subjective experience. Thus no point in anything. The point is for the natural course of creating beings to experience something completely new but still within the system of "god". Because there is nothing to experience besides God.

       Perhaps ultimate union with and
       <em>
        as
       </em>
       Object is something so out of the jurisdiction of our ability to cognize and abstract about that we can’t even fathom if there would or wouldn’t be a point one way or the other.

        The point is for the natural course of creating beings to experience something completely new but still within the system of "god".

      <p>
       Sounds about right…and as the creating beings continue to experience more and more “somethings” within the system of “God”, a greater level of understanding and awareness develops whereby the being in question understands more and more what their true self and true identity really is…and as they understand more and more and grow greater in their understanding, they arrive at a closer and closer level of cosmic consciousness/cosmic unity.  The being imbues the ability to identify more and more things as part of it’s true greater Self.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        there is nothing to experience besides God.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Exactly this.  God, of course, is limitless, so the experiencing of the Self can be concomitantly expansive.  This reminds me of a quote by the great
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Vivekananda">
        Swami Vivekananda
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        God is a circle whose circumference is nowhere, but whose center is everywhere.
        <del>
         He
        </del>
        It works through all hands, sees through all eyes, walks on all feet, breathes through all bodies, lives in all life, speaks through every mouth, and thinks through every brain.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I would ad to this that God is no less the dog, cat, running stream, blazing fire, or the air or tree or mountain than anything else.  God is, again, everything.

       Matthew 24:41 says, “Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left.” This verse links with a similar illustration in verse 40. A key to understanding the Bible is to examine a verse in its context. The full context begins in verse 36 with, “But of that day and hour [of Jesus Christ's second coming] no one knows.” It ends in verse 44 with, “Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.” Clearly, the topic is preparedness for Christ's second coming.

       Unity can compartmentalize itself and create a myriad of separate identities, yet
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       be one.  Take people with schizophrenia, as but one indicative example.  Sybil Dorsett was said to have as many as sixteen different personalities - various of which had exactly no idea about the existence of the others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, God can be visualized as a Sybil Dorsett that separated Itself out into a googolplexian identities throughout existence.   Just as Sybil’s 16 different personalities were each at different stages of awareness with regard to who/what they were and what their relationship was to the true, “host” identity that they in fact were ultimately one with, each of the limitless number of identities that God separated Itself out into is at a different level of awareness and understanding with regard to its ultimate unity with and

       God, literally by definition, is the word that humans have for “Everything that is”.  In other words, God is omnipotent (all powerful), omnipresent (everywhere), and omniscient (all knowing).  Again, strictly Philosophically-speaking, this is the case
       <em>
        necessarily
       </em>
       .  If the thing a person calls “God”
       <em>
        doesn’t
       </em>
       have these qualities, then it, by definition, cannot be “God” (i.e. the word humans have for “everything that is”).  As such, since God
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       indeed all powerful, God
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       in fact very much in control and in charge of everything there is.  In fact, “everything there is” actually
       <em>
        IS
       </em>
       God Itself.

       such descriptions.  Source is comprised of the descriptions given to It, but It is also yet more still.  Its being more still, however, does not contradict a limited description of It - so long as that limited description is acknowledged as such.  Therefore, while limiting descriptions used here do apply, they are not ultimately all-encompassing.  In other words, they are “necessary but not sufficient” descriptions of God.

       This is 100% correct, but applies most saliently when attempting a cosmic illustration of Source.  Within the context of limited human understanding, however, there are at least logical, rational implications that the words used to attempt to describe God of necessity have.  Those logical implications can be either logically valid, or logically

       valid, and they can be judged and assessed on those particular merits.

       end of things, our little, human descriptions here on this planet are all for naught.  However, our grasping of certain perspectives from this lowly vantage point still should nonetheless be as clear as they possibly can be.

       There is nothing I’ve stated that should lead anyone to think that I was implying anything other than this.  God being Everything does not abdicate the responsibility that the individual themselves has to still manifest Cosmic Consciousness as best as they possibly can.

       There has definitely been a group that has exploited much of the human species for a very, very long time indeed.

       Among other things, yes, this is correct.  Fear is one of the biggest tools used.

       Divine?  No less than any other manifestation necessarily is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior?  Well, some beings are much more evolutionarily advanced than others.  That much is certainly true.  That might be classified as “superior” by some.  That need never keep anyone from still becoming as competent and self-guiding a being as possible, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fearful and disconnected?  Perhaps.  Perhaps not.  I imagine some beings manipulating humanity might very well be fearful and disconnected, but I wouldn’t supposed all of them to be.

       Thank you for saying this.  Fair enough then.  Glad we are not “fighting”.  People can disagree without being unnecessarily antagonistic to one another.  Apologies for any harshness above.
