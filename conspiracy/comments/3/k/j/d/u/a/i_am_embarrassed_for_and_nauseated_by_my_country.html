I talk to people at work and at church that are waking up.  Even old people are waking up.  My 61-year-old mother tells me all about her old lady friends who are waking up. When I woke up 3 years ago, I felt like you.  Not anymore. There is an awakening happening.  This is the age of Aquarius.  These liars don&#39;t have much longer.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m starting to believe the greatest conspiracy is that people aren&#39;t awake. So many people I talk with seem to know the two parties are a sham. But at the same time feel voting is the only way to change the system.... People are fed up, but not fed up enough to do anything. We&#39;re in a state of perpetual apathetic agony. Cognitive dissonance is rampant. I guess it&#39;s the only way to cope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well for one thing we&#39;re overmedicated.  Even those of us who aren&#39;t prescribed medication have it added (without our consent) to our drinking water.  I believe you and I are on the cutting edge of something that will be worldwide.  The awakening has begun and more people are waking up every day.  Just look at how fast r/conspiracy has grown since Sandy Hook.  How can anybody believe the authorities would have allowed a bunch of slaughtered children&#39;s bodies to lay around a school growing cold until the cover of night?  They would have rushed each and every one of those children off in an ambulance, whether they had a pulse or not. (Sandy Hook woke me up.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I witnessed the towers fall from my Brooklyn fire escape.  I was 34 years old.  Got out of NYC in January of 2003.  Been living in Iceland ever since.  Simply put, I did not want my taxes to support the American war machine.  I was hoping things would change when Obama was elected, but his election only solidified my belief that the deep state is running the show, not the democratically elected mouthpieces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kind words.  Thank you.  Iceland is the most peaceful country on the planet.  I have two sons and I have the privilege of being able to raise them without fear.  When I was a kid, growing up in the States, fear was everywhere--more-so now, of course.  Back then, for me, fear was that missing kid on the milk carton.  In Iceland, that sort of fear does not exist.  My children have no fear.  They are informed about the degradations of mankind, but I tell them that they can aim for a future where there is no more war.  The only reality they have lived in is the absolute peace of Iceland.  Imagine growing up that way.  Perhaps when civilisation has progressed beyond its infancy, the whole planet will be peaceful.  I imagine there must be civilisations elsewhere in the galaxy and, indeed, the universe, that have progressed to that point.  I would like to see what that looks like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear ya bro, but don&#39;t give up.  Right now is the moment we can take the power back.</p>

<p>This is gonna sound crazy, but good folks in the military have been working for decades on a plan to get rid of the NWO and right the ship of state.</p>

<p>9/11 was a huge wake up call for everybody, especially the military and agency folks.  Believe it or not, about 70-80% our on our side and want the same as we do, to get rid of the scum who hijacked our country.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a long and complicated saga, but the basic idea is to knock them out financially and then round up ALL the criminal elite class.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been tracking this story over at <a href="/r/greenlight">/r/greenlight</a>, read the sidebar for a general description of what&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>The NWO/Illuminati are fighting themselves now as the actions of this plan have started.  This is our time.</p>

<p>The only piece missing, and it&#39;s a critical one, is mass support from the populace.  We need to show that we want this change and will fight with all we have to make it happen. I don&#39;t know how we do this, but we have to, or we in the west will get left behind while the rest of the world moves on.</p>

<p>The first big part of the financial take down is about to happen, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/greenlight/comments/3jv5v4/neil_keenan_update_september_3_2015_uno_dos_tres/">here&#39;s the latest on that.</a></p>

<p>Hang in there man, we need you now more than ever.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an obligatory rally call to ramp up moral! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-l01lOKj3k">Take the Power Back</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just shy of 23. I remember the first week after it happened and everyone wanted to unite and stand together. </p>

<p>Then I personally witnessed a waitress having a non-white man (I honestly cannot remember his ethnicity other than he wasn&#39;t caucasian) arrested for making an obvious joke about being a terrorist. This was in Los Angeles, off the Sunset Strip. </p>

<p>That moment stuck with me as we shifted into an era of fear and loss of civil liberties. There was an instance within my online group of friends where someone had the feds show up to her home because she made an offhand hopeful comment about GWB dying of sickness. They confiscated her computer, but we at least all had a laugh over the fact that all they were going to find was m/m slash fan fiction.</p>

<p>It was a really weird, bizarre time. We wanted to challenge what was happening, but it was hard to know how. Information sharing wasn&#39;t what it is now, you had to know where to look and how to find things.</p>

<p>But at least the porny fan fiction carried on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was 8 years old (or so. First grade). I don&#39;t remember everything, but I absolutely believed the official story. For a long time after that. I remember learning a few years later about the conspiracy theory from my grade school teacher, and it was taught in a manner of &quot;this is shamefull. People died and the conspiracy people are trying to dilute what actually happened&quot;, etc. There was a shame for anyone who went against it.</p>

<p>This is gonna sound really stupid, but I was young and stupid at the time. I think the South Park 911 conspiracy episode had a big effect on me not believing, and gave me feelings like all the conspiracy theorists are crazy, and that 911 was clearly done by some &quot;pissed off arabs&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even know why I posted this. Seemed relevant, but after reading your comment again it isn&#39;t really.</p>
