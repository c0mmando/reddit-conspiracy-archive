       A couple of the replies are interesting, including at least two which hint at federal involvement in her anecdote, notably the reply and exchange with user Neko_ .
      </p>
      <p>
       An interesting third reply, which was deleted, said "If you're doing something illegal, stop now." This indicated insider knowledge about the program, but it also demonstrated the lack of information that those complicit in the program have. What they don't know is that even if she were criminal (which of course is not a prerequisite to the program) it wouldn't stop based on her behaviors. The stalking continues as long as the program continues, by all accounts. That the proclamation was deleted is also a little insight into the phenomenon, since it's exactly the sort of comment that directors of the program wouldn't like, but that an innocent user would never think to delete.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also interesting that those who suggest to her that she is being surveilled don't use the term Gang Stalking. A skeptic would say this supports their side. To me it more reveals that many of those complicit in the program are unaware of the extent and design of it. These people, with no serious training, actually believe that they have been tasked for surveillance, rather than utilized as part of an elaborate network that they cannot see.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are several people accusing her of being a paranoid schizophrenic, despite the fact that she's neither paranoid, nor indicates the existence of any other delusions. Some of these commenters are almost certainly shills since, for instance, if I didn't have preexisting knowledge about the program, I would never think "This lady's crazy." I would just say "Wow, what a coincidence!" Thus, it's not a realistic reaction to her story, even as a joke, without inside knowledge about so-called Gang Stalking tactics.

       Just my .02 cents after listening to podcasts on gang stalking where they use voice to skull and some sort of microwaves system along with the many other ways they do. Talked about voice cloning and this technology linked in my mond to the types of weapons that lady said brought the towers down. DEW or whatever.
But I think they are noticing bored ass old men. Maybe they are actually are being perverted tracking eye candy down. I mean if you don't have shit to do old people just jang out with disposable incomes doing nothing. 
I just think they would incorporate other tactics that would stand out more than seeing a stalker.

       Pretty interesting that you play up the less credible claims of gang stalking (which I don't believe), but you become so reasonably skeptical the moment you hear of one that is very probable. That's pretty unbelievable. Like, if I wanted the program to continue, so that I could watch as thousands of helpless Americans are driven by madness to murder and suicide, I would say the exact same as you. It's uncanny, almost like you enjoy sadism.

       The federal government does have the means, more or less, to carry out such a campaign. They wouldn't under ordinary circumstances attack a high school girl with such ferocity, although they would do so if they thought it would hurt an adult target who she was associated with. One thing that strikes me about the program is that it is utterly sociopathic in nature, and forgiving of any collateral damage whatsoever. It's the one American program I've heard of that cheerfully emrbraces the destruction of innocents wholesale.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I am still healthily suspicious of this news story. My opinion is that modern COINTELPRO really kicked off the year this article was published, so it's right on the cusp. It would be very surprising for them to have been this aggressive at the beginning of the program, especially against a  17-year-old.

       lol. You realize that "an old guy she recognizes around town" is not "gang stalking"? Even if your extremely paranoid supposition that this old man is specifically targeting or "stalking" this girl were true, it has nothing to do with proving or validating your idea of "gang stalking".
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion people like you who talk about this shit are so nuts that you basically just put anyone who disagrees with you (or points out your paranoia / irrational thought processes) as "part of a gang stalking thing" --- you just use any possible thing to justify and validate and self-affirm your pre-existing paranoia or delusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just FYI? That literally IS what a 'schizophrenic' or mentally ill person with paranoid delusions does.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Let me give you an example from my own life. I know a person who is drastically mentally ill - but he doesn't know that - because he is so mentally ill. I've known him from childhood and I always tried to be nice to him / good to him - because I know he's mentally ill. I hadn't seen him in years and we ran into each other - he was with a girlfriend who incidentally wanted to leave him because he was mentally ill and he was  stealing/leeching all of her money while not showering, not working, and just smoking pot all day while playing video games
       </strong>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       ....
       <strong>
        anyway, this guy found cigarette butts in his garage and thought "I was there in his garage secretly" because "those cigarette butts look like ones I smoke" (even though really they weren't, and that made no sense, and his paranoid delusion was not based in reality, and I had no reason to "hang out in his garage smoking cigarettes just to mess with him or fuck with him
       </strong>
       -- I had spent
       <em>
        my whole life
       </em>
       specifically trying to be nice to him and take care of him / make him feel better / be his friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also thought I was trying to make his girlfriend leave him - when in reality I had also known HER for her whole life (since we were kids) and I was absolutely not attracted to her - she repulsed me in every possible way romantically.
      </p>
      <p>
       But because he is mentally ill - he just takes any random thing he sees in the external world - and
       <strong>
        super-imposes his pre-existing mental illness, delusions, and paranoia onto it
       </strong>
       , creating some big scary story like "gang stalking" (in your case) -- or "me secretly hiding in his garage doing nothing and smoking cigarettes to fuck with him" in the case of my mentally ill friend. In the case of someone who believes in gang-stalking, you just choose to think anyone who tells you how crazy you are being is "part of some big conspiracy gang-stalking happening against you". He saw some cigarette butts in his garage, and immediately connected them in his mentally ill mind to me (someone he was worried about 'stealing his girlfriend' - because his girlfriend liked me because I was less insane than he was and I was just polite to her).
      </p>
      <p>
       Get out of the conspiracy world, man, it's driving you crazy. Paranoid delusions make it impossible to have a meaningful conversation with someone and I'm almost certain that I'll regret even posting in your thread.

       I suppose that's true. Seeing as how you didn't respond in a rational way to the summary at the top, you're the one who is not contributing to meaningful conversation. I will refrain from calling you schizophrenic though--no need to thank me.

       I did that, you responded by trying to belittle me (because that's the only way you can respond) and ignoring what I said because it doesn't  fit what you want to believe. Can't get much simpler than simple logic, which I'll repeat for you here, bud, and yes I'm "trying to help" because I'm not sure if you're even serious or if you are one of the mentally ill people who is obsessed with this idea of gang-stalking:

        You realize that "an old guy she recognizes around town" is not "gang stalking"? Even if your extremely paranoid supposition that this old man is specifically targeting or "stalking" this girl were true, it has nothing to do with proving or validating your idea of "gang stalking".

       The nuances of the methodology is rife for this kind of dismissal. The program is meant to be subtle. That's why it's actually called Zersetzung among those who are familiar, because that references the intended effect. It means dissolution of the soul. To dissolve. Gradual. Gang stalking is just a disinformation term.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        You see an old man sitting. You think nothing of it. And the next day, he's there again. That's odd, but not really. Over the weeks, you see him there most days, but occasionally he's not. He appears to be waiting for somebody that never comes.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Your route isn't the same each day. You'll be ten minutes fast, or ten minutes slow, but it doesn't matter. You may be an hour late for work one day, and the old man is always there. He won't speak to you. He'll never say hi. In fact, he's on his cell phone every time you pass, implying that he knows somebody, and yet he's alone. He'll glance at you, but he won't look at you. Over months, and sometimes years, he will never make an indication that you exist. He will behave as though he senses a ghost when you're around, he will be very alert to your presence, but he will also evoke a kind of sadness.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Most of the time he will pull his cell phone out of his pocket the moment he senses your approach. He will read, or type, but he won't really seem engaged.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        There's something off about him, but you don't know what. It's almost like he's there just for you, but that's crazy. He serves no purpose. If he was there to surveil, why make it so obvious? And if he were there to observe you, or take your measure, why has he so conspicuously failed to once meet you in the eyes, or ask a question, or even say Hi.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Nothing about this man seems to belong, but it would almost be odd for you to initiate contact. You've had this relationship of ignoring each other forever now, so that's there almost a no-contact pact. And the truth is that you've now become afraid to talk to him. You don't want to confirm his existence. The way he treats you like a ghost, you've now come to regard him the same.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        You switch jobs. Your path has changed. Guess you'll never see the ghost ever again.

       But understand this is only one tiny facet of the entire program. It's far deeper. I'm sure it doesn't sound like much to you, but for a sensitive target, this part of the program alone will break them down.
      </p>
      <p>
       But why all this? The truth is this: remember 9/11, and that whole war on terror and shit? Well there is a fuck ton of money wrapped up in it. Probably more than congress even knows. But there aren't actually any terrorists to speak of. They're statistically nonexistent. But what about this huge new agency? The DHS? We can't just lay off a hundred thousand employees! Besides, we have all this money.

       The result: an American Stasi.

       LOL. Are you even serious? You're connecting a girl who sees an old guy sitting around on the bench in the mornings in her town to "DHS 9/11 and Stasi", and you think this is a good example of how the government is trying to make you think you're crazy? By seating an old man on a bench somewhere who you never interact with, who never interacts with or molests you in any way? This is why I said you're reading too much conspiracy shit and it's contributing to mental illness. You think maybe this is the reason why people think "conspiracy theorists" are crazy?

       You are doing exactly what I said in my, what did you call it? Pointless anecdote, or something? You're taking a normal thing (a feeling, or a woman posting about seeing an old guy sitting on a bench in the morning on her way to work, who she imagines is waiting for someone - then switching jobs and seeing another old guy or the same old guy sitting on another bench on her walk to work again) and super-imposing onto it your paranoia and pre-existing delusions, fears, and beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing I can say to you will get past your crazy-shield - just like the woman in the youtube video I linked won't ever be convinced that the post men aren't stalking her. The woman whose experience/post you are using to extrapolate all of this insane bullshit from was just a random person, not a conspiracy theorist, not a "target" of some monolithic conspiracy trying to "dissolve her soul" or "break her".
      </p>
      <p>
       I live in a town, I see the same people daily occasionally because we live in the same geographical region. Sometimes they are on their cell phone, sometimes I'm on my cell phone. Sometimes
       <strong>
        they're old men sitting on a bench because there is a fucking nursing home nearby in our town
       </strong>
       , and sometimes, gasp, they even wave to me as I ride by on my motorcycle. A crazy person (or someone like you) might interpret this as "gang stalking" or "someone trying to break them" (
       <strong>
        because that's what the fucking DEFINITION of paranoid delusions are, it's utterly self-absorbed and self-centered - you are - so you think everyone else and all random events in your life are also ALL ABOUT YOU
       </strong>
       ), when really it's an old guy who has nothing better to do who likes the fact that I'm young and living/enjoying my life - so he waves to me or gives me a thumbs up as I ride by on my motorcycle... or just sits there on his bench.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have apparently already done a good job of breaking your own self with all this complex paranoia.
       <strong>
        You have an extremely complex paranoid narrative wrapped around totally innocuous and simple events that take place in the lives of billions of people every day around the planet
       </strong>
       . I'm sorry that the mental world you have crafted for yourself to live in is such a scary hopeless place.

They are the real harm and they are what really does break "sensitive people", people who are already suffering from mental illness find your type of posting and stick to it like glue, and it poisons their mind and life and ability to interact with others.

       You guys always respond the same way. My story was reasonably and evenly told.
      </p>
      <p>
       A rational response would be to question what I think the program is trying to accomplish, or ask what I mean by Zersetzung, or Stasi; or to ask who I think the old man actually is, and who employs him. You could ask how this tactic fits into a larger program, and what the other facets of the program are. If you were trying to be helpful, learning more details about what you are implying are my "delusions," would be far more helpful in finding weaknesses in my presumed imaginary world. Instead, your response--with all its intermittent boldness--reeks of hysteria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yelling at somebody and telling them they're crazy accomplishes absolutely zero. I can tell that you're smart enough to know that. Your reaction just isn't... real.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I am not going to make accusations, I am going to assume the best. I'm going to assume that you're afraid to believe. Covering your eyes isn't going to help.

       is such a hallmark of a crazy/irrational person who is existing in a solipsistic little bubble. If you don't know that term, go look it up, because you're in one.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want me to play along with a belief you have and you want me to help you use it to self-aggrandize (telling me I could "ask you how this tactic fits into a larger program, blahblahblahblahblah"), or "ask you to elaborate on things you've already clearly elaborated on" - as though you will enlighten me with your beliefs even though they totally ignore simple logic (which you likewise don't respond to, ever).
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't seem to be capable of logic or understanding simple rational thoughts communicated to you very clearly. You are here to talk to us about a mountain of paranoid delusions that you are sitting on a throne at the top of - which is why you can't actually address anything that anyone else says, except for "wishing other people would do what you want and play along with your beliefs even though those beliefs are skewed and demonstrably not sane". You bear the hallmarks of all the genuinely crazy people I've met in my life - unable to care about
       <em>
        or understand why they should care about
       </em>
       perspectives beyond their own - so you literally say things like "you're not real" or take
       <em>
        text that disagrees with you
       </em>
       as "yelling at you".
      </p>
      <p>
       You have built a big delusion out of a normal human experience (seeing another person who lives in your community day after day, because you both go outside your home onto the same town's streets, day after day), and tell me I should "ask who you think employs him". Do you not realize that's insane?

       Where in heaven are you getting this stuff? I made a post offering up information about unconstitutional (and frankly evil) counterintelligence operations in America. It's your choice whether you want to hear more, or try to understand where I'm personally coming from.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've spent a lot of time attacking this one example of the so-called gang stalking phenomenon, explaining how this one small example makes me insane. Let me clarify for you, since you seem to lack any sense proportion or mental clarity: if this one post were all there was to the gang stalking program, you would be right that I was insane. But it's not, and I didn't represent that it was, and I strongly suspect that you know otherwise. I just don't believe anyone as capable of typing words into a keyboard (as you apparently are) could also simultaneously be so aggressively stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Come to think of it, your method of rhetoric would probably be pretty effective for discrediting an opponent, wouldn't it? Locate some perceived weakness in their argument and then: Attack! Stay on point, and
       <em>
        attack
       </em>
       the weakness. But I am not making an argument, I'm just telling you as much as I know, as well as I know it.

       Actually I am personally starting to believe these gang stalking posts are in fact the only real gang stalking that ever happens - like, they are basically a cruel prank on any paranoid people who read them, essentially trying to convince weaker minds that the world exists to bully them.

       That the kind of clever analysis that can only be derived from projection. I applaud your self-awareness.

       I dunno man, I think he was legitimately trying to help you but after realising he was banging his head against a wall for nothing he just disconnected from the convo, like I'm going to. Peace

       What he was doing was called gaslighting, meaning trying to convince someone that they're mentally ill, and it's widely recognized as one of the most evil things that you can do. And in so doing, he convinced you that he was legitimately trying to help. The definition of evil, if ever there were one.
