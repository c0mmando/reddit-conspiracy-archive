<p>The main question I mean to ask is what particularly would Cheney or Bush or any political power gain from going to war for Oil? I mean, most definitely oil companies would benefit, but I don&#39;t see them giving money to politicians as a thank you, or do they? How does it impact them?</p>

<p>I found this &#39;disappeared&#39; article on archive.org, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061130065813/http://villagevoice.com/news/0648,lombardi,75156,2.html">&quot;Death by Dust -- The frightening link between the 9-11 toxic cloud and cancer&quot;</a></p>

<p>They KNEW it was nuclear in nature and they didn&#39;t tell the workers, just let em keep on working without so much as a potassium iodide pill to protect them. Fucking infuriating:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At times, the detectives would take shelter in wooden sheds, in an attempt to get away from what Walcott likes to call &quot;all that freaking bad air.&quot; One day, he was sitting in the shed with his colleagues, eating candy bars and drinking sodas, when <strong>some FBI agents entered. They were dressed in full haz-mat suits, complete with head masks, which they had sealed shut with duct tape to ward off the fumes.</strong> As Walcott took in the scene, contrasting the well-protected FBI agents with the New York cops wearing respirator masks, one thought entered his mind: What is wrong with this picture?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And equal is the number of those that choose to turn a blind eye. Whom do we blame? Can we then shift some of the blame on those wilfully ignorant and asleep? For example, I have told some friends, but they tell me to shut up and get with the program - nothing can be done, so just live your life how you can. They don&#39;t want to hear any of it. I think people like that are equally disastrous to our society. They are complicit. Its not merely the &quot;evil&quot; rulers at the top.

<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cnf0I2dQ0i0">G Edward Griffin&#39;s interview of a Russian Spy</a> -   This all correlates with the concept of a &quot;culture war&quot; to subvert the U.S., and how the Neo-Conservatives are trying to find a way to un-do the damage to US culture.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this &quot;spy&quot; may actually be part of a broader attempt at covering over the globalist agenda and misdirect anger over the culture war toward Russia instead of at the globalists.  In order to install a NWO, America must be brought low and other countries must be raised up.  (E.G. Level the playing field for all countries.)  In this sense, the Neo-Conservatives are trying to consolidate and regiment the U.S. back into a distinct country with nationalism.</p>

 had nothing to to with the Iraq War except as those attacks were used for scare power.  </p>

<p>You are asking two questions. 
The reason for the Iraq War, and wonder if it was about oil, do you have another reason some U.S. leaders would want to spend a few trillion on an invasion. </p>

<p>As for the corruption of government elected and appointed, the benefit is not always direct cash, it comes from job offers and invitations to invest in a sure thing here and there, and other networked opportunities, and contracts for this company or that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the best explanation I have seen for motive was based around Brady Bonds. google Brady Bonds and 9/11 and you&#39;ll get some informative stuff. I think that was the motive for the specific timing and target. bigger picture I think the monetary profit from getting those middle east wars going is astronomical. all countries were among last hold outs to have world banks in their countries. now they have them. also Heroin. grown and exported. whoever is occupying Afghanistan controls most of the worlds Heroin production. -- and domestically we handed over our civil liberties that day - exactly where that will lead - we are still to find out, </p>

<p>but look up Brady Bonds, best concrete specificity I&#39;ve seen on the question yet, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have almost successfully convinced my uncle who recently retired as a GM of a big bank. When he was working, he was too busy for all this. At first he was totally opposed to the idea. But by slowly bringing it up in a way that he can process it, has helped. The trick is to get them to bring it up as well. If you constantly bring it up, they feel they are being led along and quickly go into defensive. Let them feel as though they are also figuring it out, and be patient while they do.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>what particularly would Cheney or Bush or any political power gain</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the Germans gained when they burned the Reichstag building: a sway in public opinion cemented through panic. Before 9/11, the main news was Bush&#39;s financial irresponsibility, and impending investigations. Following the attack, there was nothing else anyone could focus on for weeks or months. And without the attack, a support for increased surveillance, an invasion of middle eastern countries (most of which being Israel&#39;s rivals, go figure), and a &#39;by any means necessary&#39; attitude to fighting the nation&#39;s &#39;enemies&#39; would never have been supported by the public.</p>

<p>Hermann GÃ¶ring said it best: &quot;The people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shortly before 9/11 Iraq began selling oil for Euros instead of USD. This move helped begin the death of the petrodollar (the system by which USD retains reserve currency status). The US powers will do anything possible to make sure this doesn&#39;t happen.. which includes going to war.</p>

<p>All that is left, then, is to garner popular support for the war. As another poster pointed out, Hermann GÃ¶ring said it best:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were many motives behind 9/11 in my opinion. The invasion of Afghanistan. Heroin was made illegal in Afghanistan some time before the invasion, they used this type of fear mongering to invade Iraq which was mainly for oil and because saddam hussain wanted to change oil to the euro instead of the dollar. </p>

<p>A day before 9/11 rumsfield stated that they couldn&#39;t account for 2 trillion in funds. It just so happens that the plane hit the area where accountants were working and the files were destroyed. </p>

<p>Larry Silverstein made billions from the insurance policy he took out months before. </p>

<p>There are also many other reasons why the 9/11 attacks were carried out. </p>
