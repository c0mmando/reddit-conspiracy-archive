       It's probably a stupid question, but I know Cheney and Bush testified behind closed doors, how was this allowed? What did they testify for?
      </p>
      <p>
       The main question I mean to ask is what particularly would Cheney or Bush or any political power gain from going to war for Oil? I mean, most definitely oil companies would benefit, but I don't see them giving money to politicians as a thank you, or do they? How does it impact them?

       They KNEW it was nuclear in nature and they didn't tell the workers, just let em keep on working without so much as a potassium iodide pill to protect them. Fucking infuriating:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At times, the detectives would take shelter in wooden sheds, in an attempt to get away from what Walcott likes to call "all that freaking bad air." One day, he was sitting in the shed with his colleagues, eating candy bars and drinking sodas, when
        <strong>
         some FBI agents entered. They were dressed in full haz-mat suits, complete with head masks, which they had sealed shut with duct tape to ward off the fumes.
        </strong>
        As Walcott took in the scene, contrasting the well-protected FBI agents with the New York cops wearing respirator masks, one thought entered his mind: What is wrong with this picture?

       I'd tenderize his meat with a maple glaze, burn him slow over hickory, and treat him with a honey glaze.

       That's great. Now Jeb will surely order a new investigation and prove for once and all his brother is innocent.

       I'm just wondering which he'll order first, the new investigation or to stop the wars based on known lies. I bet he orders the new investigation first, then to stop the wars.

       And equal is the number of those that choose to turn a blind eye. Whom do we blame? Can we then shift some of the blame on those wilfully ignorant and asleep? For example, I have told some friends, but they tell me to shut up and get with the program - nothing can be done, so just live your life how you can. They don't want to hear any of it. I think people like that are equally disastrous to our society. They are complicit. Its not merely the "evil" rulers at the top. Such "evil" people are spread far and wide the pyramid.

       A lot of them do have a choice. A lot of them do have a choice to learn all the facts, to educate themselves and see what is going on and choose whether they want to speak out or not. But most of them don't. They choose other things, for example facebook, movies, music, partying, other forms of distractions or whatever it may be that they choose in life. This is the worst part of it all. Its like a chicken and egg problem. Who can you ultimately blame?

         -   This all correlates with the concept of a "culture war" to subvert the U.S., and how the Neo-Conservatives are trying to find a way to un-do the damage to US culture.

       Note that this "spy" may actually be part of a broader attempt at covering over the globalist agenda and misdirect anger over the culture war toward Russia instead of at the globalists.  In order to install a NWO, America must be brought low and other countries must be raised up.  (E.G. Level the playing field for all countries.)  In this sense, the Neo-Conservatives are trying to consolidate and regiment the U.S. back into a distinct country with nationalism.

       I just don't think there exists an ELI5 answer. Even the links I provided are just a drop in the bucket. It' s just too complex for a 5 year old to understand. Really.

       Nevertheless, the short answer is that it was a step towards world conquest by the US. And then you need to figure out just who it is that really controls the three branches of US government. Reading the PNAC document and the list of PNAC members makes it clear that it's not who most people think it is.

       The 9/11 Attacks had multiple purposes, but remember, the 9/11 Were used to attack Afghanistan, but 
 had nothing to to with the Iraq War except as those attacks were used for scare power.

The reason for the Iraq War, and wonder if it was about oil, do you have another reason some U.S. leaders would want to spend a few trillion on an invasion.

       the best explanation I have seen for motive was based around Brady Bonds. google Brady Bonds and 9/11 and you'll get some informative stuff. I think that was the motive for the specific timing and target. bigger picture I think the monetary profit from getting those middle east wars going is astronomical. all countries were among last hold outs to have world banks in their countries. now they have them. also Heroin. grown and exported. whoever is occupying Afghanistan controls most of the worlds Heroin production. -- and domestically we handed over our civil liberties that day - exactly where that will lead - we are still to find out,

      <p>
       but look up Brady Bonds, best concrete specificity I've seen on the question yet,

       Yeah I don't really understand. I mainly want to know how to break it down in terms of convincing people that they should reconsider what happened on 9/11. Most people want to know the why of it, and I don't have an ELI5 answer.

       I have almost successfully convinced my uncle who recently retired as a GM of a big bank. When he was working, he was too busy for all this. At first he was totally opposed to the idea. But by slowly bringing it up in a way that he can process it, has helped. The trick is to get them to bring it up as well. If you constantly bring it up, they feel they are being led along and quickly go into defensive. Let them feel as though they are also figuring it out, and be patient while they do.

       Without the petrodollar our economy would collapse, as would the world economy. I can explain further if you'd like, I'm just on mobile at the moment.

       What the Germans gained when they burned the Reichstag building: a sway in public opinion cemented through panic. Before 9/11, the main news was Bush's financial irresponsibility, and impending investigations. Following the attack, there was nothing else anyone could focus on for weeks or months. And without the attack, a support for increased surveillance, an invasion of middle eastern countries (most of which being Israel's rivals, go figure), and a 'by any means necessary' attitude to fighting the nation's 'enemies' would never have been supported by the public.

       Shortly before 9/11 Iraq began selling oil for Euros instead of USD. This move helped begin the death of the petrodollar (the system by which USD retains reserve currency status). The US powers will do anything possible to make sure this doesn't happen.. which includes going to war.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that is left, then, is to garner popular support for the war. As another poster pointed out, Hermann GÃ¶ring said it best:

       There were many motives behind 9/11 in my opinion. The invasion of Afghanistan. Heroin was made illegal in Afghanistan some time before the invasion, they used this type of fear mongering to invade Iraq which was mainly for oil and because saddam hussain wanted to change oil to the euro instead of the dollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       A day before 9/11 rumsfield stated that they couldn't account for 2 trillion in funds. It just so happens that the plane hit the area where accountants were working and the files were destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Larry Silverstein made billions from the insurance policy he took out months before.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also many other reasons why the 9/11 attacks were carried out.
