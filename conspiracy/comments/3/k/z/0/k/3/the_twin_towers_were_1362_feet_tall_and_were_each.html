       9/11 was a form of Shock brainwash. The MSM showed the planes hitting the towers over and over for what seemed like weeks all the while they were chanting the official story.

      <p>
       While America's mind was in shock looking for answers...the MSM rammed it in...and it stuck very well.

         Use In Mental Conditioning
        </strong>
        <br/>
        The sudden conversion methods of mental conditioning rely heavily on TMI. Of the ten elements of control (environment control,
        <strong>
         physical fatigue, mental fatigue, tension or uncertainty,
        </strong>
        confession,
        <strong>
         superstimulation, crisis,
        </strong>
        euphoria, proselytization, and restimulation), six can be seen as stimulation toward TMI. Organizations that practice sudden conversion, such as military recruit training, prisons, and extreme psychiatric treatments, often have individuals enter TMI states which may result in permanent psychological damage.[citation needed]

       I know alot of really smart people who otherwise have well honed critical thinking skills.  But when it comes to this topic, they can't bear to even hear it.   The notion of insider involvement on this kind of alarmingly grand scale is so upsetting to them(and should be) that they just can't bring themselves to think about it - let alone believe it.

       Miracles, Coincidences, Lack of basic Scientific knowledge that you learn in the 8th grade. Believing that a 200,000 Lb. 757 can nosedive into a crater no bigger than a trash dumpster. I just imagine the old, high dive into a glass of water trick. And then supposedly, the impact completely destroyed the plane seeing as no plane was ever excavated from the hole. Both planes that hit the World Trade Center were completely destroyed. No wings, no tail, no fuselage, from TWO different planes. Did you see any large plane debris sitting in the pile? Where'd the planes go? Where'd the black boxes go? And then there's the Pentagon. Another 200,000 lb. 757 or 767 plowed into the side of the building, squeezing itself into a hole not large enough to accommodate the wing span or the tail and no debris from the plane was recovered. And then, as I've been arguing with this troll, the belief that jet fuel poured down the elevator shaft, setting off explosions all over the building. It's just ridiculous what people will believe. And they call us the tin foil hat crowd.

       I find the 9/11 thing fascinating and I do think there are a lot of unanswered questions, but to claim that the laws of physics have been broken in this claim is difficult to justify. Falling from that height, under gravitational acceleration is around 10 secs.

       TLDR : When presented with a fact that conflicts with a strongly held belief, a person will feel mental discomfort called cognitive dissonance.  To alleviate the discomfort, they will fabricate a seemingly logical story to explain away the conflicting fact.

       The scary thing is, when this happens and you pinpoint it and stop it. This is where a paradigm shift occurs. This is where we can push people into seeing things. It can be dramatic. I know I had a rather tough time when I started to come round. Literally broke down into tears.

       No, this simply incorrect and I don't care how many people think upvotes on reddit change history. If this was the case the schizophrenics wouldn't cut the clip. This is an extreme example of confirmation bias, and cherry picked fallacy, and propaganda cuts. Why the fuck did I show up here. It's like telling the sky it's blue and the sky is nah.

       In personality theory, specifically the myers-briggs studies, I've gained a lot of insight and understanding of these different personality types. Which is what I think these people are that you're referring to. They just happen to be the most prevalent personality type, which is bad for anyone who likes to break down complex problems. The specific type of personality I am referring to is the one labeled as 'sensing' because of how they perceive the world. They use established methods to draw conclusions, don't like to deviate, prefer routine and become frustrated with theory. What's terrible is that these people tend to believe popular opinion, and 7.5/10 times they interact with someone, it's with someone who will see the world the same way they do. I worry that 'establishes' truth in their minds as to what is right, "if most people agree with me, then I must be right, right?" So, their perceptions become skewed, and they work against themselves. Then again, had they been interested in new information, discovery or just thinking critically about a closely held issue they may not have participated in the hive mind to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       So part of me wants to sympathize with them, until I interact with one of them, then I realize there's no helping most of these personality types. Especially Sensing/Judging types, those are the irrational rule enforces that do really crazy things in the name of 'protection.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, I had to learn about this a little bit in some introductory engineering courses - they push socialization and communication a lot in engineering. I do more social learning activities in my engineering courses than I do in my communications class, heh. Anyways, here's some interesting information that another university did on the same subject. Sure, it is pseudo-science as the results are hard to replicate, but it's close enough to develop a sort of barometer for understanding or at least recognizing other personality types - it helps me reason with them, lol. I thought you might find it interesting.

       You have to deal with this "type" constantly, not only on the engineering side, but also the management side.  Sounds like you're getting some useful info from those courses - I had to learn it on my own.

       I can answer this, as (I'm embarrassed to say) this was me up til just 3 years ago. I don't buy any of this anymore, but I can give you that argument:

      <blockquote>

        The jet fuel wasn't hot enough to melt the steel, but it weakened it until it collapsed. And once it started collapsing, it just kept going until the whole thing was done. WTC7 was damaged by falling debris and raging fires and suffered a similar fate. I dunno what you're on about "free-fall speed" -- I mean, they did what they did. We all saw it.

       Probably the biggest issue is that I couldn't even imagine that the news would be lying to us, in concert, from several different angles. I couldn't imagine they were all selling the same lie. That's some Twilight Zone shit right there.

       some of the paid shills claim that a CNN camera crew were driving around and mananged to find a parking spot, unload their vehicle, then race to the rooftop up twenty plus floors, setup their camera/equipment, connect to the network feed, then start filming, all in less than three minutes.

       Isn't just flying real planes in to real towers the most feasible thing to do?  What was actually preventing them from just doing that and having to resort to holograms or CGI and actors to pull it off?

       They'd have to be actual American Airlines 757s, because they'd pancake against the 2.5" thick steel of the WTC and fall to the ground, where everybody could see the wreckage. A sub-sonic aluminum jet simply cannot punch through tank-thick steel to the building interior. Even super-sonic armor-piecing missiles are coated with tungsten because steel is not enough.

       The hardness of the material is only one part of the equation.  The mass of the object also plays a part.  The bigger the mass, the more force behind it.  And of course the kinetic energy behind it plays a big part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Industrial applications use jets made of water to cut through steel all the time.  Here is
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E7u0LNUpO4">
        a jet of water cutting through steel nearly as thick as the steel you claim could never be damaged by a airplane made of aluminum.
       </a>
       How is such a thing possible if steel is so much harder than water?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe there are factors that need to be taken in to account other than just the hardness of the material?

      <p>
       And you're misrepresenting my argument. I didn't say "steel could never be damaged by a [sic] airplane made of aluminum". I said a 757 (or 767) flying at subsonic speed cannot punch through 2.5" steel. Can't happen. It'll splat against the side and fall to the ground. Who knows, maybe at Mach 10 it could punch through.

       Taking into account the take-off weight and speed of the planes, it could easily punch through the buildings' exterior, and likely that 2.5" thick protection wasn't offered throughout the exterior.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we reject that those planes hit the towers -- which is a very well documented fact -- we'd have more questions raised than answered, which can't be readily resolved: the air traffic controllers who handled the planes, the pilots who confirmed the presence of a stray Boeing 767 en route to Manhattan, the passengers on the planes, etc.

       One of the lead architects for designing the Twin Towers said that the buildings could withstand the impact of a Boeing 707 -- implying it would penetrate the exterior cladding. Not withstand as in the plane would "squash" against your 2.5" thick exterior columns...no, as in literally absorb the penetrating impact. This is made clear when the architect in question is quoted in that article:

       Doubting that jet fuel-ignited fires, in combination with damage from plane impacts brought down the towers is fine, as long as you can credibly argue against it. I have vague doubts about it myself, but I find the accepted explanation (jet-fuel ignited fires + structural damage) compelling, if speculative in some details.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it's silly to misuse physics to argue against well-established facts which were acknowledged on both sides of the debate. Case in point, your argument that the planes would not penetrate the towers, therefore no planes were used...or something.

       Pressure = force / area. (psi = pounds force per square inch) If you're trying to cut through, you want more force on less impact area. A sharp point, like a missile. (Made of steel, tipped with tungsten so it won't deform.) That's why a sharp knife will cut your toe with only a little force while a brick (much more kinetic energy) dropped on it won't.

       That's all fine and good but everything you are saying doesn't somehow prove that a it is possible for something like an aircraft to punch through steel.  It might not be the most

      <p>
       If you throw the brick hard enough it would easily cut through your toe.
Try not to forget there are other factors at play.  Quit focusing on just the few factors that you think are supporting your argument.

       I would think it would only prove that it is an impractical material to make a missile from when there are obviously much better options available.  It doesn't prove that it is impossible at all.  That is a fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could easily make a missle out of materials even harder than what they are made out of today.  But it wouldn't be practical to do so for various reasons (cost, availability, etc).  That those missiles don't exist doesn't somehow prove that they wouldn't work.

       I mean for real, since a jet of water can cut right through steel.  Can you explain to me why they aren't used as weapons?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, since we are using your bizarre form of logic.  Since the military
       <em>
        doesn't
       </em>
       use them for weapons, doesn't that
       <em>
        prove
       </em>
       that they can't cut through steel?  I mean since they don't use missiles made out of aluminum that that proves they wouldn't be able to cut through steel, surely the lack of water jet gun proves water jets couldn't cut through steel either, right?  That is how you prove things, right?

       They make missiles out of steel, tipped with tungsten, to punch through steel plating, because aluminum will simply pancake against it due to being a much softer metal.

       Yeah we got it.  And by your logic any missile made out of anything else would never work.  Why?  Because they don't make missiles out of anything else.

       You would never make a missile intended to penetrate a harder metal from a softer metal. It doesn't take an engineer to see that. Likewise, a jet with a thin aluminum skin can't punch through thick steel. It's impossible -- regardless of whether you want to defend the official narrative or not.

       explains the kinetic energy of the plane impacts. Impacts were comparable to ~900lbs of TNT, not counting the kinetic energy of the jet fuel combustion. The planes were basically missiles. Also, industrial applications use water jets to slice through steel as u/SirMildredPierce mentioned.

       So you think half a ton of TNT could blast through 2.5" steel box beams... twice? Don't be silly. Imagine firing an aluminum can at a steel plate for a picture of what'd happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       And a water jet saw uses upwards of 60,000 psi to cut through steel. Are you arguing there was that kind of pressure at the tip of the jet? Or are you just saying "soft things can cut too!"

       An object allowed to reach a sufficient amount of kinetic energy can slice through anything. It's not about hardness, it's about velocity and mass.
      </p>
      <p>
       The existence of the planes and their impacts are well documented through manufacturer and airline documentation, radar, air traffic, seismic and eyewitness reports. Rejecting these well-established facts raises more problems than it purports to solve. The planes were not simply hollow aluminum tubes; they were 340,000+ pounds of steel composites, hardware and electronics, and also carried jet fuel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frank DeMartini, one of the architects of the World Trade Center, said it could
       <a href="http://911myths.com/html/wtc_707_impact.html%E2%80%8E">
        withstand the impact of a 707 at landing speeds
       </a>
       , implying that the plane would penetrate the exterior cladding even at a mere ~200mph. Both Towers withstood impacts at much higher speeds.

       The pressures don't need to be that high. Plus, water jets are for specialized applications so the two scenarios aren't really comparable.

       Good find. His...err..."argument" is pretty clinical, and ignores basic facts which are acknowledged by the same sources he cites, for example NIST...which repeatedly mentions the plane impacts.

      <p>
       Like you said in your reply to that linked post, aluminum would not be ideal for the job, but it could still penetrate under sufficient conditions. The design philosophy of a weapon varies upon its intended (ideal) use, so it's no wonder there are no aluminum-coated missiles.

       Yeah, there seem to be varying claims about what the towers were designed against. I've seen landing speed figures thrown out before, so that's what I used. But I admit this claim is somewhat unqualified.
       <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a022793skilling">
        History Commons
       </a>
       offers sources which indicate that engineers considered a 600+ mph impact, though the engineer's analyses seem incomplete and doubtful, according to NIST. History Commons has links to the NIST investigations of these reports too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's important to clarify that the towers
       <em>
        withstood
       </em>
       the impacts (i.e. they remained standing for an extended time afterward) but subsequent conditions, partly brought on from the impacts, ultimately led to their collapse...whatever those particular conditions were.

       I can see how your explanation relates to the Pentagon strike, but WTC 1 &amp; 2 were mostly glass between steel columns, a structure the design engineer compares to a screen door when explaining how the buildings could stand up to a strike by a 707.

         here's the exterior wall
        </a>
       </strong>
       in question.  Notice that the majority of the surface is glass.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, realize that an airliner has "softer" and "harder" parts.  So the landing gear assemblies, wing root structures and the engines (9,570 pounds each) are going to have a lot more concentrated mass compared to the passenger cabin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kinetic energy is calculated as 1/2 mass x
       <em>
        velocity squared
       </em>
       .  It's that squared velocity that really ramps up the destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       At 590 mph, (
       <strong>
        865.33 FT/SEC
       </strong>
       or faster than a .45 caliber bullet), those parts are going to go through the exterior box columns like a sledge hammer through warm butter. (At that speed,
       <em>
        one engine
       </em>
       has ~151 million joules kinetic energy, which is the energy required to lift
       <em>
        33 million pounds
       </em>
       -
       <strong>
        10 Boeing 767s
       </strong>
       -
       <em>
        39 inches off the ground
       </em>
       ).
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        .5 x 4340.88 kilograms x 263.75 meters per second squared = 150,989,203.48 joules
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Now, do the same calculation on 336,000 pound (152407 kilogram) base weight (no fuel or cargo) of a Boeing 767 and you'll get an idea of what hit those towers. (5,301,185,827 joules) Those columns didn't stand a chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as going out the other side, that was mostly present in WTC 2, which was hit off-center.  Most of what came out was the jet fuel fireball, which passed to the side of the central core columns.

       was.  I also know that a handful of experienced 767 pilots in a simulator only could hit WTC 2 one time out of numerous tries.

       I have struggled with this part.  It is my understanding now that they used military drones to hit the buildings and then went back and edited the tape to make it seem like it was CGI to throw people off of the trail.  (i.e. that video of the wing of the plane passing behind a building miles in the background.)
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  Without getting into an argument about that particular detail about the wing, there still remains substantial evidence that CGI was used even if not in this particular case.  I was just trying to provide one example.  The video where the plane image is distorted as it crosses behind the crane cable is another example.

       I think they made the CGI ahead of time. I used to think they remote-controlled the 757s, but now I'm not sure if there were any aircraft at all -- could have all been done with explosives and actors.

       I think some were planted as eye witnesses and then there were people who filled in the gaps in memory by going along with the story. My opinion anyway.

       Interesting. I'm a little intimidated by all the info out there about 9/11. I grew up with the narrative everyone saw on TV so I'm kinda just sifting through connecting dots. I watched the Rebecca Roth video today and that was pretty insane.

       It takes years to sort through it all. Take your time. On top of the media lies were were told, we then have to deal with planted people who are an integral part of the "Truther" community that tells mostly the truth and some big ass whopper lies. Misdirection, misinformation, and assaults on your ego are wicked weapons being used against us.  I watched this one today

        9/11 MXL - Not for the faint hearted (18+ ONLY)

       and thought they wrapped their response to the truther movements undeniable facts in intense emotion as a way to disengage the logical part of the brain. Again.. my opinion.

       I am unsure like you. But do you think they intentionally added those rod looking things to the belly of the plane videos to further confusion? And if they used no planes, why would the official report show the planes traveling at impossible speeds instead of just making up a more plausible flight path?

       It's also extremely important to note that even though the media perpetrates the official version, it is
       <em>
        not

       proof that they had any involvement in the acts. The official version sells more than the truth, it's a simple as that. Pure capitalism at work here.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Church was stunned by what the Church Committee learned about the immense operations and electronic monitoring capabilities of the National Security Agency (NSA), an agency whose existence was unknown to most Americans at the time.
        <strong>
         Church stated in 1975
        </strong>
        : "That capability at any time could be turned around on the American people, and no American would have any privacy left, such is the capability to monitor everything: telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn't matter. There would be no place to hide."[38][39] He is widely quoted as also stating regarding the NSA: "I don't want to see this country ever go across the bridge... I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America, and we must see to it that this agency and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision, so that we never cross over that abyss. That is the abyss from which there is no return."[38][39]
       </p>
       <p>
        Commentators such as U.S. constitutional lawyer and columnist Glenn Greenwald have praised Church for his prescient warning regarding this turning around by the NSA to monitor the American people, arguing that the NSA undertook such a turning in the years after the September 11 Attacks.

       It can be speculated, and there is evidence to support media complicity in propaganda as well as government infiltration such as Operation Mockingbird, but the idea that because the media displays the official story that
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       itself serves as evidence of their complicity, simply isn't true. Like I said, the official story is what people want to hear. It gets good ratings, it gets good views. I'm still however completely sceptical of the media at all times, including media presented in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, think about Edward Snowden. Unless you believe he's some kind of asset who was sent out to distract people from the real conspiracies (which I certainly don't think is the case), the media shouldn't have covered his story as much as they did if they were run by the government. People wanted to hear about how shitty the government is, so he made headlines.

       I believe, as with many here, that Snowden is a CIA limited hangout operation. I'm also taking up a collection to buy him a new nosepiece. He's been wearing that for, what, 5 years now? Must be uncomfortable.

       The media lied about everything they've ever talked about. They're spreading propaganda, but the idea that that means they're willingly doing it has absolutely no backbone. Of course, when you think the media is complicit in spreading this propaganda, you'll probably be inclined to believe Snowden was a limited hangout as well because of his extensive news coverage. That's really all the evidence we have to support this. No limited hangout operation conducted by any government has ever followed the path Snowden's story did
       <em>
        and

       revealed such deeply incriminating facts about their government. I guess it's not incorrect to believe that he was simply an asset in the operation, but, in my opinion, it certainly isn't as likely as the predominant theory that he's a normal guy with some abnormal revelations. It

       Jung is getting at something quite complicated that this snippet can do no justice.  Anyway, you seem to clearly lack an "imagination for evil" here. The first thing I'd do (if given I was on the black operation team of destroying the World Trade Centers alongside murdering thousands of American citizens) would be to take steps to hide what I did.  This would
       <strong>
        obviously
       </strong>
       include muffling the sound of detonations/explosions, which as u/ATerribleLie logically points out,
       <strong>
        is not needed in regular demolition.
       </strong>
       How on earth you came to the conclusion this is a "reach" is puzzling, to be honest.  "Can't exactly be quieted"?  Have you any experience in muffling explosions?

       <p>
        When explosives are found unexpectedly, left over from mining or road-building, or before a planned terrorist attack, often the safest way to dispose of them is to detonate them in place.  Even if the explosives were intended for civilian use, they might have become unstable over time so that moving or touching them could be very dangerous.  To do this safely, Airmen, soldiers, and others need extensive training, including hands-on use of real explosives.  Recently, training like this has produced added noise around military facilities and increased noise complaints from neighbors.  We studied some suggested methods to reduce this very loud noise to see if any would work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sandbags:  During testing, we covered charges with 10, 20, or 40 large (50 lb) sandbags.  The sandbags were piled directly on top of the charge in a hut-like fashion, as shown in Figure 2.  We wanted to find out how many sandbags were needed to effectively muffle the blast noise.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our measurements show that using 10 sandbags cut the noise levels in half.  Using 20 or 40 sandbags only added a little more attenuation.  Piling 10 sandbags onto the charge didn’t take very long and was considered acceptable by the Airmen.

       Please think critically about this else you risk stooping down to the level of irrational dissonance observed in a large percentage of Americans (not specifically relating to this incident, but in general, politically, medically, emotionally, etc.)  Remember, it's OK to pretend you were the (
       <em>
        hypothetical?
       </em>
       ) perpetrator.  You'll see your opinion quickly slide towards conspiracy rather than foreign Islamic terrorism.  No, I am not saying it'll slide to certainty, but it seems you fall in the "doubtful," perhaps "impossible" category rather than the "almost certain" category, which is unfortunate.

       video clearly shows the tower failing precisely at the impact point.  Now if you suggest to me that an explosive highly sensitive to heat can survive a plane impact as well as over an hour of intense fire, then your credibility is done.

       Obviously you have not looked into this enough. Thermite can only be lit by white phosphorous. Fire will not set it off, it doesn't get hot enough. Of course it collapses at that point, because the structure underneath it was taken out by controlled demo via thermite/nano-thermite. The top half crushes the blown out bottom, that's how controlled demo's work. Are you new to this topic?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Thermite is an incendiary not an explosive. Forgot to add that.

       I'm familiar with thermite....in fact, I've used a thermite grenade to destroy an Iraqi T-72, so I'm quite familiar with how it works.

      <p>
       That said, you're telling me they were able to place explosives without anyone noticing on the precise place where the impact wouldn't disrupt them at all and have them all perfectly ignite at the same time in order to fool the public who would surely be watching into thinking that the impact of a +/-350,000lb aircraft travelling at over 500mph and the resulting fires causing heart fatigue would be enough to bring the towers down?   I'm not convinced.

       The US military spends more money just on Black Projects than most nations spend on their entire military budget. You don't think that the military might have demolition explosives that make very little sound? Besides the fact that explosions were heard by fire fighters, first responders, reporters and survivors. They are also on video and audio recorded that morning.

       Here is a private demolition company that utilizes silent explosive demolition materials.
      </p>
      <p>
       Often work sites are located in areas where environmental disruptions must be kept to a minimum. If this is the case, then Bustar expansive grout is a proven silent demolition alternative that offers the flexibility to handle many different types of concrete and rock demolition applications.

       Here's my question then;
      </p>
      <p>
       Controlled demolition. Consists of dropping a building from the bottom up into it's own footprint using numerous strategically placed explosive charges in key weak points on each floor.  Each one of those explosives are tied together with detonating cord, creating a labyrinth of wires and explosive string all tied to a central detonation point.   When the signal is given, the explosives travel from bottom to top, weakening the structure and causing it to collapse in on itself (hence, building implosion).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now....watching the collapse of the twin towers, you'll clearly see from the numerous angles it was filmed from, the building collapses from the top down, its upper floors pancaking onto the lower floors.  Absolutely
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       indicates that there was a controlled demolition.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the by,
       <a href="http://s.hswstatic.com/gif/building-implosion-20.jpg">
        this
       </a>
       is what a building prepped for demo looks like.   It's kinda hard to hide all that in a building packed with thousands of people and first responders.   You'd think someone would notice.

       You know no one really uses the pancake theory? Right? Especially with video evidence proving the contrary. You can see explosives running down one side at a faster rate then the collapse while the other corner of the building remains intact. That is not pancaking.

       Are you talking about the windows blowing out? Do you realize how much air was in that building? You realize that air is a physical thing right? We don't live in a vacuum. Air has mass, it's a fluid. It acts like one too. There were literally hundreds of thousands of cubic feet of air PER FLOOR that had to go somewhere. I'd imagine the windows might be the weakest point.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for things being flung outwards at 60mph. That's entirely possible. That's just inertia and energy. We're talking about a twenty story building traveling at speed. Can you even fathom how large that is? Do you even recognize how much energy that is? You could drop a 20 story building from a foot off the ground and it would launch fragments at well over 60mph.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously use your head. Instead of focusing on dumb shit why don't we focus on the real conspiracies at hand. Who funded this? Did the government let the funding happen? Who knew beforehand? Did the government let this whole thing happen? Wasn't the terrorists coordination too precise?

       The windows blowing out? Lol no I'm talking about the explosives running down the side of the building. While the other corners of the building remained intact. This is not how pancaking works. You don't get accelerated speeds while also launching debris out all sides faster then the building is collapsing. Lol air. You don't get pools of molten steel and red chips In The dust.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wtc7 was a controlled demolition it hit free fall speeds. That's not possible without a controlled demo. If wtc7 was a controlled demo then there's a pretty good chance the towers were as well. Since all the anomalies will have a pretty good explanations. Like explosives running down the sides. Or the angular impact of the plane with the angular descent of the roof line still resulting in a straight down collapse. nist doesn't even use the pancake theory and admits to buildings hitting free fall speeds.

       Oh it was multiple parties. Bush,Cheney,Larry Silverstein,Donald Rumsfeld, Saudi Arabia, military personell. Funded it? Saudi. This isn't some Pearl Harbor shit. Certain people in our own government had a hand in this. Yes I am using my head. Dick.

       Very simple solution to your question:
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever heard of wireless detonators? Ever heard of computers having the ability to control them? Ever heard of being able to reprogram that sequence to fit wherever the plane may have impacted? After all, it was like 60 and 90 minutes before the towers 'collapsed'. Plenty of time for reprogramming.

       There was no reason to reprogram. The planes hit exactly where they wanted them to hit. The areas of the Towers where the planes hit was recently renovated by the same company that renovated the Pentacon. These floors were directly below the companies that were targeted by the planes. Eurobrokers and Marsh and McKlennon.

       Hmm..I'll have to keep looking. Pretty sure it's the same firm that did both but how is this not a major area of interest for investigators? Is that not suspicious enough to warrant further investigation? Just so happens the planes hit exactly in the areas renovated that just so happens to have the offices of the auditors investigating possible criminal activity, money laundering and theft. No one thought that was unusual?

       They were two of the largest brokerages in the United States and were involved in fraudulent transactions spanning over a decade. However, some of the brokers were getting suspicious because there was almost a half a billion dollars worth of bonds that were about to come to term on 9/12/01. As u/SuchBSDotCom pointed out, Richard Andrew Grove was one of the people that discovered the fraud and luckily he survived as all of the rest of those involved in the investigation were invited to a meeting on the morning of 9/11 and told to bring all of their evidence and they were all killed when the plane impacted the building. Later, the SEC suspended their normal operating procedures and cleared the half a billion in transactions without verifying the bond holders, who were a group that called themselves the Vulcans led by George H. W. Bush. The account the Bonds were in was created to help cripple the Soviet Economy by buying up all of their infrastructure and crashing the Ruble. This was just a small fraction of the amount of money that was stolen on 9/11. It was the largest heist in American History. The missing $2.3 Trillion at the Pentagon which was being investigated by the Office of Naval Intelligence. Everyone except for one person in this department was killed. 39 out of 40 employees. Half a Billion at Marsh and McKlennon and Eurobrokers. The majority of the fatalities in the Towers were from these two companies. Billions stolen from the Gold Vaults beneath WTC 4 and 6. WTC6 also housed the El Dorado Task Force,
       <a href="http://www.ice.gov/money-laundering">
        http://www.ice.gov/money-laundering
       </a>
       , an interagency money laundering task force who were also investigating the half a billion in securities. The entire department was destroyed, taking with it all of the evidence from their investigations. WTC7 had offices for the SEC, IRS, FBI, CIA, Secret Service and several other agencies. WTC7 held all of the files for investigations into ENRON and several other high profile cases. All destroyed. And then there was all the money stolen when Bush was given a blank check to fight the War on Terror. Pallets of cash, no bid contracts for their cronies and co-conspirators.

       Obviously 9/11 was a travesty of an operation and anyone with a head on their shoulders pretty much figured out that it there were bombs involved and a media coverup from day 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something "truthers" have been pointing out for 14 years and a couple days now, look at the damn video evidence. There was nothing perfect about it. The planners weren't relying on fooling critical thinkers. They were content to fool everyone else with emotional arguments and discredit the critical thinkers with allegations of dishonoring the victims by demanding an investigation (seriously) and pushing "expert" evidence and disinfo through their diverse monopoly media corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, they made blatant mistakes and got away with it by smearing anyone who pointed out the mistakes as a "conspiracy theorist."
      </p>
      <p>
       No, they aren't professionals at hiding their evil strategies, hence why we have their motivations laid out for us in video evidence. A "new pearl harbor." They did it in plain sight and then had their media tell that anyone noticing is unamerican.
      </p>
      <p>
       It depresses me to consider that 14 years later idiots still support the same narrative that was released on the television the day the event happened before any investigation could have occurred. Almost as if we knew all along that it was going to happen, and did nothing to stop it.

       It

       like a controlled demolition because that's literally the only footage we have of buildings collapsing. It's not exactly a common event.

       It only looks like a controlled demolition in as much as it's a tall building collapsing to the ground. Beyond that it looks
       <em>
        nothing like an implosion
       </em>
       - it starts from the top, there's no visual or audible evidence of the hundreds of high explosive charges required for implosions and it creates a massive an poorly contained debris pile.

       Well sure - WTC7 looks exactly like a controlled demolition in the same way - it's a building collapsing. Again it's lacking the visual and audible signs of hundreds of explosive charges. That's a pretty big part of it.

       If the claim is that it must be a conventional explosive demolition because it looks like one, then it has to
       <em>
        look like one

       .

       Maybe it's possible that there are other ways to achieve the same result, but that's entirely theoretical because another way has never been documented. And what that other way might look (and sound) like is unknown.

       That's entirely the point - you won't find one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Buildings don't collapse often, and when they do it's not likely they're being filmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The explosives in an implosion make a building fall down, but they don't do it on their own. Gravity is the main force - the explosives are used to initiate the collapse in a predictable way.
      </p>
      <p>
       A building collapsing looks a lot like a building being imploded because that
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a building collapsing - with help.

       But to me it doesn't.  You can clearly see large sections of the outer shell of the building remaining after the top part caves in.   You can see large fountains of debris spraying out from the collapse as the tower falls.   It's not a clean drop as everyone seems to think it is.  It looks like a giant hand smashed it from the top down....which is exactly what happened.   The top portion of the tower dropped on the lower portion, smashing it.

       Exactly, but wouldn't the weight have to be distributed straight down with precision on four sides of a floor for it to look like this? Any shift in weight would result in more of a tipping which the building does not do...

       What are you talking about? The top of the South tower fell into the buildings across the street it went down so lopsided. The North tower did fall ever so slightly sideways, watch the spire, it's leaning and twisting as its being enveloped in dust.

       Fair enough. I feel like I'm starting to argue this in to the ground (no pun intended) but if the building was struck on one side of the exterior - would that not be the first place it would fail? I'm no engineer but I've played a lot of physic simulator games lol

       Dude...
       <em>
        how the fuck else is a building going to look when it's destroyed, regardless of whether it was with explosives or a giant jet slamming into it and burning and pancaking

       Calling someone brain dead because they don't see a conspiracy in every-fucking-thing that happens in this country.

      <p>
       Yeah, the building was supposed to fall sideways, and in slow motion. Or split down the middle and fall to either side. Or fall straight up into space. Fucks sake. It got pulverized.
      </p>
      <p>
       You guys squint at pixels on a monitor and then tell anyone who disagrees that they don't know shit about physics. It's awful. Horrible. You guys are claiming that it's physically impossible for 100 tons of aircraft grade (strong) aluminum, steel, titanium, and other materials
       <em>
        slamming
       </em>
       into a building at the speed it did to cause the building to collapse. Response: "the building is hundreds of thousands of tons!!!! The plane would bounce off!!!! It was a missile!!!"
      </p>
      <p>
       The fires weakened the steel and it pancaked on itself. The massive, hundreds of thousands of tons meant once it started to fall the weight alone smashed it to bits. Response: "YOU DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PHYSICS AND YOURE BRAIN DEAD"

       That's how bad this sub has gotten, is that's the predominant attitude now. There are real conspiracies that aren't Hollywood bullshit like everything posted here, but they aren't cool enough for the conspiracy theorists to pay attention to.

       Sigh, this old chestnut.
      </p>
      <p>
       To free fall 417m (the highest main point of the highest tower), would take you 9.2 secs and you'd be traveling at 200mph when you hit the ground. This is neglecting air resistance but since the towers fell into their own volume, I think this is s very fair approximation, especially, owing to the 30m or so pile of resulting rubble, the top of the tower didn't fall the full 417m.

       Usually unless there's concrete and steel in the way it's gonna use some of that kinetic energy to push that material away thus slowing the speed of the collapse.  Nope free fall. And it did hit free fall speed.

       There's various tools to measure such things. Look at the film 9/11 deception. They can follow the speed of a soccerball falling at free fall speed and its sensitive enough to pick up the air drag. The buildings on 9/11 hit free fall speeds. It hit free fall speeds and pushed material away by use of explosives and or incendiaries. The  kinetic  Energy would have had to push and pulverize the concrete and steel slowing down descent. No such resistance was found. This is the smoking gun

       I can understand how such a thing would be measured.  I mean we have a pretty extensive video record of the event.  I don't want to know how it was measured, I want to know how this "10 second" figure was settled upon as correct.  There have been plenty of analyses that place the figure higher.  Here is

       Interestingly what you just did was exactly what nist did in reaction to the free fall allegations. They put it into a completely irrelevant category while dismissing it at the same time. They had something called "free fall time" which was bullshit. It's not how fast the building hit the floor. It's the fact that the building was at a state of free fall. They reached the  necessary  speed for free fall.

       Okay, well I was specifically trying to figure out how we settled on this "10 second" figure, which is what everyone has been talking about, so don't be surprised that I address the time it took as opposed to the speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So are you saying that maybe it took longer than 10 seconds but that it doesn't matter because it still might have reached a free fall speed?

       Yes the building collapse might have taken longer then 10 seconds. But it does not matter because the building hit free fall speed for the majority of the collapse. That can not happen while debri is also shooting out the sides of the building faster then the building is collapsing.

       That could very well be the case but I still don't understand how we have proven that it was at a "free fall".  If the estimation of "10 seconds" could be off, so very well could be our estimation of the speed at which it is falling (especially since so many seem to hang one on the other).

       This whole ten second this is irrelevant.  The fact that you can import a video into a tracker where you can mark the position of the building in each frame. Tracker captures the position,time data from which it can compute velocity,acceleration and graph it versus anything else. These programs show free fall speed for A majority of the collapse. That can NOT happen. This whole 10 second convo is putting the debate in your court. The fact is the buildings hit free fall speeds while launching debri from all sides. Smoking gun.

       Okay, yeah, that's certainly possible.  Obviously you have seen this tracking done, can you share it with the rest of us?  I've seen plenty of analysis that shows otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most glaring thing is that you can see plenty of pieces that are falling from the top down that are falling at a free fall, but the central portion of the building that is falling is falling at a slower speed.  So I am having trouble reconciling your claim that the whole building fell at a free fall speed when there are plenty of pieces of the building at the periphery that are falling quite a bit faster.

       So I watched the section of the video you talked about and it isn't about the twin towers, it's about wtc 7.
      </p>
      <p>
       When in this conversation did I ever indicate I was talking about WTC 7?  The thread is about the twin towers.  Everything I've been saying is about the twin towers.  This isn't a conversation about wtc 7.  When I kept asking about the "10 second" figure, why would you think that has a damn thing to do with a conversation about WTC 7.  I would love to have a conversation about WTC 7 some time, but you can't just pretend we are talking about WTC 7 when we are clearly talking about the twin towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im having troulbe understanding how you wouldn't understand that because you keep saying "the buildings" reached a free fall speed.  That would really indicate that you know we are talking about the twin towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't cite an analysis of the fall of wtc 7 to support a claim that the twin towers fell at a free fall.
      </p>

       I'm actually surprised at your reaction because it sounded liked you learned some important information about how some of the buildings fell on 9/11. Because at the end of the day it makes no difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean there's  lots of discrepancies with the towers as well like the molten steel,red chips in the dust, Angular collapse to angular descent that led to a straight down explosions. Or sides of the tower being blown out faster then the collapse while the other corner remained intact.  Proving the pancake theory wrong. Reports of explosions in the basements.  The fact nist even acknowledges that building 7 came down at free fall speeds. Like why so fuckin outraged? That should be directed towards something else besides covering for dick cheney

       Yes, I think even if it were proven that WTC 7 were brought down by a controlled explosion you would still have to prove that they did the same thing in the twin towers.  It is not that out-there a theory to think that the twin towers were actually brought down by planes and that wtc 7 was brought down by a controlled demolition.  One does not prove the other.

You can't keep claiming that "the buildings" fell at a free fall when all you've come close to proving is that wtc 7 did.

       Blaming dick cheney for anything and everything that happened on 9/11 is just as bad as covering for him, if not worse.  Dick cheney doesn't care if you blame him for everything, he just cares that you are further away from the truth.

       I just want to know how those "questionable items" can fall faster than the "collapse" if you are claiming that the collapse happened at a free fall speed.  You seem to recognize that they can't fall faster than a free fall speed, but at the same time you are recognizing that they fall faster than something that hit a free fall speed.  You can't have it both ways.

       You can tho. Because the building hit free fall speed. I'm compensating for your weird litte request. im looking at building 7 collapse right now and I don't see any pieces that fall faster then the first 8 stories of free fall. Again the collapse would last longer because the whole thing wasn't  at free fall speeds. The buildings did hit free fall speeds tho. It's provable..

       "the building" "the buildings".. which is it?  This is a conversation about the twin towers.  Why would you be looking at the fucking WTC 7?  You knew we were talking about the twin towers.  WTC 7 is a whole other discussion.  Quit pretending that one would prove the other.  This thread is about the twin towers.  I specifically mentioned analysis of the North Tower.  The whole "10 seconds" figure is specifically a claim about the twin towers, not wtc 7.

       That's because it's a discussion about the twin towers, not wtc 7.  Nothing I have claimed has anything to do with wtc 7
       <em>
        and you know that
       </em>
       .

      <p>
       This isn't an appropriate way to try and frame a debate.  It's just dishonest.  If you can't be honest with us in a debate, how can you be honest with yourself about your own conclusions?

       Look this might sound crazy but we can talk about all the towers because they might al be related. It's not like golly gee that isn't fair you can't use building 7 to prove 9/11 was an inside job. It's about the towers??  It's almost like I bunch them all together with no though of separating it. Because there's no reason to. If building 7 fell by controlled demolition ( which it did) then the towers also fell becaus of controlled demolition

       You aren't using wtc 7 to prove 9/11 was an inside job.  You were using the collapse of wtc 7 to prove that the twin towers fell at a free-fall speed.  There is a world of difference there.

       So basically you only dig deep enough to satisfy your initial conclusions.  Sorry, I don't work that way, I dig deeper.

      <p>
       Basically all you have proven to me is that when you claim something as "fact", I can rest assured that it might not be so much a "fact" as it is an opinion.

       If that is a satisfactory enough conclusion for you, then so be it.  Just don't act all surprised when someone questions you on it. I hold myself to a higher standard of evidence.

       Yes it's a fact wtc7 fell on a controlled demo. Sorry bro.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mm yes it would because it involves some simple critics thinking. A steel building collapsed into pulverized concrete. Molten pools of steel were found weeks after the collapse and red chips were found in the dust.  See when you prove wtc7 was a controlled demo then it really lets all the other evidence that was found really shine.  If you can't see that I'm sorry for you're Aspergers. It's not like Cheney is gonna give us the blue prints to what happened. But we got a good idea

       There was a lot of government rhetoric which included the words "that day". I.e. "the fires were so hot that day those planes just vaporized". (That's an actual quote from W). So basically they brushed aside all logic and science because "that day" was so horrible. .  .

       The cost of the two planes would equal about 80.5 million for UA 175, and 100-110 million for AA 11. The cost of the remote control system and fuel load would be negligible compared to that so we can put the cost at roughly $190,000,000 for the planes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The twin towers cost about 2.3 billion to build when adjusted for inflation. If we include all the office furnishings for the two building we can probably assume that $1 million per floor in furnishings is reasonable for cost so tack another $200 million +.
      </p>
      <p>
       Total cost(rough estimate) 2,700,000,000
      </p>
      <p>
       This of course doesn't include cost of land to build it on or the cost of clean up.

       Well see... what happened was fire... and some planes and a bunch of Muslims, not regular Muslims that we like but dirty old terrorists Muslims that we don't like, made the steel beams get all weak and everything and the top got all heavy what with a plane sitting on top of it and all and it just fell down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing happened to the other one. These guys were good.
      </p>
      <p>
       That other building had some extra hot fire too and made the whole thing fall down at free fall and drop into it's own neat little footprint. How they done it was probably something they learned in terrorists school.

       aye. The point of the calculation was not to show that the towers collapsed according to strict, vacuum free-fall dynamics, but that the speeds raised in the original post were well within the basic physical parameters of gravity. There are a lot of factors that would have to be included in a comprehensive model, but we're nowhere near the bizarro world that those looking for confirmation of their existing beliefs are claiming.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that a little bit of momentum at the start of a collapse (say, from the top 1/8th of a  skyscraper falling in) goes a long way. People are not great at intuiting geometric functions, which is what we're talking about here...

       Teach me your geometric functions. Here is mine:

      <pre><code>ü=g-F(u)/m(z)

      <p>
       describes the acceleration of the tower. m(z) is easily approximated, g is known, ü can be measured, solving for F(u) is trivial.

       The faithers account for it the same way religious people account for a god. They believe the official story because the TV trained masses are brainwashed into believing that the MSM would never convey a lie. If you don't believe (the official story), you're going to hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shaming that went on in the media towards anyone who questioned the official story was flat out nuts. The talking heads on fox actually said it is "mental illness" to believe anything other than the official story. Right there, anyone with a weak mind wouldn't realize the epic bullshit that it was and immediately shut down their natural ability to think critically and get on the band wagon that Truthers are nuts...and I've been called every name in the book.

       The planes hitting them were essentially missiles right? Don't skyscrapers sway in the wind anyway, and that's just wind. A missile hitting them should do tremendous damage to overall structural integrity. I'm not shilling here. I'm just wondering what the rebuttal to this is.

       Even if the impact of the plane caused the collapse, which is not the "official concensus", they would never fall into their own footprints from an impact on one side, let alone high up and on one side.  A fall like that requires simultaneous steel beam destruction, equally distributed accross the building's supports.

       That entire upper section that tilted over and began to fall onto the street below, destroyed itself before reaching the undamaged lower section so there was nothing left to crush the floors below which means that something else destroyed the floors below, which got progressively stronger the lower in the tower you went. 42
 Steel Columns in the core section of the Tower were somehow removed. If this was a real collapse, then the core columns should have remained standing. There was essentially a building within a building with an inner framework and and outer framework with supporting structure securing the floors to the inner and outer framework. After the collapse, there should have been a debris pile, surrounding the inner structure of atleast 14 stories high but there wasn't. So where did all of the debris go? And what happened to the 42 Steel Columns?

       How do you know that the section above the failure point "destroyed itself"?  What does that even mean?  I mean it might have destroyed itself but the material that was "destroyed" didn't disappear did it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though the floors near the bottom were stronger, wasn't the weight of the material crashing down on them even heavier since it included not just the portion above the point of failure but also all the floors that had been destroyed on the way down?

       This is where the faithers tell you that NIST swears that inside that intact facade, an unprecedented amount of thermal expansion had created a domino effect of columns failing.  What you saw was the secondary collapse of the "skin" of the building (they say).

       I didn't insist anything like that.  I'm not talking about wtc 7.  The only thing that I ever pointed out about wtc 7 is that it has been claimed (possibly rightly) that it "fell in to it's own footprint" and over time that assertion has been wrongly extended to the twin towers, through confusion or confabulation.

       I have a lot of opinions about a lot of things.  My opinion of WTC 7 is there is a lot of suspicious things about what happened to it.  I am far more open to the idea that WTC 7 might have been destroyed on purpose as opposed to simply a side-effect of what happened to the twin towers.  Maybe there was a controlled demolition?  Maybe it was the thousands of gallons of fuel Mayor Giuliani insisted on keeping in the building to fuel his poorly-placed emergency bunker (even though FDNY cited him for it).  I could go on and on about wtc 7, but I would rather do so in an actual thread about WTC 7.  Honestly, right now, I need to get to bed.
      </p>

       I'll say that there were a lot of things that happened on 9/11.  But, I tend to think that it was a fairly simple thing that happened.  But we should never fall in to the trap of assuming that all of the people that either made or let this thing happen were all shared the same motivations, or that their motivations were singular.  That is where the complexity of the event actually lies.  But because we can never actually get in to the heads of these people, those motivations will always be a mystery.  It is frustrating to everyone who studies this subject.  And I think that frustrating reality tends to make some people try to imagine that the plan carried off that day was far more complex than it needed to be.  But criminals and conspirators do not operate that way, they are bound by the reality that a simple plan is always easier to pull off than a difficult one.  Especially if they intend not to be caught after the fact.

       Please forgive my aggression, but since I joined reddit I am under the impression many truthers are unsure about the Twins and manage to derail even Twin Tower threads into WTC7 debates, as if there is not enough "Did you know a third skyscraper fell on 9/11" material yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me briefly explain my issue with that: you can model a WTC7 collapse with Jenga bricks, somewhat, by pulling away all supports at the same time. The Twins' collapse is much (MUCH!) harder to model, and that's the ONE undebunkable weakness the truth movement should throw all its weight into.

       9/11 Faithers cannot account for this, so they have to create pseudo-science to explain it.  Once done, they hide behind the media and imbeciles in society to bastardize anyone who brings up very logical and necessary questions like yours.

       The ACTUAL answer:  There is no explanation OTHER THAN the buildings were imploded from top to bottom.  The make matters 100% convincing, Building 7 wasn't even hit, barely saw fire, and still collapsed in the same imploded manner.

       Yes, that's what would happen.  The forces going up would counteract the forces going down, insofar as speeding up or slowing down the fall of the buildings is concerned.  I'm saying the explosions don't only force things in the downward direction as OP implies.  (I'm an architect, for what it's worth.  Not that you should attach any significance to it, just to say that I may not be a numbskull.)

       May I ask what forces were going up? Yes explosions don't only go downwards. That's why when you look at the collapse you can see debri being shot from all sides. It's very obvious. But how was that debri being pushed so fast and far while the building still hit free fall speed? The energy that pulverized and pushed concrete or melted steel would have had to come from another source.

        But how was that debri being pushed so fast and far while the building still hit free fall speed?

       I don't understand this sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP is implying that the explosion makes the building move downward (fall) faster than it otherwise would.  I am saying that explosions are a net negative effect on the speed of the fall in that they explode in all directions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden is on the OP to say why an explosion necessarily means faster falling speed, not on me to say why it doesn't.

       But why bring op into this I just replied to you I don't need to cover for him. The debri that launched from the towers launched at high speeds while also reaching great distances. How would that happen while the building hit free fall speeds. It's impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know exactly how and what explosives were used. People just know it was a controlled demolition because the buildings hit free fall speeds. A building can't hit free fall speeds while collapsing. It's proof of a controlled demolition.  It launched debris from all sides  and the pancake theory doesn't hold up anymore.  To pull off the greatest crime of the century they most likely used extreme tactics.

       Yeah because your pulling stuff from your ass. Your saying explosions will slow down the descent? Fucking how controlled demolitions Happen all the time at free fall speed. That's the only time a building has ever hit those speeds except for all the exceptions. Which were all on 9/11. But they were also controlled demolition. I'm cold hard telling you the smoking gun the main reason why this is going down in the history books, something you can't argue. So just be like whoa maybe dick Cheney didn't have our best interest?

       No I don't think the explosion would slow it down.  When I said "net negative" I meant that it would its effect would be neutral.  "Net negative" wasn't right.

       Something's pushed the concrete and steel out of the way. Wtc7 fell by controlled demolition. The towered had molten steel for weeks and they found red chips in the dust  "incendiaries " it's a damn fact 9/11 is a lie

       The top floors were much, much lighter than the bottom floors and their reinforcing. The mass of steel and concrete should have slowed the top floors falling, unless they'd been compromised in some manner before the top floors fell.

       10 seconds for a 1300+ foot fall without resistance is impossible for those towers, unless the resistance was removed before the towers fell.
      </p>
      <p>
       The laws of physics are pretty simple. For the towers to fall at the speed/rate which they did, there had to be ZERO resistance from each of the floors as they fell.

       What you may be missing though is that the continuously increasing mass from more floors would continue to increase the speed. Theoretically you could fall faster with more mass AND resistance

       It would increase the speed only if there was no resistance from the bottom 7/8 of the building. The official story states that the top of the building destroyed the rest of the building on the way down. The problem with that story is that it would mean the fall should have been slower.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't have it both ways. Either the kinetic energy was used in the fall or it was used to destroy both buildings (straight down, with no resistance).
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was no resistance, as is the case, that means that something else was used to remove the rest of the building as the top fell.

       Can you quote where in the report it says that because I'm not finding anything in the report that says anything like that and read over it twice just to make sure.  It doesn't seem to mention either how long it took the tower to fell, nor how long the simulation says it should have taken.  110 seconds seems like a ridiculously long time anyways.

       Because it says if the  failure plastic deformation parameter is set to 0.5%, they manage to make it look like a vérinage, if it is set to 1%, collapse is arrested, at 5%, collapse occurs only in the immediate vicinity of the impact/fire zone.

       It seems to take the cause of the collapse at face value.  The paper seems to be less about figuring out why the towers collapsed, rather it seems more like a lesson-to-be-learned sort of paper to educate engineers in to building skyscrapers better.  Considering it's a chinese paper that is hardly surprising.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't quite get what your angle is, though.  I honestly can't figure out if you are making any claims that support or contradict the "official theory" or any of the various alternative theories out there.  You don't seem like you are playing both sides, more like you are trying to stay somewhere in the middle.  I dunno man.  At least the stuff you say is

       10 seconds seems too short for you (although not for the expert who submitted a paper on September 13th, 2001, with the stated aim to prove the towers must have collapsed under most optimistic assumptions towards survival, which until today is THE paper all supporters of the official conspiracy theory turn to (because NIST did not treat the collapse sequence at all)).

       110 seconds seems too long for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       My suggestion is you name a collapse time - one that sounds reasonable to you - and all the other parameters (weight of building, collapse initiation height etc) and we go through the math. I'm from metric land, so I'll convert all ells and feet into SI units, but that won't change matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, we'll have to arrive at the conclusion that for the tower to fall as fast as it did, the force keeping it up had to be much too small by an order of magnitude for the mass it had to decelerate against the acceleration of gravity on the surface of planet earth.

       Well, don't misunderstand me.  I haven't been trying to claim that 10 seconds is too short.  I've just been trying to get someone to tell me why everyone is fixated on that specific figure.  Ironically you have nearly provided me the closest to actually answering that question :p  I don't know what speed the fall should have happened.  I've just questioned the 10 second conclusion based on the assumption that it was based on the evidence coming from video of the collapse.  I've questioned that it would be that easy to come to such a specific conclusion based on just the video evidence because so much of the collapse is obscured in dust and debris.  It seems to me that the collapse might not be so uniform, that different parts of the building would fall at different speeds.

       Nobody really is, it just pops up all the time even in early "official conspiracy theory" literature, the most famous and often-quoted of which is

      <p>
       Say 12 seconds, say 16 seconds, count the fraction of the core that stands up (the "spire") and say 30 seconds, it doesn't make a difference really. The point is that the towers fell
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       , straight down through themselves. That's a fucking awesome feat from an engineering standpoint (if really no explosives helped it along), except that there were still people inside.

       It's sorta part of the official narrative, but when truthers use that figure, everyone screams bloody murder because it was more towards 12 or 16 seconds.

       But where does this 10 second thing come from?  If you look at
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/oQ8qzYy.jpg">
        this photo
       </a>
       you can see a lot of debris in free fall, but you can also see a sliver of the tower that hasn't collapsed yet much higher up.  If the large mass of the top of the tower was collapsing at a free fall then all of the debris falling underneath it must be falling even faster! How have we settled on this "10 seconds" figure?

       Dude, I was agreeing with you.  I agree that this is a perfect example of the education system.  Everyone else in this thread lacks a fundamental physics intuition.  Not sure how you read my comment wrong.  Sorry, I was just piggybacking on your comment to add to your thoughts.

       The neat thing about gravitational acceleration is mass cancels out of the equation.

       Missing Evidence show, new on Smithsonian Ch. If I remember correctly one building was 13 seconds, the other was 16. 
They did a good job pointing out that the NIST report was flawed. That report never considered the aluminum of the planes, 90 tons, which melted. And here's the interesting part a lot of people don't know. I sure didn't. Melted aluminum explodes when in contact with water. Has caused entire factories to be destroyed.
So, planes melt, seep through cracks, hits water, boom, supports give, collapse. Good enough for me and I,m not up for another debate on this topic. Watch the show, argue with them....

       I've been getting shit from truthers for so long. I would even try to understand them and research what they said. This led me to the fact that the towers were of a "tube" design. Essentially "hollow". I looked up thermite and realized this is just a part of the welding process which had to be extensive and powerful,I assume, because of all the steel. We saw a building collapse straight down what we didn't see was the collapsing inward of the supports which in my opinion helped it fall straight down.

       Well, I would first ask, how do we know it only took 10 second for it to collapse?  Where does this 10 seconds claim come from? The mass of the building seems to be fairly obscured in smoke and debris.  When I look at
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/oQ8qzYy.jpg">
        a picture like this
       </a>
       I don't see a building falling straight down.  The damage to the buildings surrounding the WTC also shows us how straight down this fall was NOT.  I see a tremendous amount of debris being flung out to the sides, which is what would happen if the top section of the building was falling down on the bottom part and pulverizing it as it goes.  I certainly don't see a building falling "in to it's own footprint" as is often claimed.  And I don't see a building being destroyed in the same way as a controlled demolition.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of collapse seems to be very obviously at the point where the plane hit.  This can be seen
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/UYI9d7f.jpg">
        most dramatically here
       </a>
       .  If it was a controlled demolition, how did they cause the top of the south tower to toppel over at an angle like that?  Were the explosives packed in to the floors where the planes hit?  How would they know where the planes were going to hit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was the second tower hit the first tower to collapse?  To me it seems fairly obvious because it was hit much lower and the part of the building that the compromised section had to support was much heavier.  I can't imagine that if it was a controlled demolition that they would have planned to make it look like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question recognizes that it was a "top-down" sort of fall, but that's not how demolitions are done.  The explosions in a building demolition tend to focus on the bottom of the building when the explosions at the wtc happened in areas where the planes hit.  Why does a "free-fall collapse" translate in to "demolition"?

       The 2nd Tower hit was hit on the corner, which means that the plane didn't even directly sever the core columns. NIST claims, in order for their hypothesis to work, that the plane hit so hard, that it knocked all of the fireproofing from all of the steel beams.
      </p>
      <p>
       These buildings are over 1300 feet tall. If they would have fallen over, the damage would have been a lot worse. They more or less fell straight down. Sure, there was some damage to surrounding buildings but nothing like if they had fallen over on their side. Watch any video of the collapse and you can see the building destroying itself from the top down but there were also explosions on the lower levels as well. You can see this in the videos showing the first responders entering the lobby of the Towers. All of the windows have been blown out, the marble has been blown off of the walls and the elevator doors have been blown out. It looks like a bomb went off in the lobby. In some videos, you can hear the explosions going off at the base of the building, followed by smoke rising. And no, this was not due to fuel spilling from the plane. Most of the fuel was burned off in the initial explosion and there just wasn't enough to fall the length of the building in the elevator shaft and cause an explosion in the lobby. The janitor in the WTC was in the basement before the first plane hit and there was a very loud explosion in the basement level. When he went to investigate, he ran into a man who had his skin blown off of his body from the explosion. Again, this was before the plane hit. Why do debunkers continue to deny the hundreds of witnesses to explosions?

       I am familiar with William Rodriguez story, but not the angle that all that happened

       the plane hit.  I doubt I need to tell you that explosions at the ground level likely were the result of fireballs travelling down elevator shafts.  Does such an explanation not satisfy those witness accounts?

      <p>
       Why do
       <em>
        you

       want to deny the witness account?  Here is a direct quote from Rodriguez:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        and at that terrible day when I took people out of the office, one of them totally burned because he was standing in front of the freight elevator and the ball of fire came down the duct of the elevator itself, I put him on the ambulance.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So even the witness you cite mentions specifically that the burned man was burned because of a fireball from the elevator (and he doesn't mention it being
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       the plane hit).
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would you say he experienced all of this before the plane hit?  These sorts of facts are important, especially when you are the ones saying "debunkers" are denying witness accounts.

       There was not enough fuel left over from the explosion to create a fireball that would be able to travel from the top of the building down to the basement level. Most of the fuel burned off in the initial explosion. It certainly wouldn't have enough energy to create as much devastation in the lobby that was shown in video of the first responders entering the building.

       The relevant part of the video starts at 12:55 in case I didn't link correctly. William Rodriguez is very specific that the explosion came from below, not from above. He states that the explosion happened at 8:46. There was an explosion in the basement, prior to the plane hitting the building and the explosion came from below, not from above. He thought it was a generator exploding.

       What are you basing that information on?  How can you be so certain?  If there was a bomb in the basement that injured the man, it would have been a concusive injury.  But instead the man was severely burned.  That's not how bombs usually do their damage.

       So when I prove your points wrong, like your misquote from William Rodriguez, you just move on to the next. I see how you operate. I'm not going to sit here and look up every source for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       NIST admitted to the presence of an incendiary explosion at the concourse level and to the deaths and injuries caused by it, stating, a “fireball killed or injured several occupants in the Concourse Level lobby (NIST NCSTAR 1-7, p 73).” However, a scientific explanation was never provided. Instead, an untested hypothesis was given as fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       “There are numerous media reports of building occupants being burned in the ground-floor lobby of WTC 1 following the aircraft impact. Numerous eyewitness accounts describe a large flash fire on the concourse floor lobby at the time of aircraft impact, that came from one or more of the elevator shafts that ran from the concourse floor of the tower past the floors where the aircraft impact took place. This observation suggests that sufficient burning liquid aviation fuel entered at least one of these elevator shafts to continue burning, while it fell roughly 1,175 feet. Even after falling this distance, sufficient unburned fuel was available to create the overpressure that opened the elevator shaft at the concourse level and forced additional unburned fuel into the lobby area, creating the extensive flash fire observed.” NIST NCSTAR 1-5A, p 80
      </p>
      <p>
       For the jet fuel bolus hypothesis to be even remotely reasonable, the following five challenges would have to be overcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       1)  The jet fuel that was available to flow down and away via openings, after accounting for the external fireballs and impact zone fires, was estimated by FEMA to be about 3,500 gallons. And NIST stated that, “No evidence or analysis emerged that significantly altered the FEMA estimate” (NCSTAR 1-5F, p 56). The 3,500 gallons would need to flow evenly across the entire, acre-wide area of the impact floors.
      </p>
      <p>
       2)  The impact damage would have had to fully open, and leave exposed, the 22 elevator shafts in the core area of the impact zone (or the 30+ in the WTC2 impact zone). The shafts that were most important would be for cars #6, #7, and #50, the express elevators traveling the entire distance from top to bottom. In WTC1, these were located at the opposite side of the core from the impact zone.
      </p>
      <p>
       3)  We must assume that no more than a proportionate amount of jet fuel flowed into the express elevator shafts on the opposite side, after traveling through more than half of floor space of the tower. This would be one-22nd of the total available, or 159 gallons. There were also 12 in x 18 in telephone cable openings between floors, however, and holes in the floors made by the impacting aircraft, through which fuel would have been lost. A realistic maximum therefore might be 120 gallons in each shaft, assuming an equal amount of the spilling jet fuel made it all the way across to the express elevator side.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMG_13044)  The jet fuel would have adhered to the surface of the elevator shaft as it traveled downward. The elevator shafts were lined with 2-inch thick gypsum planking and the low surface tension jet fuel would have wetted this thoroughly. An estimate of the surface area in an express shaft is 60,000 square feet. A quick experiment shows that gypsum board soaks up approximately 0.03 gallons of kerosene per square foot.  All the available jet fuel (120 gallons) would have been lost in this process before the jet fuel bolus reached the mid-point of its fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore the jet fuel that was available to flow down and away from the floors of impact could not have reached the concourse level of the WTC towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       5)  However, a lot of damage was attributed to this impossible jet fuel bolus. Eyewitnesses stated that there were intense elevator area fires in the lower half of the building. There were fires on the 40th floor, and the 22nd floor, and witnesses said that the elevator doors on the 22nd floor had been blown out from fires or explosions in the elevator shafts. Even if a highly disproportionate quantity of jet fuel from the aircraft had somehow caused these fires and the related damage, there certainly would not have have been any left to reach the lobby.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this ignores the questions of how unburned jet fuel could make its way around the elevator cabs in the shafts, how it could re-accumulate at the lower level, and how the supposed fuel/air mix could become optimum and then ignite. It also ignores how much jet fuel would be required to produce the explosive energy needed to destroy so much of the lobby, including the huge windows and the massive granite wall coverings, and kill people in that area.
      </p>
      <p>
       The jet fuel bolus hypothesis also ignores the eyewitness testimonies of massive explosions within the lobby.
      </p>
      <p>
       If NIST had done a minimal amount of physical testing to support its weak fuel bolus suggestion, the hypothesis would have been easily disproven. But that would have left people to wonder what actually did cause these incendiary fires and the ones in the basement levels. The answers to those questions would almost certainly add to the other, extensive evidence for the presence of energetic, incendiary materials at the WTC.

       Hursley Lever: (on the b4 level) "... I heard a bomb. So, I says, 'Probably a transformer again blew up.' So I step back, finish what I had to finish, and I started towards the door again. And there came a big blast with a big ball of fire. And that's when I got hit. It hit me right back down on the ground and I realized my ankle was shattered." Lever also recalls this happening near the door in a Boston Globe article.
Jose Sanchez: "We started to walk to the exit and a huge ball of fire went through the freight elevator. The hot air from the ball of fire dropped Chino to the floor and my hair got burned...”
Firefighter John Schroeder: "People just come running out of the elevators on fire. Fireball. I mean it was like 'What is going on here? Something's up here.' I mean, the plane's up there and now there's fire down here? People running around all on fire. This is crazy."
These are just some that I found.

       So first you say that a fireball travelling down the elevator shaft would not have been possible, and to support that claim you quote a bunch of people describing fireballs coming out of the elevator shafts... I don't get what you are trying to do.

       stop wasting my time. Selectively choosing to hear what you want to hear. I also provided a very detailed explanation of why jet fuel explosions are impossible but you ignore that and hear what you want to hear. I don't feel like wasting any more time with Trolls.

       Typical Troll. He says some false shit. i correct him with sources which he ignores or cherry picks words out of the sentence. I suspect he's a bot. Wouldn't be surprised if they have TrollBot's by now. There just wasn't enough fuel to create a fireball powerful enough to account for the damage. These people seem to think the fuel from the planes was some kind of miracle fuel. burns through the fireproofing, melts steel beams, vaporized the plane, and still had enough energy to pour down the elevator shafts 93 floors up with enough explosive energy to blow the doors off the elevators and destroy the lobby. One of the victim's fathers who's one of the more outspoken of the victim's families son was killed entering the lobby of wtc1. He was hit full frontal with a blast that broke ribs, burned the skin off of his bones and tore one of his arms off. The hospital didn't want to release the autopsy report to him. And the injuries that killed his son would be considered "Concussive" seeing as his ribs were broken and he had a lot of other internal injuries. He pretty much died instantly. I would hope anyways because the pain of having your arm blown off would be pretty fucking painful.

       Before collapse, North Tower lobby was destroyed, all glass, revolving doors, plus huge slabs of marble (along with significant parts of subbasements). The official story is that this was all done by a jet fuel fireball, on impact, traveling 90+ floors down elevator shafts, emerging from elevator shafts and doing the lobby damage, etc. For evidence, they try to cite that elevator doors in lobby were destroyed. But it is already established in blueprints that elevator access to the lobby from the point jet fuel impact was exceedingly limited.
In oral testimony, FDNY Lt. William Walsh (see NYT) explicitly says that the elevator doors which were destroyed in the lobby were from shafts that served only the LOCAL floors - floors 30-35 and below (roughly). Those elevator shafts don't reach the 95th floor where the plane hit. Other elevator shafts go higher - the Express elevators -- BUT Walsh also explicitly says that the EXPRESS elevator doors were "INTACT" as far as he could tell. If Walsh is correct, it renders the jet-fireball-lobby destruction theory utterly impossible. Here's Walsh, see pages 7-8 roughly

        The question recognizes that it was a "top-down" sort of fall, but that's not how demolitions are done. The explosions in a building demolition tend to focus on the bottom of the building when the explosions at the wtc happened in areas where the planes hit.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You can clearly see that this is the most economic and awesome way, and still very error-prone, leading to toppling sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it would totally have crushed the bath tub.
      </p>
      <p>
       So blowing it up from top to bottom instead is much dirtier and intensive in terms of explosives needed, but safer because the debris rains down in small chunks, and distributes itself over a wide area, not as a whole building, and the bathtub remained intact because the building's stump acted like a damper.

       I can understand how such a thing would be measured.  I mean we have a pretty extensive video record of the event.  I don't want to know how it was measured, I want to know how this "10 second" figure was settled upon as correct.  There have been plenty of analyses that place the figure higher.  Here is

       There was no reason to reprogram. The planes hit exactly where they wanted them to hit. The areas of the Towers where the planes hit was recently renovated by the same company that renovated the Pentacon. These floors were directly below the companies that were targeted by the planes.

       You aren't using wtc 7 to prove 9/11 was an inside job.  You were using the collapse of wtc 7 to prove that the twin towers fell at a free-fall speed.  There is a world of difference there.

       It takes years to sort through it all. Take your time. On top of the media lies were were told, we then have to deal with planted people who are an integral part of the "Truther" community that tells mostly the truth and some big ass whopper lies. Misdirection, misinformation, and assaults on your ego are wicked weapons being used against us.  I watched this one today

       and thought they wrapped their response to the truther movements undeniable facts in intense emotion as a way to disengage the logical part of the brain. Again.. my opinion.

       9/11 was a form of Shock brainwash. The MSM showed the planes hitting the towers over and over for what seemed like weeks all the while they were chanting the official story.

       While America's mind was in shock looking for answers...the MSM rammed it in...and it stuck very well.

       stop wasting my time. Selectively choosing to hear what you want to hear. I also provided a very detailed explanation of why jet fuel explosions are impossible but you ignore that and hear what you want to hear. I don't feel like wasting any more time with Trolls.

       I know alot of really smart people who otherwise have well honed critical thinking skills.  But when it comes to this topic, they can't bear to even hear it.   The notion of insider involvement on this kind of alarmingly grand scale is so upsetting to them(and should be) that they just can't bring themselves to think about it - let alone believe it.

       It's made me realize that we what we have before us is a manifestation of, "The Great Truth"

       The bigger the truth, the bigger the likelihood that no one will believe it.

       Miracles, Coincidences, Lack of basic Scientific knowledge that you learn in the 8th grade. Believing that a 200,000 Lb. 757 can nosedive into a crater no bigger than a trash dumpster. I just imagine the old, high dive into a glass of water trick. And then supposedly, the impact completely destroyed the plane seeing as no plane was ever excavated from the hole. Both planes that hit the World Trade Center were completely destroyed. No wings, no tail, no fuselage, from TWO different planes. Did you see any large plane debris sitting in the pile? Where'd the planes go? Where'd the black boxes go? And then there's the Pentagon. Another 200,000 lb. 757 or 767 plowed into the side of the building, squeezing itself into a hole not large enough to accommodate the wing span or the tail and no debris from the plane was recovered. And then, as I've been arguing with this troll, the belief that jet fuel poured down the elevator shaft, setting off explosions all over the building. It's just ridiculous what people will believe. And they call us the tin foil hat crowd.

       I find the 9/11 thing fascinating and I do think there are a lot of unanswered questions, but to claim that the laws of physics have been broken in this claim is difficult to justify. Falling from that height, under gravitational acceleration is around 10 secs.

       That is fact.

       It affects the truthers' (? Have I got it right?) credibility and distracts from an otherwise interesting debate.
