       I've seen a load of posts about 9/11, but none seem to address the very important aspect which was it fanned the flames of a rapidly growing islamophobia. To this day innocent people are being attacked and discriminated against simply because they are muslim. It's returning to 1930s Germany. We have the specific race baiting of the media between blacks and whites. We have the organised discrimination against other races.
This is all planned. It is all divide and conquer. A community can't come together as one if they are hateful and distrusting of each other. We have to work on making our local communities stronger, as the old saying goes, because united we stand, divided we fall.

       That is what I said, the Nazis! But really, the Bushes were just the hired help. Prescot Bush got 1 share of stock in the company that he was helping over here. The real criminals were the Industrialists and the Bankers, who played both ends.

       The Reichstag fire is a great example, too, of Problem-Reaction-Solution. You get some Nazi cronies to set it on fire, blame a communist, quickly swoop in and promise to defend the people from the communists, boom, you've got more power as the communists are now completely kicked out of the government.

       This is one of the things that irks me about the ant-conspiracy crowd.  They always accuse "conspiracy theorists" as being anti-semitic while overlooking the fact that the group of people demonized in our society the most is muslims.  If there is any parallel here it is between nazis hate of Judaism, and present day hate of Islam.

       The agenda is culture and identity destruction, different cultures can co-exist just fine if they aren't too antagonist in ideology and if they are governed by a sufficiently democratic construct (true full democracy has not been seen since Cleisthene) . Identities are problematic because they resist the concentration of power at a larger scale... elsewhere. Quebec doesn't want to be ruled by Ottawa, Greeks by Bruxelles, Texans by Washington, etc... And the only reason a group can resist is identity, a shared set of values and beliefs that contradict finance's. So to break that, finance is shuffling everyone around. The fact that finance can distract anger from itself by throwing one community against another is just an added bonus to this larger scheme. Another added bonus is the pressure on the job market it creates.

       The bigger conspiracy is people not putting Islam to the same scrutiny as any other religion.  One can pass off pissing on a cross and calling it art.  However,  drawing a picture of the profit puts one in the scope of a gun. The media obscures much more than it overhypes in this case.

       Last I checked, this has been talked about exhaustively in every liberal media outlet around the world and many moderate ones as well ever since 9/11. I'm not saying it isn't true, or isn't something we should continue to keep in mind, but it's hardly a topic that's been ignored.

       You don't seem to get what is happening. The "organized discrimination" has been the deliberate flooding of Europe with Muslims, which discriminates against the white Christians of Europe. That is the cause of any discontent you may be seeing from white Christians -- they are reacting to an attempt to make them second-class citizens in their own nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same thing is happening in the United States, but it is not the Christians who are under attack in America, it is the whites. Obama and his ilk are flooding (deliberately, coldly, calculatingly, maliciously flooding) the United States with Hispanics, and also with Muslims.
      </p>
      <p>
       In both the US and Europe the same game plan is underway -- to deprive the whites of power in their own countries; to eventually make them minorities in their own countries. Whites in America, white Christians in Europe, see this happening, and they are reacting with anger,
       <em>
        as they should
       </em>
       . The only possible reasonable reaction to this attack is anger and violence. These floods of illegals must be stopped if Europe and America are to survive.

       Okay, all things aside, we don't know what the world will bring with the new changes. You can't just go saying "Whites" will be oppressed now. I don't think that is how this works, the people who are doing this have "positive" energy about them almost like magicians kinda like how people keep claiming all these shootings are fakes... what if they are? What if they are just propaganda to make us wake up and realize things...
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't feel that whites will be oppressed, I feel that whites who stand for Zionism and the current oppression against all who are not white will feel the wrath of change. I think people who are good at heart who want to see change, want equality for everyone race color and gender will work out fine. I doubt the objective is to do the exact same thing back to "whites", that just taints the revolution with an even scale, I would hope that the goal were to show them the correct way to run the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, the coming changes in the future will be different for both man and human kind, we can't stop

       Actually, there was once a political discussion in German television and a moderate imam was included. Especially for the purpose of reducing fear over Muslims. Someone asked him if the laws (concerning women, wearing headscarf etc) in Germany would be changed if Muslims became the majority and he confirmed that they surely would. That somewhat backfired.

       Well some moderate Muslims need to actually speak out against the jihadists in their ranks.  Moderate Muslims need to speak out against the bronze age punishments they use against people disobeying their religious laws and trying to leave the faith.  Moderate Muslims need to speak out against the attacks on people for free speech that Islam condones/encourages.  A community quite literally can't come together when a group of people believe they have a mandate from god to convert non-muslims or kill them.  This isn't just related to 9-11.  When the Ayatollah ordered the death of Salaman Rushdee for writing the Satanic Verses it was unanimously accepted by Muslims across the globe that he should be killed for blasphemy.  There was no outcry from the moderate Muslims saying that you shouldn't kill a man for writing a book.  Until the moderates who are willing to speak out are the majority there will be a problem with Islam.  As long as the majority of Muslims believe that the correct punishment for apostasy is death there will be a problem.

       In this country's white people have been doing all the hate and killing. American Indians, slavery, chinese, Japanese camps, communist witch hunting of the 50s, actual witch hunts of the 1600s, mexicans, jews, government (timothy mcveigh), Muslims, corrupt cops. White people have even been racist against other white people. I site the Irish coming to this country. I don't blame white people. It's the history of this world. Always blame the guy below you. The problem with that is it's getting crowded below. By the way most minorities don't blame all white people just republicans. They might want to work on their image. Or whatever keep pretending like we're all one big happy family. Nothing is going to change until we ALL understand this country doesn't belong to one group. We all helped build this country. We all have to learn to forgive. It might be harder for others but we can do it.
      </p>

       Lol no we can't we're all selfish. We can't look past our small little world. For this world to get better we all have to care more about the other person but that's never going to happen. We're only interested in ourselves and maybe the people around us. Sure you have the few who care but there probably smaller in numbers then the rich elite.

       I think you'll find it's only the extreme SJWs who want all whites to feel guilty. But that's all part of the clever trick - it makes them angry and more likely to retaliate. 
I'm white. But I know that there is a disproportionally lower chance of me being seen as a terrorist for simply carrying around a backpack or as a thief for walking round a shop.

       I agree OP. I fucking hate SJW's but that doesn't mean I'm a racist. It's really convenient that calling out neo-nazi's will now make people associate you with otherkin whining about micro agressions. The truth is that racism is a very real problem, and it's not about feelings, it's about the prison industrial complex, the rationalisation of genocide in the middle east, etc. 
It's a shit world. Divide and conquer is an age old cliché because it works. Rise above it and aim to connect all people, you can't convince people their hate is irrational but you can hope to be a beacon of sanity in an insane world. Best of luck.

       Are you JOKING? That is ALL they said about Dylann Roof - "racist terrorists." In fact, the comment you just made has been make a least a million times already.

       I bet you are talking about women's rights aren't you?  That's fucking retarded...Pakistan had a women Prime Minister.  Huh, isn't that amazing - those misogynistic bastards voted a woman into office?   Shame she got assassinated up by Al-Qaeda...wonder what she said that pissed them off so much?

       Actually, most of my friends are Muslim. And living in Brooklyn, I've met thousands of all different kinds of Muslims from all over the world. I've personally read the Quran and studied the faith for years, and like I said have interacted directly with the culture my whole life.
      </p>
      <p>
       You conveniently ignored my point that all three main Abrahamic religions all pray to the same Yahweh. Muslim faith is entirely compatible with Western culture. What you're noticing isn't about Islam in specific, but religion in general. People in the east are much more religious in the west. Symphony of church and state, as well as strict observance of religious rules,
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       is incompatible with Western culture. But the set of ideals valued in Islam is completely compatible with Western culture because it's virtually the same as what Christians and Jews value, and those have already proven themselves to be compatible with our culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wahabbism/Salafism is a whole different story, that shit has fundamentally got to go and isn't compatible with
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       culture.

      <p>
       Right, because who cares? I'm not particularly interested in their mythology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of Muslims barely practice their faith and are Westernized. In their case, it hardly matters because they are hardly Muslim.
      </p>
      <p>
       But those that take their faith seriously are required to support things (like death for apostasy) that are incompatible with Western ideas.

       I bet you thought you were going to get a lot of brownie points for living in New York and knowing Muslims, but so has mostly every else. You are not special, not particularly more cosmopolitian than others, and Islam is
       <em>
        is

       still foreign to the West and fundamentally incompatible with it.

       Islamophobia is something creares by us. 30 years ago no one cares about muslims, they where on Asia doing "muslims" things. Since we entered, they had became our enemies. It has no sense.

       My muslims friends buy at Zara, costco., H&amp;M... Usually travels to Europe to visit their family and visit cities... How can they be incompatible with "West"? Only because they don't eat pork? Jews either...

       You are literally just making up lies now. I can almost guarantee that I have personally known more Muslims that you, and I never said anything about whites being "superior."

       You are literally just making up lies and strawmen.

       Actually, most of my friends are Muslim. And living in Brooklyn, I've met thousands of all different kinds of Muslims from all over the world. I've personally read the Quran and studied the faith for years, and like I said have interacted directly with the culture my whole life.

       You conveniently ignored my point that all three main Abrahamic religions all pray to the same Yahweh. Muslim faith is entirely compatible with Western culture. What you're noticing isn't about Islam in specific, but religion in general. People in the east are much more religious in the west. Symphony of church and state, as well as strict observance of religious rules,
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       is incompatible with Western culture. But the set of ideals valued in Islam is completely compatible with Western culture because it's virtually the same as what Christians and Jews value, and those have already proven themselves to be compatible with our culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wahabbism/Salafism is a whole different story, that shit has fundamentally got to go and isn't compatible with
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       culture.
