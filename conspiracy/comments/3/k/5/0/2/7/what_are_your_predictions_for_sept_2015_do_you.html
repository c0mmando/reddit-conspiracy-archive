<p>In your opinion, what do you think will happen the the average U.S. Citizen? Will it be like a post-apocalyptic world, or just some tough times for a few weeks/months?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard every idea under the spectrum and id love to hear your opinion as well :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve given it a lot of thought as to what could potentially take place if/when the economy completely tanks. Call me a pessimist haha but I can totally see it being like an apocalypse scenario, looting, fires, riots, I mean I think it&#39;s safe to say, and may be a bit of an understatement, that people will be pretty upset about it. I live in A small town in South Texas, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll get really crazy here, but I can imagine it being pretty much hell on earth in more urban areas. Hopefully that provided some insight. Would love to discuss more with you or anyone else. You all have a nice day :) </p>

<p>Oh! I should probably add, I don&#39;t expect it to go completely wrong in September, just get worse as time goes on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would <em>you</em> go &quot;completely ape shit, batty insane&quot;?  Would you riot?  Would you start hurting and killing people...just because?  I don&#39;t know if you would or wouldn&#39;t, but I know I wouldn&#39;t.  I&#39;m going to assume you think yourself as someone who <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> go apeshit crazy...so if you think of yourself like that, then you have to ask yourself why you think that the rest of the country would be so different.</p>

<p>I understand that there have been riots, etc, but I think for the most part this whole &quot;everyone would go <em>craaazzzyyy!!</em>&quot; mentality that people (it seems many people, unfortunately) have has a <em>lot</em> more to do with the social/societal brainwashing and programing that they/we get indoctrinated under and don&#39;t actually even know it.</p>

<p>We live in a society where we are made to feel inadequate if you don&#39;t buy, buy, buy &quot;the next big thing!&quot;  You grow up watching msm program after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv-GTna6VAY">msm program</a> where the main objective is covert control and consumerist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ3RzGoQC4s">propaganda</a> - a system that does little more than scare the public with fear mongering and a running theme heavily implying that the masses would not be able to take care of themselves and act orderly unless a big, governmental, bureaucracy is breathing over them/us - and it&#39;s no surprise that many of us almost reflexively think that &quot;everyone will go insane!&quot; if the economy goes south.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to pretend that things would be great.  Of course not.  However, the idea that the country would somehow turn into some sort of scene in a movie when all the inmates suddenly get set free doesn&#39;t seem very likely or well through-through to me.</p>

<p>Movies like &quot;The Purge&quot; and its sequel(s) do very little to dispel this continued brain washing exaggeration of things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I understand what you&#39;re saying. I really should&#39;ve stressed that I am not 100% on the whole riots and craziness scenario, so for that I apologize as it seems like I&#39;m am dead set on it, when I&#39;m really not; I guess I should really give people more credit than that huh?

    <div class="md"><p>While many (all?) of us might be easily-manipulatable on one level or the other toward violence, etc, I think that the general tendency of most (all?) of us is to simply live in peace with ourselves and our loved ones, and if we&#39;re left to our own devices <em>without</em> any sort of covert, clandestine manipulation cajoling us to act against ourselves and each other, we wouldn&#39;t necessarily start just killing and robbing and looting each other just because.</p>

<p>This is not to say that I&#39;m some optimistic ray of sunshine.  No.  I can actually be seen as a general misanthrope to a great extent.  However, I&#39;d say this is the case because I see the violence and vice on this planet, know that it doesn&#39;t <em>have</em> to be that way, and it becomes discouraging to see how far behind the ladder of psycho-emotional-spiritual evolution the human race has descended.</p>

<p>I think we are capable of great harm, but we are also capable of great good as well.  Which is manifested is the great battle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the way I see it: If all this talk of occult conspiracy of Luciferians, Satanists, Rosy-cross types, Zionists, Freemasons, etc. etc. is FOR REAL, they have no choice but to try to pull off some kind of massive ritual -- it&#39;s obviously been in the cards, and all the dates lineup for Shimita, Jubilee, blood moons, etc. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there is any question that something is going to happen, the only question is how big. I&#39;m expecting significant economic reset, massive market crash, some violence. But it might be much worse than that -- false flag terror attack to blame the collapse upon, etc. </p>

<p>From Sept 11 to Sept 28, watch your  back. those are the dates when all bets are off. </p>

<p>If nothing happens, I may be leaving this subreddit for while. Because I never felt any concern about Y2K or 12/21/12, but this one feels like the real deal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An economic collapse is inevitable, but we can&#39;t say how or when it&#39;ll happen. Maybe things collapse over a few days, or maybe there&#39;s a slow decline over a few years. I think all we <em>can</em> say is that TPTB <strong>want</strong> us to believe something will happen on Sept-23 -- there&#39;s no way that this fear campaign is all organic.</p>

<p>That said.. I read somewhere that suggested 9-11 was deliberately place shortly after the Y2K scare because the public was already on edge. One could argue that something awful is planned for Sept 23, 2015, shortly after the scare of 2012, for the same reason.</p>

<p>If I get a vote, Imma pull for a fake alien invasion for the special effects. Or a tsunami because I just learned how to surf. Just... no starvation -- that&#39;s weak.</p>

<ul>
<li>to paralyze us into inaction -- if we&#39;re all prepping for some big event, then we&#39;re not planning/acting against TPTB</li>
<li>to discredit us when we go warning all our friends and then nothing happens</li>

    <div class="md"><p>With the falling oil prices, Russia now in Syria and Ukraine, and the EU the migrant refugee conspiracy.  I believe the Market will crash on Monday the 14 or the 15.  The World economy is slowing especially in Asia and most of Western Europe.  The Refugee crisis in Greece is most likely to explode in violence against the migrant Muslims and will stir the EU Muslim community to backlash against the Europeans into violence as seen in France for the past few years. 
Asia and the Brick nations are discussing droping the dollar as the reserve currency.  Janet Yellen has yet to be tested by a market crash and all New Fed Charmin has to deal with a market collapse within their first term(Volker, Greenspan, Bernanke, all has market collapses after appointment.). It seem real this time and now people are listening and looking into the spectacularly odd coincidences of these market collapses.  Every thing seem to be falling into place.  Especially Yellan to be tested</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we&#39;ll see a major reset in the economy and quite possibly removing the USD as the global currency. It will probably start in Sept but will keep escalating over the next few years. I think it will be much bigger than 2008.</p>

<p>I think the NWO is going to move into gear starting this Sept with the Pope speech at the UN as well. I think you will see Russia and China invade the US within the next five years. I think you will see nuclear bombs dropped on the US and it will look like the USA will crumble. At that point the USA will turn back to the Lord and everything will turn around. The Lord will rebuild America even stronger than before. </p>

<p>I understand that many people in this sub are non religious and only look at the physical side of these things. But the spiritual battle that is going helps me see how it all fits together. The Bible tells the whole story including the end. So that brings great peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I myself an non-religious, but that doesn&#39;t mean that your statement is inherently wrong... I could tend to agree with several of your points!</p>

<p>What leads you to believe we&#39;ll see an economic reset? And if this were to happen, how would it affect our daily lives as average Americans?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with Keynesian economics. You can&#39;t sustain a recovery by just printing your way out of it. It helps in the short term but the long term it will cause a huge bubble that will lead to major problems. I think many other nations are very upset that we are doing it. They own a lot of our debt and dollars and we are devaluing it. I know the dollar has improved lately but overall, when you print a trillion dollars there will be some devaluation. </p>

<p>Honestly, I think the key country is Japan. Very few people have been talking about Japan but they are in a huge mess. They own a lot of US debt and when they start selling our bonds it could start the domino free fall. What happens when there is a selloff of US TBonds? What does the US Govt do when no one wants to buy Tbonds? What happens when the US Govt has to drastically cut spending? What happens when entitlements get drastic cuts? Like all disability, food stamps, welfare, public housing all get cut by 50%? Riots. Food shortatges. Rationing of food. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be as bad off as the depression because we are much more developed. But there will be martial law. Read about Argentina in the early 2000s. It was chaos. I&#39;m guessing 40% unemployment. High inflation. Black markets everywhere to sell goods.  </p>

<p>What happens when China and Russia have a struggling economy? They have the chose of letting the people riot and their govt getting overthrown or they can choose a scapegoat. They will blame the US and join together and attack the US. I lived in China for a few years. All Chinese believe that it is China&#39;s rightful place in history to be the world power. They have been for longer than any other nation and they were completely humiliated by the western countries coming in and carving up their country. They are just waiting for a chance to get back on top. Russia and Putin are the same. They are still angry about the collapse of the Soviet Union and the loss of the cold war. And together they believe that they can defeat the US. How will the US fund a huge global war when we are so in debt? You think our enemies are going to borrow us money to fight them? Wars are not won and lost because of might or strategy, they are lost because they run out of money and fuel. Which China and Russia have more than us. It&#39;s going to be ugly.</p>

<p>But there is hope. The church will unite to hold the line. We will see sweeping reforms. Most congressman will resign. The constitutional convention will be held and we will restore govt to its original form. There may be a civil war or succession. But I think that will only be for a short time. Good thing Americans like guns. We&#39;re going to need them when Russia and China come. </p>
