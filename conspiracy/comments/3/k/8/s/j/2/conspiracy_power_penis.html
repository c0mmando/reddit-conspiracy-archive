<p>Be a REAL MAN, step aside and ask the women what work needs to be done. Then do it, for them and for humanity. LISTEN AND ACT!! And love. No more discussion is necessary.</p>

<p>Men have had their chance. They have tried to fuck Gaia into submission, they want to see their explosion of jizz blowing like geysers out of her every opening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, because women are perfect and everything would be solved if we give all of the corrupting power to <em>them</em>.  No woman has done anything selfish or evil right?</p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t men.</p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t Jews.</p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t one demographic of the human population.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the abusers of power.  The sociopaths that are bred and selected by the shadow elite to enact their agendas.  The spiritually wicked in high places.  They hide behind things like religion, sex, and ethnicity to play on these divisive tendencies.  Stop falling for it.</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t superior because you&#39;re a man or a woman.  You aren&#39;t superior because you&#39;re white or black.  You aren&#39;t born better.  I&#39;d sooner follow an invalid that speaks the truth than some Semiramis wannabe.  I&#39;ll be a real man by following what is righteous and that doesn&#39;t entail bowing down to someone based on their sex.</p>

I actually think some people that make it into political positions may be decent but they&#39;re blackmailed if they step too far out of line.

<p>I draw on some Biblical inspiration as well,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. (Ephesians 6:12)</p>

<p>For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. (Romans 10:11-13)</p>

<p>Then you very clearly stated, &quot;I never said there weren&#39;t any. But the ones that are, they sure keep it to themselves.&quot;  According to that comment, those who are not airheads hide their intelligence which still insults all women.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not an insult if its the truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is not the truth because there a lot of women in government, science, academia,  media, etc. who do not hide their intelligence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if your insulted by it, well, then there&#39;s a case right there of a person not suited to public position...because there are insulting people.</p>

<p>An assumption like that indicates a person not suited to a public position.</p>

<p>Just because women do many of the same jobs as men does not mean they do not shine in their chosen fields.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The context of that question seems sexist because men do not know everything as repeatedly documented by current events &amp; history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should. I&#39;m good at giving directions. </p>

<p>Your defending a position that is also generalizing. Of men. The Sarah Palin&#39;s, the Margaret Thatcher&#39;s, the Kim Campbell&#39;s have never done a better job then a man. Some men aren&#39;t any better at the job then an inanimate object. They aren&#39;t there to do it any better, they are there to do what they are told.</p>

<p>I&#39;m progressive enough to step behind a woman. I haven&#39;t yet met one worth doing so. Are they out there? Sure they are. But where are they? 
There are plenty of women in positions. They don&#39;t shine. Why? That&#39;s a man&#39;s fault? How? There aren&#39;t any women leaders or bosses? What do they do that&#39;s any better then a man?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I had assumed you would respond with another incorrect counter-argument, like you did just now. I was hoping that you would infer that I wanted the argument to end and that would end it; Instead you decided to instigate. How about we end the conversation right now and save us both the trouble.</p>

<p>The only point being exemplified here is someone is having a crampy day. 
I&#39;m convinced now that this is trolling. <em>sigh</em> I fell for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You clearly didn&#39;t read my comment then. I very clearly said if I had to rely on one of them -- pretty plainly saying the ones I did know -- then I&#39;d rather not.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not an insult if its the truth. And if your insulted by it, well, then there&#39;s a case right there of a person not suited to public position...because there are insulting people.</p>

<p>If it makes you feel any better boo-boo, there are plenty of men I&#39;d rather not see in decision making positions as well.</p>
