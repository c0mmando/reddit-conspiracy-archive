       Ok, so this concerns me greatly.

      <p>
       The ufo sighting in Florida was coincidentally within a couple hours of the FCC shut down there.

       Thanks for saying so. I am on mobile, and I don't think I can link. Also, noone can ignore MSM coverage of ufo's all of a sudden, with a side of flat earth, and a pile of shills.

       I have no idea. There's so much that's supposed to climax in September it's hard to say...I'm hoping this is all just silly paranoia and nothing drastic will happen, but I feel like we are being prepped for something. Everyone I speak to on the matter, regardless of who they are, what they believe in etc, can feel something brewing.

       All we can do is wait and see I guess.

       There is a lot of "As long as I can go get food with my car and live pretty comfortably and don't live in fear of dem terrorists terrorizing me I'm fine" going on with it.

       An Atlas V rocket carrying a satellite was launched and it left an odd looking trail that people caught on their dash cams and cellphone cameras. You can consult the launch list here:

       That means approximately nothing. Keep in mind that rocket launches will look different dependent on the atmospheric conditions and the time of day. Just because it LOOKED different to people in the area doesn't mean it was. Non-anecdotal evidence says it was a satellite that was launched with an Atlas V. If you can provide non-anecdotal evidence that it was something else then you'd have room for speculation.

       ATC is controlling air traffic as they've done for decades. Yet every time I point this out I receive massive down votes. The hysteria here is completely unjustified and most here make it clear absolutely no facts are desired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ads-b and tcas are both entirely optional. They are not required equipment and are not required nor necessary for safe air travel. This equipment is relatively new and safe air travel proceeds this equipment for decades. Many aircraft do not even have this equipment which means literally no impact for many pilots.
      </p>
      <p>
       ATC still uses radar. ATC still used radio. ATC still uses transponders. ATC still controls the airspace. Pilots still file and follow IFR procedures. Navigation devices (vor and ndb) and GPS still function.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the lengthy post I've provided on this before which contains actual facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guys, calm down. Lots of bad information here.  Loss of ADS-B and TCAS are no big deal. It's basically yawn worthy. It does, however, increase ATC workload. Regardless, both are newer technologies and loss does not constitute a significant issue. It's an annoyance at worse with only a slight loss of air safety and a higher workload and smaller margins for safety for ATC. TCAS is a collision alert and avoidance system and ADS-B is a radar supplement which frequently provides visibility to pilots rather than just ATC. Transponders are still used/required, which means radar as before. Airspace is still controlled exactly as its always been. Pilots have been flying for decades without this technology and many aircraft still do not have this technology in the cockpit. For many Pilots, there is zero impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bluntly, you do this type of thing as a security measure to prevent position reporting and tracking outside of the radar environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       To better understand the security point of view look at this video. While it doesn't specifically speak of security issues I trust you'll understand the significance of position reporting VIPs in real-time.

       Understand this is less than $40 worth of hardware, plus computer. Barrier to entry It's extremely low. The radio model can be had for $20, delivered and the software is free and open source.

       Great post, havnt watched the video or followed you links yet but catch your drift.

       Is this a regular thing that happens then? Going off the post 100% it does seem a little coincidental the way it says last time they put these systems down was 9/11...definitely scaremongering, but do you know if they do this often?

       Thank you for the reasonable reply. Not sure why you were down voted but I up voted you. See my history (link) for additional details provided in previous exchanges. I posted a link to the original exchange which provides additional details which were allowed because someone desired more information rather than delusional confirmation bias. Sincerely, thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not aware of other tcas or ads-b outages. I wouldn't be surprised if they've happened before. I do know GPS outages have happened before, which is far, far more significant. You will find in the original discussion others noted multiple VIPs travelling during this period. As such a reasonable non-nefarious assumption is as I've outlined above. Which is to say, a reasonable security precaution which carries only minor negative safety implications.

       Thank you for this info.  As
       <em>
        ichoosejif
       </em>
       said in the post below, many of us are just trying to put things together.  I adamantly admit, that I do not know what half those words mean in the "nbaa" link.
       <br/>
       I tried to ignore the article below the "nbaa" link since it was a third party source.
       <br/>
       You have to understand that right now there is a build up of information/disinformation far beyond what I have ran into in the past decade plus that I have been trying to find different truths.  So I see that the military shut something down and it just adds to the pile.
       <br/>
       I do take everything with a grain of salt and I hope I'm just being a paranoid fool.
       <br/>
       Anyway, I will research those links you posted so I can be better informed.  Thank you. :)

       I assume the nbaa reference is actually ads-b. If you check my history you'll find I posted a link to the original discussion. In it I describe how things work with radar and transponders as well as ads-b.
      </p>
      <p>
       The short version is that ads-b reports the aircraft's GPS position and altitude.

       Thanks for this information. I do respectfully disagree on a couple points - your reference to predicting the response that "we" have, and stating "we" don't require facts, are two incorrect generalizations. This is

       There's no we. This is a group (ftmp) of independent thinkers. Unlike the spoon fed public.

       Before you face palm, think....I'm just putting thoughts together. I thought we all were.

       That's certainly a fair reply. You'll have to forgive me given conspiracy has overwhelmingly spoken in two previous exchanges that only misinformation and scaremongering is desired, facts be damned. This is obviously a generalization (in fairness I predicated with "most") with the assumption there are some dissenters as some up votes were provided in previous exchanges and here. Regardless, on this specific matter conspiracy as a whole has been less than honorable.

       You, like the other who politely and respectfully replied, I thank you. Sincerely.

       It's been shilly round these parts, and I don't doubt you came across some bass ackwards ignorance.

       I do remain intrigued by the lack of transparency here.

       What do you mean when you say "pick up traffic beyond the radar " (not verbatim) could you explain this please? I'm blonde.

       Please view my history. I recently posted a link to the original discussion. In that discussion I explain how radar/transponders work as well as ads-b.
