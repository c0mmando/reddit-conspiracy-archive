       Let's get real here: the mainstream media has only started to care about this in the past few weeks, and since then, it's been balls to the wall coverage. Why now? Is it part of a plan by Washington to trump up support for an all-out invasion of Syria?

       It's recently gone out of control and there really economic migrants. They keep on heading and want to go to certain European countries, (UK, Sweden and Germany). Poor Germany has already taken 800,000, nobody asked. The Arab countries aka their neighbouring countries aren't doing nothing. Nobody wants them, the EU is causing all this.

       I agree with your comment, however some and I emphasise some Arab countries are taking them in, but Europe is receiving a vast influx of immigrants that has not happened since ww2 and it is only going to put an even larger strain on society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially here in the UK, most of us are not happy with the way our country is being lead and with an even larger number of immigrants arriving could be a catalyst for a civil war, but knowing us were to polite to do anything other than bitch about the situation online.
The Egyptians used the Internet to revolt and we use it as a tool to say we're not happy.

       The EU didn't directly cause this, US funds and train the rebels fighting in Syria/Iraq and EU on some cases blindly followed US into the middle east. But the majority of all this is caused by US.

       I believe Germany has only set aside money in the budget for 800k - they have not actually taken them in at this point. 
Also, just to be clear, that number refers to people taken in for processing, after which they are supposed to be allocated to other countries. Germany has in fact only pledged to allow 30k to stay permanently over the next 2 years.

       The thing about Germany taking 800,000 is, they're not really taking 800,000 - once granted citizenship, which they will get, they are free to travel all over the EU, and probably a lot of non-EU countries quite easily and legally.

       This is my best guess. The fascists are ready to clamp down upon the West and they require a catalyzing event to plausibly swoop in. That way, instead of rebelling, the populace will be divided. Some will say the peace is being kept, some will say it's necessary, and some will say it's a power move.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, the elites move right on ahead with their original plans. It's an old trick. If you study history, you see it everywhere.

       Is the American public hearing about these syrian refugees and talking about taking them in? Australia is doing this right now aswell. I hate to think that this going to be used globally to funnel 'ISIS' into Coalition countries. This would also most likely have disastrous humanitarian implications
