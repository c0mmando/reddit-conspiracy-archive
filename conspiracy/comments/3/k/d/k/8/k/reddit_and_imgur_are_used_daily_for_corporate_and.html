<p>these dudes had been &quot;caught&quot; doing what reddit staff is doing each fucking day</p>

<p>post after post of corporate fascist promotion on front page, government propaganda everywhere, but some &quot;smart&quot; user figured out how a indie company promoted their shitty game using bots.</p>

<p>brave dude, now what about checking the real deal?</p>

<p>just get a random front post and check the countless shills, bots, fucking censorship of comments, shadowbans, fucking ridicule of anything that 0,001% don&#39;t want to hear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t like the idea of anything being restricted on the sites - even corporate propaganda. That&#39;s not to say I like corporate propaganda, just that supporting any censorship marginalized free discussion. Not to mention that as a private site, Exxon Mobil or Goldman Sachs could moderate things and it would be the owners of the site&#39;s decision; it&#39;s just your decision to keep using the site. Again, not saying I like it, but this is a private site and people tend to forget that.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s such a red herring</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While it&#39;s a popular term to throw around, you might need to look up &#39;red herring&#39;. By no means is saying that a private site can censor its content a distraction or fallacy in a discussion specifically about the content of said private site. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But then you claim that banning corporate propaganda is censorship, if that makes any sense</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it&#39;s only censorship when your speech is banned? It doesn&#39;t have to be agreeable speech being banned to constitute censorship. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say &#39;if you don&#39;t like the way it is run just leave and don&#39;t complain.&#39; But I will say if you don&#39;t like the way it&#39;s run, you can complain and have concerns, but you also <em>can</em> leave.&quot; That&#39;s the beauty in using a free, private service. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it has nothing to do with anything. Everyone on this sub is aware of the fact that Reddit is private. </p>

<p>Unlike you, that doesn&#39;t end the willingness for some people to discuss an issue. </p>

<p>And yes, people can leave. Another great point. </p>

<p>As far as your point on censorship goes, give me a break. Your &quot;standards&quot; being applied here are an absolutely useless abstraction. Feel free to argue in reality on this issue and not hide being the most generic platitudes possible. </p>
