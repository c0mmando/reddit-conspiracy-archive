      <p>
       post after post of corporate fascist promotion on front page, government propaganda everywhere, but some "smart" user figured out how a indie company promoted their shitty game using bots.

      <p>
       brave dude, now what about checking the real deal?
      </p>
      <p>
       just get a random front post and check the countless shills, bots, fucking censorship of comments, shadowbans, fucking ridicule of anything that 0,001% don't want to hear.

       I don't like the idea of anything being restricted on the sites - even corporate propaganda. That's not to say I like corporate propaganda, just that supporting any censorship marginalized free discussion. Not to mention that as a private site, Exxon Mobil or Goldman Sachs could moderate things and it would be the owners of the site's decision; it's just your decision to keep using the site. Again, not saying I like it, but this is a private site and people tend to forget that.

       This argument is always brought up but it's such a red herring.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who "forgot" that this is a privately owned site? You say that like opposition to this is confused or misplaced.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then you claim that banning corporate propaganda is censorship, as if that makes any sense. As if full commitment to a uselessly abstract conception of censorship should guide our behavior over the actual reality of what we're talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having issues with propaganda and censorship do not require a government actor. Of course this is a private site.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'if you don't like the way it's run just leave and don't complain' is an absolute bullshit point to make and it's sad that it's getting upvotes in this sub.

      <p>
       While it's a popular term to throw around, you might need to look up 'red herring'. By no means is saying that a private site can censor its content a distraction or fallacy in a discussion specifically about the content of said private site.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But then you claim that banning corporate propaganda is censorship, if that makes any sense
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So it's only censorship when your speech is banned? It doesn't have to be agreeable speech being banned to constitute censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't say 'if you don't like the way it is run just leave and don't complain.' But I will say if you don't like the way it's run, you can complain and have concerns, but you also
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       leave." That's the beauty in using a free, private service.

       Because it has nothing to do with anything. Everyone on this sub is aware of the fact that Reddit is private.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike you, that doesn't end the willingness for some people to discuss an issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, people can leave. Another great point.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as your point on censorship goes, give me a break. Your "standards" being applied here are an absolutely useless abstraction. Feel free to argue in reality on this issue and not hide being the most generic platitudes possible.
