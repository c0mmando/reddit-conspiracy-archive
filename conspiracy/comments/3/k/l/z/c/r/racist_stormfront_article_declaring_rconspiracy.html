<p><strong><a href="https://archive.is/5EBcB#selection-469.0-469.40">Reddit is Fertile Ground for Recruitment</a></strong></p>

<p>Many of you will remember this article and the ruckus that it created in this sub. Accusations of racism were flying against the sub and its members - with the usual suspects wagging the usual finger.</p>

<p>Following today&#39;s revelations about <strong><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/australian-is-jihadist-is-actually-an-jewish-american-troll-20150911-gjk852.html">the arrest of Joshua Ryne Goldberg</a></strong>, a user in <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3khy08/fbi_arrests_jewish_american_for_posing_as/cuy35br">noted the following:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The neo-Nazi site Daily Stormer has a long article about Golldberg today, saying that <a href="https://archive.is/66b37">they were duped into carrying articles by him under the alias &quot;Michael Slay&quot;</a>. The Stormer article says they&#39;ve now deleted all of his articles, but a few can be found on archive.is, including one in which <a href="https://archive.is/7lQiA">he encourages &quot;white nationalists&quot; to infiltrate and recruit new members on reddit.</a> A quick search of reddit shows that the reddit user name associated with &quot;Michael Slay&quot; was <a href="/u/European88">/u/European88</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Note: Both of the above links lead to <strong>archived</strong> versions of the Stormfront articles - because, who in their right mind would click on a fucking STORMFRONT link???)</p>

<p>Below is a link to the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> thread that came out when the (fake) article was published:</p>

<p>[Stormfront has targeted r/conspiracy as an &quot;ideal recruiting ground&quot;. Don&#39;t fall for their racist propaganda.](np.reddit.com<a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/3dpodb/stormfront_has_targeted_rconspiracy_as_an_ideal/">/r/conspiracy/comments/3dpodb/stormfront_has_targeted_rconspiracy_as_an_ideal/</a>). </p>

<p>You&#39;ll see in my comment (second from the top) that I smelled a rat even then, accusing Stormfront of being a &quot;honeypot&quot;. </p>

<p>Apparently I was right?</p>

<p>So here we have Goldberg (a Jew), pretending to be a &quot;white supremacist&quot;, writing Jew-hating articles on Stormfront for the specific purpose of defaming this sub by falsely linking it to that filthy website. And of course the clowns on TopMinds and IsRConspiracyRacist were celebrating.</p>

<p>When you see articles or comments that are BLATANTLY RACIST appearing on this sub, you can bet that they are being published (and upvoted) by clowns like Goldberg, who was himself a contributor to the aforementioned subs.</p>

<p>My condolences to the boys over at TopMinds and IsRConspiracyRacist. They&#39;ve lost a friend and a valuable asset today.  </p>

<p>Would anyone like to donate some Kleenexes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are not.  Here&#39;s why.</p>

<p>Bluepilled sheep think the identity of their politicians matter.  They believe in fronts like the Democrats or Republicans.  This is identity politics (which is the same thing as stormfronters: GOP, dems, and racists all think exactly the same way).  People who make an effort to dig deeper, learn real history, see where policies really originated, read the original white papers that precede the political rhetoric that justifies them to the masses, and so on know that <em>leaders are just figureheads for broader policy initiatives</em>.</p>

<p>Part of the enlightenment process that is inherent to uncovering the ongoing conspiracies in our world is therefore a recognition that POLICY, not PEOPLE matters.  Any good conspiracy theorist can trace the history of IDEAS and how they were used to hoodwink the masses and send them down a destructive road.</p>

<p>We therefore know the source of power of the conspirators and realize that by exposing the history of the ideas (like 9/11 being a false flag), you can undermine the power of the conspirators without ever even naming them.  Ultimately that&#39;s all that people want here.  Get rid of the nonsense and get back on the right track.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve personally gotten into multiple debates on this sub with storm fronters, there&#39;s an entire sub devoted to calling them out on here.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/isrconspiracyracist/">https://www.reddit.com/r/isrconspiracyracist/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/ujhlkdu.png">http://i.imgur.com/ujhlkdu.png</a></p>

<p>Also, as for 9/11 being a false flag who do you think is more correct here.</p>

<p>The tiny minority of truthers in the scientific community, or the overwhelming majority of scientists and physicists that have debunked this claims time and time again?</p>

<p>The 9/11 conspiracy doesn&#39;t even pass basic critical thinking.</p>

<p>There is literally zero logical reason to bring the buildings down, they could have justified a war by simply flying planes into the buildings.</p>

<p>So ask yourself this, which is more likely.</p>

<p>The government managed to silence thousands of people for years after carrying out a false flag attack of unnecessary proportions or a lot of people suffer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia</a></p>

<p>The logistics of a 9/11 style false flag attack would be mind blowing and impossible to cover up.</p>

<p>The government can&#39;t cover up bill getting blown in his office but can keep god knows how many people silent? and then on top of that have managed to convince 99% of the scientific community to side with them?</p>

<p>I understand your average truther suffers from severe confirmation bias but how about reading something that goes against your narrative?</p>

<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wtc7lies/home">https://sites.google.com/site/wtc7lies/home</a></p>

<p>I spend a lot of time on this sub debating people, and the lack of critical thinking ability is really out of control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, do you realize what this thread is about?  FAKE stormfronters posting here to make it look bad.  No one is saying you have not argued with people pretending to be stormfronters.  The claim is that conspiratorial thinking and identity politics tend to be incompatible.  If you encounter stormweenies here, they are probably fake.</p>

<p>Second, I went to a top 10 university for the entire world.  I&#39;m smart and I know lots of other smart people.  NONE of us believe the government&#39;s 9/11 story.  I&#39;m sorry if the media convinced you otherwise, but it simply isn&#39;t true.  I know this because I know these people personally.  So bugger off.</p>

<p>And I do believe I linked a screenshot of a stormfront propaganda video being posted by the mods of this sub on the sidebar.</p>

<p>Are they fake stormfronters too? what if I told you anyone that feels the need to claim they&#39;re smart in an effort to defend an argument they can&#39;t defend any other way isn&#39;t actually a smart person?</p>

<p>The media didn&#39;t convince me of anything, the overwhelming majority of the scientific community convinced me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man, I subbed here because I find the odd conspiracy interesting, and the crazy ones a good exercise in limiting my gullibility. I love to see people approaching these ideas logically and actually chewing through them, because while there may not be quite as many as this sub may think, there are for sure conspiracies out there, and it&#39;s nice to see a bit of separation of the crazy ones.</p>

<p>&quot;Does being an engineer make me stupid?&quot; Nice proof bro I&#39;m a spaceship door gunner twice deployed to Mars. </p>

<p>&quot;I went to one of the top 10 universities in the world.&quot; Nice one bro. How many scientific journals did you read there where the author would randomly put SOME words in ALL caps for emphasis instead of relying on the eloquence of the language they were writing in? Did they teach you the theory of the &#39;Blue Pill&#39; there too or did you have to take that during your stint at a community college?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, I&#39;m pro-Palestine so idk why I&#39;d by &#39;upset&#39; about a zionist posting on stormfront - seems to me the ulterior motive is in fact to discredit the conspiracy movement by encouraging fringe ideas like holocaust denial to take center-stage. So guess he succeeded there then.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s laughable if you think there weren&#39;t stormfronters who read that thread and thought &quot;oh look, this will be a good place to spread the seeds of white nationalism&quot; - I guarantee at least some of them are still active here.</p>

<p>Truth is there is an active campaign to try and bring the conspiracy movement into disrepute and you are inadvertently contributing to that. Bravo. They want you to focus on the religious element so they can accuse you of antisemitism and dismiss anything else you say as irrelevant - a trap which you have swallowed hook line and sinker. There are corrupt Christians as well; to me their religion is an utter irrelevance - corruption is corruption and it&#39;s time that we recognised the world for what it is - and that is ruled by a capitalist cabal motivated primarily by a greed and self-preservation, I really don&#39;t see how the teachings of the Torah or any other such religious crap comes into it. But hey, feel free to focus on the zionist element and ignore the bigger picture - you are going to dismiss anything I say automatically anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes this Jew much more dangerous than an internet troll is that he was trying to instigate actual terror attacks which would kill people, all to be pinned on ISIS:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theage.com.au/national/australian-is-jihadist-is-actually-an-jewish-american-troll-20150911-gjk852.html">http://www.theage.com.au/national/australian-is-jihadist-is-actually-an-jewish-american-troll-20150911-gjk852.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>An affidavit sworn at the time of the arrest says that, between August 19 and August 28, Mr Goldberg &quot;distributed information pertaining to the manufacturing of explosives, destructive devices, or weapons of mass destruction in furtherance of an activity that constitutes a Federal crime of violence&quot;.</p>

<p>US Attorney Lee Bentley III, said Goldberg instructed a confidential source how to make a bomb similar to two used in the Boston Marathon bombings two years ago that killed three people and injured more than 260 others.</p>

<p>He allegedly instructed someone how to fill the bomb with nails, metal and other items dipped in rat poison.</p>

<p>Police base the charge on his communication of five web links to sites that provided instructions that could be used to make explosives as part of a plot to explode a bomb on September 13 at a memorial ceremony in Kansas City, commemorating the 9/11 the terrorist attacks.</p>

<p>The affidavit, released by Special agent William Berry of US Customs and Border Protection, says that Goldberg had initially denied to officers that he had any involvement with distributing information on how to make a bomb, but then later admitted it.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Goldberg further admitted that he believed the information would create a genuine bomb,&quot;</strong> Agent Berry alleged.</p>

<p><strong>However, Goldberg also claimed that he meant for the person he was communicating with to either kill himself creating the bomb or, that Goldberg intended to warn police in time</strong> so that he would receive &quot;credit for stopping the attack&quot;.</p>

<p>down here in Southern MN, we had a child raping gun supplying bastard walk with 90 days for his crimes, all because he was/is a prosecution witness for the LaDue case.</p>

<p>a 90 day sentence for multiple rapes of a child is rather lenient, even for our modern corrupt &#39;justice&#39; system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zionist Jews spreading &quot;anti-semitism&quot; online?</p>

<p>This is old hat:</p>

<p><a href="http://aryanskynet.wordpress.com/2015/01/29/the-espionage-model-ii/">http://aryanskynet.wordpress.com/2015/01/29/the-espionage-model-ii/</a></p>

<p>Part of the Jewish shtick is that everyone is always oppressing them. The reality? Most people don&#39;t really care either way, so Zionist Jews have to MAKE UP &quot;anti-semitism.&quot;</p>

<p>Just look at places like <a href="/r/isrconspiracyracist">/r/isrconspiracyracist</a> or <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a> - they spend all day trying to find someone saying something they can spin as &quot;anti-semitism.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s well known now that most &quot;anti-semitic incidents&quot; on college campuses are Jews doing it themselves - not a year goes by without some Jewish girl painting a swastika on campus in order to say she&#39;s &quot;oppressed.&quot;</p>

<p>Without this fake &quot;anti-semitism&quot; most Jewish people would just drop the act - they don&#39;t believe the religion anyway - and just be normal white people.</p>

<p>But then who would support the apartheid regime of Jew bigotry in Zionist-occupied Palestine?</p>

<p>Hence, their problem.</p>

<p>On Vanguard, where this African-American persona posted more than 1,400 times, he encouraged the malevolence of Frazier Glenn Miller, the neo-Nazi accused of killing three people whom he believed were Jews outside a Jewish community center and retirement home in Kansas in April. The character Williams was engaged in a comment thread more than 200 times with Miller, whose screen name was Rounder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stormfront is a White Nationalist forum, and it&#39;s one that does its utmost to maintain a &quot;respectable&quot; face -- racial slurs are banned and looked down upon, generally, but &#39;scientific racism&#39; (i.e. justifying racism with statistics, or trying to) is the norm. </p>

<p>The Daily Stormer is a &#39;news&#39; site connected with 4chan&#39;s /pol/ board and 8chan. It uses a lot of racist &quot;jokes&quot;/memes originating on 4chan and uses silly, jokey, hyperbolic language and satire all over its site -- even though it&#39;s without a doubt a serious White Supremacist site. A good example of their behaviour (alongside /pol/) is their attacks on a Libertarian cartoon drawer named Ben Garrison -- they have been <a href="https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1431/29/1431299010140.png">editing his comics</a> for years to include anti-Semitic, Nazi caricatures and claiming Garrison is a neo-Nazi -- Google his name, it&#39;s somewhat amusing, but gives you a good idea of how their behaviour differs from regular racists. They&#39;re &quot;trolls&quot;, basically. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the thing many need to realize. It isnt places like storm front or other racist sites like that making people racist. Its TV. Or real world experiences. </p>

<p>I went to coontown of my own free will. No one encouraged me to go. Matter of fact no one encouraged me to stay. I did get a message once asking me if I wanted to join the Nazi party. I said no and was never asked again. </p>

<p>It was a place where many of us could share our stories and ask for advise or just vent about shit we have had to deal with. Now that isn&#39;t the case since it moved to voat. Its no longer a place to vent. </p>

<p>Coontown welcomed anyone with open arms that had a story and didn&#39;t judge you on race. Now n voat they do. Calling women that are white and was with a black man but since said nope they brand them coal burners. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not community to me its something else. I have voiced my concerns a couple times but never got a real response. Its all about white power and choosing a side. I don&#39;t agree with that. </p>

<p>They also by majority write off black children which I don&#39;t agree with either. They are the future whether they like it or not. They can change if you just fucking give a fuck about them.</p>

<p>Been called a cuck and a n<em>gg</em>r lover. Because of my views but I have witnessed people change. I have also seen them get worse. So I have been combing thru Facebook and twitter to find those that wish to inside violence and reporting them to local homeland security offices. </p>

<p>Cause its what real terrorism is to me. Been doing it with white people too. Cause fuck them as well.  So the whole reddit is a place to find racist is stupid. Women flock to coontown on voat now. What does that tell you? Every other day its a woman sharing a story. Maybe its made up but chances are it isn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you seem upset that once again, a dual citizen zionist is responsible for the bulk of the racial hatred.  Producing it from both sides of the debate.</p>

<p>The only reason i posted to /holocaust is because i believe it vital to a free society that we are allowed to question history and debate it freely without being targeted by hate speech laws that serve only to silence opinion.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t see <a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> in the news right now under arrest for encouraging a terrorist attack on 9-11 do you?</p>

<p>No thats right! you don&#39;t! What you see is a jewish american living in his mommy&#39;s basement making pressure cooker bombs with his mommy&#39;s William Sonoma copper plated pressure cooker.</p>

<p>You&#39;re sick man, and you&#39;re clearly on the wrong side of this incident.</p>
