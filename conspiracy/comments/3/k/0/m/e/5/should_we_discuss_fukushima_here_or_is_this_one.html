    <div class="md"><p>This is an interesting article on the increase in &quot;sea snot&quot; since 2011.</p>

<p>&quot;As mentioned, this snot covers about 1% of the floor, but now it seems to be covering about 98% of it. In the 24 years of this study, the past two years have been the biggest amounts of this detritus by far,” said marine biologist Christine Huffard, who works at the research station off of California. Multiple other stations throughout the Pacific have seen similarly alarming increases.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course we should talk about it. I was watching this one documentary (can&#39;t remember the name, trying to find it). That was saying that they missed the window to entomb it, and every plan to contain it will not work.

    <div class="md"><p>Go to Chernobyl and see how long you last. This is 100x the size of Chernobyl. It would be a nuclear winter in North America (as the fallout crosses the ocean) and most of that part of Asia. You think of a nuclear winter as an end to everything in a flash, no, it would take time. But eventually, the animals would die, life forms will die, water undrinkable, people would perish.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s just a catastrophe due to fallout and general leeching and pollution. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not defending that it would kill you...</p>

<p>A nuclear winter is when enough soot and earth is ejected (mass fire storms, significant nuclear event, meteor impact) and suspended in the stratosphere to a degree that net heat loss in the environment is greater than heat retention due to reflection of sun light (our heat source) over a given area - which is why I was saying I don&#39;t think Fukushima could produce this in it&#39;s current state, or ever really.</p>

<p>However, major nuclear contamination, pollution and leeching is a different and just as deadly story.</p>

<p>Firstly, the reactors and fuel pools need cooling, which requires access and monitoring. Secondly, groundwater ingress means that contaminated water would still be a problem no matter how much concrete they threw at it. </p>

<p>The only option is the much harder task of removing all fuel debris from the reactors, and removing the fuel rods from the fuel pools. This is what they plan to do, and they have already cleared the fuel pool in Unit 4, and are making progress on the pool in Unit 3.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They could&#39;ve entombed it, but now humans and even machines cannot get close enough to work on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. There has been constant work on the reactor buildings. The reactor floor level at Unit 3 is now cleared of debris just for a start.</p>

<p>There have also been many people investigating inside the reactor buildings, as radiation levels are slowly falling since the accident and as more debris are cleared. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately this post was made on the spur of the moment 
and I haven&#39;t gotten the information into a presentable form.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a starting point.</p>

<p>The short synopsis of the things that aren&#39;t generally known  is that the ionosphere heated unnaturally for several days before the tsunami.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/424033/atmosphere-above-japan-heated-rapidly-before-m9-earthquake/">http://www.technologyreview.com/view/424033/atmosphere-above-japan-heated-rapidly-before-m9-earthquake/</a></p>

<p>HAARP was also searching the earths mantel for weak spots and could interact with those weak spots.</p>

<p>&quot;HAARP Detection and Imaging of Underground Structures Using ELF/VLF Radio Waves&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/systems/haarp.htm">http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/systems/haarp.htm</a></p>

<p>and that   they had the ability to send ELF frequencies through the earth to &#39;communicate with submarines&#39;  causing a very widespread earth vibration of roughly  10 hz. </p>

<p><a href="http://engineering.nyu.edu/news/2015/03/11/reaching-ionosphere-talk-submarines-save-satellites">http://engineering.nyu.edu/news/2015/03/11/reaching-ionosphere-talk-submarines-save-satellites</a></p>

<p>Simultaneously  they were sending high frequencies into the ionosphere which I believe   bounced down to concentrate the ELF signals to any position desired such as the weak spots they had located,  sort of like a finger placed on a subwoofer might concentrate the vibrations at the point of contact.</p>

<p>Evidence of the high frequency signal bouncing   down from the ionosphere to stimulate the ELF signal  in a particular position 
is seen here.</p>

<p>There is a  reason for these  holes in clouds  given to us  but it doesn&#39;t wash for several reasons. </p>

<p>Air doesn&#39;t normally  travel in circles unless it is rotating and no rotation is evident.  </p>

<p>Nothing makes holes in clouds unless it is highly energetic. Planes for instance don&#39;t make holes in clouds as they pass. </p>

<p>The physics that allowed for these holes in clouds didn&#39;t appear to  work before the advent of HAARP for some reason and they don&#39;t  seem to work today  to my knowledge. Physics either is or it isn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t start in the 1990&#39;s and end by 2015.</p>

<p>In the past before we had any inkling of a problem in the area I had seen a story about the U.S  threatening just such a seismic attack if japan didn&#39;t go along with some U.S. demand.</p>

<p>That threat has become  obscure  now and I ask for any help that can be provided to find a record of it.</p>

<p>Here is very early evidence of a national nuclear  cover up of information.</p>

<p>I would like for many others to chime in with whatever they have to  add either before or after the event. Surely the good work that this sub has always produced can enlighten us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m mobile right now and don&#39;t have the links handy but there are some additional things to think about.</p>

<p>DECEMBER: Japan offers to enrich uranium for Iranian power plants.</p>

<p>JANUARY/FEBRUARY: An Israeli company with no prior experience working with nuclear power plants is given complete access to the Fukushima site to install huge industrial binocular camera systems.  This includes cameras inside the containment buildings.  These cameras maintain a direct Internet link (which is later offered to the Japanese government to take a look early in the disaster) ... a fact notable because there is not supposed to be any connection to outside networks from within the containment building (could be wrong on this point).</p>

<p>MARCH: Earthquake and flood.  Contrary to popular knowledge, at least one generator is not flooded out.  This generator is powerful enough to cool the entire complex.  But the switching gear to connect it to the plant electric grid doesn&#39;t work!  And the backups don&#39;t work, either!  Meltdown!</p>

<p>Punchline: The generator switching gear used the exact same Siemens industrial process controller that was targeted by Stuxnet to kill the Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges.</p>

<p>Means.  Motive.  Opportunity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whilst I totally agree with the statements you&#39;ve put forward, there was still one fail safe that could&#39;ve and should&#39;ve averted the meltdown, the non electric coolant circulation system which is like an old school reservoir tank used to keep the coolant from boiling, ideally keeping it cool for up to 12+ hours of use. The technician staff managing the plant were inadequately trained and where throttling it open and close to do what escapes me at this point, but when the final critical electrical failure hit, the system was stuck in the shut position and they delayed several hours to even check if it was open, upon realising this they rushed to open it again but the coolant temp was still unstable and high causing reservoir cooling the coolant to boil off. This could&#39;ve delayed the meltdown a further estimated 6 to 8 hours as the reservoir boiled out but there was 0 contingency to refill the reservoir and I think last I heard they thought there was a fault in the system and closed it off. That was the final nail I&#39;m the meltdown coffin</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t look at the context of your  comment and answered directly from my inbox, so my answer was not what it should have been.</p>

<p>The cause of the earthquake that caused the tsunami  is questionable.  HAARP was interested in finding  earthquake fault lines in the earth&#39;s crust and was operating above Japan just before the tsunami.</p>

<p>HAARP Detection and Imaging of Underground Structures Using ELF/VLF Radio Waves</p>

<p><a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/systems/haarp.htm">http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/systems/haarp.htm</a></p>

<p>HAARP claims it produces these waves to communicate with submarines.</p>

<p><a href="http://engineering.nyu.edu/news/2015/03/11/reaching-ionosphere-talk-submarines-save-satellites">http://engineering.nyu.edu/news/2015/03/11/reaching-ionosphere-talk-submarines-save-satellites</a></p>

<p>Once found those weak spots could be agitated by using their ability to project ELF signals through the ground,  and concentrating those ELF/ VLF signals in a given area  by using their projected and reflected  VHF wave forms to disturb  faults which would tend to produce earthquakes.</p>

<p>several of these ELF frequencies can be detuned against one another creating novel effects.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.salzburg.gv.at/cherry_schumann_resonances.pdf">http://www.salzburg.gv.at/cherry_schumann_resonances.pdf</a></p>

<p>Here is evidence that HAARP was operating in the vicinity just before the earthquake.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/424033/atmosphere-above-japan-heated-rapidly-before-m9-earthquake/">http://www.technologyreview.com/view/424033/atmosphere-above-japan-heated-rapidly-before-m9-earthquake/</a> </p>

<p>There had been reports of U.S. threats against Japans nuclear facilities in  recent years but those are now hard to find, of course.</p>

<p>There may have been a second occurrence of a HAARP earthquake.</p>

<p><a href="http://wtfrly.com/2014/03/02/earthquake-20-miles-crimea-feeds-rumors-nuclear-blast-haarp/">http://wtfrly.com/2014/03/02/earthquake-20-miles-crimea-feeds-rumors-nuclear-blast-haarp/</a></p>

<p>Reflected VHF frequencies from HAARP  may cause these hole punch clouds.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;site=imghp&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;biw=1067&amp;amp;bih=461&amp;amp;q=hole+punch+cloud&amp;amp;oq=hole+punch+cloud&amp;amp;gs_l=img.3..0l3j0i30l6j0i5i30.2566.7953.0.8242.16.13.0.3.3.0.140.1544.0j13.13.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..0.16.1555.kO4DoCew5IY">https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;site=imghp&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;biw=1067&amp;amp;bih=461&amp;amp;q=hole+punch+cloud&amp;amp;oq=hole+punch+cloud&amp;amp;gs_l=img.3..0l3j0i30l6j0i5i30.2566.7953.0.8242.16.13.0.3.3.0.140.1544.0j13.13.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..0.16.1555.kO4DoCew5IY</a></p>

<p>Although another explanation has been given, it  uses physics that only existed  during  the early years of the development of HAARP so the  credibility  of that explanation is low.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thankfully it&#39;s a slow process.</p>

<p>The amount of radiation poisoning is relative to distance from the source. very near the source, at least at first. it may be almost instant and at a distance of thousands of miles it would progress much more slowly. The radiation from Fukushima is still spewing and it will take a while for it ro fill the entire atmosphere so once again it will be a slow process. Here is what happened to sailors who were some 30 miles from the source for the most part.</p>

<p>Japan updated their building codes following the 1978 Miyagi Earthquake, as well as the 1995 Kobe earthquake. The Tohoku area frequently gets big earthquakes, so people take it seriously, and a lot of municipalities offer free/reduced in cost seismic inspections/upgrades. Additionally, despite it being a stronger earthquake, the peak ground motion was lower than say, the Kobe earthquake, hence the disparity in the damage.</p>

<p>And it did destroy homes and roads. <a href="http://photoarchive.c.yimg.jp/res/emgphoto-0475/000/19475.jpg">Take</a> <a href="http://www.asahi.com/photonews/gallery/jishin/images/jishin1020.jpg">a</a> <a href="http://www.e-nexco.co.jp/pressroom/press_release/kanto/h23/0316f/images/01.jpg">look.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Feel free to link them later, they&#39;ll likely defy basic seismology and  have no supporting evidence.</p>

<p>A long, P.S. edit. - </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny you said  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then you have the burden of proof of explaining how 9.0 didn&#39;t completely destroy homes as it normally would. The real numbers are no more than 6.8. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which I sorta of did, but you say</p>

<blockquote>
<p>9.1 would pretty much flatten everything. Not just destruction like the pictures you link. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>now. Well, first, it was a 9.0, but I guess you can&#39;t decide on the actual magnitude, or comprehend what I was explaining. Just blame HAARP, it&#39;s basically the Jesus of &quot;I have no facts to explain what I&#39;m saying&quot; for &quot;quake and cloud&quot; folk.</p>

<p>Secondly, research the different types of earthquakes. There&#39;s lots of types, and they cause different kinds of shaking. The Kobe quake was right under the city, and had much more intense peak ground motion (Google that term, it&#39;s fun to learn). Did you even know you can have horizontal and vertical shaking? In separate quakes, and sometimes one right after the other? The vertical ones always scare the bejezssus out of me, even if they&#39;re not actually strong, just feels like the house is coming down.</p>

<p>Third, the Kansai area of Japan gets far fewer, and much, much less strong earthquakes, but often gets strong typhoons. People in that area value a strong roof, even if they don&#39;t retrofit their house frame to accommodate it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hanshin_earthquake#Damage">From Wikipedia:
</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of the older traditional houses had heavy tiled roofs which weighed around 2 tons, intended to resist the frequent typhoons that plagued Kobe, but they were only held up by a light wood support frame. When the wood supports gave way, the roof crushed the unreinforced walls and floors in a &quot;pancake&quot; collapse. Newer homes have reinforced walls and lighter roofs to avoid this, but are more susceptible to typhoons. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fourth, Japan is not Haiti, Chile, or another poor-to-semi-poor earthquake prone country. Buildings are built like forts, and don&#39;t come down easy. On top of that, given the modern trend to live with your own family together with ones parents until they pass, and then build a new house on the land they leave you, buildings are relatively frequently reconstructed along modern building codes.</p>

<p>But please, show me the non Jim Stone sources when you&#39;re on a computer.</p>

<p>Again, explain how the whole area around wasnt completely flattened by a 9.0 (9.1 typo error on phone). Explain Magma BSPs involvement, the permanent internet connection inside the reactor that they had during the whole event (something which is simply not allowed)

<p>And finally explain why no one is mentioning stuxnet when its existence was found out during Irans nuclear program.</p>

<p>So, a 4 year old list from Tsukuba University (nice university), which was also badly shaken and suffering from rolling black-outs, with access to unspecified sensors counts as a source? Shiggy Diggy Doo.</p>

<p>Not allowed according to?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explain how reactor 4 was blown sky high despite it being inop</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really wish that Libya hadn&#39;t had their mess shortly after, then there would maybe be English sources that explained (as Japanese ones did) how the ventilation systems were shutoff from the outside to try and prevent leaks, which led to the Reactor buildings being linked, which allowed hydrogen gass to fill Building 4.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And finally explain why no one is mentioning stuxnet when its existence was found out during Irans nuclear program.</p>

<p>Link it to Fukushima and a 9.0 earthquake and massive tsunami that wiped out the emergency generators at the plant, and maybe people will. Hell of a computer virus to do all that.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Just skipped over my recommendation that you look into the different types of plate mechanisms and quakes, huh? Okay, ignore information that disproves you, that&#39;s pretty much the game here, that&#39;s why I never bother to comment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, your downvotes aren&#39;t coming from me. Even if we&#39;re having a severe disagreement, you&#39;re being polite, that&#39;s respectable to me.</p>

<p>Since it seems neither of us is going to prevent evidence compelling enough to sway the other, I&#39;ll say this as my last two points.</p>

<p>1 - Any explosion of sufficient power can make a mushroom cloud, it&#39;s symbolic connection to nuclear explosions isn&#39;t an absolute. Several reactor&#39;s worth of hydrogen air being chained together, exploding in one building could make one.</p>

<p>2 - If Stutnex could make a reactor in Japan explode, why not in Iran and prove they have active reactors? A bit of a better argument than some picture of a cartoon bomb, in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fukushima was entirely preventable. It was an older design. The specific build had received criticism for a long time by nuclear oversight agencies. And because the Japanese government is so dysfunctional nothing was done to fix the issues.</p>

<p>Had the problems discovered for years by nuclear oversight been addressed it wouldn&#39;t have melted down. Had a newer design (difficult because of anti-nuclear groups) been installed it wouldn&#39;t have melted down. Had the government done it&#39;s job it wouldn&#39;t have melted down. Basically all of these are human failures, not technology failures. We already have the technology to run safe nuclear energy. And in fact, including every mishap and disaster, nuclear is still, by far, the safest form of energy known to man.</p>

<p>The biggest problem nuclear energy has, by far, is the anti-nuclear scaremongers who create self fulfilling prophecy. They are the enemies of mankind and bare a large responsibility here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll come at this from another angle - fukushima was manufacturered to make nuclear power look bad.  It&#39;s being blamed for disasters now that are caused by plastic buildup and global warming from burning fossil fuels.  </p>

<p>People act like retards when it comes to radiation.  News to most people is there&#39;s radiation from the sun, your phone, and other sources pumping through you every day.  Low amounts of radiation have no adverse effect on us - our bodies have evolved to protect us from a bit of that shit.  Fukushima was an extremely large disaster, but even that diameter of effect is only 100 miles at most.  It&#39;s not going to cause fish on the west coast of the US to die.  That&#39;s pollution and global warming folks.  There might be some isolated incidents of radioactive death, but the VAST VAST majority of these animal deaths are pollution/heat related, not radiation related.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the guy who writes that blog does take a very pessimistic attitude towards the whole thing.  I mean he does cite documents, so it isn&#39;t like his argument is unfounded, but he seems to be looking at it from an absolute worst case scenario where the damage has already been done, is totally unavoidable, can&#39;t be mitigated, and where the amount of radiation will be so much that humanity as a whole will likely never recover.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of a frightening thought that he could be right.  I&#39;m not sure he is though, at least not totally.  More worrying to me is what would happen in the case of a widespread EMP or global power outage.  There are thousands of other reactors on the planet, thousands of other potential Fukushimas, without power they can&#39;t be kept cool and they all melt down - and then what happens?</p>

<p>Rhetorical question of course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fukushima was not a earthquake.</p>

<p>Fukushima was a Mossad operation.  Japan was stepping out of line.  (I forget the details, but review news about Japan&#39;s banking and government dealings in the months leading up to the event (as they may relate to banking, 9/11 and/or Israel).  It should become clear.)</p>

<p><strong>I believe it may have been a tactical nuke, masked by a HAARP-initiated &quot;earthquake&quot;:</strong></p>

<p>Reactors don&#39;t &quot;explode&quot; -- they simply &quot;meltdown&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude.  Reactors EXPLODE when they melt down.  Go watch a chernobyl documentary.  It&#39;s not as big as a chemical plant explosion, but it&#39;s still explosive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unit 2 at Fukushima melted down without exploding. </p>

<p>It was also responsible for the largest individual release of radioactive gasses. </p>

<p>This is the problem with discussing Fukushima. Very few people who have a good understanding of how the accident progressed, and how it was caused, are willing to discuss conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>So, the majority of discussion on Fukushima is so far from reality that the small discrepancies in the data which could reveal a cover-up or contradict the official account are entirely ignored. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its either Fukushima or the warming that is confusing everything.  I live on the west coast and all of the tide pools in Santa Cruz, bodega bay, fort Bragg are dead.  We found a few with some life but they were in tucked away areas out of the sun.  So I&#39;m not sure if temperature has a lot to do with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go to Chernobyl and see how long you last. This is 100x the size of Chernobyl. It would be a nuclear winter in North America (as the fallout crosses the ocean) and most of that part of Asia. You think of a nuclear winter as an end to everything in a flash, no, it would take time. But eventually, the animals would die, life forms will die, water undrinkable, people would perish. Maybe nuclear winter is the wrong word, but it would be catastrophic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whilst I totally agree with the statements you&#39;ve put forward, there was still one fail safe that could&#39;ve and should&#39;ve averted the meltdown, the non electric coolant circulation system which is like an old school reservoir tank used to keep the coolant from boiling, ideally keeping it cool for up to 12+ hours of use. The technician staff managing the plant were inadequately trained and where throttling it open and close to do what escapes me at this point, but when the final critical electrical failure hit, the system was stuck in the shut position and they delayed several hours to even check if it was open, upon realising this they rushed to open it again but the coolant temp was still unstable and high causing reservoir cooling the coolant to boil off. This could&#39;ve delayed the meltdown a further estimated 6 to 8 hours as the reservoir boiled out but there was 0 contingency to refill the reservoir and I think last I heard they thought there was a fault in the system and closed it off. That was the final nail I&#39;m the meltdown coffin</p>
