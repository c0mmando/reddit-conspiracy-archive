<li>The Principle of Mentalsim </li>
<li>The Principle of Correspondence</li>
<li>The Principe of Vibration </li>
<li>The Principle of Polarity </li>
<li>The Principle of Rhythm</li>
<li>The Principle of Cause and Effect </li>
<li>The Principle of Gender </li>
</ol>

<p>If you can tell, just by reading these words, that there is some truth to them, then you are on the right track in my mind. </p>

<p>These principle ideas make up the ancient wisdom&#39;s understanding of divine, natural law; not muddled by religious perspectives. It simply IS. </p>

<p>Science has tried to keep this information from becoming part of the mainstream scientific paradigm; one where only physical causes and effects are monitored and recorded; taken as the ultimate standard of reality. Our five senses are very limited. The knowledge of the Hermetic Principles and other examples of Natural Law will undoubtedly uplift the individual; something we all know TPTB are trying to avoid. </p>

<p>I want to give a basic synopsis of each principle and finish by including an 8th principle that will sum the rest up</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Everything IS Mind! Your thoughts create your reality. New Age people will try to tell you that this means that just by thinking positively that you can effect change; this is cowardice. EVERYTHING starts and ends within you! You have to put the THOUGHTS into ACTION! It is a process that has been divinely created so that everything is fair; everything is balanced. </p></li>
<li><p>As above so below; you have heard that before, yes? If your into Alchemy you most definitely have. It means that no matter where you go, there will be something; there is a pattern in nature that cannot be ignored. Atoms, planets, stars, organs, batcteria, animals, plants, humans, rocks, forces of nature like gravity, time, fate; all of these things are ALIVE; all of these organisms, if you will, work in tandem. Whats happening within your psyche is a microcosm for what is happening in the ENTIRE UNIVERSE.</p></li>
<li><p>Nothing rests, everything moves. If you were to take a microscope and put it to your hand you could see a whole little world going on; bacteria, cells, etc. Those little tiny particles are moving nonstop; they are not what you would or could refer to as &quot;solid&quot;. The universe in not solid. It is a hologram, in that, &quot;we see what we need to see&quot;. Everything is energy. Energy is never destroyed, it can only go somewhere else.</p></li>
<li><p>Everything is dual; everything has its opposite. Hot and Cold, Light and Dark, Good and Evil;, Pinky and the Brain. Etc. But let me ask you this, does &quot;hot exist? What is &quot;hot&quot;? Is it 2,100 C, or is it 85 F? It is a matter of degree, not of distinction. The point is, you can&#39;t one without the other. We judge how cold it is based on the ammount of heat. &quot;Cold&quot; is simply an absence of heat. Just like the color black could be seen as an absence of color, everthing is on a spectrum.</p></li>
<li><p>The universe flows back and worth like a pendulum; everything in life has its ebbs and flows; times that are easy, times that are hard. It might be boring if there were no challenges, right?The universe always swings back the other way; and the farther our right the pendulum swing the farther left the reverse swing will be.</p></li>
<li><p>Everything in life is either a cause or an effect. We, as humans, live in the world of effects; Earth, the material world, the physical plane of existence. We need to shift our minds more to the world of cause; the supernatural, the thought realm, our subconscious minds etc. What is causing people to behave the way they do? We have to look at the root of a problem before we try to diagnose it. </p></li>
<li><p>Everything has masculine and feminine principles; the sun, moon, planets, and stars reflect our projections of the gender archetypes. We have a real problem with misunderstanding the sacred nature of each principle and allowing them to thrive in both male and female bodies.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, I want to wrap it up with an 8th principle, and that is,</p>

<p>CARE </p>

<p>Because, what YOU care about, is what your gonna change.
If your passionate about art, use it to spread the knowledge and wisdom of our forefathers. If you want to be a businessman; invest in groups that you believe in. Give back. You are those people suffering in Syria in the news. They are suffering right now. We see them, we feel them. You are everyone who ever bled and died on this rock; we are all in this together. No satanic, demonic principalities, nor powerful alien overlords, nor viscous human psychopaths who have rejected nature, will scare us any longer. We have see the light the illuminated ones try to hide from our eyes and we have downloaded that information into our consciousness. There is no stopping the celestial tide of redemption this planet is about to go through. </p>

<p>May you all be free </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think this is applicable on a planet with 7 billion people that&#39;s running out of resources. And only a tiny fraction of the people living can see though the bullshit. Unless there&#39;s some kind of miracle technology being kept under wraps like an ocean deacidifier, or a device that can recycle all waste products into some kind of usable compound, were just going to go through a mass oblivion in the near future.</p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to think that this miserable planet is a sort of &quot;nursery&quot; or a stepping stone for spiritual learning. And when we move on to our next life, we&#39;ll inherently be &quot;better&quot; or more wise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It most certainly is applicable. As to the question of whether or not we will survive the future, it is of little consequence in my mind what happens; because the second part of your statement is very, very true. This world is a prison and it is a school. We are here to learn. It doesn&#39;t matter if everyone gets there now, they&#39;ll get there &quot;then&quot;, whenever &quot;they&quot; are ready. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good and evil?
Lazy from the motivated?
Why would a god create our existence if already perfected?
Maybe to expand gods own consciousness, maybe to learn, or to filter imperfections? In the end the good ascends to the heavens and the evil burns on this rock when the sun supernovas?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the picture you just painted is very much possible; though it may lack the joy of knowing of such amazing occurrences. As to the question of &quot;God&quot;, I know not the nature of such. &quot;God&quot; transcends our understanding of nature. A certain level of trust, and a certain level of discernment must be applied when dealing with &quot;God&quot;. I feel like I should say this in reference to you comments about evil; everything is one. Everything will begin anew. Life ill always win. Nature abhors a vacuum.  </p>
