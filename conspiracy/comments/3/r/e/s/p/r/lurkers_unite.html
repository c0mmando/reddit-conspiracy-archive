       Longtime lurker, first time poster. I've seen other posts like this, so what I'm saying is nothing new. And yet...and yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is happening? In the last few months, this sub has seen a surge in antisemitic content, harebrained conclusions, YouTube videos full of biblical conjecture, and
       <em>
        screams internally
       </em>
       Flat Earth bullshit. At its best (to me), this sub is a place to excavate beneath MSM headlines, to reveal abuses of power, to uncover what is hidden, and to question the fundamental narratives sold to an unsuspecting populace. Don't get me wrong; there's still of lot of that good stuff happening. But the other stuff? The your-favorite-pop-star-is-a-satanic-reptile stuff? All that does is delegitimize the more thoughtful posts here.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what's behind this trend? Is it shilling? Deliberate attempts to discredit this sub? I don't know. All I can offer is this: as a lurker - and I'm sure there are plenty more here - I will commit to upvoting the kind of thoughtful content this sub needs and downvoting the inane, the cheap, the ridiculous. Fellow lurkers, won't you join me?

       There was a post not too long ago on this sub detailing how some mods from other subs were actively trolling here with anti-Semite material just to see if it picked up traction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sub is also becoming toxic with downvotes too. It's definitely being attacked, which is seriously just a waste of the attackers time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either they're just getting off or want to have this place die so they can start their own sub and moderate it themselves. Either way they need to go out for a walk and stop being assholes.

       Like the old saying goes...one mans trash is another mans treasure. Conspiracy that you may think is batshit, could very well be an actual reality. While your daily MSM narrative, your reality, could be as false as Pamela Anderson's tits.
      </p>
      <p>
       People often label us as crazy because one, they're trained to believe we're crazy and two...the Truth IS crazy. It's quite liberating to shed the "No Questions" shame that 90% of the American population seems to be suffering from.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an advantage to be able to look at the world events, countries and governments, including our own, from an objective perspective without being immersed in false patriotic nationalism. Without being forced fed the MSM narrative and then scoff at anyone who thinks for themselves. I say this to all new comers...Anywhere you go, including r/conspiracy, all is not to be believed. But when you come here, have an open mind and remember the choice is yours on which conspiracy subject to get involved in. If you don't agree don't get involved. Please, do be a part of the conversation if the subject interests you.

       my favorite has been the huge influx of posts that make a bold statement in the title, offer no links or commentary of any kind, and when you comment that you would like to see an example because it makes no sense they tell you "I'm not going to do your research for you"......ok, so why did you post it then if you won't even provide enough information for anybody to have a discussion about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I REALLY don't get those posts because they don't even really make this sub look bad because ALL the comments other than OP are people pointing out what bullshit and nonsense it is.  OP will go out of his/her way to get confrontational with every single commenter as well as actively refuse to supply ANY content or reference regarding what they are talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I lurked in this sub for a long time before even commenting on things.  You are absolutely right that in the past year there has been a huge influx in nonsense/bullshit/trolls/lunatics here.  it is a shame.  I used to love this sub, now I have to dig around for ages to find almost anything worth reading.  The only thing that keeps me coming back is knowing that there ARE some good people here that will call out blatant bullshit for what it is.

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Depending on what you're referring to, I may be accused of this.
So a rundown, for those who are unaware (if not you OP, then others).
      </p>
      <p>
       Semite =/= Jew =/= Hebrew =/= Zionist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Semites are practically anyone of North African/Middle Eastern descent. My current romantic interest who is from Sudan is technically a Semite. I have no beef with her genetic makeup, although her liberal Islamism may prove incompatible with my fundamental anti-theism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews are followers of the Torah. They are a religious group who subscribe to such doctrine as the law of Moses, the belief in father Abraham as a prophet of the God Yahweh, etc. i suppose I could be considered anti-Jewish insomuch as I am anti-religious and have many charges to level against the Jews, starting with the intrinsic racism of their lovely little cult.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hebrews are genealogical descendants of Abraham. This is the race referred to  when people erroneously refer to the "Jewish race." Pre-modern Israel, Jewish leaders considered the idea of a Jewish race to be blasphemy, as this would mean that a religious heretic of Hebrew blood would claim the title of "Jew," however they considered Jews to only be those who were descendants of Abraham who were also active practitioners of Judaism. They were very opposed to the modern idea of Jews as a racial group, an idea propagated by the Zionists. Hebrews are a subcategory of Semites.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to regularly bang a Hebrew girl and we still love each other. Her genetic makeup also never entered the equation other than in jokes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zionists are a radical offshoot of Judaism who are by definition, NOT Jews. They are not Jews because they believe in the restoration of Greater Israel through political/military means whereas the actual Jewish doctrine forbids this. Core Jewishs teachings are that the Jewish people are in exile for their sins and are to remain a homeless/nomadic people until the arrival of their messiah. This contradicts the Zionist message of the Jewish people "deserving" a state, and Israel being their divine birthright. Zionism also functions as a cabal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most accurate analogy I can think of would perhaps be Zionism:Judaism as Gnosticism:Christianity. A less precise but also less esoteric comparison would be Zionism:Judaism as Westminster Baptist:Christianity as ISIS:Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have read many people criticizing Zionism, probably slightly more criticizing Jews (often actually referring to Zionists) and possibly nobody criticizing Hebrews or Semites, more broadly speaking.

       This should actually be encouraged, not shamed. Freethinking and brainstorming pretty much guarantees you'll get a lot of shit to sort through. Just be careful not to throw out the baby...

       They're not reptiles, but they
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       Satanic. By using the symbolism of Satanism, they are
       <em>
        being
       </em>
       Satanic, even if they are not themselves Satanists (many of them are though). It would be like... if I started hanging Christmas ornaments everywhere, you could call me Christmassy or something... They hang Satanic/Masonic/Druidic ornaments all over the place. Thus invoking those adjectives.

       As Reddit grows in popularity, subs like this get more exposure and thus more flak.
      </p>
      <p>
       More people are "waking up" and looking for sources to continue their self-driven re-education. The more garbage on here, the less seriously it will be taken.

       r/conspiracy has enormous potential to help continue investigative inquiry, spread useful information, and bring darkness to light. We need to upvote AND create to help drown out all the noise

       I don't mind flat earthers, UFO reptilian believers etc etc as long as they back their claims with proof, facts or credible observations. However it's not often the case and most threads on these topics make the sub look bad. Just yesterday we were nuked on
       <a href="/r/TIL">

       and they recycle the same negative stereotypes and bias on the sub.

       Yes definitely. I'm not sure exactly what is behind the trend you are pointing out, it may be a deliberate attempt to sink this sub because you know, anything conspiracy can't be taken seriously or appear reasonable in any way. Or, it could just be that reddit has become much more popular and now come the people who genuinely believe that these topics ARE conspiracy. Either way, it's pretty disturbing.

       I don't know that it's deliberate, but I get the impression a lot of the ridiculous stuff is posted knowing it's ridiculous, because, as has been mentioned before, the very word "conspiracy" has become linked in society and the media with Ancient Aliens-style insanity. If somebody wants to discuss something that they know any half-brained person will immediately dismiss as total nonsense, they think "I'll ask those crazy conspiracy theorists, they'll be open to this stuff, right?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there a separate sub for those kinds of "theories"? Then we could quickly redirect people with questions about fictional universes created by autistic schizophrenics.

       Yep, it's something you need to watch out for, where
       <em>
        people
       </em>
       try to promote an incorrect notion and arbitrarily label someone in regards to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Labels to watch out for: feminist, liberal, dindu, racist, anti-trade, anti-government, anti-semite.  As soon as I see these terms being used nearly always they are being used arbitrarily and without being fully explained in the reasoning of their use.. it's like they expect people to agree with them out of hand, or they are just making obvious sarcastic remarks and not taking the subject matter seriously.

       I keep hearing more and more suggestions to support segregating topics. "We can have a section for flat earth, we can have another for Zionism, and another for Monsanto..." The problem is that you have to know what to look for to find those subjects if they are segregated. A new person can come here right now and get a mix bag of all sorts of material without much effort, which further increases any possible curiosity about more than just one subject that they may not of heard of before. Plus, sectioning out topics also makes it easier to target specific threads for derailment and mod takeover. Right now shit posts are flying to (IMO) push for this sectioning of topics. "This way we can put shitty unworthy posts in the junk folder" - so to speak. The same tactic could be said about how our nation and states are being run, when people ask for smaller government. What they are really doing is asking for more controlled subsections that are easier to buy off and sanction under the guise of threat of single world order. Which we all know happens anyway. Its just that states are easier to take over one at a time instead of a whole country at once.

       The sun stays in place when you follow it on the surface of the Earth moving with it. This theory precipitates that day night would be the same for the whole planet, there would be no time zones. Just these 2 things alone are wholly explained by a global earth as opposed to a flat disk which essentially precipitates that the laws of physics are mere suggestions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Welp, so much for flat earth theory. The problem we in this sub have with flat earth theory is that sincerely, it's extremely easy to debunk using even the most basic of reasoning. There's a meta conspiracy theory  that the concept is pushed to get illogical people to attach to bunk theories as misdirection, and frankly
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       has more evidence than flat earth.

       here are 200 proofs for flat earth theory:

       hope so thanks.

       also - if you really believe that flat earth theory is a fly trap for the psychologically undesireable why don't you encourage the theory to let its freak flag fly? wouldn't you rather it trapped and misdirected everybody who doesn't think how you want them to? Just exactly where do your priorities lie.

       I'm not opposed to the idea that the Earth could be flat, just that I've seen more pointing to it being a globe.

       Hey now, I understand how money itself is evil, lending itself to international satanic mass brainwashing ponzi schemes, most of human consciousness is now a controlled matrix, despite the absolute indoctrination from other people claiming otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me ask you this though, really, why is only the Earth flat? Why not are all planets flat disks instead globes? I'm not being facetious I'm really asking why phsyics work differently on this planet, maybe you believe the sky is a fake projection? I've thought about that. I'm interested in your take and what you have to say.

       Who fucking knows if its flat.  That wasn't the point.  Replicating certain everyday behavior to see if it matches your observations.  On a ball, whipping around at 66k MPH?  No centripetal force whatsoever?  A flat horizon everywhere you go?  Thanks to Pythagoras, 8" falloff per mile squared - 8” - 32” - 72” - 128” - 200” - 228”?  Good stuff.

       I think there's some retardation mixed with "shilling", or people trying to poison the sub. They're probably not even paid, just people who don't care trolling.

       Also, not all "anti-semetic" stuff is comparable to flat earthing, but I see your point.

       Totally agree, I can't tell what's going on with this subreddit, I couldn't positively make a claim that it's infiltrated because, to be honest, it makes sense that this specific sub attracts a lot of outliers -- but it's omnipresent, the flat earth shit, the nutty theories, and racist shit. And yeah, I get it, the jews, I agree, but repeating it over and over and over is just rehashing what is already known. I thought this wasn't supposed to be an echo chamber?
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I do get a lot of great content from here as well, and I'm thankful for that. This community showed me stormclouds gathering, luke rudkowski, and many other content creators that I really enjoy. So I am grateful it's out there, it's just tough to find amidst a sea of horseshit.

       sure, but what gain is it from exploring ancient theories that are quite impossible to prove for a fact? You much rather expose the crimes that are going on today. But whatever, I like to day dream too.

       That's what happens when you get too many conspiracy theorists in one room. There's not enough sane people to put the breaks on when it goes off the rails. Conspiracy itself is a very broad category. Evil Jewish cabals hell bent on crushing the goyim is a conspiracy, so are the NSA abuses. So of course we are going to get the crazies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd worry less about shilling. It happens, that's a given. But people have such a high opinion of themselves that they think they are in verbal battles with reptilian NWO agents everyday who have nothing better to do than discredit their hoaky government satanic cult chemtrail conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the thing, chemtrails are an interesting topic already, but if no one puts on the breaks on it, we go down some ridiculous roads with it. Don't agree that Obama was personally involved in the chemtrail conspiracy in order to cause more mass shootings to pass gun legislation? You fucking shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust me. Half you assholes don't need anyone to discredit you. Youve already done that.

       Great us vs. them while looking mighty sure of yourself.  We've witnessed the shill presence increase substantially.  Little is being done to correct the unnecessary aggression and attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       You remember all those years back when the "densest Reddit population" tuned out to be an Air Force base?  The whole discounting the heavy shill presence isnt going to work out too well for you.
