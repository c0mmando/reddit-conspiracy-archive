<p>&quot;All of our best sources are independently saying that Disclosure is actually going to occur. The Alliance groups have reached a consensus. The question now is how much they will tell us. The Pentagon faction is pushing for full disclosure, China for a more limited release.</p>

<p>There is much more to be said. The battle is vigorous and the shoot-down of the Russian airliner is definitely related. I am working on a new article about all of this right now. I have only had a little over two weeks off since a very intense work period, between the book work in Canada and 28 new episodes in two weeks for Gaiam. Needed to relax.</p>

<p>I will probably hold off on finishing this piece until I hear something from Corey that is more specific. He is one of the sources whose intel is lining up to say the same thing. He is going through hell right now and hopefully it will clear up fairly soon.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What would you guys rather see, Full Disclosure or some half-baked soft disclosure?</p>

<p>Full Disclosure is the only way we will see justice and peace achieved. We have the technology to feed, clothe, shelter, and have access to clean water for every single individual on planet Earth. We all deserve to know the truth and have equal access to the amazing technologies that exist.</p>

<p>If anything but Full Disclosure happens, then we will continue to be slaves. The Pentagon and anyone else pushing for Full Disclosure, how about you start fucking dumping files, and I don&#39;t mean files that you are listening to us, how about some empirical in your damn face proof of extraterrestrials, teleportation tech, anti-gravitics, etc... Stop pandering to political squabbles of how much or little, JUST DISCLOSE, right now, not tomorrow, not next week. NOW!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem that David Wilcock and others claim is that we have a cabal of people connected to an advanced group of extraterrestrial/extradimensional beings that want to enslave us using the patterns of fear. This earth based group is utterly terrified of a disclosure scenario. The people will screech like nails on the chalkboard for justice when they find out that the dark occult bullshit they repeatedly heard about was actually real. This group is still powerful, it is the secret government of the west according to David Wilcock, COBRA, and others putting out such similar narratives.</p>

<p>The key thing is to remember that this goes on because of control by fear. There are a lot of nested lies, secrets, secret groups, false flags, and other deceptions to shape our behavior to not overcome this planetary infestation. Let&#39;s be honest. If this planetary infestation is real as is said by many, it IS the fallen angels/demons/devil/trickster group spoke of in religion. Our fear of looking stupid keeps us from acknowledging that we actually do see clues and patterns here. I could almost write a book about what I have learned about it only through introspection aligning with observation. </p>

<p>It goes very deep spiritually too. Their game is to have us give up our free will willingly through fear and deception, because we have some intrinsic esoteric value we do not understand yet. The extremes are quite extreme. We can walk toward unity in harmony like Jesus taught or sleep walk into unity through harming each other due to fear. It is serious and due to our technological advancement we are running out of time. The choice is basically, do you want to carry your weight and help others or do you want to shovel your burdens on them and exploit them for pleasure? The dark force gains control as we agree with their life philosophy, because running our lives based on our fears make us predictable like machines and these beings are many millions of years older than us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re in partial disclosure and we have been forever. Partial disclosure is basically a slap in the face and I know David hates it, well maybe instead of hating it he sends it love and just does whatever he can. There are always limitations set on people who get too close to the truth. Every moment of our lives is shaped to such a high degree. And it&#39;s worse than we thought. We are actually having difficulty keeping up with the bots. It&#39;s like a wake up call almost. We have to realize and remember that we were denied the current iPhone technology and laptop technology for decades. We were given an extremely slow technological evolution from the 1950&#39;s through today. An artificial limitation set on the improvement rate of technology. Just think about that for a moment. It&#39;s both impressive and unbelievable, but that&#39;s what I believe now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m not trying to troll, but how could the thousands of people who work on developing technology all keep it a secret? Having the knowledge and technology to make an iphone doesn&#39;t mean it gets made, it has to become cheap enough to build and for people to be able to afford it before it gets released as a product. They could probably build an iphone as powerful as a top end gaming computer if they really had to, but it would cost far too much for anyone to consider buying it at this time.</p>

The Manhattan project was a project which involved 100,000 people for several years and not one person &quot;blew the whistle&quot;.

<p>Full Disclosure is the only way we will see justice and peace achieved.</p>

<p>No it&#39;s not.  Not in the least.  The 99% coming together and MAKING justice and peace be achieved is the only way.  Full disclosure in and of itself won&#39;t do it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We all deserve to know the truth and have equal access to the amazing technologies that exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not according to the factions that we&#39;ve allowed to remain in control of this civilization for a long time now.  According to them? fuck you and fuck me and fuck all of us but <em>them</em> is what they think.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Fuck you and what you think you are deserve or are entitled to, you stupid, useless, mouth breathing piece of shit.  You&#39;re not even beneath what my shoes step on.&quot;</em></p>

<p>THAT is how they feel, and that is what we&#39;re dealing with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If anything but Full Disclosure happens, then we will continue to be slaves. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  If anything but US COMING TOGETHER AS ONE happens, then we will continue to be slaves.  Again, disclosure in and of itself won&#39;t change things.  WE will.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They&#39;re not going to do that because there&#39;s a small but powerful faction that doesn&#39;t give a fuck about us and it is <em>they</em> that are controlling the government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is where Snowden plays into it all. Corey Goode has claimed Snowden is part of the Alliance. If he is, then the slow but steadily released information may have helped a few more people become aware of the shadiness of government.

I&#39;m totally on Corey and David&#39;s side. And Snowden is one of the good guys. We have to contact Snowden. John Oliver did an interview with him and it was good but now he should do a follow up interview and raise the bar and push as hard as we can to open the door. Also I just read the rule 6.

<p>I pretty certain that another attempt is going to be started now. The question is whether it will succeed. I believe the chances are better than ever before since the powers holding Disclosure back are weaker now and humanity is more prepared for it, too.</p>

The Alliance has information that they could release at any time to disclose the true state of affairs and if a Bluebeam false-flag event happens, there will be sufficient evidence to show the bullshit the Cabal is spewing and that the reality of the matter is, there are benevolent, malevolent and neutral extraterrestrials. Depending on your perspective of course.</p>

<p>Was it hit by some advanced tech that humans have developed that was provided by aliens?</p>

<p>Was it attacked by an alien craft?</p>

<p>Was someone on that plane with deep knowledge who was about to &quot;spill the beans&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Latest post: &quot;The Paris attacks have obviously delayed our next article, since this is all part of the final battle before Disclosure takes place. It is important to get all the details laid out properly and I haven&#39;t had any extra time since I am here in Boulder taping Wisdom Teachings episodes. Hopefully we can get something out in the next day or two!&quot;</p>
