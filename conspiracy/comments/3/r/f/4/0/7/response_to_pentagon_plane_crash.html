       Someone on Facebook is arguing with me about this. Here is his response to my comment that the pentagon was rigged with bombs and there was no crash.
"Because the plane vaporized...? Do you understand how fast a plane is going and the energy released as it smashes into concrete reinforced with steel? Conspiracy theories are for people who are ignorant and don't know enough about a subject matter to have the ethos to comment yet do anyways."

       The plane was a Boeing 757-200. It is big, over half a football field long, about 125' wingtip to wingtip, and the tail is 44' tall. It has over 200 passenger seats, two titanium engines, a massive landing gear, and literally miles of wiring.  Here are the specs.

       Take a look at the Pentagon.  Zoom in.

      </p>
      <p>
       Look carefully. There are no wings, no engines, no landing gear, no tail, no seats, no wiring, no luggage, no bodies. There is no plane there.
      </p>
      <p>
       This reporter said after his close-up inspection, he saw no evidence of a plane crashing anywhere near the Pentagon.

       Go to google images and look for yourself. If you search long enough, you will find a couple of scraps of aluminum. You may also find a few other pics of plane parts that were purportedly found at the Pentagon...but the Pentagon is absent from those pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, there should be thousands of pictures and videos showing the plane. There are none.

       "Vaporize."  In the real world---the world we live in---massive planes don't turn into a vapor.  Of course, we have free will, and that shithead on facebook is welcome to believe whatever stupid bee ess he wants to believe in order to hang on to the lie.  But it's still a lie.

       The pentagon isn't as tough as the bunker wall in my vid. Therefore, we might expect some remnants of the plane to be found, which they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I mainly posted the vid in regards to the whole "Real planes can't vaporise" part.

       You have difficulty paying attention it seems.

      <p>
       The title of the video is
       <em>
        "F4 Phantom Jet Hits Concrete Wall at 500 MPH"
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       NOT, F4 Jet hits wall at max speed of 1470mph.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       But that's not the point. The point being that it is possible to vaporize something given sufficient forces at play.

       This was made after 9/11 it was probably done to make the very point you are making with it.

      <p>
       Ask yourself if they are above making a 'special' plane out of weakened materials to make a point / cover their ass?
      </p>
      <p>
       When planes hit very solid, reinforced mountains there is always lots of debris including large pieces of fuselage, wings and tail pieces.

       An official (government employed?) photographer was somehow standing in the no man's land between the Pentagon building and the expressway and was ready to take this photo so soon that the flames hadn't even had time to become flame shaped. He apparently already had a tripod set up and was ready to get a professional photo of the event, which just happened to be  best viewed from exactly where he happened to be waiting, unmolested by security.

       Regardless of the quickness with which that photo was taken, in it there is already, absolutely no indication that there was a plane crash
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way that's this plane,  which has 9ft. tall engines under it's wings and they apparently were made of Nerf material because they didn't make any mark anywhere when they hit.

       What about the photo tells you it was taken with a tripod, let alone by a professional photographer?

       Not taking a side on this, but I wanted to add some input as a photographer. I did some freelance photography back in the day and would sell my photos and publication rights to groups like that. They would take my work and slap a watermark on it to use in publication. The person that took the photo was probably paid a good chunk of money by Sipa so they would have the distribution rights. It doesn't mean that one of their photographers took the pic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's not hard to take a perfectly level photo, just use the grid lines in the viewfinder and align them with the ground.

       TIL no media agency in the history of mankind has ever used amateur footage of photos in their news stories. Never ever evah4eva.

      <p>
       A photo being clear doesn't = Tripod or pro. You've never used a camera?
      </p>
      <p>
       The photo also isn't level. But you don't need to use a tripod to make a photo level. You just need to.. You know... use your eyes through the viewfinder and look at things to line up with?
