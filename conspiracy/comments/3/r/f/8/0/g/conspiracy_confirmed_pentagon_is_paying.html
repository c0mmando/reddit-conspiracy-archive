    <div class="md"><p>I wish people who wanted to join the US military would talk to vets about joining. Not currently enlisted, high ranking members, or recruiters, but real men and women who severed at the bottom of the totem pole. I feel that after a serious talk with them, most (sane) people would change their minds about joining. The military sucks dick, the money is alright if you don&#39;t blow through it, and the benefits are decent if you make through your enlistment. That being said, doing everything the &quot;man&quot; tells you to do, including what you eat, where you go, where you live, what you do, and who you talk to is not worth it. You lose all freedoms the moment you sign. I only joined because I had hit rock bottom and literally exhausted all my options. I didn&#39;t want to take a loan out and create a debt I would never recover from either. Hell I wasn&#39;t even sure I was gonna finish my enlistment. All I knew is I had nothing going for me, I still had a clean record (luckily), and suicide was my only other choice. I ended up making it through my enlistment and conquored everything thrown at me, and I&#39;m happy to say I came out 100000x a better person. However it cost me my sanity for it. Mentality I&#39;m wiser, everything else though hasn&#39;t changed. </p>

<p>TL;DR - Unless you&#39;re out of options and is ready to end your own life and can manage to postpone it for a few years, I don&#39;t suggest joining.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That said, I highly recommend this novel: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Billy-Lynns-Long-Halftime-Walk/dp/B007Z969H2"><em>Billy Lynn&#39;s Long Halftime Walk</em></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Billy Lynn is part of a unit called the Bravo Squad, fighting in Iraq. After a brief but intense fight anointed as &quot;the Battle of Al-Ansakar Canal&quot;, Lynn and seven other surviving members return to the U.S. hailed as war heroes. They are sent on a &quot;Victory Tour&quot; by the government to invoke spirit and support for the war. As part of this Victory Tour, Bravo Squad come as guests of the Dallas Cowboys for their Thanksgiving game, and are to make an appearance during the halftime show with <em>Destiny&#39;s Child</em>. However, it is later on revealed that following the Victory Tour, the government has not relieved the men of their duty for their achievements and they are to return to Iraq. Lynn begins to express disenchantment with the treatment of supposed war heroes from American citizens who have seen nothing of war. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>p.s. A movie based on the novel is now in post-production. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  On a recent roadtrip through the western US, I thought it was puzzling how every single county line we came across had a welcome sign that said &quot;We Honor Our Vets&quot; or something like that.  Do any counties have a motto that says &quot;We Really Wish We Hadn&#39;t Gone to Iraq&quot;?</p>

<p>Had a delightful time still and the US is a wonderful country to visit.  Thanks for the cheap gin and gas.  Even with our horrible exchange it was still cheaper for us Canucks to travel there.</p>
