    <div class="md"><p>Went thru this stage back in 2009, I skipped a ski season here in Colorado due to sadness over our state of society. Worst choice ever!!! Keep your head up, smile and find beauty in nature and the world. Meet new people and make friends, eat, cook, exercise, and play. Life is too short to let them win, keep living. If it all goes sputh, atleast you enjoyed yourself and while you are enjoying yourself if you decide to share that info you know people will recieve it better by aeeing you happy and not concerned. We need to be active, spread the word. People will only listen to happy and strong people, weak and powerless people seem like fear is te only point. Have NO FEAR. Fuck the Fascists. Point and Laugh :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you!! I tend to stay positive, especially in front of people. But the state of the world fucks me up man. Anytime I read a news piece - I have to read into it and between the lines. I feel like I don&#39;t know the truth about anything. </p>

<p>I appreciate the positivity and will definitely point and laugh. Gotta perfect my educating the masses without being a condescending asshole! :) </p>

<p>Btw I just got back from Denver. You got an AWESOME state there. I had a really great week. Those mountains really change your life. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Call me a hippy. But I&#39;m of the understanding that humans are entering into a new understanding or phase of consciousness. All of the evil in the world is being directed at stifling the progress of this collective consciousness but trust me tptb are in survival mode and they know it and their loudness of late is very telling. Watch magical Egypt it&#39;s an 8 hour series on this new concept of consciousness. It really helped me find a sense of understanding and peace from within and is an overwhelmingly positive source of information for anyone feeling disenfranchised . </p>

Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jobs too</strong></p>

<p><strong>Number nine shoulda been number one to me

    <div class="md"><p>I stay positive. For one reason, I know I&#39;m on the right side of issues. I do get amazed at how resistant the general public is to the truth on various sensitive issues where the propaganda conditioning has been the heaviest. I can put the truth on a silver platter and slide it under their noses, but I can&#39;t make them look at it, or think about it, let alone understand it and accept it. </p>

<p>And the issues I press are not in question. Take man-made global warning. There is enough proof out there that it is nothing but a huge scam and a lie that no intelligent individual should be accepting it. Yet we have a large portion of the population who still buy into this farce. Nothing that is said to them makes any impression. That can be depressing at times -- the hidebound, willful ignorance of people.</p>

<p>How do you guys stay positive?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Generally speaking, I don&#39;t need to stay positive.  Life on this planet may very well <em>be</em> fucked, but we are much more than our physical bodies.  When you have at least some understanding that we are more (much more) than these limited physical vehicles we inhabit for a temporary period of time, then you realize life on this planet is only a passing phase.  Granted it&#39;s a passing phase that we may have to keep coming back to again and again, but the ultimate point is that the only thing that will be &quot;fucked&quot; is this body...and this body is only a thin outer garment worn by our true selves for a short period of time.</p>

<p>Yeah.  It really helps a lot.  It doesn’t necessarily <em>take away</em> the suffering…but it at least lets you know that this isn’t it/all there is.</p>

<p>Could not have said it better, sir.  Exactly this.  Easy to <em>say</em> “it’s all illusion”.  It’s a bit more difficult when you have a bullet in your gut or are bleeding from a knife attack or catch a spouse in the act of cheating or have a gun pointed at you by a mugger, etc, etc, etc…</p>

<p>Very well then.  Apologies for assuming incorrectly.  I guess too much time on reddit has conditioned me a bit to assume that people are simply being snarky when they make comments similar to yours.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>And I do, so perhaps I&#39;ll check it out.</p>

<p>Thanks for responding and letting me know you <em>weren&#39;t</em> being marginalizing.  Do you have a link to said documentary, by the way?</p>

<p>EDIT:  Found it.  :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to get really upset the more I learned about all the craziness going on. It definitely still bothers me sometimes, especially when I know how much we are led to believe that we can make huge differences. But I realize now, that I am a single small and insignificant cog in the machine. The odds of me being a part of anything greater than what I do everyday, given my level of activity and my ability to be ignored and/or forgotten my whole life helps with more rational thoughts. You just can&#39;t let yourself get overburdened. Watch some cat videos, read a entertaining book, occupy your mind with other things at least a portion of the day. Don&#39;t forget the things you learn about, just don&#39;t dwell on them or live your life in fear. Remember there are others that share at least a portion of your beliefs, and keep learning!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you mean. I still struggle with this as well. I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that the best thing to do is live your life as best you can. The truth to all of these conspiracies is that we, the people, have the power, and the powers that be do everything they can to keep us from realizing that. Everything you see exposed on here has one central purpose, to control our thoughts and feelings. The moment we all realize that we can change the world by coming together, is the same moment all of this nonsense will end. I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that the best way to create that change is to first create it within yourself. You don&#39;t have to convince others, or sway them to your side. All you have to do is find the joy and peace within your own life, and as soon as you do, others will see that in you, and will beg to know your secret. If we all raise ourselves up, let go of petty things, and live lives full of joy, then the world will change, and no one will be able to stop it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let all of it go.</p>

<p>I still struggle with the process of conceptualizing, internalizing, and compartmentalizing the scope of ruin that has been rendered over the short course of my life.</p>

<p>Letting it exist beyond me has helped though.</p>

<p>As tough as it is to trust, there is no good or bad. We can&#39;t be fucked if somehow missed out on another path. We just &quot;are&quot; at this point in our life as a species. We could have made anything in this world; we&#39;ve always had everything we&#39;ve needed to survive happily. Somewhere along the way, we decided to get really violent and some animal&#39;s plan (that was more than likely reactionary) snowballed into the world we see today.</p>

<p>If you accept that we didn&#39;t choose this life any more than we chose the Moon things get a little easier.</p>

<p>Did human nature play a part in guiding our trajectory toward the  terrifying world we live in today? I <em>highly</em> doubt it played a part initially. Does human nature maintain the suffering we see? Absolutely.</p>

<p>So let it go. Be mindful of your own nature and cherish the agency you have over it. If you have to use good and bad to conceptualize things, think of it like others have mentioned; making the conscious choice to seek happiness in the face of unrelenting chaos gives you strength over the forces of evil in this world. As long as you&#39;re unhappy you&#39;ll chase whatever it is you think will change that and thus end up assisting in the destruction.</p>

<p>Be careful though as even by fighting against one enemy, you risk helping another. The vast majority of &quot;issues&quot; you&#39;ve encountered which lead to feelings of hopelessness exist to keep your mind panicked and distracted. Some are directly manufactured (9/11 obviously), others are passive (currency manipulation); all of them have the same ultimate value.</p>

<p>This is getting preachy so I&#39;ll cool it but I do wanna make it clear that you&#39;re not alone in your fatigue. The weight of knowledge can be crushing. You&#39;re doing well by communicating it though. I think that as topics relating to the general meltdown of the planet become more common place and steady (if you can believe that can happen at this point) we&#39;ll begin to see more and more people like you coming forward about their fatigue and hopelessness.</p>

<p>I just hope that by then we&#39;ll have more concrete ways to help them.</p>

<p>I felt that way for a while, especially when I learned that all my High School &quot;friends&quot; were calling me crazy behind my back because of my seeking the truth. 
What I did for myself is I have left the US with my family and am forging a new life. Where I am is probably equally fucked due to Hijrah but I am hopeful that I at least have more time. Living day to day, studying things I want to study, and painting. I still do my truth searching but it takes up less of my life. Find a way to spend some of your conspiracy time to have fun or better yourself. When there&#39;s nothing you can do, just do you.
You are not alone.

<p>I think your life philosophic framework need an upgrade.</p>

<p>Like u/luckinator said, take joy in knowing the right, do what you can/want with your life and accept the fact it will end sooner or later. Whether that is because we all get fucked or any other possible reason ( many.. ) if you told the truth to yourself and accepted it you can move to more positive thoughts. I think you did tell yourself the truth, but still need to swallow that very dark thing. It&#39;s still in front of you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone has a little bit of heaven inside of them, find it. The rest of the world is gone to shit and they would much rather poke fun at you for trying to help them. I think this is how it was always meant to be. Doesnt mean you should not do your bit, just that you shouldn&#39;t get hung up over it. We are all part of a bigger picture we don&#39;t get yet. My opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are not alone, these posts pop up all the time. I made a post like this a couple years ago and it changed my outlook on the way it all works.</p>

<p>The two game changing links for me were:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/hidden_hand_081018">http://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/hidden_hand_081018</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.lawofone.info">www.lawofone.info</a></p>

<p>I ordered the Law of One series in print to read and I am still devouring related material. I will be studying this area until I die.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not afraid anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zero idea what you&#39;re talking about.  Sounds like an attempt at marginalization, however - which is what many tend to reflexively resort to when confronted with information they&#39;ve been taught to turn away from.</p>
