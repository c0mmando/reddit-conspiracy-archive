I saw the blueprint that has been built by a crowd of volunteers who transcribed over 30 hours of blueprint teachings. The technology is called Magrav and it is based on plasma energy which is a field created by gravitational and magnetical forces working together in a spiral. Needless to say the whole thing has me baffled, a little hopeful and also skeptical as hell. Anyways, I started to build a unit, winding coils as the teaching instructed, but then the official buleprint was released and it conflicted with the teachings. Some die hard Keshe folks on the blueprint collaboration are screaming rothschild intervntion... What do you think!? here&#39;s the link to the volunteer blueprint collaboration page. See the page with Magrav Problems as you scroll to the blueprint! docs.google.com/document/d/14DKW15x9Osgeb_BvASXJgeThqQxnCGfnKOQMmDyHxs8/preview</p>

<p>One can be yours for the price of 800 euro! </p>

<p>Free energy is HERE! In a prohibitively expensive generator. Yeah I know the blueprints are free and the materials are dirty cheap but not everyone is skilled at building things, or following blueprints which call for &quot;prayer.&quot; I mean, just take the cost of the materials and the time for a knowledgeable person to build one. That ain&#39;t no 800 euro. He should sell it for $50. I&#39;d buy one then. So would thousands more people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This, used to be a &quot;LAW&quot; of physics too: <strong>The Ptolemaic system is a geocentric cosmology; that is, it starts by assuming that the Earth is stationary and at the centre of the universe.</strong></p>

<p>Not saying it&#39;s not a scam(how could one know for sure, for sure until it&#39;s built?), I totally acknowledge that anything can be false, but the Magrav is ALLEGEDLY a new field of science. Plasma = Active non material force fields (magnetic &amp; gravitational) that the solid (matter state we see, touch and experience through our 5 physical senses) universe emerges out of and is everywhere throughout the universe. A physical things materializes out of the plasma when the fields are arranged in a certain way. Every physical object is materialized from the plasma. The plasma is the “ghost” of the physical object and the creator of it.</p>

<p>It&#39;d be easier to dismiss if I hadn&#39;t seen a few Keshe vids. He can be pretty convincing, but then again, good con men are too. Jury&#39;s out still but risk, reward: If he&#39;s not lying: WORLD CHANGING - If he is... I WASTED A FEW HOURS. I def. wouldn&#39;t buy one from the Foundation until the units are proven by DIYers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know man. Like I&#39;ve been researching this for a few years and I was super into it at first.. but he kept on procrastinating and always said this was coming out the next day kind of deal. But seeing as I follow the entire world and everything about it. You can go quite deep into the ocean of information. We&#39;re truly living in a pivotal time in our world. It&#39;s incredible seeing the things that are going on. Anyway! Before I start ranting. (Sorry guys) the keshe foundation is really moving forward with ther moment.  I strongly suggest you all took a further look into it. Keep yourself updated. At least if it does happen you can say you seen it before anybody else right. Have a good life. And try not to be so down all the time. Chin up soilder. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, did you even read the post!? Did you use the link I put in? The blueprint is FREE. Keshe did over 30 hours of blueprint training this week. Did you see the video on the 16th of October where he gave a 10 day notice to all nations on earth that he was going to open source his patents for the world on the 26th? Here&#39;s that: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4yN-xqZN6w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4yN-xqZN6w</a> Well, the teachings began on the 26th and the links to all of that is in the volunteer blueprint document I posted. Get with it dude, your lack of attention span is evident. Again, the blueprints are free and Keshe taught the whole world how to build them. Go to the link and see for yourself!</p>
