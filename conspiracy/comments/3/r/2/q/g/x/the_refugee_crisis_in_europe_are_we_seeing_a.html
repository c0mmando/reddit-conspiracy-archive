       There are already hundreds or maybe thousands of unregistered "refugees" who are able to roam through Sweden and Germany and pass freely through the open borders to France, Belgium, Poland, Norway, Denmark or the Netherlands.
      </p>
      <p>
       The German and Swedish police and intelligence apparatus are not able to keep track of the refugees, who are able to leave refugee-centers at will without being registered whatsoever and there are reports that hundreds of them have already done so.

       If ISIS (
       <a href="https://archive.is/VZsWs">
        created by western secret services
       </a>
       ) is willing to infiltrate those countries with terrorists, there would be no hurdle for them to do so. If they wanted to, they could have already sent thousands of terrorists into Europe, who are now roaming through the countries, without ever having been registered, waiting for a command to do coordinated and potentially disastrous attacks on people and infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this happens, the people will beg the government for tighter controls and surveillance. It is the old game of creating a problem and then offering the solution.

       The globalists want to erase the nation-state. (It's the only hedge against their power.) To do that, they have to dilute each nation and erase its culture. Once that is accomplished, they can say, "But you're ALREADY a global society, see?"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a fait accompli.
      </p>
      <p>
       THEN they will make it official by stripping individual national sovereignty and transferring it over to an international body [run of course by the globalist banking syndicates].

        Footnote: The new angry minority populations can also act as zombie armies for the elite. Until now, the elite was always in jeopardy due to the fact that, by definition, they have small numbers. Historically, the common people could always rise up and overthrow an oppressive regime. Thanks to the new "zombie army" methodology, though, the elite can use the media to rile up a convenient ethnic bloc and mobilize them to loot and riot. Julius Caesar called it "Divide and Conquer". You play Group A against Group B. By telling the newcomers that they have legitimate grievances and that the host-population "owes" them, they can fan race-hatred and foment violence. Through this method, they can keep the host-population cowed and in fear. So to the globalists, mass migration is a win-win.

       I think the idea that ISIS is "run" by the west is complete tripe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe there is a very real chance we started them, but it would be the sort of action where we set it in motion and supplied what was needed, but it was all done backroom, under the table, and now is outside of any direct control.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not as if Obama or Brennan can give them an order or anything. We may have created them, we do not, any longer at least, have overt control.

       You basically have a blow back hypothesis.  But this fails because the West could easily annihilate ISIS with its air force as Russia is currently doing.  WSJ lets the cat out of the bag: "US Sees Russian Drive Against CIA-Backed Rebels in Syria"
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two Frontline programs that are free online that deal with these aspects.  They are funded and run by the West to overthrow Dr. Assad, because he has missiles that can strike Tel Aviv.  The attack on Iran is delayed until these missiles are dealt with.

       False flag attacks are only needed to push a complacent population in a particular direction when all other attempts have failed.  It's much easier to let things happen organically.  For the powers that be it would ideally play out like this:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Allow for mass influx of people into regions that are diametric opposites to the native population and culture
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Inform the native population that they must allow these refugees to do as they will.  Forcing them to assimilate will not be tolerated (Bonus points for any holocaust analogy).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Continue to bring in more refugees at the same time publicly damning natives for getting upset.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Allow the native dissent to fester to the point it boils over into riots (Bonus points if an example can be made of an innocent refugee's death.  Even more bonus points if the victim was a child who was trying to escape such violence in their homeland only to die from it here).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Enforce more assimilation as opposition continues to grow.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Repeat as needed and only enact a false flag if absolutely needed.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>

       It will be easier to enact laws that will turn countries into police states. It will most likely start with riots either by dissenters or other legitimate organizations who want whats best for their country.

       Why is it that 99%(estimate) of terrorist attacks are always thwarted? That is an ubsurdly large sucess rate. Im not complaining im just saying its weird. Why are cops so good at stopping terrorism but not corruption, robberies, or murders? Seems to good to be true.

       I don't see any evidence to suggest such attacks are commonly thwarted. Those that are often fail due to the mental illness of the perpetrators, leading to carelessness, inadequate research on untraceable purchases, basically anything you would see on a csi type tv show or a court inquiry. Those acts which are carried out by well run organisations usually succeed, such as the tokyo sarin gas train incident. True terrorism is a rare thing and by every emotion of humanity self limiting, whereas the power struggles of war over land and resources never cease.

       There are two ways to look at the Migrant situation right now.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        They are making Europe a multi-cultural haven where the first true humans will be born. Mixing the entire human race into one, just like in the past I.E. original Hebrews.
       </li>
      </ol>

        They are planning false flag attacks in order to kill white people.

       Here is why, I've come to the conclusion that Germany and Russia were high jacked by British Nobility in order to spread white supremacy in countries that used to be fully against it. Using Hitler and Stalin, the Red Army and the Nazi's killed real Semites while empowering the Ashkenazi Jews to the status they hold now. I beleive this is why Germany is so divided, while there are some that still stand by the Nazi rhetoric, others know of the their countries past and how their heritage was basically darkened by the likes of the Nazi movement.

       I think this is why this video exists.

       We are also seeing the EU change to a different regime, a very different regime than the previous one that existed. This regime is the same that happened when Obama first got into office, we as American's became a lot more Liberal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which leads me to the next odd issue, Britain, one of the found members of the EU wants to leave...

       Is this because liberals have infiltrated the EU as well?

       Well let's see what America has to say about it,

       Now, throwing in the fact that the Israel/Palestine conflict as pretty much gone mainstream, ISIS is in full effect and the fact that UK newspaper released this video,

       We are literally living in the times just before WW2 started, regime changes from both the Zionist and the global liberals every other day. This war will be a bit different though, you need people for war, and thankfully we have the internet, opinions and perspectives can be swayed unlike the mindless who fell for the likes of Hitler because that's the only source of information they had.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are starting to see a huge propaganda war, not like before.  All news at this point should be researched and looked at, there is no telling who is doing what.

       Common knowledge, every minority on this planet is a Jew as in we all were enslaved by the hands of the same kind and all freed at once.
Hence we all come from that area, although, removed by instances like slavery or migration. We all started right there.
      </p>

       Thus the mixing of dark and white will create the same mixed toned Hebrews of the past, bringing along with it a multi-cultural Europe, if things continue the way they are. First, barriers (white supremacy) has to be destroyed.
