<p>I posted this:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3r010e/roger_waters_is_boycotted_outside_bay_street/">Roger Waters Is Boycotted Outside Bay Street Theater On Friday</a></p>

<p>It was removed from the queue with no flair or explanation.</p>

<p>I politely inquired:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just curious -</p>

<p>Why was this removed without even a flair?:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3r010e/roger_waters_is_boycotted_outside_bay_street/">https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3r010e/roger_waters_is_boycotted_outside_bay_street/</a></p>

<p>Thanks in advance for a response.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And got this from a mod named luster:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/r/entertainment">/r/entertainment</a> - Justin Bieber updates, etc.</p>

<p>Celebrity news is removed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Noticing that there was at least one celebrity thread on r/news, I replied:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s not in the rules. You should add it. Is it a selective rule?:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3qxpxm/al_molinaro_character_actor_known_for_role_on/">https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3qxpxm/al_molinaro_character_actor_known_for_role_on/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I asked when we could expect to see the rule added, was told the rule was there and was then &quot;muted&quot; for 72 hours from r/news and couldn&#39;t message the mods.</p>

<p>I&#39;m neither angry nor annoyed. I am dismayed to see what used to be a great site for freedom of expression slowly being strangled.</p>

<p>Yes. &quot;Become passers-by&quot; is my favorite quote from the Gospel of Thomas. Being a tourist is the only way to cope with this particular planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear you guy. I had a similar experience on r/skeptic, but at least the mods had the excuse that they hate my guts:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/3ng0ld/it_sure_looks_as_though_they_consider_me_dangerous/">https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/3ng0ld/it_sure_looks_as_though_they_consider_me_dangerous/</a></p>

<p>I contacted admin about the enforcement of non-existent rules, and the new practice among mods of not contacting users to explain bans. I sent them the following:</p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;First off, I&#39;m an evil, dangerous climate contrarian. That makes me the target of a lot of hatred. It&#39;s also made me, and many others like me, the targets of unjust bans on subs where the mods are AGW believers.</p>

<p>You guys have said in the past that policing the subs is up to the mods. But you also have site-wide rules presented in your FAQ. Mods in various subs have decided that their own rules override yours. I may be the only one who&#39;s decided enough is enough and have contacted you guys. That may be because I have the guts to do it. </p>

<p>As I said, a few subs have taken to banning contrarians with prejudice - r/environment, r/climate, and r/skeptic are the ones that I know of because all have banned me. There are likely others. No notice is given, no information as to why the ban is in effect. </p>

<p>R/skeptic mods at least gave their reasons and I&#39;ve reproduced our exchanges here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/3ng0ld/it_sure_looks_as_though_they_consider_me_dangerous/">https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/3ng0ld/it_sure_looks_as_though_they_consider_me_dangerous/</a></p>

<p>In that case they re-interpreted your site-wide rules and held a kangaroo court. In the other cases I&#39;ve been met with silence. Other banned users tell us the same. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I see - a number of highly vocal and determined AGW believers have taken it upon themselves to harass skeptics and abuse mods who allow skeptic content. Their bullying tactics have resulted in many people being driven from subs and the banning of others. Tactics such as: stalking; username mentions; invention of statements, positions and beliefs; multiple replies in a single thread, vote-brigading. In the thread beneath the link I gave you above I show an example of watching vote-brigading in real time. </p>

<p>The person whom, I believe, is behind much of this is (username) That user has been stalking me for 5 years now. He supplies a lot of content to those subs I&#39;ve mentioned and is consumed by his karma score. It would be worth your time to investigate his activity if only to show that Reddit admins have a care for the safety and enjoyment of users.</p>

<p>It would also be worth your while to demand from the mods their lists of banned users and the reasons behind those bans. You&#39;ll find a pattern of arbitrary decisions that fly in the face of your site rules.&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>No action was taken so I have to assume that the admins support and encourage the banning and harassment of people that they, or the mods, don&#39;t agree with. </p>

<p>That&#39;s my conclusion too. Thanks for the backup. It&#39;s a shame watching this place turn into another kept gate.</p>
