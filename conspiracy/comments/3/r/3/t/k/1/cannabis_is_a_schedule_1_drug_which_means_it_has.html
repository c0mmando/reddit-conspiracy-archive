       If I had a pool of slaves that numbered in the billions, I would know that I could accomplish much more with them if they were healthy.  Unless I felt that they might overthrow me were they not weakened enough to be enslaved... then I would have to keep them sick and I would accept that they could not be at maximum productivity.

       I was taught in the 1990s that Monsanto and that sort of industry might use marketing and lobbying and a flood of money to overwhelm our safeguards that are meant to protect our food supply.  They have done this and continue to do this.
      </p>
      <p>
       They seek to and already hold patents on genes.  This science could also be used to make food into a sort of genetic medicine or poison which is basically what you're talking about.

       Once TPP is enacted and more internet censorship begins, we may be unable to have this conversation, or even face consequences for sharing our views and thoughts on this matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have also heard that there is GMO being researched regarding the modification of cannabis, so there may soon be or already be transgenic cannabis.  I have also heard that there are very productive GMO poppies in Afghanistan, which is a bit strange and alarming.

       One other suspicion I have...  during the height of the Occupy movement, there were reported incidences of protesters being brought by police to facilities where they were given cannabis to smoke.  Maybe these were early trials of a GMO cannabis.  Imagine if an engineered cannabis was considered "anti-establishment" but was actually a trojan horse for chemical lobotomy or who even knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that this is happening, but it was very weird to hear about police supplying weed to such people and then observing them- it seems exactly like experimentation to me.

       I have heard people say that the Guardian is a rag, and I guess wiki isn't so perfect either but I suppose I could contend that we aren't exactly given perfect journalism in this world for the most part and that might be a part of our problems.

       In the Oliver Stone film 'Platoon', which is about Viet Nam, a character mentioned "gooks putting chemicals on the grass to make us all pacificts".  So the idea has been around since at least 1986 when it was released, or in the '60s when Stone was himself in Viet Nam.

       Monsanto and the US government is already responsible for food-related human rights violations in the United States, considering their herbicides are carcinogenic. We're eating cancer. What I'm confused about is how the EPA initially identified carcinogenicity, and then went ahead and approved glyphosate. What.

       Marijuana is not generally known for increasing productivity. The bottom line is that it's a difficult drug to control because it's so easy to produce.

       But the hypocrisy is clear here. Hypocrisy in government is generally based on dishonest rather than stupidity. It's called the noble lie.

       This is also true of GHB (γ-hydroxy-butrate). It is a Schedule I drug, but it is also prescribed as a drug called

       . It calls its main ingredient Sodium Oxybate, but it's the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even stranger...Xyrem is Schedule III!
      </p>
      <p>
       As people have figured this out over the past 8 or 9 years it has been prescribed...The makers have had to be honest and state that it is GHB and then list why GHB is illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is GHB is endogenous and virtually harmless. You can go into a deep sleep state while taking it if you are not careful and there is a steep dose-response curve meaning a little bit can be very potent depending on physiology of the person taking it, but it was made illegal as a political show...as part of the "War on Drugs"
      </p>
      <p>
       The only caveat to GHB being harmless is that it can be dangerous if you are consuming the legal drug alcohol along with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, much like cannabis, GHB has been shown to have numerous neuro-protective benefits. In fact, one of the ingredients in the solution that transplanted organs are kept between removal from donor but before implant in the donee is GHB.

       Heroin is also on there when in reality it's diacetylmorphine, and doctors legally prescribe opioids much more potent than heroin.. It's just easier to mass produce so profits are slim for them

       Heroin is a legal analgesic in every other part of the world (administered parenterally in hospitals) except the US. That's because the US wants to keep up the disinformation about it...To fuel the War on Drugs.
