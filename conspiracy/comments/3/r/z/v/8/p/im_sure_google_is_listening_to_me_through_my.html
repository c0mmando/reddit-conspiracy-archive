       I've never posted before but I wanted to know if any one else had experienced this. 2 days ago in work I was talking to a friend about music particually shitty music from a few years ago, I mentioned Nickelback - How You Remind Me and then after hearing about a couple of other bands that she used to like I said I bet you liked Evanescence and tried to remember the name of the song Bring Me Back to Life. Fast forward to this morning and I go on the Google Play Store and
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/SHBvbSV.jpg">
        This
       </a>
       is the first page I thought back to Friday and thought it was a coinsidence I click more and see
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/HVeuceS.jpg">
        This
       </a>
       I know I didn't google them because I was working, I dont have any music on my phone and I dont use anything like spotify so I told my girlfriend and we decided to see if we could talk and make it do it again so we talked about Arctic Monkeys and kept on mentioning the band name and there latest album AM I refreshed the app store scrolled down recommended and seen
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/YgExp6v.jpg">
        this
       </a>
       straight away. Has anyone else noticed? I am almost certain that my phone is listening to me for targeted ads, is this even legal?

       Your time stamps and battery life show that you took the nickelback picture,  less than 1 minute later you took the Evanescence picture,  and then less than one minute later took the Arctic Monkeys picture. This means that your story doesn't add up.

       Actually looking at them it appears the first and second picture were taken one minute apart, with the same battery life, then the third pic which is supposedly one day later is taken at the same time (10:43) but with a 1% higher battery life. The phone is charging as you can see in the battery symbol, but if you look at the notification icons in the top left you can see an email has been received, so what happened is in the second screenshot you can see the WiFi has up and down arrows, meaning that was probably when it was downloading the email. So the first and second picture were taken one minute apart which does line up with the story, but the third image would either be in the same minute, and the battery charged by 1% and received an email OR it was taken the next day at the exact same time at a 1% higher battery after getting an email. So 90% chance that all screenshots were taken in a row, OP is a phony. Although the moral of the story is right, Google is listening all (or at least some of) the time, and harvesting that data.

       One thing that I think about sometimes having been using computers for quite a while is what the hell is eating up all the processing power these days,   and in some cases it's obvious but in others not so much.  When I first started getting into computers they ran at 50mhz and below (the 486dx1 era) and they ran full color guis,  at decent enough resolutions like I think most good monitors then ran at least 800x600 no problem but can't recall,
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have multiple cores running in the multi ghz, even the lowest power states are tens of times faster than a computer of that era,  it makes me wonder what could be running behind the scenes or even on a firmware level in some cases.  It's probably just mild paranoia from hearing about all the back doors and loopholes but it doesn't seem that far fetched when you know that 20mhz and 4mb of memory is enough to run an entire OS and applications in full color and 20mhz is a throw -away amount of resources on any modern device outside like an arduino. . .

       Most of us also do ten times as much computing as people did on those early computers. Right now on my PC I am using my web browser, streaming music from the spotify app, and downloading a game update in the steam client. I have 85 total processes currently stored in memory.

       That depends entirely on what OS it is you are running...OS's today are exponentially more complex than something like ms-dos or early windows versions.

       I know that they are, I guess my point was that windows versions and Linux and so on that will run on 25mhz and 4mb of memory, they actually did alot.  My first pc had that and I could have dos5, or 6, running windows 3 on top, and Microsoft works on top of that all while running a Gui,   so my point was there could be something running behind the scenes using very little resources and you would have no idea,   in those days you really wouldn't see that. By the way my friend at the time had a 486 25sx,  which was like the celeron of the time,  no math coprocessor, and 12mb of memory and could run windows 95 which multitasking,   and he could browse the Web,  download something etc all at the same time in the space of 25mhz, and 12mb plus probably some small amount of disk swap.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we really don't do that much more than we used to,  steam isn't new music streaming isn't new , I remember on 100mhz pentium and 24mb of memory having multiple Web browser open and my email client autorefreshijg in the background while streaming with RealPlayer or Winamp,  and plus an IRC client doing Xdcc transfers ,  the games we run are certainly more advanced but software itself while it might do a lot more in the way of active spell check and run faster and open and save files faster, the actual functions haven't changed a whole lot I would say.  People even had 3d accelerators and opengl and DIRECTx on those machines though the only accelerator I had until I bought a Riva later, first 128 then Tnt was a rendition vertite which I bought because quake supported it and I saw it in a magazine LOL, much different times.

       Try disabling Google Now. It constantly listens through your microphone so that it can know when you say "Ok, google".

       They're both owned by Facebook so I guess that's the culprit (for now). I also have whatsapp and have slight beginning thoughts of deleting it.

       Basically if you want to be as spy-safe as possible don't use any Google (including youtube) Microsoft, Apple and Facebook (including WhatsApp) products.
And if you want to be even more safe don't use computers or smartphones at all. You will manage.

       Its an android phone though so I think Google Service are always running and it was the Google Play Store that recommended the albums. I wasnt even using my phone when I was talking it was just on my desk locked which makes me thinks it listens 24/7

       You're right I cant be the only one to notice this but people don't care because we are so reliant on our smartphones, tablets and computers. I literally have my phone with me 24/7 if it records audio and tracks gps it would know everything about me, what music I like, where I work and live, what food I like and if they collaborate that data with what they collect from everyone elses phones they would know who my friends and family are, who i work with etc.

       I know that when you are on your home screen and the search bar appears, the microphone is turned on to listen if you say "ok google". But I don't know, many people have reported about targeted ads. Have you never searched for these bands on youtube?

       My phone was locked and was just on my desk and I definetly haven't googled Nickelback or Evanesence its not my kind of music and we having a joke about the bands we listened to in the 90s in fact i honestly dont think I've heard an Evanesence song in about 5-10 years it is such a random artist to reccommend it makes no sense as it's not similar to any music I ever listen to or search

       I kind of think most the comments here are just for fun, your story seems legit to me at least. I was talking about fallout 4 (mentioning pit boy and whatnot) with my friends, saw your post and cheched my Google store, sure enough Google reccomended Fall out Boy to me. I have never listened to fall out boy

       OP,  you should have a Google settings feature.  Looks like a cog.  You can turn off the targeted ads and reset your ad ID.  Might not prevent the eavesdropping,  but should stop the interest based ads.

OP is deliberately making it obvious that he is BSing, so that when someone finds REAL evidence of Google spying, they will not be taken seriously...AHA!

       You should try something more strange to test it. Like Yellow Magic Orkastra or some other weird band that no one listens to any more.

       There's some bullshit going on. I have the facebook app. I don't use it. I can't delete it fully. I uninstall the updates and check the box saying I don't want it to auto update. Guess what? It still fucking auto updates. Why push Facebook like that?

       I know Nickelback adverts are scary and hard to accept but its true and if we don't do something about it one dreadful day you will wake up to see a beautifully wavy haired and goatee faced mans advert on your phone screen and then and only then will you understand the devastation

        Now we have multiple cores running in the multi ghz, even the lowest power states are tens of times faster than a computer of that era

       Most of us also do ten times as much computing as people did on those early computers. Right now on my PC I am using my web browser, streaming music from the spotify app, and downloading a game update in the steam client. I have 85 total processes currently stored in memory.

        it doesn't seem that far fetched when you know that 20mhz and 4mb of memory is enough to run an entire OS and applications in full color

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That depends entirely on what OS it is you are running...OS's today are exponentially more complex than something like ms-dos or early windows versions.
