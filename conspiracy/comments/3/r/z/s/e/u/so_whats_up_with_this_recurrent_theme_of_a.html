    <div class="md"><p>As a former religion studies major (that admittedly didn&#39;t get that far into it), here&#39;s a list of features surrounding the life of the Egyptian God Osirus, one of the oldest known deities. </p>

<p>Mother was a virgin</p>

<p>Born under a star</p>

<p>Birth attended by three magi</p>

<p>Born on December 25th (there about)</p>

<p>Was unfairly put to death by his brother Set, and rose from the dead three days later. </p>

<p>Sound familiar? There are more to be found. There are also many traits in common with the Hindu God Vishnu. Conspiracy? Probably not. It suggests that a lot of people incorporated the legends and religion of their neighbors with their own for a long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried searching online, and found nothing useful. There&#39;s a lot of sources, but the sites against it are all Christian and correctly state that there are numerous &#39;books of the dead,&#39; and that the wealth of research allows one to cherry-pick their facts. The ones for the notion describe numerous tales of Osiris and Horus that overlap the Jesus story, but again have the ability to cherry-pick these tales and their sources may not be reliable. </p>

<p>But I stand by what I intended to be my original point, which is that the local legends and mythologies often worked their way into various religions. The beliefs of the Babylonians colored Judaism, much of the legends of Buddhism come out of Hinduism, etc...</p>

<p>Studying religion does not necessarily lead one to be religious. Not all good Christians believe in the same Christ. I could offer the same advice to you. If you&#39;ve never looked at the history of your religion or what others have written about your denomination outside of what&#39;s written in the bible, you will be surprised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You aren&#39;t a Christian if you don&#39;t believe in Christ. You can follow all the scriptures but if you don&#39;t believe Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins you aren&#39;t a Christian. I don&#39;t know why or how you would even start to argue that point. I may be wrong that zeitgeist is the first place it showed up I admit that, but it still doesn&#39;t make those lies anymore less a lie. It&#39;s misinformation that doesn&#39;t have anything to back it up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point. Although I don&#39;t complain when the librarian points me into the direction of the library computer to make the search. Seriously, I wasn&#39;t being mean with that &quot;google&quot; answer - it was honestly a good suggestion. Then that asshole says society is shit because it wasn&#39;t the answer they were looking for. Unbelievable.</p>
