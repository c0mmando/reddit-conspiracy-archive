       Muslims and Christians believe in the second coming of Jesus Christ (he is called Isa in Islam) and he will kill off the Anti-Christ (or Dajjal, meaning the 'Deceiver' in Islam) when he returns.

       Umm I don't know but a lot of Christians also believe in Vatican lies. I think messiah is just a term given for a prophet who will save his people. We all are waiting for that messiah, or perhaps the messiah could be any of us. It doesn't have to be a person with supernatural powers as the vatican made us believe.

       The vatican is the beast mentioned in revelations. The beast rose out of the sea it had 7 heads (the 7 hills) to which sat 10 crowns (the 10 original EU countries that together borders make up the holy roman empire) upon its heads. One head was wounded &amp; healed (french revolution). They gave it power &amp; the people were in awe or something like that. These aren't jusy random assigning. These are all supported by evidence I consider beyond reasonable doubt. Let me know if you want know more

       Zoroastrianism is the first monotheistic religion that we know of - all the other copycat religions wanted to feel special, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything about good vs evil, messiah, morality lessons, etc. is taken from this ancient Iranian religion.

       Good point. Although I don't complain when the librarian points me into the direction of the library computer to make the search. Seriously, I wasn't being mean with that "google" answer - it was honestly a good suggestion. Then that asshole says society is shit because it wasn't the answer they were looking for. Unbelievable.

       True, part of the fun was actually finding what you were looking for!  Don't let the negative or rude people get to you.( not saying the commenter was rude. Just saying)

       Though,
I have found searching YouTube. If a great way to get into a new topic .
One video leads to another video or  book to read or person to research .

       As a former religion studies major (that admittedly didn't get that far into it), here's a list of features surrounding the life of the Egyptian God Osirus, one of the oldest known deities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mother was a virgin
      </p>
      <p>
       Born under a star
      </p>
      <p>
       Birth attended by three magi
      </p>
      <p>
       Born on December 25th (there about)
      </p>
      <p>
       Was unfairly put to death by his brother Set, and rose from the dead three days later.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sound familiar? There are more to be found. There are also many traits in common with the Hindu God Vishnu. Conspiracy? Probably not. It suggests that a lot of people incorporated the legends and religion of their neighbors with their own for a long time.

       I tried searching online, and found nothing useful. There's a lot of sources, but the sites against it are all Christian and correctly state that there are numerous 'books of the dead,' and that the wealth of research allows one to cherry-pick their facts. The ones for the notion describe numerous tales of Osiris and Horus that overlap the Jesus story, but again have the ability to cherry-pick these tales and their sources may not be reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I stand by what I intended to be my original point, which is that the local legends and mythologies often worked their way into various religions. The beliefs of the Babylonians colored Judaism, much of the legends of Buddhism come out of Hinduism, etc...

       You were not a religion studies major because if you were you would not have posted these misconceptions that are based on nothing but lies told to forward a narrative. Unless watching zeitgeist counts as a college major now. Nearly everything in that first part of that movie has been debunked as either misconceptions or flat out lies.

       Thanks for attacking a stranger's credibility on the Internet! I was indeed a religion studies major, and I don't remember much of the movie Zeitgeist other than it being about 3 hours long.

       As a bonus for your participation, I'll tell you about the book that lead me to a crisis of faith and was the main reason I dropped the course of study, 'Meeting Jesus Again For the First Time,' where author and prominent Christian Theologian Marcus Borg explains that even though Jesus was probably not real, it's important that people believe in him to maintain morality. As the old saying goes, religion is the opiate of the masses.

       zeitgeist is the only place where your information comes from. It's too specific for you not to be pulling it from that movie you might not be aware that's where you getting it from but it is. I don't believe for a second you've studied religion. You are not a Christian if you don't believe Christ is real it's the same as calling yourself an atheist but saying God exists. Educate yourself, knowledge is power.

       This theory was also seen in Bill Maher's 'Religilous' which I believe came out years before the movie Zeitgeist. Google it and see there is a lot of discussion on the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Studying religion does not necessarily lead one to be religious. Not all good Christians believe in the same Christ. I could offer the same advice to you. If you've never looked at the history of your religion or what others have written about your denomination outside of what's written in the bible, you will be surprised.

       You aren't a Christian if you don't believe in Christ. You can follow all the scriptures but if you don't believe Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins you aren't a Christian. I don't know why or how you would even start to argue that point. I may be wrong that zeitgeist is the first place it showed up I admit that, but it still doesn't make those lies anymore less a lie. It's misinformation that doesn't have anything to back it up.
