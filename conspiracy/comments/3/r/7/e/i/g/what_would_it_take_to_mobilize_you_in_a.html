       Here's what would make me stand up: if any one of the States voted to secede from the the rest of U.S. and implimented non fiat based debt currency, but gold backed, militias, a plan, green energy, trade based economy, then I'm all in to moving and helping out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another scenario I would act on is if a shit ton of Americans were ex-patriating off into, say Argentina, to start a new colony based on gold backed currency, constitution, etc. Fuck yea I,would be so down

       If done the right way, in the spotlight, with massive social media support, and support of key politicians, banks, gold reserves, people, some corporate cooperation, then it could be done via a slow drip of getting everyone used to the idea until it becomes concrete.

       No they didn't. I picked them because they are fairly stable and have a shit ton of land. I think if it was done in a way were it integrates with native culture, intermarriage, starting business, creating a sub economy, etc that it could be done also via a slow drip. This country also had european immigrants into various cities that intermarriage locals and integrated, but never on the level of being a colony.

       Thing is, something has to be done to hedge bets against a collapsed U.S. that becomes a totalitarian oligarchy orwell society. Look at how Syrians are immigrating into E.U. and will create Syrian blocks and eventually outbreed the home countries population:

       </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's on the low end. Some women have upwards of 8-12 kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately,the SJW and feminism movement is making men in the U.S. anti marriage, anti procreation, anti women besides just sleeping around and protecting assets from marriages/divorces.

      <p>
       A lot of shit is up in the air, but seceding and/or colonizing a part of some sympathetic country I think would be the only options to establish a seed of constitutionalists

       My question was about the Global Oligarchy, you focused on America.

       Even if my question had been about America, both of your scenarios involve no longer participating in the original America. Wtf?

       The original America is being destroyed from within. What's happening instead is sub movements of decentralization, bitcoins, transparent movements, people wanting organic non gmo foods, labeled foods, wanting to hold corporations and governments accountable for their actions, psyop SJW movements possibly created by C.I.A. There's a lot of stuff there to dig through.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, its not yet a global Oligarchy. If it was, we wouldn't be seeing the whole Syria debacle, so not everyone is on the same globalist page. Russia seems to be a last holdout along with China starting to dump U.S. debt and create and alternative BRICS system.

       That's what I'm doing so far, as much as I am able. But, right now I am entirely dependent on another person who IS still living within the system. I have developed my "psycho totalitarian bullshit" trying to imagine a world in which I could be independent while free of the system, without being reduced to hunter-gatherer-sustenance-farmer, and that is what I came up with. A system that supports the individual. I've put a lot of thought into it, years of it. What plan do you have that you think could accomplish the same goal?

       Ah, yes, all of that is feasible for the population.  Great solution, certainly not highly implausible to successfully implement for even a small group of people.  After all, there aren't any communes left that don't use money, so you have an archetype to follow for a couple years until things go haywire.

 The Black Live Matter movement? 
It's a revolutionary movement against the oligarchy and the agents of the state: the police.
Go to Ferguson. See what is still going on, and take that energy to your city. Movements, marches, civil disobedience doesn't just happen. It's organized. Its about making change. Look up what's happening in your community and make change happen. Start with a "know your rights " training and get plugged in.

       I'm in a rural area of a state with almost no African american population. Most of our "people of color" are refugees, and they get treated pretty well, to the point of us whites tolerating being screamed at to leave their ethnic markets without fighting back or even reporting the incident. So I have no idea how to bring that movement's energy home.

       Putting "less fortunate" in quotes indicates you have no interest in being a responsible member of civil society.  There are a great many people who need and deserve help that costs almost no societal resources.  We expend more policing them than would be spent aiding them.  It makes no sense.

       Oh come on, we'd set up universal free healthcare too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to see every piece of "science" funded by a corporation thrown out and redone. Likewise for laws/legislation. I'd like to see ALL Needs be established as Rights: food, physical safety/comfort, education, livelihood/work, healthcare, emotional safety/stability, communication, transportation, everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to see new, strict laws regarding pollution and finite resources. I'd like to see every fossil fuel powered car and power plant and gas station recycled. I'd like to see many of our roads demolished, our transportation system totally restructured --convenient mass air transport replacing highways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Laws regarding energy use as well. No more "power vampire" appliances like blower space heaters. No more cheap housing with ineffective or absent insulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once we've established all that, it makes sense to create "intentional communities" -- to hard to set up the infrastructure to provide all of this to everyone in far-flung private homes.

        Stand up and what? If it was up to reddit, we'd stand up and beg them to  confiscate and redistribute our property to the less fortunate while we line up and pay for a new round of booster shots.

       Oh come on, we'd set up universal free healthcare too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to see every piece of "science" funded by a corporation thrown out and redone. Likewise for laws/legislation. I'd like to see ALL Needs be established as Rights: food, physical safety/comfort, education, livelihood/work, healthcare, emotional safety/stability, communication, transportation, everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to see new, strict laws regarding pollution and finite resources. I'd like to see every fossil fuel powered car and power plant and gas station recycled. I'd like to see many of our roads demolished, our transportation system totally restructured --convenient mass air transport replacing highways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Laws regarding energy use as well. No more "power vampire" appliances like blower space heaters. No more cheap housing with ineffective or absent insulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once we've established all that, it makes sense to create "intentional communities" -- to hard to set up the infrastructure to provide all of this to everyone in far-flung private homes.

       Putting "less fortunate" in quotes indicates you have no interest in being a responsible member of civil society.  There are a great many people who need and deserve help that costs almost no societal resources.  We expend more policing them than would be spent aiding them.  It makes no sense.

       You don't seem to understand how few people are controlling this internet even as it was paid for mostly by us, and other tax payers, along with 99% of the research that funded development of the products from semiconductors to these slick new thin screens.
