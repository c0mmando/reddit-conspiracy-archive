    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a muddying the water technique.  Remember the Valerie Plame affair? There was something there where there was some news that had to do with one guy, with a name like Lawrence Wilkerson, and they had a story released the same weekend along the same lines with a guy named Jim Wilkenson;  end result was you couldn&#39;t tell one story from the other, and the news was confused.   I have seen this technique used on other news events as well.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>me either, i love all races, and we are taught here in ks that whites were bad and kidnapped slaves while in reality africans sold other africans to europeans which shipped to america. i wish the confederacy won, the civil war wasn&#39;t about slavery. it was about money. war started in 1860. lincoln freed the slaves in 1863 to gain popular support because the southerners were kicking some yankee ass.</p>

<p>i&#39;m just sick of being blamed for the worst atrocities in history even though ALL other rraces commited MUCH worse atrocities than any white man. even hitler. </p>

<p>stalin was a jew, he wasn&#39;t white, so was mao he was asian. both killed tens of millions of ppl more than hitler. </p>
