    <div class="md"><p>Heroin use has exploded <em>because</em> of the US military.  We&#39;ve had a presence in Afghanistan since 2001, opium production has increased every year since.  It&#39;s a feature, not a bug.  It&#39;s a moneymaking venture as well as an excuse to crack down (heh) at home.  I mean, it was pretty well proved that the CIA created the crack epidemic, this is just another iteration. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heroin use has also exploded because of the unbelievably successful govt program to crack down on doctors that over-prescribe perception pain killers.</p>

<p>Because of the limits (for better or for worse), of doctors to provide extended pain relief, those who need that kind of pain assistance, say, after major surgeries or accidents, must go elsewhere.  If you&#39;ve ever lived with chronic pain, you understand that a needle that can provide relief is the least of your worries.</p>

<p>There are many factors to this complex problem.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would contend that the successful govt crackdown on doctors is a net plus in accountability of said doctors. I think the next step is to go the portugal route, and treat addicts instead of ruining their lives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right on, and there are more factors than the two we mentioned.  Human addictions is an extremely complex set of issues.  Like chemical substances and the human brain, these things do not have simple answers and ding emerge from vacuumes.  I believe our policy makers are starting to understood that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When people lose hope, as many have and are continuing to do because of economic uncertainty, an incomplete understanding of the world&#39;s ills, and the constant barrage of bummer information, they have a choice- they can fight back, try to change things, or they can beguile themselves and make the pain go away.  It&#39;s not a surprise that many people feel utterly powerless to change anything external to themselves, so they control what they are able to.  They try to make the pain go away.  Heroin, while utterly devastating to one&#39;s humanity if used with any degree of frequency, can make any situation at all seem like paradise for a short while.  And the people pushing opium production know this.  They know they can make money.  They know they can spread fear and loathing.  They know that most will see only a drug addict, a criminal, not a human being in need of help, whose very existence is a declaration that something is dreadfully wrong with the world.</p>

<p>On why middle-aged white folks are dying at a faster rate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;An increasingly pessimistic view of their financial future combined with the increased availability of opioid drugs has created this kind of perfect storm of adverse outcomes,&quot; said Jonathan Skinner, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The British historically used opium in order to ruin the Chinese economy. I would suggest that some clandestine group has done the exact same thing to the US. </p>

<p>We have a flood of heroin, I don&#39;t see anyone asking why or where it came from. I would suggest that the reason for that is because the reporters already know that it was smuggled in by the CIA and the Bush crime family. </p>
