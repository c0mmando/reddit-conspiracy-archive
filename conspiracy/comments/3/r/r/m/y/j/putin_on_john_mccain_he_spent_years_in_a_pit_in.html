       Before he became songbird he was called crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once back from Nam he did everything he could to NOT help the POWs left there. And went on to become of of the most psychopathic war mongers!
He should be put back into a cage and left to rot in one of the many dilapidated VA hospitals.

       I can't imagine what it must have been like for a man to live for years caged like an animal. I wouldn't put a dog in a cage like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently McCain did break. Lot's of stories about him making all kinds of political statements and giving up info about stuff that probably got a lot of other pilots killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       People (eg. Donald Trump) get down on McCain for doing this. But the North Vietnamese broke him using the most inhumane methods. Nobody could have held out forever under the conditions McCain faced.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm guessing his experience as a prisoner of war still haunts him today. If he's even able to think about it. I've got an uncle who was a tail gunner during WWII. Tail gunners had something like a 75% mortality rate. So every mission he flew, he must have been expecting to die. Anyone who knew him knew not to even ask about what he went through because he simply wouldn't even talk about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure McCain has been affected in a similar fashion.

       Certainly. He was a key advocate against securing the release of leftover POWs in Vietnam...didn't want to relive the horrors I guess, so kept others living through them.

       Uh, you should read some of the statements his fellow pow's have said about him. Singing his way to daily showers/fresh shaves/3 meals a day/clean clothes daily. The others were pissed at him as they should have been.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the Vietnamese commander was said to be enamored that he had a Navy Admiral's son captive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that the hostility from the pow's that were treaty horribly, while the Hanoi Hilton Songbird was treated favorably, was a great deterrent for McCain to obfuscate any military review and/or actions to further the search for many pow's that didn't make it back home. The guy is a sick fuck!!

      <p>
       He must not have had any fucks to give. There's a couple of possibilities here. One, he didn't think he was ever going back to the States. Two, he thought he'd make it back.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he thought he'd make it back, he sure wasn't worried about looking bad because of the way he cooperated with the NVA. I'm guessing he was pretty well connected? Like a rich family or something... because that's the way those people are. One set of rules for them and another for everybody else.

       Sure.  But I've always found it interesting that he's been a hawk's hawk throughout his career, even after being tortured as a POW.  That's where any adoration for a man like that goes out the window.  Smedley Butler was a war hero.

       In SERE school in the military, they teach you what to do and what not to do as a POW.
      </p>
      <p>
       But honestly, I would imagine the actual experience to be
       <strong>
        much, much worse
       </strong>
       than what they are training you for.
      </p>
      <p>
       So i would agree with you, i don't think anyone can blame John McCain for simply trying to survive. Which one of us here in the subreddit would fair any better?
      </p>
      <p>
       I may take issues with his politics, but i respect McCain for simply staying alive in an environment like that.

       That's assuming he really went through the hell he claims. His father was commander of the Pacific fleet, so he most likely got some kind of special treatment by his captors.

       On his best day, combined with his [literal] dreams, John McCain registers at about the seismological-blip-equivalent of a prepubescent-queef at the bottom of the kiddie-pool when juxtaposed next to the sanctimonious-sainthood of mister sanguinness himself, Louis Zampirini.
