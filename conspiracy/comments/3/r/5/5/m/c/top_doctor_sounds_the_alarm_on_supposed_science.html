        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Dr. Mark Geier discusses aspects of the flu vaccine</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvXIqUyOdK4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvXIqUyOdK4</a></p>

<p>In the video above, he explains that the flu shot causes Guillain-Barré Syndrome, and that the flu shot is not very effective in preventing the flu. He also explains that the CDC does not follow the law for vaccines in requiring long-term safety testing for the influenza vaccine like they do with other vaccines, as it is impossible to test a vaccine that changes every year. So the flu vaccine is basically an experimental vaccine that they want to give out to 300 million people every year. There are also no studies showing the safety of giving the flu vaccine to the same person every single year. However, Dr. Geier points out that the CDC is in the business of distributing flu vaccines, because they represent 300 million doses per year, whereas all the childhood vaccines together only number 20 million. </p>

<p>Dr. Geier goes on to explain that flu is “the wrong thing to vaccinate against” because you have to keep re-vaccinating against it every year, unlike childhood infectious diseases, such as smallpox, that are only vaccinated for once. Dr. Geier points out how ridiculous it is spend billions of dollars on a vaccine that might, at its best, save about 50 lives a year, when there are far more serious problems causing death that are more worthy of that kind of expenditure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was reading a book about vaccines and they made a good point. They said you look at a man that&#39;s 4ft tall and you would most likely say he is short. Then we add an inch to him and we would still call him short, and another inch and another but he is still short. Then we find ourselves with an 8ft man and are wondering how we are still calling him short. This is what happened with vaccines. We had a vaccine for a serious disease say polio and we justified it and said this is good. Then we had another and said this isn&#39;t bad either. Now we are at 53 recommended vaccinations in the child&#39;s first year overloading their immune system. The book is called Vaccine Epidemic and has input from at least 20 doctors. I would suggest reading it also there are some good documentaries on you tube by Gary Null.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The polio vaccine was an admitted train wreck, conceded even by Paul Offit in his book. </p>

<p>Polio was massively over diagnosed prior to the vaccine, as we now know a dozen different things can cause paralysis - including Gullian-Barre syndrome (known potential side effect of vaccination). </p>

<p>Following the vaccine, only &quot;true polio&quot; was recorded which led to the obvious drop. There were also environmental causes like DDT that were eliminated.</p>

<p>Also the greatest horror of polio was actually the way modern medicine treated it through surgery, casting, etc. Physiotherapy was born by a nurse who reversed the paralysis in &quot;polio&quot; patients. </p>

<p>The greatest horror of polio is paralysis. So in India for example, they have nationwide mandatory polio vaccinations, where kids can receive as many as 30 vaccines for it. And while they claim they&#39;re about to eradicate polio, cases of paralysis are through the roof. More than 60,000 cases a year, of identical symptoms of polio - but it&#39;s not polio. </p>

<p>Vaccines are the greatest medical scandal in history. Incredibly well written and documented book available on kindle called &quot;dissolving illusions&quot; </p>

<p>FYI: He&#39;s had his medical licenses revoked for misrepresenting his credentials (he&#39;s not a medical geneticists, he is a genetic counselor) and trying to treat autism with Lupron (by intentionally misdiagnosing autistic children as having precocious puberty), which is used to stop the production of testosterone (and chemical castration), and in doing so, defrauded insurance, and intentionally misinformed parents and patients and put children at serious risk.</p>
