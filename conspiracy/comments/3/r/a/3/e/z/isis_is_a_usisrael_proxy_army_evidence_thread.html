</ul>

<p>Bump to wake people up. </p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT</em></strong> A comprehensive link explaining the whole picture in the middle east and peppered with videos. We train extremists, use them, and discard them when we&#39;re done. It started with the mujahideen against the Soviets, we installed Saddam Hussein, we created Al qaeda and now they&#39;ve been re-branded as &quot;ISIS&quot;. </p>

<p>My question: If the beheading videos are fake - are any stories of them in combat real ? </p>

<p>If you want a good example of the volatility I&#39;m talking about.. 8x the daily volatility on a yearly average two days before the attack. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t be too surprised if the US was using ISIS as a way to force the Russians into committing a ground campaign in the area. Especially after the recent attack on the commercial plane and how the West reacted vs. how Russia reacted.</p>

<p>Creating ISIS could serve a couple functions. Forcing Russia into a military campaign by actually threatening to defeat the Assad regime which gives the US an out for their troops by letting Russia take over the military operations. Also, if Russia gets sucked into a prolonged military campaign there is the possibility of them bleeding money trying to support it.</p>

<p>Of course, this is all speculation, but it&#39;s an interesting idea to think about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia needs Assad because they&#39;ve had to route goods around Europe since their meddling in the Ukraine, they have to ship across the black sea and then via truck through the balkans to the medeterrainean, ISIS overthrowing Assad was a direct threat to their logistical interests, they had to get involved because they can&#39;t afford not to. But with oil prices being half of what Russia needs them to be, they can&#39;t afford to be there, either. They have to destabilize oil production in the middle east if they hope to afford a long term engagement, so far they&#39;ve passed up their opportunities to do so.</p>

<p>Edit -- I think this whole ISIS coop is to push for WW3 ( US vs Russia ect) , which is ultimately to achieve a unified global currency and government ect imo</p>

<p><a href="http://realitieswatch.com/us-intelligence-officer-every-single-terrorist-attack-in-us-was-a-false-flag-attack/"><strong>US Intelligence Officer: &quot;Every Single Terrorist Attack in the U.S. is False</strong></a>(Article)  </p>

<p>From the article:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The truth is, there is no Islamic army or terrorist group called Al-Qaeda, and any informed intelligence officer knows this. But, there is a propaganda campaign to make the public believe in the presence of an intensified entity representing the ‘devil’ only in order to drive TV watchers to accept a unified international leadership for a war against terrorism. The country behind this propaganda is the United States.”<br/>
– Former British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is not a legitimate quote, nor does the article you reference provide a worthy source.</p>

<p>The actual quote from <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/08/july7.development">this Guardian article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bin Laden was, though, a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies. Throughout the 80s he was armed by the CIA and funded by the Saudis to wage jihad against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan. Al-Qaida, literally &quot;the database&quot;, was originally the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the CIA to defeat the Russians. Inexplicably, and with disastrous consequences, it never appears to have occurred to Washington that once Russia was out of the way, Bin Laden&#39;s organisation would turn its attention to the west. The danger now is that the west&#39;s current response to the terrorist threat compounds that original error. So long as the struggle against terrorism is conceived as a war that can be won by military means, it is doomed to fail. The more the west emphasises confrontation, the more it silences moderate voices in the Muslim world who want to speak up for cooperation. Success will only come from isolating the terrorists and denying them support, funds and recruits, which means focusing more on our common ground with the Muslim world than on what divides us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also OP, in the video you provide,Putin does not &quot;candidly explain who controls ISIS&quot;. He explains that the USA armed mercenaries to fight Assad and that these fighters have joined ISIS. The West&#39;s arming of the Syrian rebels is common knowledge, the received understanding is that ISIS used the fallout from the conflict to unite the rebels under their own cause. Your sources do not conflict with this narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want your opinion.  You said &quot;Holohoax&quot; so I am led to believe that you do not believe the Holocaust occurred.  It has been 70 years since the Holocaust ended and in that time there has been plenty of discussion in the U.S. and around the world about the events that transpired during WWII.  </p>

<p>This has not all occurred in a vacuum.  Surely there is a reason why people might take exception to you denying its existence? It&#39;s because most people take it now as historical fact that it did indeed occur. </p>

<p>Do you believe the Holocaust was a hoax?  And why?</p>

<p>Edit.  I must apologize, I can&#39;t watch the video right now, it&#39;s a little long, but I am certainly open to you explaining your point of view to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure I can copy and paste previous comments I made.</p>

<p>But it happened alright. But no where is it near close to what the official propaganda will tell you. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not at my pc atm to provide sources but I will tell you some facts. </p>

<p>There used to be 22 alleged death camps.(Propganda historians were all stupid and called them all concentration camps).</p>

<p>Now there are only 6 in the world and they all reside in Poland.  Why Poland? Because Poland is the last nation to allow independent investigations of their camps.</p>

<p>Zyklon_B is the alleged gas that was used to kill the Jews. Yet it&#39;s proven that people can easily breathe Zyklon_B. </p>

<p>Zyklon_B is a pesticide that leaves behind a blue residue. In none of the fake gas chambers which were built in the 70s, not one had traces of Zyklon_B.  But where did they find it?  The are found in the Delousing Chambers that tour guides will never show you.</p>

<p>Now what was killing Jews in a massive scale enough to be an epidemic? The typhus epidemic. And how was typhus carried? Lice.</p>

<p>I&#39;ma leave it up to you to do the research. I already linked you a big one so good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to correct you on a couple points.</p>

<p>There were far more than 22 concentration camps, however 22 were death camps, for the sole purpose of the extermination of undesirables.  It should also be noted that mass killings did take place at more than just the extermination camps, at other concentrations camps, but more importantly as the Nazis swept across Poland and the Soviet Union, they engaged in mass shootings, of which mass graves still exist.</p>

<p>More than 6 concentration camps survive today, with the majority actually existing in Germany.  Dachau is the most famous of the German ones.  There are others in Poland, Latvia, Ukraine, Austria and beyond.</p>

<p>I am a firm believer that the Holocaust did occur as it is historically taught, however I want to know your point of view as to why you question this narrative.  I respect your opinion, and it is not bad to question the narrative, but I think its important to look at information objectively, and draw conclusions from the evidence, rather than find evidence to fit our own conclusions.</p>

<p>It was a Holocaustian(Someone believes in the Holocaust) who pointed this out to me.</p>

<a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/qar/qar04.html">http://www.nizkor.org/features/qar/qar04.html</a></p>

<p>Nizkor is the number one organization trying to stop/slow Holocaust Revisionism. And yet they have to tell the truth sometimes.</p>

<p>Revisionism isn&#39;t some kind of conspiracy ok. It is an essential part of history. Like water is to living organisms.</p>

<p>It exists because history is written by the victors, so they like to turn it to propaganda. That&#39;s where Revisionism comes in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct, Dachau was not a death camp, this was my mistake. </p>

<p>Mass graves do indeed <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/06/secondworldwar.ukraine">exist</a>.  Most of the graves went unmarked and German death squads (Einsatzgruppen) had the task of destroying them before the end of the war.  This task went unfinished and many remain unexcavated, however we are aware of a large number of them.</p>

<p><a href="http://academic.eb.com/holocaust/article-215489">Here</a> is a good resource by the Encyclopedia Brittannica on the <strong>Einsatzgruppen</strong> and the Holocaust.</p>

<p>It is important to note that there are primary sources that document the mass shootings of Jews by the SS as they went across Eastern Europe.  Testimony from SS soldiers, Nazi collaborators, victims, photographs of the events, and census data exists that backs this up.  I recommend reading <strong>Masters of Death</strong> by Richard Rhodes, a Pulitzer Prize winning historian.</p>

<p>A note about historical revisionism:  you are right that revision of history is important when appropriate.  But it is important so that it may dispell falsehoods and reveal the actual truth.  In the case of the Holocaust, historical evidence, and collective memory have proven that what we know of the Holocaust (why it happened, when, and how it was executed) is largely true.  </p>

<p>As I said before, it is important to look at evidence first, before drawing conclusions. </p>

<p>Let me ask you. How many people do you think died during the Holocaust, and by which mean(s).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="comment mb-3 ml-8" data-depth="15" data-id="cx45kgs">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/cheesyvagina.html">cheesyvagina</a> 2015-11-02</p>
    <div class="md"><p>As I said, there are more primary sources than just photographs.  Testimony from SS soldiers who perpetrated mass killings across Eastern Europe, not solely in death camps, but in impromptu massacres that utilized mass graves.  Just as ISIS today marches across Iraq and Syria, rounding up &quot;infidels&quot; and executing en masse, so too did the Nazis in their European campaign.  </p>

<p>Testimony from victims of these mass killings, and census data that shows enormous loss of life exists.</p>

<p>And finally, the testimony from the camps themselves, including that of officers such as Goering, Himmler, and Hoss, and camp guards exists that corroborates the story that the Holocaust occurred not only as a terror campaign in Eastern Europe, but also as a systematic concerted effort.</p>

<p>Around 11 million or more are estimated to have been killed in the Holocaust from execution by firing squad, gassing, overwork, disease and brutality.</p>

<p>I want to again emphasize that evidence, particularly from primary sources is key.  Even if we choose not to trust the interpretation of events as recounted by thousands of well-respected historians, military personnel, and the like, we should respect the primary source evidence that exists.  This evidence allows to draw a very damning conclusion, that a genocide perpetrated by the Nazis did occur.</p>

<p>First it was 6 Gorrillion now they want 11 Sheckillions. First Saudis now this? You really do eat a lot of propaganda.</p>

<p>I&#39;ma tell you the real number recorded by the Red Cross.</p>

<p>300,000.</p>

<p>Approved by both the Germans and inspected by the Red Cross.

<p>Even Auschwitz changed from 6 Million to 4 Million in the 50s, and by the 80s went down to 1 Million. Getting closer to the actual count every year.</p>

<p>Now let me talk to you about another fake term you keep throwing around. Nazis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, 11 million, 6 million of whom were Jews and the other 5 million were mostly non-Jewish Poles.  It is often forgotten that the Nazis perpetrated a genocide against the Polish people as well as the Jewish people in Europe.  </p>

<p>I want to let you know, the Red Cross actually does not claim that 300,000 were the only number to die in the Holocaust.  <a href="https://m.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3pq3eq/til_that_per_the_official_international_red_cross/">This</a> has been claimed many times in this subreddit, and it is frequently rebutted with evidence from the Red Cross themselves.  The ICRC says that the misattribution of this figure is &quot;false propaganda.&quot;</p>

<p>You have linked that blog twice now and I must ask you, why do you think that you can find no scholarly sources to back up your claims?  There are many who deny the Holocaust and none of them are well-respected historians.</p>

<p>Regardless of what we call the &quot;Nazis,&quot; (we may call them German National Socialists, or representatives of the former German government and military wing if you prefer) there is a large degree of evidence that points to the conclusion that genocide in Europe did occur during WW2.  </p>

<p>At the very least you must concede that there is evidence to support the conclusion of genocide, that <strong><em>at least</em></strong> equals the evidence that shows the opposite, no?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>But based on what you linked me.</p>

<p>&quot;the Red Cross&#39; official position is that there is no way to know the actual number of deaths.&quot;</p>

<p>So currently 300,000 is still the closest accurate number there is.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t buy that Polish/French propaganda smut.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how WW2 started. 1939 Danzig Massacres. Poles killed off 58,000 German and Ukrainian nationals living in Danzig. This prompted Hitler to invade Poland. Of course I&#39;m pretty sure the history books taught you &quot;OMG HITLER WANTS TO CONQUER THE PLANET&quot; and I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s what you believe right now.</p>

<p>But have you actually ever heard Hitler&#39;s speech on the Danzig Massacres? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74krkfIrFQM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74krkfIrFQM</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the very least you must concede that there is evidence to support the conclusion of genocide, that at least equals the evidence that shows the opposite, no?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So where&#39;s the evidence?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have linked that blog twice now and I must ask you,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shows me you didn&#39;t even click on the blogs if you think I linked twice.</p>

<p>As for scholars. How about the fucking Historian who wrote Hitler&#39;s Autobiography? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwp7tVZuXKM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwp7tVZuXKM</a></p>

<p>He was allowed to write the biography, because he was allowed to interview all of Hitler&#39;s generals. And he was able to gain their trust because he exposed the false British/Allied propaganda about bombing raid pictures. His sources are primary source unlike the propaganda historians you read.</p>

<p>&quot;If you copy a work, that&#39;s called plagiarism. But if you copy many different secondary sources that&#39;s called works cited&quot; - David Irving satirizing propaganda historians. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget about David Cole and Mark Webber. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNsbGKqjXcs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNsbGKqjXcs</a> They were really popular in the 90s. There was a Revisionist movement at the time that spread across campuses across the country starting debates about the Holocaust.</p>

<p>Now David Cole. He was extremely popular. Mostly because he himself was Jewish. You could call him the superstar of Revisionism. He took a tour of Auschwitz and got one of the curators to admit it was a Holohoax. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHzWo79dCHs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHzWo79dCHs</a></p>

<p>He was so popular in fact he was kidnapped and assaulted multiple times by the JDL. Luckily American JDL are more lenient than their European counterparts and don&#39;t immediately kill on sight. And so he had to go into hiding for 20 years. Along with him, the Revisionist movement quietly died down as the Holocaust propaganda machine known as Hollywood pumped out great works such as Schindlers List and Saving Private Ryan. Truly great emotional pieces of propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s just clear up a couple things before we continue the discussion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for scholars. How about the fucking Historian who wrote Hitler&#39;s Autobiography?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assume you mean biography.  Hitler is one of the most well-known individuals in human history.  There are literally <em>thousands</em> of biographies that have been written on Adolf Hitler, David Irving has written one of these.  I strongly urge you to go to a bookstore and buy any of the books that have been written about WW2 and read exactly what they say about the Holocaust.  You will not find Holocaust denial in almost <em>any</em> of these books.</p>

<p>A note about David Irving himself, in a civil court case he was found to have fabricated historical evidence to support his claims about the Holocaust.  He is not widely recognized as a credible source among his peers.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here&#39;s how WW2 started. 1939 Danzig Massacres.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This claim is incredibly ludicrous.  The Danzig massacres occurred two days <em>after</em> the German invasion of Poland.  Not only this but the massacres were perpetrated by Germans against Polish partisans.  Whether or not <em>you</em> choose to believe the motivations or actors behind the killings, the very fact that these events transpired <em>after</em> the invasion of Poland should be enough reason to dismiss them as <em>the sole cause</em> of WW2.  </p>

<p>I am not sure how familiar you are with the timeline of events leading up to WW2, but the enormous mobilization of the German military prior to 1939, the annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia, and Japanese and Italian invasions of Pacific Islands and Albania respectively should give you a clear indication that war was on the horizon for Germany well before September 1939.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So where&#39;s the evidence?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a large abundance of primary sources, but since you would like me to link you some, I can do so.  I have mentioned that we should not discount testimony from Nazi officers like Goebbels, Hoss, and Himmler. Here is just some so that you will not discount this.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Joseph Goebbels, Minister of Propoganda:
<em>February 14, 1942: &quot;The Führer once again expressed his determination to clean up the Jews in Europe pitilessly. There must be no squeamish sentimentalism about it. The Jews have deserved the catastrophe that has now overtaken them. Their destruction will go hand in hand with the destruction of our enemies. We must hasten this process with cold ruthlessness.</em></p></li>
<li><p>March 27, 1942: &quot;The procedure is a pretty barbaric one and not to be described here more definitely. Not much will remain of the Jews. On the whole it can be said that about 60 per cent of them will have to be liquidated whereas only 40 per cent can be used for forced labor.&quot; -Joseph Goebbels* </p></li>
<li><p>Interview of SS-Untersturmführer Dr. Hans Münch:
<em>Interviewer: Isn&#39;t the ideology of extermination contrary to a doctor&#39;s ethical values?</em>
<em>Münch: Yes, absolutely. There is no discussion. But I lived in that environment, and I tried in every possible way to avoid accepting it, but I had to live with it. What else could I have done? And I wasn&#39;t confronted with it directly until the order came that I and my superior and another one had to take part in the exterminations since the camp&#39;s doctors were overloaded and couldn&#39;t cope with it.</em>
<em>Interviewer: I must ask something. Doubters claim that &quot;special treatment&quot; could mean anything. It didn&#39;t have to be extermination.</em>
<em>Münch: &quot;Special treatment&quot; in the terminology of the concentration camp means physical extermination. If it was a question of more than a few people, where nothing else than gassing them was worthwhile, they were gassed.</em>
<em>Interviewer: &quot;Special treatment&quot; was gassing?</em>
<em>Münch: Yes, absolutely.</em></p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>So currently 300,000 is still the closest accurate number there is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely not.  Their are other sources that allow us to arrive at the number of between 5 and 6 millions Jews and 11 million total killed in the Holocaust.  Population statistics give us the most accurate measurement, but statistics about the number of casualties at each camp are also available.  Do you believe that this number was just made up?  How could a conspiracy even exist where 11 millions people are complicit?  What do you believe happened to these 11 millions people?  </p>

<p>I strongly urge you to read a book specifically about WW2.  You will find a much greater wealth of evidence in a book written by a historian and presented in a much clearer fashion than is done by me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the risk of going against the grain, I really am not seeing any evidence in this thread at all. Everyone&#39;s just posting links of random people <em>claiming</em> that there&#39;s a connection but failing to actually prove a connection. The most damning &quot;evidence&quot; is Israel&#39;s open policy of treating any wounded person left at Golan Heights. Not a lot to go on, especially considering that the area is held by anti-ISIS rebel groups. I mean, let&#39;s take OP&#39;s links as examples:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obama told you American Government trains and funds ISIS </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He misspeaks, then immediately corrects himself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CNN admits ISIS is an American Operation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The full line is &quot;US lead ISIS coalition&quot;. Another mistake when he clearly meant to say &quot;<em>anti</em>-ISIS coalition&quot;. The rest of the clip is about the US <em>fighting against</em> ISIS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Putin candidly explains who controls &quot;ISIS&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He explains that most of ISIS are just mercenaries. He says nothing about control, but does blame the US for creating a climate that caused them to rise up and for arming the &#39;civilized&#39; rebels who then turned face and joined ISIS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Deleted Reddit thread dedicated to ISIS-CIA connection</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not much more there than is already here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Israeli IDF Colonel captured Leading band of ISIS in Iraq</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...says the Iraqi forces as quoted by the Iranian government. You don&#39;t hear about it anywhere else, because there&#39;s literally nothing other than a small article on FarsNews.com to go on. No pictures of the guy, no interviews with the Iraqis who allegedly captured him, no discussions regarding his friends and family back in Israel. IDF ID numbers are <a href="http://blog.tapuz.co.il/kmusa/images/2784370_373.jpg">9 digits long</a> and have no letters, so the sentence &quot;with the security and military code of Re34356578765az231434&quot; makes no sense.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter if Mossad used the acronym ISIS back in the 90s. They are in fact ISIS right now. Of course names don&#39;t prove collusion.  There is hundreds of solid evidence that proves ISIS is a subsidiary of Mossad.  The name game is just a little inside joke/fact. But it is strange who called them ISIS in the first place. Did Islamic State or the media decide to call themselves that? What happened to ISIL? Why would they want to call themselves ISIS when it was used by Mossad before? Sometimes we will never know small details like this.</p>

<p>Also noteworthy that Hamas was an Israeli creation as well first designed to gain political influence over Palestine before they went rogue and decided to help their people. </p>

<p><strong>From 2006!</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Extremist elements increasingly use Syria as a base, while the SARG (ed: Syrian government) has taken some actions against groups stating links to Al-Qaeda. With the killing of the al-Qaida leader on the border with Lebanon in early December and the increasing terrorist attacks inside Syria culminating in the September 12 attack against the US embassy, the SARG,s policies in Iraq and support for terrorists elsewhere as well can be seen to be coming home to roost.</p>

<p>Possible Actions: — <strong>Publicize presence of transiting (or externally focused) extremist groups in Syria</strong>, not limited to mention of Hamas and PIJ. Publicize Syrian efforts against extremist groups in a way that suggests weakness, signs of instability, and uncontrolled blowback. The SARG,s argument (usually used after terror attacks in Syria) that it too is a victim of terrorism should be used against it to give greater prominence to increasing signs of instability within Syria. (emphasis added).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is my problem with this:</p>

<p>1)  Syria was already engaged in a civil war prior to the existence of ISIS.  ISIS was not the cause of the civil war. </p>

<p>2)  The U.S. has had numerous chances to depose Assad with strong international backing but has not done so.  (Remember President Obama&#39;s Red line speech regarding Assad&#39;s chemical weapon use?)</p>

<p>3)  The Syrian Civil War, instability in Syria and the deposition of Assad are counterproductive to U.S. goals in the Middle East.  The Syrian Civil war has put an enormous strain on the fledgling, U.S. backed Iraqi government, a government which the U.S. has spent billions of dollars creating.  Not only this, but the instability in Syria and Iraq has created a hotbed of terrorist violence that threatens (and already has) spilled over into the U.S. and other parts of the world.  It&#39;s safe to say that ISIS and other paramilitary groups in Syria that operate with impunity are great contributors to international terrorism.  Paris was just attacked by what are believed to be ISIS militants.</p>

<p>All of this means that it doesn&#39;t make much sense for the U.S. to be propping up ISIS.  Clearly it was possible to achieve the deposition of Assad without ISIS and on the U.S.&#39; own terms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I mean is that in an investigation, the first thing you do is study the evidence and see WHO it points at.  </p>

<p>Once <strong>&quot;The Who&quot;</strong> is established you look for reasons why <strong>&quot;The Who&quot;</strong> did it.  </p>

<p>We are at the first stage: Pin-pointing WHO is responsible for this ISIS/ISIL group.  That is the purpose of this thread.  <strong>The Media and the Government are in LOCK-STEP. Totally corrupt.</strong> The evidence that has been piling up in this thread for nearly 2 weeks has completely destroyed their paper-thin theory.  </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve already accepted the US-Israel joint role in creating ISIS and you&#39;re ready to move to &quot;motive&quot; - You should have just said that - and now I will offer some ideas for you:  </p>

<p>Maybe the US wants to destabilize <strong>Syria</strong> because it <strong>is an oil-rich nation</strong> and its leader isn&#39;t friendly to american businesses, the IMF, and american control.  </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Saudi Arabia = oil rich</strong>.  UK &amp; USA swooped in, funded the Saudi Royals, while teaching them how to get the oil;  they aren&#39;t good people - they&#39;re an oppressive regime - but they do what we say, so they get to stay.<br/></li>
<li><strong>Iran = oil rich</strong>.  We overthrew the democratically elected leader of Iran - he wasn&#39;t friendly to us. We installed a tyrant who butchered his own people who were brave enough to stand up and say: WE DIDN&#39;T ELECT YOU - WE DON&#39;T WANT YOU.<br/></li>
<li>We sealed off Cuba because they weren&#39;t friendly to our demands<br/></li>
<li><strong>Venezuela = Oil Rich</strong>. Hugo Chavez was demonized even though he had support of his own people. And he said many times he felt americans were hunting him.  He wasn&#39;t friendly to our demands.<br/></li>
<li>The US has a history of over-throwing leaders of foreign countries to suit the needs of a few at the top - the big businesses and Military Industrial Complex. Imagine if a man&#39;s wife died strangely and he had a history of killing his previous wives. Would you think that MAYBE he a hand in it ?<br/></li>
<li>Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey -- they are our satellite nations - maybe it&#39;d be nice to have the whole middle east doing our bidding.<br/></li>
<li>Israel has been lashing out at its neighbors since its inception - they justify it with: &quot;they don&#39;t like us and we&#39;re scared&quot; -- well guess what: Syria is not a friend of Israel - and that might be enough motivation to want a new leader in there if they can buddy up with Team America.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>Do your own research and see what you dig up. I&#39;d like to hear about it.  And might I suggest:  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to say that I disagree with you that ISIS is backed by the U.S. and Israel, but you bring up a point that I see very frequently in conspiracy threads that is apart from this:  that the &quot;The Media&quot; and &quot;The Government&quot; are colluding, are corrupt and pushing some agenda. </p>

<p>I want to ask:  Why do you believe this?  How is this even possible?  </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>&quot;The Media&quot;:</strong> When we think of &quot;The Media,&quot; news giants like CNN, CBS, NBC and FOX News come to mind.  Apart from the gripes that I have with these organizations, there are many other very reputable news agencies that report the same news.  In the U.S. we have newspapers like the LA Times, The New York Times, The Chicago Sun Times, and The Washington Post.  We have magazines like Time, Newsweek, and Foreign Affairs.  Are we to believe that these and the hundreds of other news outlets are all working in some kabal to keep the American public in the dark about real news?  </p>

<p>What about other global publications like Reuters, The Guardian, BBC, and The Economist?  Are they in on it too?  What about non-English language publications like El Pais, Al Jazeera, and El Monde?  Do all these news organizations which publish all of the same top headlines get orders from the U.S. government to push some agenda?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;The Government&quot;:</strong> The U.S. government consists of the local, state and federal government as I&#39;m sure you are aware.  The Federal government alone employs more than <em>4 million</em> personnel.  Are we to believe that all of these individuals are also part of some great kabal?  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are just some things that I find troubling with many conspiracies.  They rely on us assuming that large, often unrelated groups, work together maliciously without the knowledge of the general public.</p>

<p>What do you think about this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao, thanks? I know it sounds like i&#39;m making fun of conspiracies, but I&#39;m not. Just the people that can&#39;t be bothered to look at ALL (including MSM) of the media sources, not just their favorite anti-government blog. I like the idea of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></p>

<p>There are a shit load of rich and powerful people in this world that would like to stay that way. That is the simple part. The complicated part is figuring out just who is fucking over people and who is trying to help. </p>

<p>If people looked at things critically, did their own research, and formed their OWN opinions, then maybe this sub and conspiracy theorists in general wouldn&#39;t be viewed as such a big joke by most of reddit and regular people. </p>

<p>I agree with the general sentiment of &quot;lots of powerful people are evil motherfuckers&quot; but if anyone is ever going to fix it people really need to try harder when it comes to reading, discussing, analyzing, collaborating etc... </p>

<p>No, I shouldn&#39;t have. I stand by my original post by saying I was skeptical, as to me that&#39;s good enough to show that the OP just pasted a link which presented a claim that hasn&#39;t been picked up by other media outlets. In other words, I didn&#39;t believe it, but you&#39;re replying to my post with such vehemence that you really confuse me. It&#39;s like having two guys on the same side agreeing, yet one of them (you) attacks his ally.   </p>

<p>If you have a complaint then take it up with <a href="/u/PhilosopherofFreedom">/u/PhilosopherofFreedom</a> since he created the thread topic! Go on, talk to him, and start your complaints to him, <strong>NOT ME!!!!!</strong>  </p>

<p>Based on your post history, you sure do get a lot of downvotes for your over hostile approach to &quot;conversing&quot; with others. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I just checked your post history, <strong><em>and not once did you post a complaint to the OP</em></strong> of this thread topic about the lack of evidence or source material to back-up the posted link about the Israeli colonel! Instead of targeting my post (which I wasn&#39;t even supporting his claim that there was an Israeli colonel!), go do some work for a change and reply directly to the OP!! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The exploitation of chaos for financial and strategic gain. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxHEI603bF4">video</a> exposes the blatant implementation of routine groundwork in Iraq, that created the necessary climate of instability needed for ISIS&#39;s creation. This fascinating investigative story is the precursor to the situation today, highlighting the blatancy with which yet another administration continued in a line of dozens; implementing in Iraq verbatim a murky neocololnial strategy employed all around the globe today. So specifically in fact, that the same exact individuals who were sent to El Salvador under Regan as &quot;Advisors&quot; to create death squads, we&#39;re brought out of retirement and sent into fragile post Sadam Iraq to train the newly created &quot;Iraqi security force&quot;. An empowered and US armed Shia minority which would follow in Salvador&#39;s bloody torturous steps. In this way we play both sides, a design for contagious endless war. In this case one in which it is clear that a volatile Sunni reaction (ISIS) could have only been the only expected reaction. </p>

<p>From what i understand, the US arms and pays rebel groups to conduct operations. When these rebel groups/mercenaries find someone else that pays them more, they join them. In this case, the mercenaries joined ISIS. Thus, the U.S. is indirectly causing ISIS to grow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>[There is] a hidden “deep state” that influences and often opposes official U.S. policies. Prominent political analyst Peter Dale Scott begins by tracing America’s increasing militarization, restrictions on constitional rights, and income disparity since the Vietnam War.<br/>
  He argues that a significant role in this historic reversal was the intervention of a series of structural deep events, ranging from the assassination of President Kennedy to 9/11. He does not attempt to resolve the controversies surrounding these events, but he shows their significant points in common, ranging from overlapping personnel and modes of operation to shared sources of funding.      Behind all of these commonalities is what Scott calls the deep state: a second order of government, behind the public or constitutional state, that has grown considerably stronger since World War II. He marshals convincing evidence that the deep state is partly institutionalized in non-accountable intelligence agencies like the CIA and NSA, but it also includes private corporations like Booz Allen Hamilton and SAIC, to which 70 percent of intelligence budgets are outsourced.<br/>
Behind these public and private institutions is the traditional influence of Wall Street bankers and lawyers, allied with international oil companies beyond the reach of domestic law. With the importance of Gulf states like Saudi Arabia to oil markets, American defense companies, and Wall Street itself, this essential book shows that there is now a supranational deep state, sometimes demonstrably opposed to both White House policies and the American public interest.</p>

<p>I disagree because I think these tactics are used purposely to decay the &#39;breaking world view&#39; process by focusing on the physical or &#39;real&#39; evidence. The longer it takes for people to &#39;wake up&#39; the longer the world power structure can subsist. The quickest way to &#39;wake up&#39; is for one to realise the absurd nature of their existence and to stop blocking out thoughts that address metaphysical questions. With the right mindset, you can unravel it all in a couple hours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, from the links you provided, there isn&#39;t much compelling evidence. The first one was Obama misspeaking, which I guess you can argue was a Freudian slip, but it&#39;s not like that is concrete evidence. The second one was someone referring to the US-led ISIL coalition, which is pretty clearly referring to the US-led coalition AGAINST ISIL. I mean, he was talking about an accidental conflict between Russia and the coalition. If Russia were to strike ISIL, that would not be accidental at all, since Russia is backing Assad, so I think it&#39;s safe to say with that context he meant the anti-ISIL coalition. The third video is just Putin talking, which I don&#39;t understand why you take his word as evidence. The cartoon you linked is literally just a cartoon. What is that evidence of? The last link is to a report that is from FNA, an incredibly shoddy source. This is the same agency that portrayed a satirical report from The Onion about Ahmadinejad polling in the US as fact, and reported that the US is controlled by tall white aliens. If you believe that is a reliable source then you are not a rational person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I&#39;m not, I&#39;m saying you could make the argument, but it&#39;s not convincing. </p>

<p>Again, this is not what I am doing. I am taking the context in which the words were spoken and determining what was obviously meant. Also, CNN didn&#39;t say anything, a Washington Post columnist being interviewed on CNN said something.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even saying Putin is wrong, I just don&#39;t understand why you use his word as evidence as though he isn&#39;t a corrupt politician. I could link you to speeches of Obama making all sorts of claims that you would not take as evidence, so why is it different for Putin?</p>

<p>As far as FNA is concerned, I&#39;m calling into question the reliability of a source, which has proven itself to be unreliable time and time again. They&#39;re the ones making these claims, yet provide zero proof and have no reputable news agencies corroborating the claim. </p>

<p>This is supposed to be an evidence thread, no? I think you have a misunderstanding of what evidence is if you think that cartoon is relevant.</p>

<p>If you think critical thinking is mental gymnastics, then I don&#39;t know what to say. I will gladly accept actual evidence and change my point of view accordingly. Having shifts in your point of view is only unnerving if you are an ideologue who consistently forces pieces of junk evidence to fit, just because they align with the way you currently see the world. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not even saying you&#39;re wrong here, I&#39;m not really interested in getting into a debate about that. All I&#39;m saying is that you have not provided any sufficient pieces of evidence that come close to proving your claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you missed the point I was making. I don&#39;t think the claim should be outright rejected, but you can&#39;t pass it off as fact without a satisfactory amount of evidence. OP is making the claim that the US is directly funding ISIS to fight a proxy war for them in the middle east. The evidence he provided for this was two YouTube videos that can easily be explained by slips of the tongue. Another piece was of a cartoon made by someone who shares his views. Another was of a leader of a rival political nation making claims that paint the US in a poor light. And finally a link to an uncorroborated story from an unreliable source. </p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not trying to claim the US foreign policy is for the good of humanity, freedom and democracy, or that they have never done anything immoral for the sake of their own interest. My point was solely to point out the flaws in the pieces of evidence that he presented. I could be wrong and Obama actually calls Baghdadi weekly for status reports. But I&#39;m not going to accept that as truth based on the flimsy evidence that OP has presented. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I have said repeatedly now, I am not making a claim that OP is wrong, I am trying to explain why that evidence is terrible. It&#39;s like if this were a thread about global warming evidence, and OP linked to a picture with a drawing of the Earth with a fever, and then claimed that as evidence of global warming. I accept global warming as fact, but I would still call OP out for providing something as &quot;evidence&quot; when it is not. </p>

<p>The same applies here. The US does some shady shit all over the world. They have propped up dictators, funded coups, and violated other nation&#39;s sovereignty all for their own interests. Hell, they&#39;re allies with Saudi Arabia who lives under similar Islamic law as ISIS. I would say that the US funding ISIS at least indirectly is guaranteed after many reports(from actual reputable news agencies) have come out showing how once funded FSA fighters switched alliances to fight for ISIS, or of all the weapons ISIS has stolen from defeated Iraqi soldiers. So it really would not surprise me at all if there was evidence for OP &#39;s claim. But that doesn&#39;t mean you should accept the evidence he provided just because it backs up your claim. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the problem with this sub, it has so much potential, but it has devolved into people upvoting anything that supports their own ideology, no matter how flimsy the evidence provided is. Instead of fostering actual discussion about the validity of said evidence, you get downvoted if you challenge it and don&#39;t go along with the hive mind. I really don&#39;t see how the people here are any better than the so-called &quot;sheeple&quot; who get their news from CNN and other mainstream sources. The only difference here is people assume that if it isn&#39;t mainstream it must be true. And that&#39;s about as far as the critical thinking goes on this sub.</p>
