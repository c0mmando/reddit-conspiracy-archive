    <div class="md"><p>Proper Christians know that everyone is guilty. Guilty of at least breaking God&#39;s law. Especially when you consider that all men are your neighbors since we all come from Adam. So while I can&#39;t be certain the race of the people Jesus healed, I would have to guess that they weren&#39;t all white. Also, Jesus said to give to Caesar what is Caesar&#39;s. Therefor, creating and supporting a clandestine organization with express intent on undermining the governing body it operates under isn&#39;t exactly doing that... You have every right to want things to be better for you and your own. Please do not make the mistake of believeling that advantage comes to you at the disadvantage of others. If there is anything I have learned from God, it is that our destinies, all of them, are intertwined.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I am guessing you consider time to be a figment of imagination... Gravity too I suppose. And light for that matter since it has never told me anything and I have never held it. Maybe I should worship inanimate objects since they are &quot;more real&quot;.  I am wondering, since you didn&#39;t tell me but expect me to know... Which of your laws did I break? I certainly didn&#39;t mean you or any of your loved ones any personal disrespect... I just have a fairly strong drive to follow God&#39;s directives for uniting humanity under his banner, and I don&#39;t think that touting innocence is what will bring us all together.</p>

<p>Oh, just realized you are not the original person I was responding too... So I have a couple quick questions for you... Did the concept for a wheel originate in the mind of a human or the mind of God? Or are you willing to admit that the wheel was a figment before it was actualized? Are you really so cemented to this plane of existence that you think that nothing exists beyond it? Do you think reddit or the internet would be possible without conceptualizing imaginary numbers or intangible concepts? Are you aware that even when we begin to crunch the numbers about our own brains, the concepts become staggeringly imaginary because of the <a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2011/mar/10-numbers-the-nervous-system">number of connected synapses we have?</a> or to ask you more accurately, do you even have an imagination?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;And I am guessing...&quot;</p>

<p>And you&#39;re doing it without any sort of scientific process. That&#39;s my law That&#39;s you broke. It&#39;s a law of most scientists, from physicists to doctors to architects and engineers to biologists to astrologists to geologists to historians and so on.</p>

<p>Aside from all those things you listed having some sort of scientific logic backing them up, they all have very few characteristics compared to the hundreds god does, some of it&#39;s effects can be scientifically proven and attributed to a not completely understood thing, and scientists agree on these attributes and are trying to use science and reasoning to further their understanding before calling theory fact.</p>

<p>Another law you broke was telling me I&#39;m controlled by a despot, backing a despot, and falsely accusing me of a crime that you claim I inherited from my incestuous ancestors from a few thousand years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like you said, I don&#39;t know you, and I wouldn&#39;t presume to tell you who controls you, or whether you operate by your own free will. And about my scientific method... Guessing based on a body of evidence is the best any scientist ever does. Just because most scientists are too afraid or jaded to touch the God Theory doesn&#39;t mean that a body of evidence does not exist. And the surprising thing about that body of evidence is that it seems to support both sides. Imho, this would indicate that there is a mind-bending reality that nearly nobody is capable of comprehending. And to think that I called your ancestors incestuous... Or that your ancestors are even any different than mine... You misunderstand my beliefs I suppose, and you have broken no laws in doing so. While I have my own doubts that your innocence remains in tact, I personally have my issues with the &#39;original sin&#39; concept. I believe everything you do is between you and God, and my part only comes into your life where yours and God&#39;s will meet. And I think innocence is lost at some point in just living in this world and being influenced by the evil in it. It is fairly obvious, to me at least, that we have been given free will in this life as humans, and that we have critical choices to make that determine who we are moment by moment. Please do not misunderstand my line of questioning for you. I simply strive to encourage your own self-analysis, because once again, we don&#39;t know each other, and no person knows you better than yourself. I truly hope you can see that I don&#39;t mean to use reddit to blame people of any wrong doing, but rather to encourage them to be better versions of themselves whom I already love. If there is any flawed beast that posts on this thread, to my knowledge, it is me. Beyond that, I don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe I said that I don&#39;t know you or you don&#39;t know me. That wouldn&#39;t matter. I&#39;m making an argument against your points, not against you. And you are so full of shit. Several versions of the scientific method have been used to try to prove god or even create an accurately theory, and none of them get us to any version of God written in any religious text. He is the hypocrit of all hypocrits, and his books are chalk full of continuity errors and paradoxes. What kind of poor upbringing did you come from? I don&#39;t care how much you love anyone if you&#39;re that irrational. (Don&#39;t get me wrong, the opposite is just as bad. I hate sociopaths too.)</p>

<p>P.s. in case you want to know...I was born and raised Catholic. I went to Catholic school in new Jersey, and it was the best school I&#39;m the area even though it was religious. Not once did they prove anything to me or even come close to making me believe. In fact, because it was such a good school I grew further and further away from religion as it taught me more about everything else. Eventually I moved and went to a public middle and high school. Then I studied religion and religious ideology and symbology in college where I also became a member of mensa. So, I&#39;m a collegiate with a genius iq who has studied religion extensively. Those are my credentials.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow! You must really understand theology and the inner workings of quite a few more religions than me. Which I think is cool. You will probably also understand better than most one of my adopted tenets. Religion is a set of rules made by man. I apologize for assuming so much about you. Why did you choose to study religion so extensively? I realize this can be a complex answer, but I am absolutely interested. I am with you that organized religion, all of them, exist in this world and so carry the weight of operating in a morally and logically murky system. Also it is absolutely understandable that you likely don&#39;t want to waste time on anything that does not have your best interest in mind, or something completely imaginary. Indeed, in this minute timeframe and with our own limited perspectives, the ensuing chaos and paradoxical order of the universe can appear unrelentingly horrible and inhumane, confoundingly mundane and incessantly diverse, but you do not know that there is not some kind of universal safety net that catches everyone... Aborted babies, rich anhedonic executives, homeless vagrants, adulerous nihilists and humble monks alike. We don&#39;t know if when we die, some entity doesn&#39;t appear before us, to reveal to us every single truth and then asks us to decide on whether or not we accept them. Eloheim. God is plural, and the big lie probably wasn&#39;t that you could become God, but that you could possibly extrucate yourself from God, which you will forever always be a part of... But perhaps in our lives you have the ability of choice to seperate from that collective. I am abolutely full of shit, but like all shit, it is rich with unharnessed  nutrients, living entities, and probably a couple tasty nuggets, so you enjoy that imagery... I can tell you think I am uneducated, impoverished and dull witted, since you asked me what kind of poor background I came from. See, thats a rhetorical question, which you apparently assumed all of my previous questions were, even though none of them assumed anything about you. Ah hypocrits. Hypocrates said that to do nothing is sometimes a good remedy. Allow me to be a hypocrit by doing something and giving you this advice then. People shouldn&#39;t rely on prayer alone, but should put a hand into the things they request during prayer. And if you want to be blessed with religious revelations, you might want to be a bit more religious... But then opinions are only going to lead to ignorance, and so science instead will build your intellect. In good time, I am sure you can heal your relationship with the cosmos, but do not let the opportunity pass you by.</p>

<p>P.S. I stole all that advice from Hypocrates, so you can take it or leave it.</p>

<p>Also, intelligent design is <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7111/box/443521a_BX1.html">old hat science</a>. Get with the program... Not a single study... <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7111/full/443521a.html">1</a><a href="http://m.aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/05/15/aobpla.plv050.short">2</a><a href="http://m.livescience.com/49958-theory-no-big-bang.html">3</a><a href="http://m.sciencemag.org/content/296/5569/892.short">4</a> my point being that we have inherited a self-organizing, possibly infinitely old system and been given living bodies to study things. And I am sure you are familiar with the tenet, since you studied religious symbology, &#39;as above, so below&#39;. So if you&#39;d like to see God smarter, more altruistic and less harsh, perhaps you nee to calm down, be a nicer person, and go finish your degree. Your time spent studying will never be recognized as credentials otherwise. Oh, and one last quote since I meant what I said. </p>

<p>&quot;Well, love is insanity. The ancient Greeks knew that. It is the taking over of a rational and lucid mind by delusion and self-destruction. You lose yourself, you have no power over yourself, you can&#39;t even think straight.&quot; - Marilyn French. Science has <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/stop-walking-eggshells/201501/the-thin-line-between-love-and-hate">proven</a> that we turn off a part ofour brain when we love (the part that judges), and that there is a strong connection between loving and hating... So it should come as no suprise that judgemental thinking will seldom lead to love, but will likely appear more logical while leading you down a road of bitterness. It should also come as no suprise that God has done some crazy stuff along the way here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like you. I know I haven&#39;t shown it but you talk well and bring up interesting and intelligent ideas and articles. </p>

<p>What I still have a problem with, and always will, is calling the cosmos, the unknown physics or origin of the universe God. </p>

<p>Another problem I have is the fools argument of, &quot;you can&#39;t prove god.&quot; &quot;you can&#39;t disprove god.&quot;  You can replace god with all sorts of stuff; heaven, a soul, vampires, Spiderman, esp, global warming, some with better reasoning than others. Yeah, it&#39;s impossible to proven that something doesn&#39;t exist, but if you can&#39;t prove it exists you shouldn&#39;t assume it does, and having nothing but the words of other people is not enough to solicit belief, and especially not faith.</p>

<p>I definitely believe its things greater than humans and unknown science. I still can&#39;t rationalize a biblical God, and I don&#39;t believe anything not the biblical God should be referenced by name as such.</p>

<p>And love, man, I don&#39;t get enough of it. All I get is these vampires and blood suckers. All I see is these niggas I made millionaires, milling about spilling their feelings I&#39;m the air. All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs trying to draw blood from my ice cold veins.</p>

<p>The world would be perfect if everyone loved everyone and we all put others before us. You know, don&#39;t judge, help. And it&#39;s better together have billions look out for you than just one. But that is unreasonably idealistic.I wish it were possible and even though it&#39;s a fools errand I still would like that to be my end goal. I feel like affiliating those ideals with religion or any definition of god weakens the cause. Make everyone believe that good morals are a smart rationality thing and they will try to be smart. Telling then do it or an almight despot will punish you brings no sincere commitments, and indoctrination is inhibative of intellect, reasoning skills, and imagination.</p>

<p>Anyway, I took those courses because I was a history major and I still am a history buff. All mythology is important to history. And it&#39;s interesting historically and philosophically. As above so below is a topic I&#39;ve had a few awesome philosophical discussions about. I believe it just means that everything is an idea before it is physical, and that the purest form of a thing IS the original idea of it, beacus the physical is just a copy of the idea, and any ideas that come from the physical are copies of a copy. Andy the party that&#39;s important form the religious aspect is that God existed before the idea of him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it is certainly all conjecture! And while a biblical god is one that exists only in pages, the real God, being totally unfathomable, is rarely seen inside the box. I get your notions that you can&#39;t rely on conjecture or hearsay to establish your personal beliefs. That is an absolutely admirable trait, though it still behooves most to adopt a culture and get on with life rather than flap about flailing for a method through trial and error... I prefer making my own methods, but I really like your point that mythology is important... Stories, even the most false ones, contain knowledge and ideas worth playing out at least in some scenario in your head. For me, I first had death smirking inches from my nose many times as a kid... Cause I was crazy. But also, I needed to know just like you. And I realized that all I could truly do would be to eliminate the most absurd options. Surprisingly, and I am a very rational and scientific minded person who studied the subject extensively, wanting to find certainty about the matter only lead to more uncertainty in my own mind. I can&#39;t say that my search was truly exhaustive, but I came from a few points that I had to seriously level with myself to make the leap... I can&#39;t do the logic in my head any justice through words though. To put it as succintly as possible, the probability that you exist is either infintismally small, or exactly 1:1... Either way the implications are profound to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean just because someone (kkk) has different morals and beliefs than you or i may have does not make them guilty of anything.  Think about like this...say you great grandpa was a klansmen and it was just past down your grandpa then your dad and then to you.  Thats what you would think is the &quot;right&quot; belief system. Just because you were raised into it does not make you guilty of a crime. Everyone can belive as they want or put on hoods and dresses and burn a cross doesn&#39;t make em guilty of shit but being  an ignorant, poorly educated person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying that it&#39;s not immoral to look down on someone because of their race? Or that its ok to do something just because you were raised that way? Everyone is responsible for themself at some point, even if they are unlucky enough to be raised by bigots, wasps or zionists. I feel sorry for these people who are guilty of being immoral by slandering races and purposefully remaining ignorant. </p>

<p>I am not saying it should be illegal to do. Freedom of speech is important. Even the parts of speech the government claims aren&#39;t protected by the constitution are protected by the constitution. The racism still makes you a shitty person that I wouldn&#39;t talk to, wouldn&#39;t give a job to, vote for, hire, ect., and I would tell everyone has ignorant and racism you were.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and they can&#39;t go to jail or pay fines for it, and that&#39;s how it should be. However, they can be ridiculed and shunned by their peers. That&#39;s most people expressing their beliefs through their freedoms.  I suggest looking into philosophy on the difference between moral, ethical, and legal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No in actuality the kkk people probaly have higher.morals than you or i.  They are just different morals and ethics.  Are you willing to kill someone over your morlas.  Im not.  But the Kkk sure are.  So its easily understood that they have higher moral values but they are different morals.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole KKK thing sounds kind of like troll psyop to me. I mean think about it, today in the US they are dealing with a fascist corporate oligarchy of 50 incorporated states calling itself the united states, and they are unlawfully positioned all over the worm, and a hacker group is going to publish the list of KKK Klansmen? I mean... are the down-south country type white nationalists really the main figureheads behind the global shadow government and agenda 21? I think some of the trillionaires in Saudi Arabia and China have something to do with all this too, not just old racist white guys. Although I am sure there is a lot of overlap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and yes. Maybe it&#39;s a limited hangout and red herring. Like there is someone else who is part of it NOT being leaked... so when the list is leaked it proves this person is not kkk and saves them face. Just speculating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truth is they had planned for this from the beginning. They owned the server, so they added a bunch of &quot;race traitors&quot; into the roster of KKK members. Just to make the whole liberal snake eat itself. Part of the reason they wanted to &quot;verify&quot; it. A. k. A. only implicate people they felt deserved it (because they didn&#39;t know any of them personally).</p>

<p>Remember KKK members might be different from you, but they are still painfully aware of their lot in life, and likely planned for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it is certainly all conjecture! And while a biblical god is one that exists only in pages, the real God, being totally unfathomable, is rarely seen inside the box. I get your notions that you can&#39;t rely on conjecture or hearsay to establish your personal beliefs. That is an absolutely admirable trait, though it still behooves most to adopt a culture and get on with life rather than flap about flailing for a method through trial and error... I prefer making my own methods, but I really like your point that mythology is important... Stories, even the most false ones, contain knowledge and ideas worth playing out at least in some scenario in your head. For me, I first had death smirking inches from my nose many times as a kid... Cause I was crazy. But also, I needed to know just like you. And I realized that all I could truly do would be to eliminate the most absurd options. Surprisingly, and I am a very rational and scientific minded person who studied the subject extensively, wanting to find certainty about the matter only lead to more uncertainty in my own mind. I can&#39;t say that my search was truly exhaustive, but I came from a few points that I had to seriously level with myself to make the leap... I can&#39;t do the logic in my head any justice through words though. To put it as succintly as possible, the probability that you exist is either infintismally small, or exactly 1:1... Either way the implications are profound to me.</p>
