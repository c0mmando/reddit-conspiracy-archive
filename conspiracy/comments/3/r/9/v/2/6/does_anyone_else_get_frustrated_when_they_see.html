I feel like it&#39;s its own flavor of digital mind control, second maybe to the phenomenon of internet memes as a way of forming and influencing public thought. Snopes is often thrown around on facebook posts (sometimes rightfully) as this means of proving to someone that what they posted was a hoax or that &quot;that is a conspiracy THEORY, here loook, snopes says it&#39;s untrue!&quot;</p>

<p>Do we know who truly owns and operates Snopes, aside from this &quot;husband and wife who just are really into fact checking&quot;. I don&#39;t know if sites are equally as susceptible to fascistic corporatized media consolidation as it&#39;s been for television and other digital media. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for helping to arrest my rap(b)id descent.  These people apparently haven&#39;t seen this epic, and damning video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PY9dpyoiDU">Chomsky--Academic Gatekeeper from Corbett Report</a>.  If they did, they&#39;d get seriously mad.</p>

<p>Keep in mind. I was a <em>&#39;chombie&#39;</em> myself, or rather as I saw myself, a <em>skeptic of the american political landscape</em> and fan of Chomsky&#39;s for &gt;2 decades.  This video was the atom bomb of my fandom.</p>

<p>His attitude about 9/11 truth is anti-science, anti-intellectual, anti-progress, suppressive, sypathetic of the same establishment he&#39;s complained about in his numerous books, puzzlingy defensive, mean and condescending to those asking his opinion on the subject in earnest.  He is awful to 911 truth people, claiming, &quot;they read on the internet for an hour and think they are experts&quot;.</p>

<p>First of all I have a college education in science--I know well more than Chomsky on that subject.  So I&#39;m disgusted when he says, &quot; nanothermite, whatever the hell that is.  I don&#39;t know, and you don&#39;t either&quot;, I have to say, that&#39;s the dumbest thing Chomsky has ever said.  It&#39;s as if someone pressed a manchurian candidate remote agent button and suddenly Chomsky turns into a Fox News Anchor asshole.</p>

<p>Secondly, I&#39;ve spent hundreds of hours over the last decade and a half trying to understand 911 from every angle including the official story.  If my dubiousness still persists because there are real problems by my own scientific calculations, those should be respected.  </p>

<p>Noam&#39;s glib, psychopathic response, &quot;who cares anyway [about jfk, 911], get over it&quot;</p>

<p>This is gatekeeper talk.  It means he&#39;s mindcontrolled now and actively opposing the crusade for truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given that he is an intellectual revered for his engaging, high attention, high logic analyses of complex world events, for him to miss the numerous, numerous, numerous problems of 9/11 and dismiss them as utter nonsense is surely a fraud he&#39;s perpetrating against his audience, and <em>against culture generally</em>.   So, no, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s even remotely possible he &quot;simply made a mistake&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just one thing.  It&#39;s anti-conspiracy attitude. He said the same about JFK.  Watch the &#39;meet chomsky academic gatekeeper&#39;</p>

<p>It&#39;s an attitude of spinelessness when it comes to things that matter. Keep in mind, Chomky has the attention of millions, so his thoughts and words matter.  As a leader in the field of cultural thought, he has responsibility to the truth, but is rarely being accountable to it.</p>

<p>If you dismiss these big events that are done against the people as &#39;unimportant&#39; what you are really saying is, &quot;more please&quot;</p>

<p>Chomsky is an <em>enabler of wrongdoing</em> is my point.</p>

<p><a href="/u/FREETHOUGHTSOPEN">/u/FREETHOUGHTSOPEN</a>, I wrote that page about Dylann Roof. From the perspective of rumor/folklore, the tenor of the rumor was that Roof was given special treatment. Having reviewed all the extant reporting available before the story became sensationalized, it seemed pretty clear he was likely fed the easiest thing due to the fact prisoners in custody but not arranged may not yet be provided for in terms of meals. </p>

<p>As I noted in the article, police officers likely wanted to ensure no procedural complaints (&quot;my client was starved!&quot;) arose while Roof was in custody but not charged. Unless we&#39;re assuming police in Charleston secretly supported Roof, it seems the most reasonable to believe bringing food in for him was the simplest option. Until a person is formally arrested and charged, they are cooperating with police. </p>

<p>But people writing in asked if he was &quot;taken to&quot; Burger King, and it was clear that the impression given by somewhat sensational articles was that he was treated exceptionally, which is not very plausible. </p>

<p>Thanks :) Before I started working for the site, I&#39;m pretty sure it was primarily submissions. Snopes (the person) has an assistant who reads site mail, and she would keep track of which questions were coming in a lot, and then Snopes would investigate/write it. </p>

<p>Me and another writer started working for the site in August of last year, and we also get a lot of topics from emails. Sometimes we see stuff on Reddit. Or Twitter. Or in the Facebook group. But what takes priority is stuff people ask a lot. Like tonight, I did a page on a FB gift exchange that is popular. It was kind of a less-interesting topic, but we got dozens of emails. So a variety of sources, but primarily people who contact us and say &quot;hey, can you tell me if this is real or not?&quot;</p>

<p>I was nowhere near a site employee on or around 9/11, but I was an active board member. Bear in mind, 9/11 is the event that sort of changed the site from a niche folklore discussion forum to a more well-known rumors page. And for two weeks the board was inaccessible. (I live on LI, so it was also local and of interest to me from a personal and folklore perspective.)</p>

<p>Anyway, 9/11 rumors were then this sort of new phenomenon. ULs to that point generally were more of the classic variety, and suddenly they were spreading everywhere. Snopes really changed nearly overnight at that point, from my recall as a Snopes board member and not working for the site. So rumors were really addressed as they came in, and the deeper conspiracy stuff came later. </p>

<p>If we encounter a rumor we can&#39;t really flesh out, and it&#39;s going to be undetermined, sometimes we don&#39;t bother. It isn&#39;t that we avoid the topic, it&#39;s just that it&#39;s really pointless to say &quot;we don&#39;t have anything substantive on this topic.&quot; Or if something has been meaningfully addressed elsewhere, we might skip it. Plenty of old, sometimes 9/11-era stuff comes up and if we don&#39;t have a page, I&#39;ll run it by David and ask if he thinks it&#39;s worth doing. If we can ADD to the rumor by organizing what is known and proveable, we do. What are some of the top ten missing? I might know offhand if we a) have it somewhere and it&#39;s just hard to find b) be able to find out if it was ever sent in or c) find out why it never got a page. Sometimes I&#39;ll ask David&#39;s assistant about an older rumor and she&#39;ll say &quot;oh, that one has been going around since February 2005, we just never got to it.&quot; </p>

<p>Another resource is the message board- plenty of also-ran rumors were posted there by Snopes or one of the mods but never developed into pages for a variety of reasons (primarily that one to two people can only write so many pages). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is this just not a conspiracy theory you guys want to touch? Or have I completely missed the section on it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In all the years I&#39;ve been a board member and then worked for the site, there&#39;s never been anything forbidden to publish/touch. On the boards, I vocally objected to the 9/11 commission- some of the most skeptical skeptics could have called me a LIHOP 9/11 truther.  I didn&#39;t think it was a conspiracy, but I did think it was a compromised investigation. And I still work for Snopes, so there you go. I said this earlier, but most folklore types are fascinated by conspiracy and speculation as you guys. It&#39;s why I&#39;m sitting here talking to you on Reddit when I could be in bed or browsing <a href="/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix">/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix</a> :)</p>

<p>Sorry, so the short answer to your question is that if we can&#39;t give a good answer to a topic from a substantive perspective, we might not address it. But the reason some rumors might be missing from the 9/11 section that are now popular is that they weren&#39;t at the time 9/11 rumors were dominating submissions. They may have been rumors that developed around the time other rumors were popular (like Katrina) and might not have generated a lot of emailed questions. They might be more niche rumors that never got to us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the detailed reply! Although I have to admit, I am disappointed with your explanation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to say that even the most basic 9/11 conspiracy claims are absent from your site (WTC7, explosives, pre-knowledge, etc). These aren&#39;t &quot;niche rumors&quot; that never got to you. These claims have been at the forefront of the conspiracy theory since the beginning. </p>

<p>I would think that a site like snopes.com would be all over this event, especially considering the impact it had on your traffic/success (as you said). So what gives?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Informally, I can give you my opinion of it. I can even ask David if we could somehow make an article out of it- but it would be hard to make it relevant.</p>

<p>With WTC7 (and the few 9/11 questions we get even now), the thing is ... how can we tell you what actually happened? It isn&#39;t restricted, forbidden, proscribed, or anything. It&#39;s just ... how the fuck can I really speak to how WTC7 collapsed? It&#39;s weird. Do I think it&#39;s a conspiracy? No. Do I think that it&#39;s information to which I likely don&#39;t have access? Perhaps. But if you want to ask a question like why jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams, I can&#39;t answer that because that is a really training specific question.</p>

<p>I can tell you if Barack Obama told a German audience that he wants to install a NWO (no) but I can&#39;t really speak to the thermodynamic considerations of 9/11. Not because I&#39;m forbidden from doing so, and again, I can give you freestyle answers. But the big questions are likely for engineers and scientists, not me. </p>

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

<p>Also, whatever <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> wants to ask or if you know of uncovered content on which I can find material enough to make a page out of, I&#39;ll always be open to that. In January, I addressed an ancient conspiracy theory about MLK Jr. Not because it was previously forbidden, just that we just got around to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Good question. The event was a strange example of this new intersection of digital info-sharing and a huge immediate catastrophe. So it was the first time people really were finding info and sending it in the way we do now on social media. To that point, rumors didn&#39;t really occur so <em>urgently</em>. But during 9/11 it was different- for me anyway, I live on Long Island and I was in Ireland at the time. We were all in different ways desperate for more information, and for my own self, a primary frustration in Ireland was not being able to get <em>accurate</em> information. Information just began spreading at a crazy rate, much of that inaccuracy (sorry) birthing what would later become conspiracy. But the role of Snopes then was clarifying immediate rumors- did someone surf down debris? Did they find a pocket of living firefighters? Was there gold under the WTC? The Loose Change type stuff was really more out of our purview, since we weren&#39;t 9/11 specialists. It just dominated folklore for a good few years. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>We do. I used that status yesterday. But it&#39;s our least favorite status and only used when we don&#39;t have information to validate a claim. If we published a page that said WTC7 purportedly was brought down by a controlled demolition and then marked it undetermined, it would really serve no purpose. If there was a popular rumor it was firebombed by Dick Cheney in a black helicopter, we could probably mark it false. But what I am really trying to pinpoint here is how this discussion could be a page. What is the rumor? That it was a controlled demolition?</p>

<p>I would even go so far as to say (because we do get the odd &quot;was 9/11 an inside job?&quot; email) that if there is credible evidence relating to 9/11 that has yet to be released, it&#39;s not going to come from me. We have fantastic investigative reporters like Glenn Greenwald, whistleblowers like Edward Snowden, and plenty of people working the general beat of military/war/Pentagon leaks. All these questions:</p>

<blockquote>

&quot;WTC buildings 1, 2, and 7 were all demolished using some form of pre-planted explosives.&quot;

&quot;There was strong evidence of insider trading prior to 9/11, which the 9/11 Commission did not address.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are ones that would be best addressed by people who spend their whole entire lives doing hard reporting on this topic and this topic alone. It is not going to ever be settled on a Snopes page, because it&#39;s way out of the scope of the site. Finding out whether anyone surfed down the debris is folklore, finding out whether Cheney fudged the 9/11 commission is really more a job for Jeremy Scahill. We are folklorists, <em>that</em> is our scope. </p>

<p>Edit: If you want to establish credibility among folks like us, would you be interested in doing an AMA here on r/conspiracy?</p>

<p>People have asked me to do an AMA before, and I&#39;ve replied that I think David ought to do a general AMA at some point (so I wouldn&#39;t want to detract from that). For r/conspiracy, I wouldn&#39;t mind doing a casual AMA if people wanted that (with the understanding I may not be privy to all the answers to questions people might ask). However, I also don&#39;t want to annoy the members of this sub by openly espousing traditionally skeptical views, nor am I quite sure what I could offer in terms of useful information to anyone here :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. After looking at your website more, it does appear that you write about &quot;folklore&quot; more than the kinds of issues we talk about here. </p>

<p>However, I don&#39;t think you should hide behind some arbitrary requirement to be an &quot;expert&quot; or &quot;specialist&quot; on any topic to have an opinion. I&#39;d imagine you aren&#39;t an expert on debris surfing 1st responders, but you feel comfortable being an authority on that. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say don&#39;t sell yourself short, and let out exactly what you think of conspiracy theories and the people that believe in them. I think that will help us all understand your perspective on the issues we care about. </p>

<p>How many people work for Snopes </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I answered that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3mx9h9/who_are_the_mikkelsons_owners_of_snopescom_and/cvju40f">here</a>, I only directly work with three people mostly. Other people have been doing some design stuff of late, but that&#39;s recent. Definitely more than two people. :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and have you ever had anyone inside or outside the organization direct a response?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never. And I could never see this happening. Since we&#39;re independent, we don&#39;t ever have to answer to anyone. The only person who makes these decisions, ever, is David. And I&#39;ve been on the message board for a loooong time, and it&#39;s always been that way. In all the years I&#39;ve known him online, I&#39;ve never known him to have any dog in any fight, nor any apparent leanings. People sometimes think we adopt the &quot;mainstream version&quot; of events, but it&#39;s really just a matter of what we can find proof of. I mean, if we ever proved some conspiracy was true, we&#39;d get a lot of traffic. It would be great. By the same token, if we were misrepresenting something, we&#39;d get called out all over the place. Everything we publish is scrutinized by the internet for accuracy, probably more than almost anywhere else. The closest we ever come to censoring our content is not putting profanity in URLs so they won&#39;t be restricted on some sites. (But we can have it in the page&#39;s content.) </p>

<p>This is one persistent rumor that always perplexes me because I feel like it would be obvious pretty rapidly if we were beholden to anyone. </p>

<p>No problem :) I feel like a lot of people don&#39;t realize most skeptics and folklore types aren&#39;t anti-conspiracy or anti-that-stuff. Most people in these forums and communities end up there out of an interest in (not dislike of) this sort of material!</p>

<p>Like I said, I don&#39;t expect anyone to take my word for it. But personally, I don&#39;t apply &quot;someone said&quot; as strong evidence unsupported by other evidence. It&#39;s difficult to articulate, but I feel as if in order to be propaganda, we&#39;d have to be working in concert with other parties (and we are not). </p>

<p>I&#39;m honestly not sure which topics you&#39;re referencing. I can&#39;t even find any content on the site relating to &quot;Rita Katz.&quot; These are not rumors with which I&#39;m personally familiar. What about Al Qaeda?

<p>I go to work like everyone else. During my work day, I keep a Twitter tab open and watch our mentions (in case people start pinging the site for various reasons). A few tweets linked to this thread, so I opened it, switched to my work account, and replied. It isn&#39;t as if I&#39;m pretending to be a random Snopes defender- I identified myself and joined the discussion like anyone on Reddit. And I&#39;ve been a Redditor for a long time (this is just my work account). It really isn&#39;t very implausible, and even so, what would be the point? I&#39;m a person who works for the site posting as myself, so who am I fooling? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Legit. No one who ever gets shot ever knows people, and those people probably never end up on the internet after they find out their friend/family member got shot looking for information and winds up on a conspiracy thread and gets enraged. I bet that never happens. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bad, but not this bad. But, are you sure your paychecks aren&#39;t being signed by a scummy transnational disinfo corporation?</p>

<p>Pretty sure. If that was the case, wouldn&#39;t I have been censored once by now? How could I possibly be conscripted as a propaganda agent without even being nudged to do so? Again, I don&#39;t expect you to take me at my word, but I am always happy to answer any questions at all about a conclusion. We&#39;re really not all that mysterious. </p>

<p>With respect to bin Laden conspiracies, it&#39;s pretty much a known known at this point that much of the investigation remains heavily classified. That doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re afraid to touch it, it just means we can&#39;t <em>substantiate</em> things to a meaningful degree. We shared this link on FB a few weeks ago, which included speculation about the operation:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/snopes/posts/718055768338945">https://www.facebook.com/snopes/posts/718055768338945</a></p>

<p>I guess you could posit it&#39;s such good disinfo that I don&#39;t even know I&#39;m doing it, but nothing I&#39;ve ever written or proposed has been edited or killed post-writing. </p>

<p>ETA: For clarity, I work at home, but I try to maintain a work day where I am working during business hours, at which time I am also doing social media stuff for the site. The sum of my responses on Reddit for work can be seen by viewing my history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tl:dr You don&#39;t take &quot;someone said&quot; unless that someone is the known liars in Gov&#39;t or big media.  Lying just like they always been known to do.  Who are fully supported by their propaganda rags, owned by the key military industrial complex corporations.  From the big six media conglomerates, to little nonsense operations like the one you &quot;work for&quot; - Snopes.com.</p>

<p>The claimed Bin Laden videos were proven false by simple image analysis and comparison.  Very straightforward and supportable with independent analysis.  Not just by what &quot;someone said.&quot;  And Al Qaeda being such a micro group of 200 individuals, yet able to singlehandedly hold off the entire free world for years was also not a &quot;someone said&quot; type of deal. </p>

<p>It&#39;s be nice to see you actually address these major issues with the historical record.  Though that is literally NEVER going to never happen.  Snopes is largely void of any articles that negatively paint the USG.  Both in the distant critical errors, and on current fuckups.  They can clearly do no wrong, if you&#39;re a Snopes.com reader.  Now Snopes is just used to further spread propaganda and disinformation.  The speed at which new articles are added to get ahead of the conspiracies and speculation is unbelievable.  Something that would take months or years to have added to the site, is done many times in just a few hours.  More than you + a married couple...worthless sellout soulless scumbags + a few other people &quot;doing design stuff as of late&quot; and maybe another &quot;researcher&quot; likely still wouldn&#39;t be enough to fully research, collect plausible &quot;evidence,&quot; write up, design, proof/get ready for publishing, then release that disinfo to the world in such a short span just doesn&#39;t sound believable.  It&#39;s like professional propagandists are working behind the scenes, with articles pre-written and ready to roll as soon as the events are staged.  Then sending a few of you off to disinfo-spam the forums.</p>

<p>And they pay your full time salary, plus the salaries if 4-5 other individuals...and their own, all through ad revenue?  By pulling in about $600/day in estimated ad revenue.  At rank 2,229 on Alexa.  See: <a href="http://www.snopes.com/info/aboutus.asp">http://www.snopes.com/info/aboutus.asp</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah I see, so you are not allowed to go outside of your barriers. There were many things very corrupt with that case. </p>

<p>Again it&#39;s not to say what was posted was wrong but the fact that it was posted in the bottom as the user reads downward was my issue. Because on the side, when the user has googled that question, it says FALSE.</p>

<p>So in formatting context, I feel adjustments needs to be made to the website for such cases. As I stated to one of your other members, most news websites do not state what the user should believe but rather let them read the story and come to their own conclusion. This is what makes Snopes different.</p>

<p>Edit: <em>Removed</em></p>

<p>The other issue is that the article is using words specifically in a certain way.</p>

<p>Example, </p>

<p>User types</p>

<p>&quot;was dylan roof treated to burger king&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=was+dylan+roof+treated+to+burger+king">https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=was+dylan+roof+treated+to+burger+king</a></p>

<p>Second on the list is Snopes</p>

<p><strong>User Clicks Snopes</strong></p>

<p>Headline Reads</p>

<p>Did Police Take Dylann Roof to Burger King?</p>

<p>When the headline could have easily been, <strong>&quot;Did Dylann Roof Receive Burger King while in police custody?&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Instead a barrier was placed around the question, not sure if on purpose or just bad choice of words.</p>

<p>One thing we get a lot is &quot;it&#39;s worded that way because...&quot; but there is a difference between the question and what people are asking. People weren&#39;t asking if he ate it, they wanted to know if he was treated better than other accused killers. So far as I was able to see, he was in custody and police gave him food. But they didn&#39;t &quot;take him to Burger King.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Would you agree this isn&#39;t why the rumor circulated? People wanted to know if he received special, kinder treatment. Not if he &quot;received Burger King.&quot; They wanted to know if he was given favor, rewarded, etc. Not &quot;did cops feed him in custody as state law dictates.&quot;</p>

<p>Barriers on thought, instead of generalizing like most informational website would. The article decides that it will implement the thought process for the user. Sadly, among conspiracy your website will always have a bit of a narrative behind it because we practice critical thought so much.</p>

<p>As I said, not sure if done on purpose or not but it is apparent it&#39;s there. This was the main story that turned me away from the website, I&#39;ve browsed it a few times since but that&#39;s about it.</p>

<p>I think at the time there may have been at least 2 or 3 police brutality cases that ended in the death of the victim, as such, the face that this white boy mass shooter of a church no less was given not only a presidential escort but burger king might have been the outrage you are referring to.</p>

<p>Therefore, the headline</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Did Dylann Roof Receive Burger King while in police custody?&quot;</p>

<p>would have made much more sense.</p>

<p>Aye, which is why I only use the website to gather information, while also gathering from various other sources, if even MSM has the nerve to not have True/False narrative why does snopes? Very odd indeed. A reader should be able to read a story, and determine how they feel about it. In case of Snopes, it tries to act as if it is the end all be all, which is not the case. It is just another source for information that can easily be placed against a different source and hold no wait whatsoever.</p>

<p>Exactly, I always research using multiple views, I could never depend on one haha! It would be unrealistic to do so, I mean there is no telling who is giving the information out or why they give it out the way they do. It&#39;s best to use MULTIPLE sources, if you find sources that say to different things, it&#39;s usually because a lie has been told somewhere.</p>

<p>In the case of Snopes, it wasn&#39;t a lie but rather mistaken or deliberate formatting that instantly turned me away from the website.</p>

Problems arose from using it to treat morning sickness, but there are no such problems in other contexts.

<p>More than anything else, Thalidomide proves the need for extensive <strong>independent</strong> testing and demonstrates the need not only for warning labels but for people to actually pay attention to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>RE: Boston - Sure it was.  The whole announcing the bomb&#39;s exact location and timing, virtually down to the minute, inadvertently over Twitter.  And the legless actor, who had zero blood pressure, being made to wait for over 10 minutes so they could prep Carlos and the perfect photo op.   As emergency services use a stretcher to FIRST wheel away his black woman makeup artist,  and then many minutes later, him...but this time on a fucking wheelchair...placing excessive and completely unnecessary pressure on the shredded blood vessels in his (allegedly) severed legs.  But it&#39;s cool.  All Carlos needs to do is grasp then with his fingers, and we&#39;re totally good.  Like a quarter of an hour, spent bleeding almost the entire time, yet his vitals look perfectly ok.  He miraculously still conscious.  He has a flushed face.  Yet he&#39;s showing zero signs of being in shock/having suffered from major blood loss.</p>

<p>Let me repeat that one more time.  The emergency services, even after waiting for multiple minutes of total inaction, choose to first address a black woman displaying virtually no signs of injury other than fake flood smeared across her face, INSTEAD of immediately tending to the man who could be mere seconds away from death, is wheeled off on a stretcher.  While the bad actor Jeff Bauman is kept waiting even longer, and then many minutes later, is wheeled off to safety somewhere in that direction ON A GODDAMN WHEELCHAIR while kept INCLINED?</p>

<p>This is where these clearly manufactured events jump the shark into complete and total unbelievability.  So far outside of the realm that the suspension of disbelief is no longer even a physically possibility.</p>

<p>As for motiveless fiction that is Adam Lanza, there simply isn&#39;t enough evidence to even show the guy even existed.  Zero verified videos have ever captured any event in his claimed life.  Only a handful of photographs, though every single one has clear signs of being manipulated.  And this doesn&#39;t even begin to touch on the nonexistent evacuation of 400 students that day.  Even though full time video coverage of the event was rolling, and we were shown staged photos of a single partial class evacuation (taken some time in the past, not immediately after the staged event).  Hence the need to beef up the numbers of parents and students, forcing them to all walk ridiculous laps around the firehouse.  And wasn&#39;t it just perfect that Newtown had a completely unused school to immediately transfer all of those 400 kids to with no notice?  Again, this all falls so far outside of the realm of the believable.  That most citizens who aren&#39;t yet aware of the massive holes in the official conspiracy theory, don&#39;t take much to to recognize just how fraudulent these events really were.  A half hour conversation with some pointed questions, and they&#39;re solving the mystery for themselves.</p>

<p>We can also talk about the homosexual actor, Eliott Rodgers.  Or the Navy shipyard.  Or those two at Wal-Mart.  Gabby &quot;fight, fight, fight!&quot; Giffords.  The laughably unaware Alison Parker and Adam Ward live TV &quot;shooting.&quot; And this latest staged fiction - Chris Mintz, shot some six times, with those bullets somehow magically breaking both legs as well as chipping his scapula.  Horribly wounded, yet is seen with NO BLOOD WHATSOEVER on his body or clothes, as he&#39;s wheeled away from the scene.  A common thread in all of these made for Hollywood manufactured events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I&#39;m aware, regardless of the ____&#39;s, I&#39;m the only one I&#39;m aware of.  After having multiple previous accounts compromised, the next iteration of the same s/n is then used.  Contacting the mods proved fruitless after the the first time my password was changed while I was still logged in, and able to capture the IPs for the most recent sessions.  Regardless, the writing style should immediately give it away.</p>

<p>Its very interesting to note that very shortly after the unconstitutional NDAA was signed out if thin air, into criminal existence...under an even thinner judicial basis, and through the removal of the domestic propaganda protections offered by the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ndaa-legalizes-propaganda-2012-5">Smith Mundt Act of 1948</a>, staged false flag shootings absolutely explode en mass on the scene nationwide.  From just a few sparse events in the decades past - usually only exclusively used to pull the isolationist American public into bankers wars.  To the modern rapid succession of back-to-back events that all follow a remarkably similar script, as all readily push the same agenda and share the same apparent end goal.  Not to mention the absolutely perfect timing of almost every single one of them.  </p>

<p>Shall I take your response here to mean that you support the official government issued conspiracy theory for Sept 11, 2001?  The one that had drug using &quot;ultra religious&quot; terrorists, who largely found the challenge of keeping even just single engine Cessnas in the air physically impossible, to later performing razor sharp surgical precision maneuvers, well outside of the physical structural limits (VMO envelope) of the respective passenger aircraft, impacting targets so small at 500 MPH, even the most skilled pilots with tens of thousands of flight hours under their belts found, identically, as with the &quot;terrorists&quot; keeping their single engine practice planes, <strong>impossible</strong> to <a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=17996">reproduce</a>?</p>

<p>The level of believability for these staged events has been so incredibly low, most people who are exposed to a balanced review of the totality of evidence, all seem to come to the same conclusion.  Pending they can slowly neutralize the initial outright resistance to even simply must hearing the facts before  their brains shut down.  The key components thst decades of around the clock brainwashing has instilled (see: the CIA&#39;s weaponization of the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;).  In addition, while residing strictly outside of the physical evidence of the crimes, no less, it&#39;s incredibly easy to identify these manufactured events initially only by using indirect methods:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Is the event being spammed through print and television around the clock 24/7</strong>.  Is this all the puppets can talk about for weeks to months on end?  Are they telling you what and how to think?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Are even the most basic of questions purposefully ignored by the media and police?</strong>  Eg. The theater cameras in use in the Aurora, CO movie theater?  Two gas masks.  The first non-alarmed rear exit door in existence in any modern theater.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do the same usual suspects attack any open discussion of the topic?</strong>  Do they attack in packs, utilizing well known and wel exposed <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2012/11/the-15-rules-of-web-disruption-2/">disruption methods</a>?  Are even small discussions of this topic still attacked?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Que bono?</strong>  Does the claimed motive that&#39;s being sold wholesale make sense?  Eg. Adam Lanza shooting up a school of kids he&#39;s never met, nor never interacted with previously?  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Are blatant lies used to initially make the motives somewhat plausible?</strong>  Eg. Again, Adam Lanza having zero ties to the school or the students.  &quot;Confirmed&quot; media reports on most networks, falsely claiming that Nancy was a kindergarten teacher at the school, which made Adam &quot;jealous.&quot;  The disinfo claims that he had a run in with scholars administrators in the days leading up to the attack.  Um...again, he had zero motive.  So these lies were floated to make the story even plausible as it&#39;s being told.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Are simultaneous drills that mirror the claimed event actively occurring at the time?</strong>  We&#39;re the drills just recently completed in the months leading up?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Is the case too quickly closed without any independent verifications or testimony?  Do the police and prosecutors efforts mirror actual, real life events?</strong>  Eg. The jumbled mess that was the final <a href="http://cspsandyhookreport.ct.gov">Sandy Hook report</a>.  This stands entirely on its own.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do the suspects have unreasonably close relationships with the FBI, CIA, or local law enforcement?  We&#39;re they &quot;on their radar&quot; for years prior?</strong>  Ex. Jack Ruby, and his involvement with LBJ&#39;s Kennedy assassination.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Are the crimes blamed on far too convenient scapegoats that fit the current agenda being pushed perfeftly?</strong>  See: repeat AR15 attacks, even though they are statistically used in an insanely small number of murders.  Yet every single false flag shooting uses then without fail.  All while congress is conveniently attacking civilian ownership AT THE EXACT SAME TIME.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Are Hegel&#39;s dialectic - Problem, Reaction, Solution being used as the basis for the staged event, and end goal of the state?</strong>  Again, enough said...</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is but a small portion of the indicators present in almost every single staged psyop event, that can be used to initially indicate whether an event is more likely real or staged.  To fully determine, one must weigh all physical evidence, witness testimony, the ever changing mass media story (researchers have confirmed that the accounts nearest the event are almost always the most accurate/truthful), and review the full court proceedings (if you&#39;re unkucky enough to actually have the suspect not commit suicide or be killed in the immediately after).</p>

<p>Looking back to history, key events that were proven false flags:
* Pearl Harbor - yeah, the phone just didn&#39;t work.  Along with all scouts, every early warning system, all captured sigint, yet we simply couldn&#39;t have known they were going to attack just as we provoked them to.   Used to send the isolationist US into wars we had no desire to participate in.
* The Gulf of Tonkin, used to thrust the US into the unwinnable Vietnam war.
* Sept 11, self-explanatory.</p>

<p>I still have you stored here as a &quot;friend.&quot;  And have for many years.  Supported by the many positive personal conversations we shared.  It appears as though I&#39;ve somehow tripped the single completely reasonable subject for our home sub that you just suddenly now cannot shy away from.   Strange.  What I should be asking instead is if your account has somehow been compromised?  This is absolutely not an item you would take this big of a stand on historically.  If it hasn&#39;t, how much did it take to sell your soul while completely selling out humanity - your fellow brothers and sisters.  To sell such blatant lies.  For your sake, I truly hope it was worth it.  Any of it.</p>

<p>Again, to see you reject such well known manufactured events as real life events doesn&#39;t sit right with me at all.  To clarify, this very detailed response is meant less for you personally, and more for those who have also interacted with you here over the years.  </p>

That&#39;s totally asinine to believe that one of the most advanced superpowers in the world was just inept enough to not keep and maintain a reasonable perimiter around their most valuable and tactically important fleet.

<p>So we provoke Japan, leave the entire house unlocked and unprotected, then let a lot of American sailors needlessly give their lives, in the hopes that Isolationist public would change their tune as soon as their uncle, brother, father come home in a body bag.

<p>Oh, it was just them announcing a drill.  Exactly where the &quot;terrorist&quot; explosion went off.  Before it happened.  But that&#39;s nothing worth even looking into.  They weren&#39;t talking about the actual bomb.  They were tsling about some other bomb.  Right.</p>

<p>Add in all the well documented actors getting into character.  The bombs, allegedly filled with shrapnel, that upon going off, absolutely shred the crowd, yet no damage to the flags immediately in the blast have zero damage. No holes punched through them.  No blast damage is seen on the walls surrounding it.  But sure enough, all that shrapnel made it into the same said actors from earlier.  That whole Jeff Bauman bullshit.  Being left completely unattended, while emergency services instead choose to remove his black makeup artist <strong>ON A STRETCHER...BEFORE SO MUCH AS THOUCHING THE COMPLETELY LEGLESS MAN</strong> who is steadily bleeding out.

<p>OMG. A bomb goes off and, when another suspicious package is found nearby, they decide to blow it up. Again, that you are presenting this seriously as evidence for a hoax, just shows what a lack of credible evidence there is. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not even going to get into the rest of your nonsense, because someone unable to grasp simple ideas like time-zones is clearly going to having nothing worthwhile to say about medical evidence.</p>

<p>Let me be absolutely clear. Those who promote Boston and Sandy Hook as fake are an utter embarrassment to genuine conspiracy researchers, and can only be seen as either &quot;useful idiots&quot; for promoting such an obviously false narrative, or are deliberately poisoning the well so people are less likely to take genuine conspiracies seriously. </p>

Backpacks, that fully mind you, DO NOT EVEN COME CLOSE to matching the backpacks either were in possession of that day.

This shit could not be any less believable.</p>

<p>With this claimed secondary explosion, that you claim took place AFTER the initial TWO smoke bombs being such a distinct event, this will be no problem whatsoever for your to provide.  Good luck with your .  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, its clear we&#39;re going to have to break this down to a childs level for you, as you&#39;re dancing around the questions like a fool.</p>

<p>So, you aren&#39;t going to address the Tweet you claim occurred AFTER the two primary explosions, simply because you cannot prove the officials ever carried out a controlled detonation of a secondary explosive, as you&#39;ve claimed.  As well, the two brothers were ONLY seen carrying two backpacks, with one device in each.  Where again did this third explosive you allege they detonated AFTER the two primary explosions.</p>

<p>Once again, you have two direct questions that you continue to run away from like a coward:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Where is any mention of the controlled detonation mentioned in the Tweet at THE EXACT SAME LOCATION AS THE FIRST EXPLOSION near the finish line, in any newspaper or referenced during the kangaroo court trial of Tsarnev?</strong></p></li>
<li><p>If the two brothers were ONLY carrying two backpacks, each containing one pressure cooker, shrapnel filled amateur IED that were detonated (allegedly) in two locations near the race.  <strong>Where did the third explosive you claim was detonated at the exact same location as the initial blast?</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>I haven&#39;t called you a shill.  I&#39;ve stated that your behavior is identical to how a shill would behave.  Purposefully avoiding any fact based debate whatsoever, then when <strong>directly challenged</strong>, running away like a coward.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>If you haven&#39;t covered the main 9/11 conspiracies, what about that event made your site so popular?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good question. The event was a strange example of this new intersection of digital info-sharing and a huge immediate catastrophe. So it was the first time people really were finding info and sending it in the way we do now on social media. To that point, rumors didn&#39;t really occur so <em>urgently</em>. But during 9/11 it was different- for me anyway, I live on Long Island and I was in Ireland at the time. We were all in different ways desperate for more information, and for my own self, a primary frustration in Ireland was not being able to get <em>accurate</em> information. Information just began spreading at a crazy rate, much of that inaccuracy (sorry) birthing what would later become conspiracy. But the role of Snopes then was clarifying immediate rumors- did someone surf down debris? Did they find a pocket of living firefighters? Was there gold under the WTC? The Loose Change type stuff was really more out of our purview, since we weren&#39;t 9/11 specialists. It just dominated folklore for a good few years. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, you have many claims/rumors with a status of &quot;Undetermined&quot;.. I would think that an inconclusive outcome should not stop you from covering a popular claim. So no, your response still doesn&#39;t make sense to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We do. I used that status yesterday. But it&#39;s our least favorite status and only used when we don&#39;t have information to validate a claim. If we published a page that said WTC7 purportedly was brought down by a controlled demolition and then marked it undetermined, it would really serve no purpose. If there was a popular rumor it was firebombed by Dick Cheney in a black helicopter, we could probably mark it false. But what I am really trying to pinpoint here is how this discussion could be a page. What is the rumor? That it was a controlled demolition?</p>

<p>I would even go so far as to say (because we do get the odd &quot;was 9/11 an inside job?&quot; email) that if there is credible evidence relating to 9/11 that has yet to be released, it&#39;s not going to come from me. We have fantastic investigative reporters like Glenn Greenwald, whistleblowers like Edward Snowden, and plenty of people working the general beat of military/war/Pentagon leaks. All these questions:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are many questions/claims that do not require an engineering or scientific background. Here are some examples:
&quot;WTC buildings 1, 2, and 7 were all demolished using some form of pre-planted explosives.&quot;
&quot;Dick Cheney gave an order to &quot;stand down&quot; regarding the shoot down of the plane approaching the Pentagon.&quot;
&quot;There was strong evidence of insider trading prior to 9/11, which the 9/11 Commission did not address.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are ones that would be best addressed by people who spend their whole entire lives doing hard reporting on this topic and this topic alone. It is not going to ever be settled on a Snopes page, because it&#39;s way out of the scope of the site. Finding out whether anyone surfed down the debris is folklore, finding out whether Cheney fudged the 9/11 commission is really more a job for Jeremy Scahill. We are folklorists, <em>that</em> is our scope. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Edit: If you want to establish credibility among folks like us, would you be interested in doing an AMA here on r/conspiracy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People have asked me to do an AMA before, and I&#39;ve replied that I think David ought to do a general AMA at some point (so I wouldn&#39;t want to detract from that). For r/conspiracy, I wouldn&#39;t mind doing a casual AMA if people wanted that (with the understanding I may not be privy to all the answers to questions people might ask). However, I also don&#39;t want to annoy the members of this sub by openly espousing traditionally skeptical views, nor am I quite sure what I could offer in terms of useful information to anyone here :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And yet again you&#39;ve failed to counter even one single point that I&#39;ve made.  </p>

<p>Until then, I&#39;ve labeled you as such, and you&#39;ll be ignored as a valueless disinfo contributor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There have been no accusations or attempts to call you a shill.  I&#39;ve simply stated the obvious here.  Why are you so paraniod about that, I wonder?</p>

<p>Do you know what type of people avoid honest, fact based debate like the plague at all time?  Disinfo shills.  You are a coward, and refusing to counter even one single thing I&#39;ve said speaks volumes about you as a person.  </p>

<p>Keep running away from the questions.  See how others will view your &quot;sceptical conspiracist&quot; efforts here because of it.  Glad you&#39;re able to bring such an amazing voice of sound reason (see: disinfo) to all of us.</p>
