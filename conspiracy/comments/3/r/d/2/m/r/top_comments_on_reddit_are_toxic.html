Reddit has been spiraling out of control for a while now,(or rather <em>into</em> <em>control</em>...) it feels on the verge of collapse. Any thoughts?</p>

Ok to actually address your point literally: You put the words &quot;on reddit&quot; in bold, as if to declare that reddit is, by definition, a bunch of people deciding to either censor each other or boost each others&#39; visibility. Basically your logic is bad and you should feel bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely going the way of Digg.  While they both share the element of immature, hollow content from younger users devoid of the desire to discuss, there is a difference.  While Digg died from laxness toward selling prominence, Reddit will die because of censorship mainly from out of control mods.  </p>

<p>Oh, that and vote brigading.  <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> is completely brigaded by JIDF Hasbara etc. and this sub increasingly by Stormfront and the Teh Joos did everything baad! group.  In these and other instances the mods are more often part of the problem than a preventative buffer.  Add in all the BS with mods working against the rules and out of sight and this place is doomed if no one does anything about it.</p>

<p>I guess it&#39;s on to voat and wait for it to get fucked up too...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It turns out, the Joos are a problem.  Not in america, not a racial factor.  People in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nex-oSKPX2w">&#39;alllegedly antisemitic sub&#39;</a> (most aren&#39;t) are talking about Israel and Zionists specifically.  There is overwhelming proof of Israeli interference and shaping of our politics and culture in a way that has hurt america.  That is not a conspiracy, that&#39;s reality.  That&#39;s history.  JIDF shills really are here screwing around.  That&#39;s proven also.  Mossad art selling students really did case our government in the months prior to 9/11.  Come clean or f off Israel!</p>

<p>The US&#39;s relationship with them is increasingly a problem.  You have evangelicals who defend Israel and quite weirdly identify with them.  Do they even know what Israel thinks of evangelicals?  They think they are bullshit, they are <em>not</em> the chosen people.  They don&#39;t care about our Jesus or our &#39;inspired fat cow christians in mega churches&#39;.  If they had their druthers, seriously, they&#39;d line these poeple up next to paletinians and rip a line of bulletholes through their chests just to get them out of their headspace.  That&#39;s who we are dealing with.  Read what they say.</p>

<p>And of course, I&#39;ll be accused of being an antisemite when the simple fact is: I don&#39;t care about Jewish people in the same way I don&#39;t care about Irish or British or Italian people even though I&#39;m partially all of those according to 23 and me and ancestry.com, but to a miniscule extent jewish.  My point is: I care about my country and the secrecy agencies running games on everyone.</p>

<p>Mossad is not helping (in a manner of speaking, the are (ISIS)), but honestly, if Israel is to be sovereign, they are going to have to start acting like it and fight and win their own battles.  Even if this means busting out the nuclear weapons they totally have That means US stepping back and letting them do what they need to do to feel secure. I don&#39;t want to spend any more US money or lives on their problem.  We built their house and defended it for 50+ yrs.  What more do they want?  Apparently everything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I&#39;m afraid that never happened, and it not based in reality. We have <a href="/r/isrconspiracyracist">/r/isrconspiracyracist</a> sent their usual suspects to attempt to racist up our sub.  Because in its natural, unadulterated state, actual racism here seldom occurrs.  In the very rare instances where it does, day to day <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users rapidly clean house of the hateful garbage (ed. clarity). Sure doesn&#39;t make the isrconsracist crowd look very good.  They claim to simply be documenting the claimed mass of racists here, just like the good little SJWarriors they are.  But even a simple cursory review of their &quot;evidence&quot; shows that the actual racism is only ever done by a exceedingly short list of highly questionable members.  Ones that have been ID&#39;d many times over, and don&#39;t really fool anyone with their eyes open.  Oh yes, and that they really care about <em>one</em> flavor of racism.  The brajded one that paints with broadest of strokes.  More often than not, it couldn&#39;t even accurately be considered racist by any reasonable, independent observer.</p>

<p>Duckvimes or whatever alt he&#39;s using today, along with his zio-lackeys: Creating racist garbage on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as a credibility attack.  Directly in line with the previously exposed bipolarbear0 and <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> infiltration.  Then when caught red handed, claiming it was &quot;just an experiment.&quot;  Correct.  A experiment showing exactly which methods are being used to discredit and attack our sub.  As expected, nothing was ever done to correct it then.  And as such, nonsense exactly like this continues here to this very day.  </p>

<p>Call someone who is blatantly shilling an entirely exposed agenda exactly what they are, and the wrath that comes down so quickly because of it will shock you.  Now only if that same level of moderation could be applied to the actual problems facing us.  The constant contrarian ridicule and attacks we see daily.  The pack hunting gang ups of false consensus.  So much so that many very positive and beneficial <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> contributing members have already jumped ship because of it.  They can have their &quot;safe space&quot; demolished with little concern, but troll and shill rights will always trump those of actual contributing sub members.  </p>

<p>The dream of a sub that actually stands up for what is right.  For what is fair fist for its own members and community?  What would that even be like?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean this?  By the notorious &quot;stormfronter&quot; fraud, Joshua Goldberg?  The same Joshua Goldberg who was later arrested for being a terrorist?  The same one who was a key member/creator of the racist sub that seemed to be protected by the highest levels, while manufacturing racism on Reddit?</p>

<p>Our very own <a href="/u/Amos_Quito">/u/Amos_Quito</a> immediately called out this staged garbage.  He was attacked and ridiculed by the same folks who kept trying to push the lie that racists used our sub as a recruiting ground.  I don&#39;t think anyone can keep a straight face while trying to still claim this.  Ze jig is, how you say, up.</p>

<p>Much more thorough information can be found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3klzcr/racist_stormfront_article_declaring_rconspiracy/">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>submitted 1 month ago by <a href="/u/Amos_Quito">/u/Amos_Quito</a></p>

<p>You&#39;ll see in my comment (second from the top) that I smelled a rat even then, accusing Stormfront of being a &quot;honeypot&quot;.</p>

<p>Apparently I was right?</p>

<p>So here we have Goldberg (a Jew), pretending to be a &quot;white supremacist&quot;, writing Jew-hating articles on Stormfront for the specific purpose of defaming this sub by falsely linking it to that filthy website. And of course the clowns on TopMinds and IsRConspiracyRacist were celebrating.
When you see articles or comments that are BLATANTLY RACIST appearing on this sub, you can bet that they are being published (and upvoted) by clowns like Goldberg, who was himself a contributor to the aforementioned subs.</p>

<p>My condolences to the boys over at TopMinds and IsRConspiracyRacist. They&#39;ve lost a friend and a valuable asset today.</p>

<p>As we&#39;ve always said, if they cannot find racism on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, they quickly create and log it themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes you walk into a room of shills.  For example the irradiation article that dropped today.  Not a single word on the <a href="https://www.citizen.org/documents/cyclobutanone.pdf">toxic byproducts produced by irradiating food we&#39;ve known about for ages</a>.  Instead you have a top comment that says, &quot;hi I&#39;m a scientist that works quality control for USDA blah blah QA lab.  Irradiation is an excellent way to ...blah&quot;.  Then other &#39;scientists&#39; chiming in.  Not a single one had anything negative to say about it.</p>

<p>I posted on that and my comment has been fixated on &#39;1&#39;, possibly shadowbanned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fascinating. Imagine the website is flooded with countless little bots that far outnumber the humans and operate under AI. I&#39;m seriously feeling like we&#39;re in Terminator 2 and the Matrix and stuff. And maybe we should be freaking out more. Not in fear, but in like: &quot;Holy fuck. Alright. It&#39;s game time.&quot; As a matter of fact I had a vivid dream last week that I was in a physical spacial setting similar to a shopping mall but it represented reddit, and it was very dark and everyone had cool Halo suits on, and we all realized we had to stop enforcing our own rules in order to escape from the game. reality in dreams and waking life is becoming more like we&#39;re all starting to agree about this stuff.</p>

<p>There, do you guys think I caught its attention? I&#39;m seriously planning on staying here on Reddit and continuing to speak truth and bitch until the ship either sinks completely or we win this war. I won&#39;t give in and abandon Reddit. This is our website.</p>
