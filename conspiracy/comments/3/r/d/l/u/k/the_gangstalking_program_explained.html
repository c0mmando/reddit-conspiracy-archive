       The Gangstalking Program Explained
      </p>
      <p>
       What is gang stalking and electronic harassment?
Gang stalking is a form of community mobbing and organized stalking combined. Just like you have workplace mobbing, and online mobbing, which are both fully recognized as legitimate, this is the community form.
Electronic Harassment is when someone uses any electronic device to aid them in invading your person or property for the purpose of gathering information illegally, or for the purpose of causing harm. Electronic Harassment comes in many forms and types. It can be used for surveillance, sabotage, interference, directed energy weapons, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Organized stalking is probably a better term than “gang stalking” since it more accurately conveys the systematic nature of the crime, and it avoids creating the erroneous impression that the activity is connected with street gangs.
Gang stalking is organized harassment at it's best. It the targeting of an individual for revenge, jealousy, sport, or to keep them quiet, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a psychological attack that can completely destroy a persons life, while leaving little or no evidence to incriminate the perpetrators."
Most targets are women, minorities, dissidents, whistle blowers, and outspoken.

       And 
This is a real problem, I am a current victim of mental and physical torture and abuse along with many other Australians and there is nothing law enforcement agencies can do to help me, make it stop or go away. The media are aware of an increasing problem on innocent civilians that is happening all over the world. They are secret weapon's, psychotronic torture and the involuntary testing of those weapons on civilians. (see project mk ultra as one example).The people targeted include many who challenge organised criminal activity which is corruptly protected by Government / Media interests. Victims can experience hearing voices, mind reading, control and sensing, directed energy attacks and more. The technology in question are covered by military/agency secrecy orders, they are computer and satellite fasciltated all with military and criminal applications. Like myself after passing on privileged information to law enforcement became a victim of an organised criminal syndicate, I was tortured, terrorised and harressed, the methods used are covert employing high tech to remotely torment and deceive victims without leaving evidence. Often targets including myself are tricked into believing they are having a psychic, medical or psychiatric experience, I was falsely diagnosed first stage psychosis and became suicidal, this leaves them discredited as they seek help from Police, Doctors, Media or authorities. This leaves them silenced, the situation is getting worse. The Government technology is called Remote Neural Monitoring, it works remotely to control the brain in order to read and detect any criminal thought taking place in the mind of the perpetrator. RNM can control a persons emotional thought process along with subconscious and dreams.  For purposes of electronic evaluation, electrical activity in the speech centre of the brain can be translated in to the subject's verbal thoughts. RNM can send encoded signals to the auditory cortex of the brain directly bypassing the ear. This encoding helps in detecting audio communication. It can also perform electrical mapping of the brain's activity from the visual centre of the brain, which it does by bypassing the eyes and optic nerves, thus projecting images from the subject's brain onto a video monitor. With this visual and audio memory, both can be visualised and analysed. A few of the most popular names for technological mind control are behaviour modifications, electromagnetic, GWEN towers, HAARP INTER CONNECTION CD microwave mind control and psychotropic main control. 
The torture consist of body overheating, body extremely cold, seizures, heart pain, ear aches, itching behind eyes, burning behind eyes, targeting pain to individual parts of the body, swelling, headaches, involuntary movement of limbs, exhaustion, speeding and heart racing, hair coming out by the handfuls as if you have had chemotherapy, mind paralyses, being hypnotized or placed in a trance type state, being tracked through your body like an animal, electric shock sensations, bug like feeling crawling over genitals.
They can also intercept and control dreams. Sleep deprivation and constant harassment are used to makes it easier for the corrupt officials to use mind control.  V2K/voice to skull - hearing someone talk to you and hologram type hallucinations - seeing things and some say actually smelling the odor of what you are seeing.  This technology is used to make the person appear to have a mental problem.  After all if someone states they are seeing and hearing things - which they actually are - they are perceived to be mentally unstable. Most victims can communicate with there "operator" through voice sensing, they can be heard as a voice in the head. You can talk back, they repeat back exactly what your imaging or thinking, they become rude such as tracking my movements through the city the voice would say" I hope you fall down those stairs " "Don't look over there and many demeaning words, they would say haha we got him, they would heat my head up so hot for 10 seconds, make pin pricks on my skin, make it feel as though a bug was crawling over my eye lid or genitals, prevent sleep by transmitting electric pulses along my legs and feelings of bugs crawling in my hair, in my sleep I would awake paralysed by what feels like my whole body been electrocuted, I couldn't move in bed, only scream begging to stop while listening to them laugh (ultra low frequency) visual delusions such as looking at a tree in the back ground a hallogram would for a shape of a persons face, everything you look at expands and decreases as there form of harrasment using infrared technology and nanotechnology. Other technology used are the ELF, GWEN towers and HAARP inter-connection. This is real and only touches the surface google you will find many stories and information about this technology, I am a victim and still suffer today, something needs to be done.
The pain is unbelievable. It involves tones, harmonics, hissing, stabs, blows, voice to skull transmissions, induced dreams (nightmares), burning sensations in the body and head, internal burning sensations inside of the body and head, crawling sensations on the body (phantom touch), electronic rape, in

       very very informative. One can use the information in this video as a means to begin building a defense against gang stalking.
      </p>
      <p>
       After watching this video, it makes me wonder about that "crazy lady" video who thinks the school bus driver and mail man are stalking her. I think it highly likely she is a gangstalking victim.

       Just because two different people were giving you a hard time, it doesn't mean that they were connected in any way. You are the type of person who draws negative attention to yourself and then complains about it. Stop posting this gang-stalking garbage in

       and you will not hear from me. I don't follow you into any other subreddit, but if you post your insanity here I will speak up. You are paranoid, and delusional, like every other self-described targeted individual. Seek treatment before you hurt an innocent person because of your psychosis. It is not fair to the rest of society that you demonize random innocent people in your community due to your untreated mental illness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also... please tone down the name calling, it doesn't help your case. It proves you are unnaturally hostile, and most likely psychotic.

      </p>
      <p>
       i notice that in all social media that barely anyone posts as much as i do and im half assing. pathetic.  yeah go try to appeal to the corrupt system that allows pple to gang stalk you to death. allows entire cities/counties/states to gang stalk pple to death. i'll deal with gang stalking the logical way.

       You know how I know that you are insane? Because I am not a gang stalker, but you are completely and totally convinced that I am. I can only imagine how many other innocent people have been accused of gang stalking you for no reason other than your mental illness. Go see a doctor, please.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is insane to think that whole cities/counties/states would waste any time at all stalking you. What is so important about you that anyone, even the unemployed and homeless, would waste any time monitoring your boring life? If you are actually being watched by law enforcement, then you are not a victim of gang stalking, you are a suspect under surveillance. That's different than gang stalking.

       Ok, I'll fess up. The charade has gone on long enough. Kobe Bryant hired my firm to conduct surveillance on you because he was afraid that you may blame him for the Lakers' recent lack of success. I met Kobe in Barcelona back in October of 2010 and he secured my services. Just know this: if you approach Kobe, his friends, or his family, we will be watching. If you get to close, we will restrain you. If you get violent, we will react in kind.

       its actually more fun than it sounds. i hear you get to ruin pple's lives by being a little bitch and pretend that nothings gonna happen to you. its easy money from what i heard. but the job sucks ass if you dont have a high position. even those aren't guaranteed to be ideal jobs. their subject could go country to country, costing them 10s of thousands at least. or the subject might go off the grid with his arsenal and dare them to come near him.

       ah the pissing contest continues. where you cant stop replying to anything i do. so what you're saying is that even though barely anyone knows about gang stalking, there are several people who aren't ti's or gang stalkers that are actively seeking out gang stalking videos just to troll them?

       No, that is not what I am saying. I am saying that the gang stalking videos are out there on the internet where anyone can stumble upon them. Anyone with an internet connection can find them by accident. Then, after viewing the videos about gang stalking, you become one of two kinds of people: a mentally ill person who completely buys into the idea that whole communities of people are banding together to monitor one random lunatic, OR you are a sane person who realizes that the video was created by a person suffering from a paranoid delusion.

       There must be a good reason to gang stalk or harass a person electronically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ten years ago, the myth that is only government and its for only experimentation, that would have worked, BUT NOW....
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some shady companies do this for insurance. There is a digital agency in Cape Town, Liro satanic marketing (not the real name). Runs a clever scam that hires only bad, lazy incompetent employees such as the one black guy, because it would be so easy and convenient to set them up.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Before the offer of employment is given, the company does a screen check from all previous employers to get the negatives, the red flags then use these to trap the new employee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee is then placed on bogus tasks/projects that have no real value only to be fired months later. While the incompetent employee struggle to complete this no value bogus project, he is being video recorded and live streamed to make him look really bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the gang stalkers sabotage all his next job, friends and character.
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee gets fired, cannot find a new job, has no friends, had no support system, only has electronic harassment, voice to skull, physical health issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       eventually the person dies and company collects insurance payout.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now call gang stalking and electronic harassment non-existant. But his is a pretty good plan is it not?? Every year the company can make revenue from another stupid idiot dying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gang stalking is real, even in south africa

       The reason is to monitor and torture certain people such as law enforcement informants that release privileged information then organisations that are crimmimaly controlled will gang stalk to punish the victim with out evidence and to monitor covertly. It's there way of pay back. The use by Government is for intelligence or law enforcement purposes.

       I have this problem too.   I'm being treated like crap by my community and for no reason.   I don't know if it is connected but it sure looks that way.

       It isn't everyone, only a certain percentage but it's ridiculous.   I have multiple witnesses and multiple documented interactions.

       I have no idea how that would even be possible.   It's freaky to think how hundreds of people can just
be doing the same thing like they are synchronized but they can't be.   It wouldn't be possible.

       Apologies if the previous post was not that clear. Its meant to read...Scenario: TI is talking to a non TI (friend, family or some other person) the perps can also send waves to the non ti to make him/her be in conflict with what you are saying.

       Please do not use the term 'community mobbing' as people might think mobbing is part of organized stalking. Mobbing is separate and different. My detailed explanation:

       There is no evidence that: " Most targets are women, minorities, dissidents, whistle blowers, and outspoken."
      </p>
      <p>
       I created a survey to answer who most targets are and other vital questions:
