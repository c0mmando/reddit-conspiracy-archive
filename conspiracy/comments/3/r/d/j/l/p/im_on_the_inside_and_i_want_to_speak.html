        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a lurker here for quite a while now, but it&#39;s taken me a while to find the courage to speak out about a topic about which I am quite knowledgeable: Zionism/the Jews in government. Myself, I&#39;m a fourth-generation American Jew who&#39;s been trying to leave the movement for a decade now, and through holding some relatively high positions which I unfortunately am not at liberty to disclose specifics of, I&#39;ve acquired some inside knowledge that I think everyone should know.</p>

<p>First of all, yes, the Zionist influence on media is real and a genuine threat. Ever heard of crypto-Jews? Well it&#39;s more or less a requirement that anyone near the top of one of the major corporate media empires at the very least express their support for the Zionist movement, lest they find themselves suddenly out of a job. Those at the top control the content, and that should explain the kind of propaganda that places like CNN broadcast on a daily basis. (Hint: it&#39;s fed to them by an agency with a name rhyming with &quot;Schmossad.&quot;)</p>

<p>Secondly, have you noticed how few anti-Zionist Senators and Representatives there are in this country? That&#39;s no accident. Party leadership on both sides will vet potential candidates, and you can be sure that anyone not supporting the Zionist movement is going to get little to no support from their party.</p>

<p>Thirdly, antisemitism: the magic word. It&#39;s almost like a trigger word for those who have been brainwashed by the Zionist movement - a call to action against an individual or group with the intent on reducing or altogether eliminating their ability to speak.</p>

<p>And lastly, the &quot;theory&quot; of cultural Marxism. It&#39;s not a theory, it&#39;s just fact. The Jews invented Marxism, and pulling it into as many facets of our society as possible is extremely beneficial to that cause. It&#39;s happening on a daily basis through buzzwords like &quot;diversity&quot; and &quot;acceptance,&quot; words that have long ago lost their meaning and now just mean whatever the speaker wants them to mean. Don&#39;t buy into their lies or you, too will find yourself speaking and thinking that way. It&#39;s scary stuff.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, feel free to ask and I&#39;ll get back to you as soon as I can. Please note that I cannot disclose the positions I&#39;ve held nor any other identifying information - just know that I was quite high up in an entity that you&#39;ve most likely heard of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cZ7ndjhhps">Multiple cells of the wider Zionist political organization within the United States. I can reveal that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has mainly been manufactured and maintained by Zionist leaders who know that their days are numbered once there is no enemy. It feeds right into their claims of antisemitism and oppression, and allows the restriction of speech and actions further and further each day.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cZ7ndjhhps">This &quot;war&quot; is essentially a proxy war between the Zionist leadership and the people of the world. No side will ever win, but as long as war is maintained, the Zionists can assert their influence. Obama was briefed on this, as has been every president since the creation of the state of Israel.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe there is truth to this, far as it goes, but the Zionist ship is leaking already through arrogance and the internet. Things here in the USA are happening slower than Europe and the rest of the world, as usual, but the abrasive Netanyahu is making a lot of Americans (including American Jews) go &quot;hmmmmm.&quot;</p>

<p>Israel may well be the chosen people, but they have fallen out of favor with God in the past and been humbled. Time is a circle, and their latest stumble is well under way. There do seem to be a lot of Jews who know the story, who know that their faith has been undermined by Luciferian types, but I&#39;m not sure they&#39;re in any kind of position to do anything about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something that I&#39;ve been researching more and more lately is the history of families such as the Rothschilds. I think its hard to deny that they were somehow connected to this at least in the past if not now. With it being historically common for Jewish families to change their names it makes me wonder if possibly some people of power we hear about every day who&#39;s names aren&#39;t Rothschild are actually biologically related to them and/or married into the family. The same goes with other families like them that worked their way into positions of power that aren&#39;t necessarily Jewish by heritage or faith. An example being the claim that Anderson Cooper is part of the Vanderbilt bloodline. From what I hear you don&#39;t have to be Jewish to be a Zionist, which makes sense but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s true.</p>

<p>Are these families that we actually hear about just scapegoat &quot;boogeymen&quot; to mislead us or is there any validity in claims that families like the Rothschilds are close to the top of this scheme?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I was just down at the shops - and I saw the cops hauling away 2 white junkies, so I&#39;m not about the accept this &quot;cultural Marxism is leading to white degeneration&quot; crap. The poor behaviour of certain white people is the degeneration of white people - that is to say; we&#39;re doing a fine job of degeneration without anyone&#39;s help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The documentary you&#39;re citing as supporting the possibility of &quot;Cultural marxism&quot; was made by a sociologist and fan of Max Webber - a field and a theoretician would would be described as a product of &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; by theory proponents.</p>

<p>To quote from Max Webber&#39;s Wikipedia page:</p>

<p>&quot;Against Marx&#39;s &quot;historical materialism&quot;, Weber emphasised the importance of cultural influences embedded in religion as a means for understanding the genesis of capitalism&quot;</p>

<p>To show you that&#39;s the documentary maker (Adam Curtis&#39; viewpoint):</p>

<p>&quot;As a consequence, he has often been described, or dismissed, as a leftwing ideologue. On the contrary, he says, he is inspired by the liberal sociologist Max Weber, whose outlook challenged the &#39;crude, leftwing, vulgar Marxism that says that everything happens because of economic forces within society&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p>Source: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2015/jan/04/adam-curtis-bitter-lake-documentary-iplayer">http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2015/jan/04/adam-curtis-bitter-lake-documentary-iplayer</a></p>

<p>So yes, I don&#39;t think the documentary you&#39;re citing (which I&#39;ve seen many times) nor it&#39;s maker - supports the &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; conspiracy theory. If anything it dismisses it, and aims squarely at Capitalism as the source of today&#39;s cultural manipulations (if any).</p>

<p>Yeah I don&#39;t believe that culture by itself creates Marxism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cZ7ndjhhps">Multiple cells of the wider Zionist political organization within the United States. I can reveal that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has mainly been manufactured and maintained by Zionist leaders who know that their days are numbered once there is no enemy. It feeds right into their claims of antisemitism and oppression, and allows the restriction of speech and actions further and further each day.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cZ7ndjhhps">This &quot;war&quot; is essentially a proxy war between the Zionist leadership and the people of the world. No side will ever win, but as long as war is maintained, the Zionists can assert their influence. Obama was briefed on this, as has been every president since the creation of the state of Israel.</a></p>
