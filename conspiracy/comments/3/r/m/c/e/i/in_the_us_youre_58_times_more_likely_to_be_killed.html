       58? That seems low.

       Cops kill multiple Americans every day. Terrorists kill a small number of Americans in ultra rare events and slightly larger numbers of Americans in exceptionally rare events.

       I think it would have to leverage an improperly broad definition of the term, "terrorism" to classify it as that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though the US government sure as fuck has enjoyed broadening that term to include everything from actual terrorism (violence perpetrated against civilians in the hopes of driving political change) to sending text messages or rude hand gestures made in the general direction of law enforcement officers.

       Since it was a false flag that was carried out with the police, I'd say it the casualties go to the police.  Even though no one died.

       "Terrorist" is the perfect word because its definition is intentionally vague but the image you conjure in your head is a guy in a turban waving an AK-47.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you ask people on the street to define the word they can't do it. They sputter like the question was paradoxical. It's much like the word "socialism." Most people are against it but they can't even define it. American propaganda is truly magnificent in that regard.

       Your chances are not higher.  If cops kill 50 percent white people, and 30 percent black people, considering only 10 percent of the population is black, then your chances are in fact higher of being shot by a cop than if you were white

       It's so dumb to compare police officers and terrorists like that. Police officers sometimes have to kill people to keep themselves or others from dying, also some people commit suicide by cop.

       Don't 60% of americans have drugs in their system? But those are legal, so I guess it's ok?

       It's interesting to see that you are ok with the prison industrial complex and police system that supplies the "clients". And I bet you are the same kind of person who brings up North Korea's incarceration rate while ignoring the fact that ours is higher?

       You really have a biased and emotional outlook on the situation. The vast majority of your claims are hyperbole, unverified, or easily refuted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police kill thousands of people in America every year, despite having all of the means in the world to use non-lethal force. If they can subdue a Rhino or an Elephant in the wild, what makes you think a police officer cannot subdue a human being in public without ending their life?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems to me you have been programmed to think a specific way about people who don't abide by whatever arbitrary laws your government has come up with today.

       Give all the guns back! That must be the answer, for your own safety (so cops don't shoot you).

       Mass murder? You mean like the systematic killing of 1100 people? Tell me last year, all the "mass murders" combined they plastered all over tv day in and day out. Did those totals come anywhere near the amount of dead bodies created by police?

       Selling cigarettes?  Eric Garner was resisting arrest.  He is on video saying he refuses to be arrested and will not go willingly with the officer.  He was also never choked.  He was talking the entire time, if he were being choked that would be impossible.  It's unfortunate he died but using his death to discredit police officers is counterproductive.

       I see. So it's a misdemeanour but cops are allowed to treat you like a serious threat as soon as you resist arrest? And I know in both cases, that the officers didn't even yet have evidence of a crime, so all it was were some cops who had a suspicion that perhaps the guy was doing something illegal. In such circumstances, these people are not even yet "innocent until proven guilty", that is post evidence and arrest. So these are just some guys who are suspected of doing nothing really.
      </p>
      <p>
       And he wasn't choking, just died of nothing. Not the cops fault. Yes, that is how we expect to be treated when the police suspect we are committing a misdemeanour.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that is the democratic opinion of the people of the nation, it's all good, but then we need to compare our democracy against other nations and we seem fascist. I've lived in several countries and when shit like this happens elsewhere, it is considered a failure of the police. They are held accountable. But in a fascist nation, people come online to defend the actions of the police.

       Cops are only allowed to treat you like a serious threat if you are one.  I never said cops are allowed to treat you like a serious threat if you resist arrest.  I said he resisted arrest.  The cops job is to arrest this man and take him to jail.  The cops did exactly that.  What did you want them to do after he refused to go with them, ask him "Pretty please?"?
Watch the video.  A chokehold was never used and the cop had his arm around his neck for all of 12 seconds.  That guy was huge and they did what they had to do to restrain him.  The video is right there for you to see.  This is no conspiracy.  Cold hard proof right in front of your face yet you refute it because it doesn't support your side.

       It was a misdemeanor. All the cops had to do was write him a citation. There was no need to arrest him in the first place. If he was selling "loosies", single cigarettes, is that really an arrest situation? Bankers are caught regularly embezzling money, committing fraud, yet they aren't arrested. What was it about that case that warranted arrest? How much was the monetary value of the damages? Less than a $100? So they're going to expend valuable resources taking him down, locking him up, putting him through the court system over a $100 crime? And saying they didn't choke him, he just choked and died, how does that work?

       And when they get arrested for minor drug offences, they are 40 times more likely to go to prison than a white person busted with the same amount of the same substance. And then there is a 90% recidivism rate meaning that if you have been once, you're likely going back.

       Amazing logic. It's not the system, the system that feeds kids from grade school into their future career of convict that's to blame, but an inherent genetic predisposition which shows up in the race no where else in the world but the US.

       Starting when you were very young, they taught you that in order to be a worthwhile human, you needed to be better than others. Of course, this is impossible, but they tweak you and pushed you into believing it. And there was never a chance of it happening. They knew it very well. And they knew how you would respond very well. And they knew how you'd respond down the road when you began to figure it out. And they left doors open for you to take out your induced frustration on and you opened one thinking it was your act. But it wasn't, it was the same act that so many others have done before you, including those that they pitted you against.

       We were talking about how blacks commit more crimes, are more impulsive, and have less intelligence.  This is why they cause so much more trouble with police. These things can be objectively proven.  Your emotional monolog doesn't change these facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tgough being 13% of the US, they account for over 50% of all violent crimes.  Fact.  The average IQ for them, in the US, is 85.  They score much higher in all measured impulsivity tests.  They are quicker to violence due to the Warrior Gene.  Tell me how this is "brainwashing".

       That's a pretty unfair statistic, lets put you, a cop and a terrorist with some munitions within close proximity and see who kills who.

       How many "Terrorists" have successfully killed Americans on US soil in the last 10 years or so?

       Why is it unfair? When it comes to evaluating internal security policy, it is a fair statistic. How often is a person in the US likely to be in close proximity to a terrorist? To a police officer? What should people feel threatened by? What should they be willing to spend money on? Where should they be willing to concede government intrusion into their lives?

       Except when they wear military badges and kill the "terrorists" overseas, and do so with far more success and fervor. Your point is actually the opposite of the truth. How many American cops were members of the army, who have killed Middle Eastern people with their own hands or guns?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now how many alleged terrorists, have flown half way across the world and carpet bombed a million americans like they did to Iraq?
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer? NOT A FUCKING ONE.

      <p>
       You're going way beyond the base statement here.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're more likely to be killed by a cop rather than a terrorist in the US because what we brand as terrorists are hardly present in the US.

       It's the same as saying you're more likely to die in the desert due to dehydration rather than shark attacks.

       Do you think America is inside some sort of bubble? What the United States defines as reality doesn't make it so.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're more likely to be killed by a cop than a terrorist because they don't call little white boys with guns in shopping malls terrorists when they blow away a dozen people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet even if they did count those numbers, cops would still win.

       Not really. I think way outside the box and I've never been a target.

       They seem to target people who have "too high" a concentration of melanin in their bodies, first and foremost.

      <p>
       After that, they seem to be not so fond of people who flee from them.

       If you're high melanin and running, expect to receive a slug or three in your back.
