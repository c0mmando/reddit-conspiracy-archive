       A lot of people have this idea that cures for certain diseases are being withheld because that would kill the industry that treats that. Which is essentially true... However, whenever I google cures for dementia I see tons of countries investing hundreds of millions into searching for a cure. So either the drug industry is going to be killed out, or countries are wasting millions of dollars. What do you think?

       If you already have dementia or Alzheimer's, it's like a bomb has gone off in your brain. No pill or treatment will fix it, in the same way no pill will fix your legs if they were blown off. The cure is to identify the causes and address those before damage happens.

       Other countries can do whatever they want. I was talking more about the US and big pharma here. FDA doesn't allow some drugs from other countries, for this very reason.

       Alzheimers and dementia are a side effect of previous pharmaceutical "help", I think this because alzheimers patients have been found to have high aluminum levels in the brain
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what they are trying to cover up, just like our food industry does with sugar, the damage is done so now they hide the damage by changing labels, definitions, etc
      </p>
      <p>
       If people find out THEN they will spend the money to apologize and "fix"($$) it some more, but until that happens alzheimers is an incurable disease with "unknown" causes

       People tend to use Alzheimers and "dementia" interchangeably, and there are potentially dozens of root causes for, say, vascular dementia, Lewy Bodies, Parkinson's, Fronto-temporal, CJD, and acute issues like fluid buildup. I'd be careful claiming that it's all due to aluminum.

       Those are the definitions I was talking about, that make the person run in circles looking for a costly cure, alzheimers affects various areas of the brain that cause different symptoms, by calling all those symptoms different names everyone becomes separated because all alzheimers patients end up having "different diseases"
      </p>
      <p>
       They do the same thing with adhd and autism, no one knew adhd was a thing until they created that label, before that disease existed parents simply said that their kid is very active or is a dreamer, now we give pills to cure that Disease ($)
      </p>
      <p>
       Its all labels my friend, a disease of the brain very rarely affects the same region of the brain, lets say that one kid cant talk and the other cant walk, the root of the disease might be the same in the two kids, but because the first kid has "cant talk syndrome" he will be treated for cant talk syndrome, the kid with "cant walk syndrome" will be treated for cant walk syndrome and so on,  that's why our hospitals havent fixed shit since smallpox and polio, too much money and money induced confusion in the way
      </p>
      <p>
       We cure the symptoms and not the problem, because the problem is an endless spring of money, and our hospitals run off of profits so they have no choice but to be profitable

       And they "cure" it by prescribing psychoactive drugs with suicidal side effects, so when a patient kills him or herself, the doctors and media and family blame it on the diagnosis, not the drug with suicidal side effects. And others continue to take the drugs with suicidal side effects without knowing...and kill themselves...Makes me so sick and angry.

       Im not comparing dementia to adhd, im comparing the methods we use to diagnose patients, which almost always leads to a misdiagnosis or diverts the attention away from the source of the problem, but no one notices because of the definitions put into place beforehand, the most important part is my two kid example in the previous response

       Doctors are no longer taught to fix problems, hospitals are too big and there are usually multiple hospitals belonging to the same company, the goal is serve as many customers as fast as possible, kinda like a mcdonalds, scary if u think about it, because now the doctors are no longer trained like doctors either, dont get me wrong there are some heroes out there, but if you think statistically and large scale multiplied by time then its inevitable that being a good doctor will become very difficult in the future, doctors will become diagnosers of problems who then give you specific pills for what's bothering you, the source of the problem will remain or be "uncureable" , if you are permanently fixing people in a for profit company then "someone" is not happy, and that means YOU are doing your "job" wrong
      </p>
      <p>
       scoliosis is a great example of this, in the US they simply observe it to see if it progresses or put you in a corset thing which usually does more harm than good, and when the curvature goes far enough BAM you need 200000 dollar screws in your back
      </p>
      <p>
       while the rest of the world magically fixes that unfixable problem, with a bar, lots of time, weights, electric zap thingys, massage, etc, although the spine will never be perfectly straight at least your back isnt fused into a stick
      </p>
      <p>
       Also consider organ prices, if you want a kidney go to india or anywhere other than the US lol, u can buy yourself a house with the money you can save, and yes they are just as good at their job if not better, just cuz its cheaper doesnt necessarily mean its a shittier kidney, just means the US is killing its people slowly

       I know im simply saying that in the US we are taught to handle that problem differently, doctors here believe that waiting followed by surgery is the only cure, the hospitals here choose the money making method and no one even notices this, because thats how we are taught to fix scoliosis, in other words money has taught us how to fix scoliosis

       The cure's in plain sight. There was a big, big "breakthrough" last year about
       <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2014/12/blocking-receptor-in-brains-immune-cells-counters-alzheimers.html">
        blocking EP2
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       What blocks EP2? Silymarin AKA milk thistle. Do a search on PubMed for "Alzheimer's" and "silymarin" and you'll find this has been studied for DECADES with massive success. So it wasn't really a breakthrough, the Stanford folks just figured out why milk thistle works -- but they're not allowed to say which compounds block EP2. Ridicufuckinglous.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       having an increase in "Alzheimer's" due to what Stalin420 is saying. I think "Alzheimer's" is being used as a word to doom people when if they just avoided the things that are contributing to the plaque and added some things like milk thistle and vitamin C, they'd be surprised that their cognitive ability rebounds (mine has, at least - when I start to really screw things up, I make sure to distill my water, cut out the drinking, avoid processed foods, double up on the milk thistle and vitamin C and it's crazy how fast my brain comes back. To be honest, I never really totally cut out the drinking, heh).

       I'm a scientist in the medical field, so I have a bit of an insight.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of diseases are actually still not fully understood as to how they work or how they start.  So before we can even think about curing them we need to understand what exactly it is in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The overwhelming majority of people in those fields would like nothing more than to develop a cure and make sure everyone gets it.  It would be unreasonable for a group to developers something and then not share/produce it.  If one group can do it, it's garunteed another group will come up with it too.

       If there was actually an ironclad cure for cancer, or dementia, there would be no stopping it. Even at your most conspiratorial, if the FDA/PHARMA had death squads and stormtroopers, it would get out. Somebody would leak it out or try to set up shop out of country.
      </p>
      <p>
       The unfortunate truth is that we're only as close as we can get to cures. You just can't hide information like you could pre-21st century.

       There have been things that slip out (for example a lot of people who have cured their cancer using cannabis oils) but there are so many people like you, who refuse to see the overpowering corporate control, the cures/doctors end up being laughed at into oblivion....or worse, for example all of those doctors that kept turning up dead who were treating autism among other disorders. I'm not going to convince you, I jjust think you're wrong and you're way of thinking is naive and I think it's holding us back. I don't see the point in feverishly defending the status quo and the greatness of their "efforts" what is the negative outcome of these discussions? People questioning what they're told? People looking into alternative/new treatments? Hopefully you can at least understand that... It makes no sense to basically keep saying "look guys no ones covering anything up... There's no cure" as if that's not the dominant message already.

       I don't think we are on the same page. You're entirely missing my point. You are regurgitating the most common narrative. We are all told the data shows no cure, etc.... But yet people still pop up wanting to research new ideas.... What good comes from entering those discussions just to say "hey in case you missed what we've all been told..., there's no cure, nothings wrong here and everyone's doing everything they can." it's a defacto way of discouraging the conversations.

       I don't think that you're nticure... No-one in their right mind would be... I'm just trying to point out how it's- useless at best, and detrimental at worst- to speak down to people that think there may be some kind of control over research into these cures and diseases. Or people who are curious about alternatives/cures that may have worked but never gotten the attention... I'm sure part of the reason for miscommunication is due to the internet... We are both probably reading each comment in a very different tone than is intended. All I mean is... If people want to research possible coverups or corporate bias involving these issues, why not?. I think it's harmful to post a bunch of comments saying what we are all already told and (to me) making it seem like a ridiculous thing to think otherwise. We already have a cover-up of a potential cure with cannabis oil, who's to say it doesn't go further.... With that said, I really do need to get to bed. Have a good night. Again, none of this is meant to assume anything about you or your motives I'm just trying to highlight how it may steer the conversation and come across to unbias readers who might be trying to form an opinion, peace!

       If a small lab created it, and say a company like Pfizer lobbied the FDA (corrupt government bureau) to block it, because
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       wouldn't profit. FDA passes the info to Pfizer, they develop it, patent it and stop it from being released. That is what our country has come to. There is no profit in cures, only treating people.

       Phage research is a good example of this - most of the research is in Eastern Europe, and it's completely unpatentable, so US companies won't touch it due to the casheesh issue - but it may well fucking be our last gasp chance fighting antibiotic-resistant superbacteria...yet it languishes, because greed.

       You're not wrong.  The business side is exactly that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the science side is quite different.  What I'm getting at is that we (the majority of scientists) wouldn't hold the advancements back.  Either for selfless reasons, or just wanting your name to get published, we want our work out there.

       Too many of you want your work out there so badly that you don't care if it's really your work anymore. I can't wait until more researchers and scientists stand up against this shitty system vs. accepting the cash and putting out crap science. Cornell and their Big Food industry-funded "Junk food is good for you study" that made the rounds today, good gawd, give me a break - how do these "researchers" live with themselves? The money ISN'T that good, the public has seen the checks these morally bankrupt losers have cashed. They're tiny, it's sad as hell.
