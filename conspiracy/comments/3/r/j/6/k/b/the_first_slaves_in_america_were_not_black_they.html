    <div class="md"><p>i would say the very first slaves were Native American.</p>

<p>Long before the transatlantic African slave trade was established in North America a transatlantic slave trade in Indians had been occurring since the very earliest European arrivals. It was used as a weapon of war among the European colonists and as a tactic for survival among Indians who participated in the slave trade as slavers. It contributed to the fierce decline in Indian populations after the coming of the Europeans along with devastating disease epidemics, and lasted well into the eighteenth century when it was replaced by African slavery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it was a little easier to rise up since their work payed  for their trip and they were given land and payed after their service.The black slave remained a slave and their children became slave and so forth.As you say it doesn&#39;t fit into the narrative because there is no comparison between African slaves and indentured servants from Ireland.You would have to be a fuckin moron to compare the two.I think it&#39;s hilarious some people actually think they have an argument ender with this bullshit.&quot;Oh you were slaves?I&#39;m Irish and my people overcame that and made something of themselves.&quot;Oh my god.Get a fuckin clue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea this party involves thought and discussion based off of facts and statistic. Its true your not the only one to make baseless claims here and then get offended when asked for facts but we try to weed them out.  But my bad for asking for a source to your all inclusive statement that irish slaves were working off debt. But its all good because im sure the civil war for you was about slavery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flourishing rage for entertainment value causes more ripples then you see at face value. Take care with that and please dont be offended. Just converse. I did not attack you I just asked for a source to your claim. B/c I was taught that in the years before African slaves more then 50k irish women and children were sold into slavery. So I was asking for source material that was in contrast to that. thats all. No word war. Just communication</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only 7 years difference, far fewer Irish and sold for a far shorter time.  </p>

<p>As far as the Chinese thing, this is flat out wrong.  Chinese began arriving in significant numbers until well over 200 years later (The U.S. didn&#39;t control CA until the mid-19th and Mexico didn&#39;t enslave them).  Further, while they were often essentially indentured servants upon arrival, they were not bought in China and resold here, but rather emigrated voluntarily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The word slave comes from <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=slave%20orign%20word&amp;amp;oq=slave%20orign%20word">slav</a>, as in Eastern European people.  Europeans have been slaves since Roman times.  <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=kidnap">Kidnapping</a> was a form of white slavery, &#39;indentured servitude&#39; was also commonly slavery.  The Islamic caliphates captured and enslaved any number of Europeans for sex slavery, same with the Barbary pirates.   To break the matrix, there were also blacks who owned blacks   Jews were also heavily involved in the slave trade since the Roman times, which is not surprising to anyone who knows anything about the Talmud.  Michael A Hoffman II wrote the definitive book on the subject.  <em>&quot;They were white and they were slaves&quot;</em></p>
