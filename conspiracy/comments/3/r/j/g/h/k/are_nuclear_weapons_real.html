    <div class="md"><p>Yes, nuclear weapons are real.  There are heavily documented testing series, by multiple countries.  There are radioisotopes which did not occur naturally prior to nuclear weapons testing, but are ubiquitous now (Strontium 90 is one).  There are documented effects of testing and its resultant fallout on people, animals, and the environment.  Specifically, the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki did well-documented damage to people and infrastructure.</p>

<p>Certainly its <em>possible</em> that videos and documents could be faked.  But how are you going to fake the mass introduction of man-made radioisotopes into the environment?  Even if you could, why?  Are you going to fake the decades long Hiroshima population studies as well?  </p>

<p>~The lasting legacy is not evidence that nukes exist. Santa Claus, King Arthur, and Freddy Kreuger have lasting legacies. Is that proof they are real? </p>

<p>No I didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Thank you for not accusing me of lacking in logic, but your other accusations are false. Understandable, but likely projections. I didn&#39;t argue <em>everything</em> you said as you seem to think I did. I implore you to actually read and think about my objections.</p>

<p>I pointed out a couple of things that really are not proof at all. Saying that Japan being bombed is proof of Japan being bombed by nukes is not valid proof. Saying that something has a legacy is not proof.</p>

<p>I did not discount out of hand all of your arguments. I cut out the useless fat so we can now scrutinize the meat. Do you understand? I don&#39;t need you to explain to me A is for apple. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>~It&#39;s use and effects in Japan is not evidence that it exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yeah, that addresses your first two &quot;No I didn&#39;t&quot;s</p>

<p>I never listed &quot;Japan being bombed&quot; as evidence.  I listed the effects related to radiation, eyewitness accounts and speed of their surrender.  Hell, they were bombed for years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Saying that something has a legacy is not proof.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem here is that Freddy Kreuger&#39;s legacy is not tangible beyond film accepted as fiction.  Eyewitness testimony, medical results, radiation levels, devastation patterns, shadows burned into walls et. are tangible and not fiction, not because I say so, but because these things are there or at least recorded and corroborated in the extreme.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot more but you <em>did</em> deny the two things you deny denying, so I don&#39;t see the point in formulating long winded, cogent arguments.  I just get the point at which something becomes evidence for you.</p>

<p>The essential problem is that you are not asking for evidence you are asking for proof:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do understand. However, this is not proof it is real, either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I go back to prove anything.  You simply can&#39;t.  There is not a single thing that can be proven to someone contrarian enough.  That&#39;s why the justice system uses &#39;proven beyond a reasonable doubt&#39; because someone could always come up with some essentially impossible thing otherwise.</p>

<p>As far as &#39;beyond a reasonable doubt&#39;, 99.99% of people with any grasp of history would consider the existence of nuclear weapons to be proven.</p>

<p>You misunderstood me. As I said evidence of it&#39;s use and effects in Japan is evidence it exists. IOW: I am questioning the evidence that nuclear bombs were used in Japan. you present to me as evidence the <em>assertion</em> that bombs were used in Japan and there were effects of it. I&#39;m saying that you have to be more specific. What are the effects? What is the evidence that it was used in Japan? Saying that their are eyewitness accounts is specific evidence that it was used in Japan. Simply saying it was used in Japan is <em>not</em> evidence that it was used in Japan. Make sense?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, aside from eyewitness accounts, there&#39;s video (I believe of the explosion) and certainly of the aftermath.  There&#39;s the accounts of the hundreds of people involved in retrofitting and loading the two planes as well as of their crews, records of Japanese communications saying that the entire city had been wiped out by one plane, probably other stuff.  The rest would be after the fact.  Radiation sickness, decades of high birth defects and miscarriages in the area, measures of radiation at the sites and a really eery one is shadows burned into walls; more I&#39;m sure.</p>

<p>Do you believe they don&#39;t exist? If so, presumably you also believe all the nuclear weapons are fake?</p>

<p>Or do you believe they don&#39;t exist, but all the nuclear weapons are real? Because that&#39;s illogical.</p>

<p>Fair enough. Well as I believe nuclear weapons are real:</p>

<p>For you to believe nuclear weapons don&#39;t exist, it would follow that you&#39;d have to also believe nuclear weapons are fake - would you agree with that?</p>

But what a lie it would be, to tell the masses that those in power have the ability to basically vaporize the very elements within our bodies and our surroundings.

<p>Nuclear weapons are something that is very core to most people&#39;s understanding of the world.  Fake nukes is too big a lie to possibly be true.  If this can be a lie, then they would have to throw out too much of what they consider to be &quot;solid truth&quot;.  For instance the fact that so many nations claim to have weapons programs.  Would not some nation out the fraud?  In order for this to be possible the power structure of the world must be very different from how it is pictured by most people.  So the idea is rejected.</p>

<p>Physicist Galen Winsor who worked at, and helped design, nuclear power plants in Hanford, Washington; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Morris, Illinois, San Jose, California; Wimington, New Jersey had some interesting things to say about this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejCQrOTE-XA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejCQrOTE-XA</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nuclear weapons are another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sULjMjK5lCI">Freemasonic hoax</a>, one of the many false beliefs conditioned into you by the globalists.</p>

<p>Hiroshima and Nagasaki were firebombed, just like Tokyo and Dresden. A close examination of the photographic evidence shows <a href="https://i.imgur.com/50I0Xmm.jpg">obvious photo-manipulation</a> (to the Photoshop generation) and the other photos show the results of an extended firebombing campaign (wooden structures destroyed, stone structures standing).</p>

<p>Radioisotopes can be found because the US Government was testing the efficacy of dirty bombs with nuclear material, trying to create a more deadly weapon.</p>

<p>Nuclear weapons are pseudoscience that a little knowledge of nuclear physics can dispel. Neutrons released from fission are moving so fast that without a moderator to slow them down to thermal energies they are very unlikely to be re-absorbed by fissile nuclei where they could cause more fissions. Thus the chain reaction cannot be sustained without the presence of a moderator.</p>

<p>The government scientists handwave this away, claiming they have a &#39;special geometry&#39; that somehow not only invalidates this but also creates half-dome explosions. That &#39;special geometry&#39; is a national security secret, so anyone telling you that they fully understand how nuclear weapons work is lying, because it depends on national security secrets.</p>

<p>From SL-1 to Chernobyl to 3 Mile Island, the result of a mass of nuclear fuel undergoing an uncontrollable chain reaction is meltdown: the fuel itself literally melts, the vessel containing it melts, and the secondary containment boundary explodes from steam pressure. In every nuclear accident in history, there is no &#39;half-dome&#39; explosion, no mushroom cloud, no ruins where everything wooden is burned and everything stone is still standing. Those are Hollywood fear fantasies of a magical superweapon ideal for controlling a gullible and traumatized public.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re concerned about real weapons, the American empire proudly displays its research into swarms of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyguXoum3rk">flying killer robots</a>, and the current President and Nobel Peace Prize winner has launched over <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2014/01/23/more-than-2400-dead-as-obamas-drone-campaign-marks-five-years/">390 covert drone strikes in his first five years of presidency</a>, killing over 2,400 people. <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/veterans-urge-drone-operators-to-refuse-orders-to-fly-surveillance-and-attack-missions/5456274">US Veterans Urge Drone Operators to Refuse Orders to Fly Surveillance and Attack Missions</a>.</p>

<p>I started studying the mechanics of atomic weapons maybe ten years ago, so I had this particular info in the back of my mind. I&#39;ve been aware for a long time that most of the science was out in the open, but that there are just a few keys withheld on the basis of national security. </p>

<p>And knowing this, I figured I&#39;d get a good laugh when people started to tell me I&#39;m stupid for not understanding the physics behind it. I probably understand the science farther then they do. Far enough to understand that its not all explained. </p>

<p>So what do you think about environmental weapons? HAARP? Or are such things red herrings?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started reading with an open mind, knowing deep down this was going to turn stupid. I was not wrong. </p>

<p>When someone gives you evidence for nuclear weapons being real, you counter argument everything. Fine to a point, I suppose. But when someone gives evidence to say they don&#39;t exist, you just agree. You do not apply the same type of thinking/criticism. I think your mind is made up mate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>wrong. i have mostly received only insults from people who say they&#39;re real.</p>

<p>You are just another one.</p>

<p>as for me not criticizing sources that say its fake? that&#39;s because they&#39;re actually giving me substantially new information. I CANT criticize what they say until after i&#39;ve examined it at length. people who say nukes are real are either insulting me or giving me things that i&#39;ve already heard. therefore things i&#39;ve already considered and have my own objections to. and when i apply my questions to them, they dont answer my retorts, they start insulting me. </p>

<p>have a nice day. </p>
