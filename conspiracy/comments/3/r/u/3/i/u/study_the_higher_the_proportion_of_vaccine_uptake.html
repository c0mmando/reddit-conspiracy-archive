<p>&quot;Using regression analysis and controlling for family income and ethnicity, the relationship between the proportion of children who received the recommended vaccines by age 2 years and the prevalence of autism (AUT) or speech or language impairment (SLI) in each U.S. state from 2001 and 2007 was determined. A positive and statistically significant relationship was found: The higher the proportion of children receiving recommended vaccinations, the higher was the prevalence of AUT or SLI. A 1% increase in vaccination was associated with an additional 680 children having AUT or SLI.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;The results suggest that although mercury has been removed from many vaccines, other culprits may link vaccines to autism. Further study into the relationship between vaccines and autism is warranted.&quot;</p>

The reality is they will have privately done the study, realized the vaccines create highly profitable disease, then either binned the studies or locked them away.</p>

<p>The irony in this is overwhelming, given that at the time of her &quot;study&quot;. she was on the Executive Board of the anti-vaccine group SafeMinds. Absolutely no possibility of any &quot;conflict of interest&quot; there! And, look, the results she found were right in line with her existing beliefs! I am SHOCKED by this!</p>

<p>So, no counter-arguments offered against the many and significant criticisms presented there of the study. Good to know. But, hey, a quick heads-up for you. I prefer to have my medical studies carried out by people who possess some actual <strong>experience in medicine</strong>. Your mileage may vary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The data is only as good as the study design and unfortunately this one is not very good at all. I don&#39;t mean to belittle you for being concerned over the safety of vaccines and the immoral practices of big pharma. However, I really think it&#39;s important to approach this issue objectively: keep it separate from your ideology, resist emotional/populist appeals and educate yourself enough to not only come to your own, independent conclusion but also so you can lead others in doing the same. If the autism/vaccine link is true, it&#39;s a HUGE deal and needs attention. However, not being responsible in your approach will only lead to alienating people who blindly accept the conventional wisdom and lead to your message being further discredited. It&#39;s easy to write someone off when they have poor arguments even if they&#39;re right.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;m open to the idea that there could be a link between autism and vaccines, but having reviewed different findings and studies, I have yet to find compelling evidence that it is the case. It could absolutely be a real phenomenon and certainly warrants analysis and further research, but only provided that the research is conducted in a rigorous and well-conceived manner. There have been cases in the past where vaccines were causing real problems (like Guillain-Barré syndrome) and it took some time to raise awareness to have the problem addressed. That said, Guillain-Barré syndrome is potentially a deadly condition, as are many childhood diseases we vaccinate against like measles, mumps and rubella; autism is not deadly, so until there&#39;s a strong, independent scientific consensus one way or another, it seems irresponsible not to vaccinate children early in life. Personally, I&#39;ve only gotten the flu once in my life and I&#39;m relatively young and healthy, so I don&#39;t bother getting the flu vaccine. To me, it&#39;s a simple matter of the apparent benefits easily outweighing the risks.</p>

<p>Regarding this article, as a <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/117/4/1028">previous study</a> showed, the increase prevalence of autism is likely the result of a broadening of the criteria used by educators for the purpose of special education planning that took places over the 1990s-2000s. Consistent with this, the prevalence of other &quot;diagnoses&quot; fell over the same time period. I write &quot;diagnoses&quot; because neither of these articles use data collected from actual clinicians capable of testing and diagnosing someone with autism or any other sort of medical impairment. The study I linked to is very clear that this is the case, while the author of the study OP posted leaves this important bit of information out. If the author had taken this into consideration, she would have a very tough time convincing anyone there was an actual increase in autism prevalence since the 90s at all. There could well have been an increase, but the data are unclear and do not support that conclusion.</p>

<p>Moreover, the author of this paper lumps together the students with <em>putative</em> autism and those who have <em>putative</em> speech or language impairments (I say putative because, again, these students may not have ever been officially diagnosed). The rationale for this is completely mystifying to me. SLI refers to a host of different conditions, caused by both physical and cognitive impairments, the etiology for many of which are well understood and treatable in ways that clearly distinguish them from autism spectrum disorder. If the cause of some of these conditions are known, why not exclude them from the analysis? If there is a correlation between vaccines and ASD and certain SLIs, excluding conditions known to be unrelated to vaccination would give you more statistically significant data (due to a bigger signal to noise ratio). This is another weakness of the data set she used; it did not contain crucial details that would be needed to refine the analysis. To me, the SLI data should have been completely excluded from the analysis for this reason alone.</p>

<p>Another major shortcoming of this paper is how little it appears to keep in mind that correlation never implies causation, and because of that you need to take into consideration all possible biases and account for them whenever possible. This paper fails to do that with one of the most common biasing factors: an increase in incidence of a given diagnosis within a given demographic VERY OFTEN reflects an increase in that demographic&#39;s access to medical care. It&#39;s pretty logical: the more often you go to the doctor, the more likely he or she will notice a problem. This is especially true of spectrum disorders (like autism) where symptoms may be mild and/or vary considerably among patients; more visits, more chances the doctor will notice it or that the parents will bring up some concern. It stands to reason that children who received the full complement of vaccines are more likely to have been screened for developmental and cognitive disorders, including autism, early on and have had their parents notify their schools. Conversely, children who didn&#39;t have such good, consistent care may more easily ultimately fell through the cracks and their difficulties go unnoticed. This paper makes no effort to remove this bias, which is hugely problematic as the goal of this paper is to understand ASD&#39;s etiology. Not taking this into account (which is impossible given the nature of the dataset the author used) at best is bad science and at worst seems to reflect the author&#39;s clear anti-vaccine bias and her agenda.</p>

<p>Similarly, another biasing factor (which I touched upon earlier) is that some increases in incidence of certain diagnoses are reflective of an a change in diagnostic criteria. This could be due to an broadening of those criteria (which is precisely what happened with ASD through the 1990s) or the adoption of more formalized, specific guidelines removing the grey area of potential differential diagnoses along with greater awareness of a given condition (this is the case with ADD/ADHD over the past couple decades). Not accounting for this (which is actually possible given the data set used) favors the author&#39;s apparent agenda and is inconsistent with previous research on the matter.</p>

<p>In any case, as I said I don&#39;t mean to attack anyone in particular for their beliefs, but as always it&#39;s important to be very critical when it comes to accepting things as hard facts. Just because something <em>feels</em> right to you, or reflects your personal ideology or validates concerns you may have, does not mean it&#39;s true. Yes, Pharmaceutical Companies have been guilty of publishing misleading articles with poor experimental design and/or of spinning their data to support their agenda to make more money. Clearly, this is not OK no matter who is doing it. The author of OP&#39;s article is absolutely guilty of this as well. Her heart may be in the right place, sticking up for consumers and it may not be her intention, but as I described above and in the link another user posted, it is clear that she has misinterpreted her findings. If we&#39;re to speak out against powerful entities like Big Pharma, we have to be well educated <em>and</em> be sure the evidence we have is compelling. HIV/AIDS denialists relied on bad science and knee-jerk, populist appeals over facts; their propaganda was compelling to the uneducated, but their lack of good research methods and evidence contributed to the deaths of many people before they were proven wrong and their fallacious beliefs appropriately exposed and disgraced. Hopefully, science will progress to better understand mechanistically how autism manifests as it would make testing different contributing factors a lot easier.</p>

<p>I know it can be especially hard for people who lack much formal Science education to assimilate this sort of information, but it is irresponsible as parents and as citizens in general, to actively perpetrate misleading or false information when the consequences could be so dire. You have the tools to educate yourself and have access to scientists like me and many others on Reddit who would be happy help you get the tools you need to be able to fully appreciate scientific literature.</p>

<p>Otherwise, and this is completely separate from what I wrote above, autism is very much a part of someone on the spectrum&#39;s identity and as such I see the goals of and the rhetoric used by most anti-vaxxers as being <strong><em>extremely</em></strong> problematic. It is not a disease or a proper impairment that needs to be cured; like many inborn traits, it may pose difficulties to those who have it, but ultimately, it represents nothing more than an alternative, atypical way the brain processes and priorities information. The idea that its eradication or &quot;cure&quot; is worth potentially hundreds or thousands of children to die preventable deaths just to prevent more people like them from existing is hurtful and completely dehumanizing. The struggles people with all but the most severe cases of autism experience are largely the result of a neurotypical society and what it imposes on them and expects of them. Like everyone, people with autism have both talents as well as shortcomings, and ultimately some have an easier time than others assimilating into society in a manner that&#39;s meaningful to them. If it were reverse and most people were higher up on the spectrum, the world may well be better off for it. As it stands, strategies to help autistic people function better in society and have happier, easier lives are of course great. But to focus instead on its being completely expunged from humanity, as anti-vaxxers and questionable charities like Autism Speaks seem to support, is nothing but a eugenics campaign and is beyond reprehensible to me.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I hope people take the time to read this and that they&#39;ll consider it.</p>

Funds created to help those who were injured by vaccines have been found only  0.000164% of those who received vaccines to be injured by them. I&#39;m not going to cater to your paranoia. I&#39;m just going to make sure that myself and my family are safely vaccinated. And when one of the poor few who haven&#39;t been vaccinated comes down with something that could have been avoided, I&#39;ll make sure they get medical treatment and understand that what they are going through is their parent&#39;s fault.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see why I should take this study at face value as vaccine proponents seems to take all studies that come to other conclusions as shit science. Seriously, every single one, many done by very reputable institutions are all regarded as flawed, and yet I am supposed to take studies supporting vaccines as flawless. I simply am not qualified to understand the complexities and nuances of one study or another. I will however continue to be skeptical by the simple reasoning that the big pharma has been implicated in numerous scandals as a quick google search will reveal and that vaccine injury fund in the us has paid out 3.5 billion dollars in the last decade. I take this fact alone as proof that vaccines can sometimes be very dangerous indeed as the government isn&#39;t in the business of giving handouts for nothing. I will also take this as proof that the government is involved in a cover up with vaccines producers as they have used this fund to pay off injured families thereby shielding vaccine producers from being taken to court. </p>

<p>I do also recognize that none of these facts  prove anything about the efficacy of vaccines; however, they do clearly indicate that any thinking person should approach vaccination from a defensive position. I do not claim to have reached any conclusions myself, but you&#39;re link is just one of many and I have no reason to think the conclusion of these authors is any less or more flawed than the conclusion of other research with different conclusions. You may and probably will attack me for my position and so be it. I am within my rights as a parent to withhold vaccines from my children and like millions of others I will continue to do for the time being. I remain open to rational discussions and will continue to actively learn more. But I will not just accept what the government wants me to think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. I actually do see merit to what you&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>The big problem with vaccinations &amp; autism though is that autism is mental. You can&#39;t perform experiments on something like this (e.g. with alcohol, you can require a test subject to induce alcohol and then measure their blood alcohol level). With autism, it&#39;s based on observational data. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Hill_criteria">Observational data must satisfy the Bradford Hill criteria to be valid statistically.</a> Smoking &amp; lung cancer satisfies the Bradford Hill criteria because the effect is so strong! But the risk associated with vaccines is actually super slim.</p>

<p>I actually don&#39;t doubt there might be a small relationship between autism and vaccinations, but it just can never be statistically significant. I think that&#39;s the thing: until we can &quot;measure&quot; autism and the actual &quot;effect&quot; a vaccine compound has on it when exposed at different dosages, the OP&#39;s experiment just can&#39;t be used safely as evidence to warrant not trusting vaccines.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not your reason not to trust vaccines, and I get that. There might be something going on re Big Pharma. But I suppose the big push recently is because of the <em>risks</em> associated with not vaccinating are so much worse. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26240325">There was a really cool article discussing this recently.</a> They basically shifted their focus onto education showing the effects of not vaccinating instead of just trying to tell people that autism wasn&#39;t caused. They showed some voluntary anti-vax participants a true account from the mother of a measles child, a picture of a child with measles, and read out its death rate. (please note, I have a subscription to <a href="http://www.scopus.com/">SCOPUS</a> so can read it - I would have to screencap it if you want to read it too)</p>

<p>That&#39;s the crux really. There might be an increased risk of other things like autism, but the increase is so small compared to the health risk that vaccines prevent. Measles can kill. Autism cannot. And in reality medical risks are unfortunately everywhere - every surgery involves a similarly small risk of serious infection, for example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of them really fall for the propaganda, whereas others have worked out what&#39;s going on, they don&#39;t vaccinate their own children.</p>

<p>That will be great if you send the study over to your doctor!</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one of the best places for people from a scientific background to get educated, it&#39;s a group of presentations given from the world&#39;s experts at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/VaccineSafetyConf">Vaccine Safety Conference</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s also a video of when the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dh-nkD5LSIg">CDC used to admit freely on television that vaccines were causing Autism</a></p>

<p>In case you haven&#39;t seen this before, here are the comments of Dr Peter Fletcher, former UK Chief Scientific Officer at the Department of Health, he had access to documents which were being kept from the public.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;it is the steady accumulation of evidence, from a number of respected universities, teaching hospitals and laboratories around the world, that matters here. There&#39;s far too much to ignore. Yet government health authorities are, it seems, more than happy to do so.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>...</p>

<p><strong>&quot;the refusal by governments to evaluate the risks properly will make this one of the greatest scandals in medical history&quot;</strong></p>

<p>...</p>

<p><strong>&quot;There are very powerful people in positions of great authority in Britain and elsewhere who have staked their reputations and careers on the safety of MMR and they are willing to do almost anything to protect themselves.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>....</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Clinical and scientific data is steadily accumulating that the live measles virus in MMR can cause brain, gut and immune system damage in a subset of vulnerable children,&quot;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think evaluating a potential link between autism and vaccines is harmful per se. I mean, to make informed decisions, people need information. </p>

<p>The problem I have is that anti-vaxxers seem to think autism is so bad that to &quot;cure&quot; it warrants potentially causing hundreds or thousands of preventable deaths. This is crazy to me. What they fail to even consider is that autism only represents an alternative way for the brain to work. It has its inherent strengths and weakness, but its part of someone&#39;s identity and most of the problems it poses are due to these people living in a majority neurotypical society. As such, <em>the final solution</em> these people are after, of curing humanity of autism, is nothing but a eugenics campaign to dehumanize and then eliminate people who are different to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t use real controls in their safety studies, only ever comparing with another vaccine, they are not interested in mid or long term studies, just checking for a few days post vaccination, whereas autoimmune disease can appear 2-6 months after vaccination, but nobody looks...so it will be &quot;Just a coincidence!&quot;, they never compare Unvaccinated V Vaccinated, the most obvious study to do, but there&#39;s always an excuse.  What that last one really means is that they know that study won&#39;t look good, as the vaccinated are full of allergies and autoimmune diseases, after their immune systems have been cluster-bombed with the vaccine schedule, so there&#39;s no way they can show you the reality.  Of course, that&#39;s perfect for the pharmaceuticals, as an immune system which has been cluster-bombed is highly profitable, as it leaves the individual dependent on expensive drugs for the rest of their life, to treat their symptoms</p>

<p>Vaccines are simply shots in the dark, everyone who goes to investigate finds out the same in the end, it is a good argument because it&#39;s the reality, listen to the doctors who are speaking out, they are begging for something to be done, but Big Pharma are resisting as safer or no vaccines mean healthy unprofitable people.</p>

You can choose to believe these anecdotes and cry foul of coverups, but I contend that it is not possible to cover that kind of thing up.

<p>Also there is no scientific link between vaccines and autism so stop your misinformation.
You come across the same to me as a person who would deny the holocaust, which is also ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi
I&#39;m sorry to hear you have autism and I&#39;m curious as to why you think there&#39;s nothing wrong with it. While I certainly believe you, it&#39;s not something I wish I had. There&#39;s nothing &#39;wrong&#39; with have a broken leg, but it&#39;s still broken and certainly causes problems. There&#39;s nothing wrong with it per se, but it&#39;s not something you&#39;d want to get if you had the option of not getting it is it? </p>

<p>The poster I was talking to certainly had many credible scientific links showing there was a connection between autism and vaccines not to mention many other problems, here are a bunch of link they sent me. I haven&#39;t looked at them all in great detail yet (but plan on it) however, the one&#39;s I did look at certainly seemed to be legitimate. I&#39;d be curious to hear your opinion on the following </p>

Professor Gordon T. Stewart, Emeritus Professor of Public Health, Glasgow University, explains exactly the dangers of the Whopping Cough vaccine

&quot;the marginal advantages of the vaccine in children over one year of age have to be offset against adverse effects of the vaccine itself, which are very common indeed and may be followed occasionally by irreversible brain damage, paralysis and mental deficiency. Because of this danger, or for fear of it, many parents and doctors are reluctant to vaccinate their children.&quot;

Key quotes below:-
Dr. Johnston, pg. 14-15 &amp; 19-20: &quot;The data on its toxicity (shows) it can cause neurologic and renal toxicity, including death.”
Dr. Weil, pg. 24: &quot;There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest that we’ve got a serious problem.&quot; .... &quot;the potential for aluminum and central nervous system toxicity was established by dialysis data. To think there isn’t some possible problem here is unreal.”
Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 31: &quot;we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes.&quot;
Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 44: &quot;Now for speech delays, which is the largest single disorder in this category of neurologic delays. The results are a suggestion of a trend with a small dip. The overall test for trend is highly statistically significant above one.”
Dr. Bernier, pg. 113: &quot;So we are asking people who have a great job protecting this information up until now, to continue to do that until the time of the ACIP meeting. So to basically consider this embargoed information.&quot;
Dr. Johnson, pg. 198: &quot;This association leads me to favor a recommendation that infants up to two years old not be immunized with Thimerosal containing vaccines if suitable alternative preparations are available.” ... &quot;I do not want that grandson to get a Thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on.&quot;
Dr. Weil, pg. 207: &quot;The number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant. You can play with this all you want. They are linear. They are statistically significant.
Dr. Brent, pg. 229 &quot;we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits&quot;
Dr. Clements, pg 247- 249: &quot;that I am very concerned that this has gotten this far, and that having got this far, how you present in a concerted voice the information to the ACIP in a way they will be able to handle it and not get exposed&quot;
Dr. Bernier, pg. 256: &quot;just consider this embargoed information, if I can use that term, and very highly protected information&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people get confused because Autism is a wide spectrum, so there are natural types which have always been around, these types are mild, many don&#39;t know they&#39;ve got it, often these people are actually good at Maths/Programming and not so good with social skills.  Whereas the vaccine type is regressive and severe, a perfectly healthy child regresses into severe Autism after a vaccine, they find it difficult to communicate, many bang their heads against the wall, they cannot function independently in society, they either stay with their parents or go into care.  It was very convenient to hide away this form neurological vaccine damage under the label of Autism, instead of giving it a more specific name.  It means that there are many people who get confused, like the poster Xadnem, and get confused between different types of Autism, thereby confusing the vaccine link.</p>

<p>Also worth noting that there are paid pharmaceutical posters all over Reddit, they will try their best to confuse the data even more by writing fictitious anecdotes in an attempt to throw people off the scent.</p>

<p><a href="/u/spiritmee">/u/spiritmee</a>... is listing off the typical copy pasta that anti-vaxx pop-media commentators list --it has been debunked over and over yet when they are confronted they do not respond to the actual question that is pertinent to what this copy pasta does and does not prove.  </p>

<p>When you think you know more that hundreds of doctors and scientists that have millions of hours-worth of education between them say, you know you are arrogant.  Just like this anti-vaxx &quot;naturopath&quot; mom is arrogant enough to let her children suffer for 6+ months <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2015/11/04/horrifying-suffering-caused-by-treating-pertussis-naturally/">http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2015/11/04/horrifying-suffering-caused-by-treating-pertussis-naturally/</a>  is arrogant she did not even listen to her own father that a least is a veterinarian and familiar with dogs that get bordetella and die without treatment with judicious antibiotics and supportive care.  </p>

<p>When you, yourself, spiritmee... have taken college courses [with B+ averages or better] on microbiology 101, A&amp;P 101, and pharmacology 101, <em>then</em> come back and debate with people that have, otherwise you are fooling yourself that you understand the first thing about vaccines. Knowing the list of what is in a vaccine is not sufficient to understand anything about their uses and dangers. You need to know about another class you need to pass = toxicology --if you know <em>anything</em> about toxicology tell me the first rule of toxicology and how it applies to vaccine ingredients....No cheating and Googling it --it is easy to remember. At least the doctor, you thought was so ignorant, knows it by heart without a Google-U &quot;education&quot;.     </p>

<p>Next time you get a wound, and question the use of a tetanus vaccine, why don&#39;t you try to go with out it? <em>Not</em> your child, but <em>you</em>, yourself, go with out a vaccine for tetanus after the vaccine booster is out of date for you. Don&#39;t make your child suffer tetanus symptoms and the rest of your arrogant ignorance of <em>very</em> basic medicine.  Ever hear of Dunning-Kruger syndrome? That explains why so many like you have the arrogance of ignorance--read about it. Or rabies, next time you get bit by a rabid animal will you go without the rabies vaccines? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Autism (or the way someone&#39;s brain works in general) influences and shapes someone&#39;s identity very much, so the idea of &quot;curing&quot; or eliminating autism reflects a desire or preference that they themselves and people like them be eliminated, which is obviously harmful and dehumanizing. Most of the problems people with autism face are due to their living in a majority neurotypical society, and little else (aside from those with very severe cases).</p>

<p>I have never read a case involving severe/very low-functioning autism that had sudden onset, as you&#39;ve mentioned. It seems inconsistent with our understanding of brain development and how higher cognitive function works. I have, instead, heard of many cases where certain symptoms or behaviors were neglected or just went unnoticed until the child began acting out over even minor frustrations, especially with respect to communication. In many cases, the signs were there all along, but the parents didn&#39;t notice or made no effort to address them. Reporting can be difficult because parents may feel the need to lie so they don&#39;t appear negligent and, unfortunately, vaccines have become a convenient scapegoat. I&#39;m happy to be proven wrong, but it would take a good amount of compelling evidence gathered through well designed studies with sound analytical methods to change my opinion in any meaningful way.</p>

<p>I obviously think such severe cases should be treated and research should continue to help those effected lead easier, happier lives. But I don&#39;t think eradicating a certain demographic would in any way benefit humanity. Personally, I&#39;m against eugenics; I would have thought most people would be as well, especially after the whole Holocaust thing, but obviously YMMV. Sometimes people will disagree with what you have to say simply because you are wrong and your belief is harmful; it&#39;s not always because there&#39;s a conspiracy to silence you. If any of this makes you uncomfortable, feel free to call me a shill and continue blaming others for your lack of agency in the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speak to the parents, there are millions around the world, perfectly healthy child, then their child gets a vaccine, gets very sick, soon after they are never the same again.  The CDC used to admit vaccines were causing Regressive Autism, freedom of information shows us that the CDC doctors privately admit it, even a CDC whistleblower has now come forward and admitted the studies were thrown in the bin.</p>

<p>The latest science indicates that vaccine Autism is being caused by a vaccine-induced autoimmune disease of the gut, this prevents the body from being capable of producing the correct nutrients for the brain to function effectively, hence why a strict change of diet has been shown to improve the symptoms of vaccine-induced regressive Autism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The existence of <em>bona fide</em> regressive autism is still unfortunately questionable, for some of the reasons I mentioned before dealing with the validity of retrospective reporting and analysis of subjects. Basically, it&#39;s unclear whether is it distinct from early-onset autism or if it is just early-onset autism that got diagnosed late.</p>

<p>That said, there does seem to be validity in the idea that improper immunological responses may contribute to severe cases of autism. Consistent with that, holistic measures (such as diet, as you mentioned) as well as direct biochemical manipulation of the immune system can achieve similar immunomodulatory effects and both of these have led to improved symptoms in some patients. There are also claims that brain trauma (as with significant inflammation due to an improper immune response) could play some role as well. Obviously, I hope there is more research into this because there&#39;s so much contradictory data out there in these cases it&#39;s hard to make sense of what&#39;s what, especially if it&#39;ll lead to kids leading more normal lives. But this is to be expected when the condition is so rare.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also interested in what you mentioned about improper nutrients playing a role; it sounds feasible, but I&#39;m not familiar with the data that supports that claim. It&#39;s definitely something I&#39;ll follow up on, so I appreciate the tip.</p>

<p>With all that said, strong adverse reactions to vaccines are so rare that I still don&#39;t think it warrants not vaccinating your children in most cases (maybe not the flu vaccine every year, but definitely MMR and other childhood vaccines as well as perhaps hepatitis and HPV in most cases). It certainly rubs me the wrong way that governments might try to force their citizens into getting vaccinated, but at the same time, the threat to public health if everyone stopped being vaccinated is pretty dire. To me, it seems like the best course of action would be, assuming regressive autism is a proper, distinct subcategory of autism, to figure out what triggers these adverse reactions in these few cases. If the causative element of vaccines can be proven, then hopefully their formulation can be reworked to eliminate that possibility of adverse reactions. Alternatively, if no direct link can be found, a means of screen people who are more at risk for such severe reactions would be quite beneficial. From a public health perspective, you only need to provide herd immunity, so excluding what would presumably be a small fraction of children shouldn&#39;t really be a major concern.</p>

<p>Of course, another important aspect of this debate is the absolute necessity of rigorous, high standards with respect to how a study is conceived, designed, and executed as well as how its data are collected, analyzed and reported. Clinical studies are much more challenging than basic science because there are so many variables and biases to consider and attempt to control for. The standards in the study this thread links to falls very short from what I (or any scientist in all likelihood) would ever accept, and therefore doesn&#39;t seem to warrant consideration. It&#39;s really shocking to me that this study was published given just how completely substandard the analysis was carried out and presented. It&#39;s definitely a shitty situation as the rich and powerful are heavily favored with respect to influencing the narrative of the debate by funding studies and awareness campaigns geared at allaying concerns over potential risks of their products. But that doesn&#39;t mean we should accept sub-standard work because it favors the little guy.</p>

<p>Well, seeing as you are clearly a retard yourself for denying everything actually scientific when there is so much evidence provided against your case, I am amazed you are actually capable of stringing together a sentence on the internet.</p>

<p>Also I really believe strongly in vaccines, but don&#39;t take my word for it, there are plenty of real world results that support my claim.</p>

<p>And by the way, you don&#39;t have a valid claim to speak in the name of actual autistic people over how we experience anything.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve very welcome!  </p>

<p>The vaccine your son received is one of the most dangerous vaccines and induces Asthma in 1 out of 5 recipients.  It&#39;s also known as the &#39;Crib Death&#39; vaccine as &#39;Crib Death&#39; only ever occurs shortly after this vaccine.  Hopefully your son is OK, but sometimes vaccine-induced autoimmune diseases, such as Diabetes Type 1, don&#39;t show up for 2-6 months post vaccination.</p>

<p>Tetanus is a disease of poor wound hygiene, it&#39;s mostly a Third World problem as they use rusty and dirty scissors to cut the cord of newborns.  In the First World it&#39;s incredibly rare, it would mostly be seen in someone with severe burns.  Even if you do get Tetanus, it&#39;s not a big deal, you take a course of antibiotics to deal with it.  The vaccine is causing so much more harm than any theoretical good, especially when you consider that most people who get Tetanus were already up to date with their Tetanus jabs, so the vaccine isn&#39;t working in the first place, it&#39;s a completely unnecessary risk.</p>

<p>For more information like this I&#39;d recommend Dr Sherri Tenpenny and Dr Suzanne Humphries, they&#39;ve both researched in depth, they are honest, not sold out the corporations, they compare the risks against the benefits of vaccines, they also point out how corrupt and illogical the system is.</p>

<p>&quot;the marginal advantages of the vaccine in children over one year of age have to be offset against adverse effects of the vaccine itself, which are very common indeed and may be followed occasionally by irreversible brain damage, paralysis and mental deficiency. Because of this danger, or for fear of it, many parents and doctors are reluctant to vaccinate their children.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Weil, pg. 24: &quot;There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest that we’ve got a serious problem.&quot; .... &quot;the potential for aluminum and central nervous system toxicity was established by dialysis data. To think there isn’t some possible problem here is unreal.”</p>

<p>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 31: &quot;we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 44: &quot;Now for speech delays, which is the largest single disorder in this category of neurologic delays. The results are a suggestion of a trend with a small dip. The overall test for trend is highly statistically significant above one.”</p>

<p>Dr. Bernier, pg. 113: &quot;So we are asking people who have a great job protecting this information up until now, to continue to do that until the time of the ACIP meeting. So to basically consider this embargoed information.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson, pg. 198: &quot;This association leads me to favor a recommendation that infants up to two years old not be immunized with Thimerosal containing vaccines if suitable alternative preparations are available.” ... &quot;I do not want that grandson to get a Thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Weil, pg. 207: &quot;The number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant. You can play with this all you want. They are linear. They are statistically significant.</p>

<p>Dr. Brent, pg. 229 &quot;we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Clements, pg 247- 249: &quot;that I am very concerned that this has gotten this far, and that having got this far, how you present in a concerted voice the information to the ACIP in a way they will be able to handle it and not get exposed&quot;</p>

<p>Additional info: deep puncture wounds that occur outdoors are the most likely to cause tetanus.</p>

<li>Are you seriously downvoting me for providic clarification as to how Clostridium tetani infections occur?</li>
</ul>

<p>Tetanus infection is painful, severe, and can be fatal for 1 in 10. You might want to avoid routine vaccination because you are opposed to many of the ingredients, but you should be aware of what the risk could be if the exposure is more likely to cause the infection. The whole point of being an informed patient is actually knowing all the risks versus benefits. Dumbasses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been over 15 years of reading vaccine studies every day, the science they use to backup vaccines is incredibly weak, they are essentially just playing games with statistics, if they don&#39;t want to find something they don&#39;t look for it.  If they accidentally find something bad they don&#39;t publish the study.  If a researcher doesn&#39;t prove what you want you stop using them, find someone who gives you the &#39;results&#39; you desire.</p>

<p>One more I forgot, this is an award-winning documentary and is suitable for those from a non-science background (and those from a scientific background), they allow both sides to make their case.  You&#39;ll notice that most of the key pro-vaccine people have conflicts of interest, such as holding vaccine patents worth millions of dollars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes you think LucyCohen knows what she&#39;s talking about?  Because her fears are consistent with your fears?  When you look at a study showing a correlation between vaccines and autism, do you ask yourself, what confounding variables might be skewing these results?  Because this is essential, especially when dealing with observational studies.  In an experiment, theres a good chance they took extra measures to control for these confounding variables, whereas in a survey, you can&#39;t very well.  For example, places that vaccinate more also have a tendency To have better mental health care.  When looking at An increase in rates of autism, ADHD, etc. you have to factor in whether diagnosis rates are what&#39;s really growing.</p>

<p>In order to control for confounding variables then, you need to do an experiment.  To do this, you take your theorized explanatory and response variables and assign subjects at random to either a treatment or control group, and then look for a correlation.  Now, for an experiment t of this nature, there are ethical ramifications for doing such a study on humans, though there was a recent study performed on some type of monkey I believe. It was funded by an anti vax group no less, and carried out at a university (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/lens/pnas/112/40/12498">EDIT: Here is a link to the study</a>).  And guess what, they didn&#39;t find any indication that vaccines increased the rate of autism.  Which means that in the survey linked by OP, it was truly confounding variables that were showing the correlation.  A confounding variable being a variable that has a linear relationship with both the explanatory and response variable.</p>

<p>Your only concern here should be taking care of your children as best you can.  Fears are easily manipulated, so use your brain to analyze data you come across instead of blindly obeying your gut.  Just say NO to anecdotes.  Do your homework, and make sure you&#39;re following sources that are scientifically valid, instead of ones that don&#39;t control for other factors but just because they confirm your fears they win by default.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did use my brain. Thanks. I went to see my doctor and guess what, when I asked about formaldehyde and mercury in the vaccine she didn&#39;t know. So she called the rep, she didn&#39;t know. They called a doctor at the company, turns out there are these ingredients there. So that sure doesn&#39;t inspire confidence. Imagine getting into a plane and asking the pilot, hey what does this button do? don&#39;t know... how about this leaver, don&#39;t know let me ask the guy who sold me the plane. I mean, come on that&#39;s unacceptable. 
Then I asked what are the odds of being injured by a vaccine, she didn&#39;t know. Who is responsible in Canada if my child is injured. Again, she had no clue. What are the odds of getting tetanus, no clue. So honestly, she can&#39;t be trusted and I don&#39;t really care what school she went to as she doesn&#39;t know the basics, how do you explain this? </p>

<p>Top top it off, she cited an recent example in disneyland where a bunch of people contracted the measles and tried to tell me dozens died. Well that was a flat out lie as I looked it up and no one died, not one! Fear, stupidity, group think and education seems to be a particularly dangerous and common combination. </p>

<p>Not to mentioned the repeated claims on the genius sub know as the top minds of reddit that I should be murdered, castrated and have my children taken from me etc...all for asking questions and reading. By a bunch of people claiming autism is good! </p>

<p>Honestly, it&#39;s rather enlightening to listen to the counter argument because none of them are based on substance. </p>

<p>Furthermore, when I look at this list of studies </p>

<p><a href="http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.co.uk/2007/06/no-evidence-of-any-link.html">http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.co.uk/2007/06/no-evidence-of-any-link.html</a></p>

<p>that show a link to autism, the sources seem rock solid. For example, the first 5: </p>

<p>Division of Epidemiology and Surveillance, Vaccine Safety and Development Branch, National Immunization Program, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 1999. </p>

<p>CM Gallagher, MS Goodman, Graduate Program in Public 
Health, Stony Brook University Medical Center, Stony Brook, NY</p>

<p>Neural Dynamics Research Group, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of British Columbia,</p>

<p>Journal of Toxicology</p>

<p>Department of Biology and Biotechnology Center, Utah State University,</p>

<p>Many of the genius around here have argued that these are bad studies, without providing any such proof while in the same breath trying to argue that hey, autism isn&#39;t so bad. I&#39;m sure some of these studies might be skewed, but there are many many more surely they can&#39;t all be. </p>

<p>The comment I&#39;ve read so far by many others have been pure vitriolic and hate (not yours which is why I answered you) so it seems to be the top minds of reddit are some of the most vicious and uninformed not to mentioned closed minded and by all appearance stupid. Honestly, their best arguments are just ad hominem attacks against me, I mean seriously, time to change the name of that sub to moronic circle jerk</p>

<p>I am informed and I do use my brain hence the reason I stopped dead in my tracks when my own doctor can&#39;t answer the most basic questions. Why should I trust someone who&#39;s uninformed, and how can a pediatrician with 15 years of experience specializing in vaccines not know what the basic ingredients are in vaccine? My cousin is a vaccine researcher and he too didn&#39;t know. Sound like a bunch of dumb asses to me. </p>

<p>In this case I did vaccinate my child despite my doubts. </p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to have a rational conversation with anyone, but so far almost no one seems to be able or willing to do the same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, your primary care physician certainly could have addressed your concerns in a better, more honest manner.  Makes me glad my mother found such a good physician who I still go to to this day.  When he&#39;s busy and I need to see someone else, oftentimes the doc I get isn&#39;t near as good at answering questions.  Like one time I went in to see a doc for what I think is <a href="http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/tc/pityriasis-rosea-topic-overview">pityriasis rosea</a>, and how does he help me?  By printing out a web article on it.  Gee thanks, glad I drove all this way for that.  So I think I understand the frustration of seeing a doctor that isn&#39;t fully invested: though I suppose in your case it was at least nice of them to make those phone calls instead of just pulling something out of their ass.</p>

<p>Still, they probably should have spent more time discussing the risks associated with very small amounts of formaldehyde and mercury, beyond just finding whether the vaccine has these things or not.  Obviously having a lot of mercury in your system is a bad thing, but lunch at the sushi bar or having a tuna fish sandwich will likely expose you to more mercury than you&#39;d get from a vaccine.  Radiation is bad too, but we eat <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/radiation-chart.jpg">bananas</a> all the same.</p>

<p>You need to go beyond, &quot;well that name/school seems reputable&quot; when vetting sources.  You MUST analyze methodology.  That is where the truth between discrepancies can be found.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s hard to do so with just the abstracts you provided.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s their method from the first link &quot;We categorized the cumulative ethylmercury exposure from thimerosal containing vaccines after one month of life and assessed the subsequent risk of degenerative and developmental neurologic disorders and renal disorders before the age of six. We applied proportional hazard models adjusting for HMO, year of birth, and gender, excluding premature babies.&quot;  From that, can you tell me how they actually conducted their research?  Hell, I can&#39;t even tell if its an observational study or an experiment.  So only having access to a bunch of abstracts, instead of the details of any of the studies is a huge red flag to me.</p>

<p>I am informed and I do use my brain hence the reason I stop dead in my tracks when my own doctor can&#39;t answer the most basic questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A totally fair reaction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this case I did vaccinate my child despite my doubts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you indicated in your earlier post.  I just didn&#39;t want to to feel guilty for doing so because of what Lucy was saying.  She may have a lot of links, but I don&#39;t care about a sea of links that would take an eternity to comb through when you can&#39;t point to one source in particular and say &quot;here is the full study and here is how it was conducted.&quot;  Did Lucy read any of the 100 studies in full?  Did one stand above the rest as proof positive?  If so, why isn&#39;t that one source being singled out?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My doctor did her best, but clearly she didn&#39;t care. As she called the company and pretended to care, and I asked if I was right if it would make any difference in her recommendation. I bet you can guess her answer. </p>

<p>According to her, and most others around here, there are no risks. </p>

<p>As for absolute proof, it&#39;s not likely to happen; however, one undisputable fact-- as it comes from the horse&#39;s mouth--<a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/data.html">http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/data.html</a> is that total compensation paid over the last 10 years of the vaccine injury compensation fund is &quot;approximately $3.2 billion.&quot;  To me this is proof that vaccines certainly are dangerous at some level anyway and certainly more profoundly than anyone around here is willing to admit. </p>

<p>Furthermore, there&#39;s endless examples of corruption and scandal in the pharmaceutical industry, google it if you don&#39;t believe me. That also adds to the overall understanding and assessment of the situation. </p>

<p>You seem nice and measured so it&#39;s my pleasure to talk to you, but you should read some of the ridiculous arguments coming from others around here, it does nothing to add to their credibility. </p>

<p>I can also guarantee you one thing, if there is lunacy coming from one side of the argument it is not coming from the anti vaxers I&#39;ve met anyway, all the hatred and vitriol is being spewed by people who couldn&#39;t argue their way out of a wet paper bag. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree that there haven&#39;t been adverse reactions to vaccines, especially the further back in time we go, but the important point to consider is whether the risk from getting a vaccine is less than or greater than the risk of not.</p>

<p>Medical malpractice exists, but it&#39;s not like we should stop getting surgeries performed or seeing doctors because of it.  Measure risks, then take the relatively safer option.  Eradicating polio was worth the costs, because polio fucking suuuuuuuuucks.  And vaccines have gotten considerably safer over the decades.  Public vigilance is likely a factor in this, but it&#39;s important to temper the vigilance with realistic expectations, and not expect to have a PERFECT solution to address a perceived flaw.  No solution is perfect, so we just have to analyze our options and take the smartest risk.  Vaccines tend to be safer than the alternative in such cases when you run the numbers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The top 6 or 7 of these studies are genuine studies saying that vaccines=autism. 4 of these recommend further studies, 1 of them is fraudulent, and 1 of them has only been tested in mice. The ones beneath obviously weren&#39;t even checked by the author as they range from studies on the effects of mercury in tuna meat on the human body, to studies on environmental effects on autism. In short, they do little to nothing to support your case. Some even detract from it. Your &quot;article&quot; is a mess in which the &quot;author&quot; (blogger?) plugged a couple keywords into google and copypasted anything that seemed vaguely related. I call BS.

    <div class="md"><p>Last point...why are they so keen to push vaccines given that the science is so poor?  Well first they make money from the vaccines, they don&#39;t have to pay out when a vaccine damages a person&#39;s health, so standards can be kept low (i.e. cheap), but the key point of all is that the pharmaceuticals make money per sick person, so by inducing autoimmune disease in a fair % via the childhood vaccine schedule, they leave their victims dependent on drugs for life, it&#39;s essentially a lifelong tax which gets paid to the pharmaceuticals in return for drugs which treat your symptoms.  Vaccines are a vital part of the pharmaceutical business model, without vaccines there would be less than 20% the number of sick people, the size of the industry would be decimated if vaccines were to be stopped/outlawed.</p>

<p><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008382">Peer-reviewed study showing vaccines cause autoimmune disease</a></p>

<p><strong>&quot;Systemic autoimmunity appears to be the inevitable consequence of over-stimulating the host&#39;s immune ‘system’ by repeated immunization with antigen, to the levels that surpass system&#39;s self-organized criticality.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>So why isn&#39;t this all over the news?  First there&#39;s a lot to learn, not many people have the time or inclination to spend time on this.  Most people in the industry are paid off or have a financial interest.  The industry demonizes any doctor who dares to speak out against vaccines or even dares to ask basic questions about their safety.  The TV channels are dependent on selling on pharmaceutical adverts, if any channel or newspaper dares to speak out they&#39;ll fast be approached by top pharmaceutical lawyers with threats, they&#39;ll be accused of &quot;Irresponsible journalism&quot;.  Even the Internet now is overrun by pharmaceutical paid posters and paid articles, that makes it harder for people exposing the reality of the situation to get heard.  </p>

<p>There are more people who know than one thinks, many don&#39;t speak out as they want to fit in socially, but behind the scenes they are not vaccinating and they are well-aware of the dangers and madness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you even read this study?</p>

<p>1) It&#39;s in mice</p>

<p>2) The authors concluded that repeated exposure to high levels of antigen were most likely to lead to autoimmunity. Vaccines are a one time exposure to low antigen levels. You know how you get a high level of exposure? An infection. The authors cited in particular <em>an outbreak of measels in unvaccinated adults</em> which led to a high rate of autoimmune disease.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The question of how autoimmunity is triggered can therefore be deduced to the quantitative response of host against immunizing antigen, i.e., the ability of host to present and/or cross-present antigen. It then follows that the ability of certain antigens such as measles virus to cause autoimmunity may be due to their ability, in conjunction with its ability to present antigen, to overstimulate CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells of certain hosts beyond integrity of their immune system. Living organisms are constantly exposed to a broad range of environmental antigens, as exemplified by the recent re-emergence of measles virus infection among a subpopulation of Japanese young adults who were not vaccinated against the virus. We therefore conclude that systemic autoimmunity necessarily takes place when host&#39;s immune ‘system’ is overstimulated by external disturbance, i.e., repeated exposure to antigen, to the levels that surpass system&#39;s self-organized criticality, and propose here ‘self-organized criticality theory’ explaining the cause of autoimmunity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s amazing how people can read an article, take one sentence out of context, and then use it to present the article as saying the exact opposite of what it&#39;s actually saying.</p>

Rather, her poor study design and biased presentation are far more likely to show that she is wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t have to read through too much more to see that the scientific community is pretty annoyed that anyone actually thinks this study can be taken seriously.</p>
