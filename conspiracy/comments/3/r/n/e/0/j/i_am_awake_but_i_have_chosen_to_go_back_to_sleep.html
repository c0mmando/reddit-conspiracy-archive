       I know all about the Federal Reserve, TPP, World Bank and WTC 7.  I know Kissinger referred to us as useless eaters and soldiers as dumb animals. I am fully aware that baby Bush didn’t win his 2nd election but was allowed to continue being president anyway.  I wouldn’t trust him to watch my dog yet no one thought it was strange that this clueless dolt was allowed to occupy the white house. I can go on and on about the eugenics program which existed and probably still exists in America and the worldwide pedophile ring which serves the elites. I know I know I know but where once I declared, “I’m a human being and goddamit my life has value”, and was mad as hell and wasn’t going to take it anymore my attitude has shifted to, “Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel belted radials and I won’t say anything.  Just leave us alone.”
       <br/>
       Over the past few years I’ve alienated all my friends, the majority of who went to college, earn a good living, have no worries and don’t see what I am always so upset about. I considered breaking up with my SO because she began saying I was just paranoid but would not look around at the world and what was actually going on.  I recently had to face the fact that I could make a thousand signs and dress in black and throw rocks at cops and not a fucking thing would change. The only result is that sincere people with positive intent get maced, beaten and locked up. Voting is a joke but I don't have to tell you that.
So now every morning when I take a hot clean shower I remind myself that I am lucky to have a job, live indoors and be able to eat whenever I want. On top of that there is coffee, Art Bell, movies, legal pot and Irish whisky to help me hide from the ugly truth of our toxic and unceasingly evil civilization. I can’t take the stress and anger and frustration and hopelessness anymore so I am going back to sleep. I am very disappointed in myself.

       It is stressful to maintain the duality of knowing that there are so many things wrong all around us while still being a functioning member of that world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think I will ever make the choice you are describing.  Instead I work on not restricting my internal thoughts while being sensitive to those around me in what I choose to communicate.  The verbal and non-verbal feedback I get from a person in a conversation tells me how far I can go and still have the person want to talk to me again in the future.  I don't think it is right to force knowledge on people no matter how important it is to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you have to be careful in the signals you give off yourself while discussing issues where you might not be in agreement with someone else.  If you are speaking too quickly, becoming excited, etc then the actual words being used will be ignored.

       A big theme in a brave new world was that promiscuity would become a way of life, and that it would be expected from citizens. To not be promiscuous is the mark of an outsider...the behavior of one who does not enjoy life as he should.

       This is good advice.  As for the first thing, if you are surrounded by people that don't think like you do, that don't accept your worldview and shut you down or out if you talk about what you're passionate about--you're surrounded by the wrong people.  People who are toxic.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to find the others.  Pick a problem you feel the most passionate about and which you feel you'll have the most impact on.  And volunteer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I gave this advice to myself-- just joined ae911truth as a volunteer local action group.  I think it will put me in touch with more people like myself, as I am like you, increasingly alienated, specifically by being surrounded by the 911bodysnatched / mindcontrolled minions who don't see the dome of illusion we're under.

       do you take an interest in any particular religion? I myself have thought about it time and time again. it's been 2000 years. surely whatever "god" is out there understands religion has been commandeered and distorted by the powers that seek to control us, and that it's just impossible to believe one over the other. is all religion false? I've changed a lot about myself at least to the point of being kind to everyone and trying to understand the inner workings of human emotions and how to resolve conflicts peacefully and strengthen friendships.

       7 years of Catholic school. High school principal turned out to be a pedo. I have a friend who is a zen monk and went to meditate with him a few times. I do try to be kind and understanding to other people. I was a real prick when I was growing up and am trying to make up for it.

       I'm not sure how long you've been "awake", but my advice would be to keep going on your journey; you have not arrived yet. Many people get paralyzed by all the evil here on Earth, but the Universe is about so much more than all this nonsense. I get what it feels like to look up at all our problems and feel completely helpless, we've all been there. But don't let the powers that be take away your soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       We literally create our own reality by our thoughts and actions. You want to do your part in changing the world? Open yourself up to love.. love for yourself and for your peers. Don't get frustrated when they can't see what you see, even if they make fun of you for it. They don't know any better, and are merely a product of their environment, culture, and upbringing (which as we know, has been completely fucked).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an even greater truth than anything that is talked about here on r/conspiracy. Nobody's saying to do nothing about these problems. Everyone has their path in life, and if this is your path, then so be it. But there are many ways to change the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever you do in life, do it with love and compassion, not hate and fear. You have so much more power than you realize.. that is the biggest secret you've yet to uncover. Keep going my friend.

       Dude. The whole point of being "awake" is to be able to enjoy the ride. Enjoy the inevitable decline into oblivion.  We are still climbing to the top of the peak.  I can't wait for the rapid desent, what a rush it will be.

       I felt like this at times, but then I kept going and saw the little changes that I was making in the people around me - gave me tremendous hope.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do what you believe in, and have confidence in it. People pick up on that positivity and stability, they envy your knowledge for that is giving you that power. They slowly do come around.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're missing is hope. I know that being awake makes you see the miserable path the humanity is following, but you have to keep having hope that change, when it happens, will be rapid and powerful enough to overturn the course of humanity completely. And that change is something you can participate in, even at a very proximal level - with your friends and family.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to be very patient with people. They may be ignornant and misinformed, but they're still 'vulnerable' to your influences.

       "The authentic human being is one of us who instinctively knows what he should not do, and, in addition, he will balk at doing it. He will refuse to do it, even if this brings down dread consequences to him and to those whom he loves. This, to me, is the ultimately heroic trait of ordinary people; they say no to the tyrant and they calmly take the consequences of this resistance. Their deeds may be small, and almost always unnoticed, unmarked by history. Their names are not remembered, nor did these authentic humans expect their names to be remembered. I see their authenticity in an odd way: not in their willingness to perform great heroic deeds but in their quiet refusals. In essence, they cannot be compelled to be what they are not." - Philip K Dick

       you've taken the sickness of the world
       <em>
        onto yourself
       </em>
       . imo, you should have contained your anger, i get you want to
       <em>
        express
       </em>
       it; but it does scare people close to you, 'cause they don't get it. i agree with you, what "normal" person wouldn't be angry?
      </p>
      <p>
       displaced anger will quickly shut people down. this isn't easy for those who take all this seriously, it's not just "something to talk about", because some of us are being effected in our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        you can't pretend you don't know what you know.
       </em>
       having knowledge &amp; living
       <em>
        as if
       </em>
       you don't is a waste.  maybe you need to have an outlet? some kind of exercise, doesn't have to be anything major. a short walk, get close to nature, in a park, get "grounded": plant something, volunteer time to whatever interests you. but first, make the time to chill from all the info.
      </p>
      <p>
       turn that anger towards
       <em>
        doing something
       </em>
       positive. no one person can change the world, what made you think you could? (&lt;&lt; i'm joking with you), that's what someone said to me once. take a breather, your health is most important during times of stress, don't be your own worst enemy.

       I work at a non-profit resettling refugees and you would think my coworkers would be interested in the world at large. They never wonder why thousands and millions of people are being constantly displaced and aren't interested in learning. It is easy to hide from news, alternative and otherwise.

       I don't think there is anything wrong with taking time off from thinking about the "worlds problems," to get your own house in order. I can't read this kind of stuff everyday myself. I stand by however, waiting for the proverbial "alarm to sound," if it truly ever does. When/if it happens. I'll be there and you can be too. Plus you will look a lot less paranoid to your friends. Whose house will they all run to if everything goes wacky? "Jim you talk about this all the time. You know what to do right. That shit is real as fuck" haha

       It's channeled material from the early 80's. The group came in contact with Ra and they had a q&amp;a for a few years. 
It resonates stronger than anything else ever has with me spiritually. It changed my life. It answered my questions and left my seeking more. It's not for everyone but try to keep an open mind.
