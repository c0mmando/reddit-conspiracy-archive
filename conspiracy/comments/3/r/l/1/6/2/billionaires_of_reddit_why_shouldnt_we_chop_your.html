       I don't think decapitating another human for collecting or inheriting a bunch of imaginary "currency" that everyone idolizes in our planet's current paradigm will accomplish much. Your question only reiterates just how decayed and broken our global monetary system is. The state of the world we live in today will not continue because it cannot. Change is constant. We will either evolve to a utopia or fail catastrophically as we have previously, time and time again.  If you truly believe a violent revolution is the next necessary step then we have already lost.  "I have a dream"
       <strong>
        BANG
       </strong>
       "All you need is love"
       <strong>
        BANG
       </strong>
       "Whenever you are confronted with an opponent. Conquer him with love"
       <strong>
        BANG
       </strong>
       "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country."
       <strong>
        BANG
       </strong>
       I think it's pretty clear what message the controlling elite fear most and its not "Let's lob off the heads of the rich and take all their stuff." at the end of the day you will still be playing their game, on their court, by their rules.

       Er, yes, the rich are not the only real impediment to solving real problems. We must also do away with  the social artifices that permitted them to gain wealth at the expense of others. Otherwise the poor would just stratify themselves straight into more inequality.

       This is retarded, sorry. It's not about being rich. It's about using your money in ways that degrade society.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are rich because u set-up an efficient business and have a lot of people working for you, you are a good man.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are rich and use it to steal through financial means or don't contribute one bit to society ( financial heavens ), you aren't a good man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop equating powerful ( rich ) to bastards without further inquiry. Some of these people busted their ass and made smart altough not immoral choices and got to the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't blame rich people for the state of affairs. Blame rich thieves, and altough there are a lot of them, it's not richness itself the problem. It is the means they take to their end.
      </p>
      <p>
       No1 would bust their asses so hard if they knew their sons would inherit nothing, and that bring others to try the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       By blaming richness you blame the best and the worst alike.

       You don't know what slavery is, if you equate it to an inheritance tax. Let people start of on the same level and foster a meritocracy. You won't need to hand your kids money, but you could spend some time with them.

       You can't be trusted to weigh in on anything.  You only act for your own personal gain.  I have no desire to just throw everything I do into a big bag for you to devour.  We-- that's the majority of this country-- are now prepared to hurt you if you don't leave us alone.

       I'm not a billionaire, but I will offer an idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some billionaires are involved with the provision of actually useful things.
      </p>
      <p>
       E.g. suppose it turns out that the lead engineer at a water purification plant is actually a billionaire.  (Perhaps he inherited money but he still chose to get educated in a tough job and to work.)
      </p>
      <p>
       In such a case, the execution of that particular billionaire would make society poorer.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the above is just speculation.  I don't know that there are any useful billionaires, although no doubt some people would mention Steve Jobs.

       Popular ideas will receive popular funding. Loans can be for anything from living expenses to startup expenses to donations towards popular projects. There could be an annual limit on donations that comes out to a universal negative income tax or better. You could live comfortably off it, or say you're already making a living you could invest it into your community.

       You have to admit urban camping is fun at times...moving on...the problem with the occupy movement was that no one threw a fucking rock. Not one of the hundreds of people there had the balls to huck a brick through a window. It may not have done much but it would have been better than "sleep-ins" and "sit down and sing" tactics...

       sleep-ins and sitting down and singing might be about as effective as hurling bricks through windows. Either way, if the media is refusing to be complicit you won't be getting any airtime. Throwing blocks will actually lose you points with many people.

       Better idea: form/join local organizations that are making progressive change in your area. Be the role model for a better tomorrow.

       You have to understand how not green his cars are.  The production of batteries is incredibly destructive to the environment.  Beside that, the contemporary power infrastructure is simply not clean.  Tesla only moves the pollution from the oil well, refinery and your tailpipe to the strip mine, factory and power plant.

       I get it, electric batteries are dirty. The main point was that some billionaires give a lot of value to the world like Bill Gates.
