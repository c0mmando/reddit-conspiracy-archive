    <div class="md"><p>I have seriously seen/heard some off the reservation, bought the farm, flew the coupe, government is listening to my brain waves crazy shit in my day fella, but this takes the cake.  My mouth is literally hanging open at just how tinfoil hat this stuff is.  I&#39;m totally flabbergasted.  </p>

<p>I like this sub.  I come here because, who knows, maybe some stuff is close to reality.  I&#39;m unsubbing right now because this is the brand of crazy that gets other people labeled insane.  And I don&#39;t mean the funny kind of insane that you call your friends.  I mean padded room, soft foods, muzzle and med insane.</p>

<p>I do not work for NASA but I can easily take measurements that prove the earth is round just off of the stars and the motions of the sun and planets.  This isn&#39;t rocket science, this is just plain old math that you can do with an astrolabe, pencil and paper.  You can buy a telescope and look at the other <strong><em>round</em></strong> planets in our solar system.  I mean, don&#39;t trust nasa for all I care; but take some actual measurements with actual equipment and do some actual math before you call an assertion like this science.</p>

<p>Gravity works at 9.8m/s<sup>s</sup> everywhere.  I mean come on.</p>

<p>What happens if I walk to the edge lol.  No one has ever seen the edge before?  Does NASA show up and use one of those things from MIB to erase your memory while they move you to the other side lol.</p>

<p>What keeps this magic floating disk from crushing into a sphere like literally every other body we have ever seen in space with any comparable mass?</p>

<p>Why is the earth&#39;s shadow round on the moon?  We aren&#39;t tidally locked to it, so why then no matter where you are on earth when you look up you see a round shadow on the moon?</p>

<p>If you go out on the ocean (and I used to work on sea fairing ships) you can look at the horizon and see the mast of another ship before you see the actual ship...because its beyond the curvature of the earth...</p>

<p>If you go up in a plane you can clearly see the curvature lol I mean come on man this isn&#39;t even grade school stuff this is Galilean shit I mean holy crap.</p>

<p>I bet you get laughed at a lot?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol you banned me from your sub, too bad you cant b&amp; me here</p>

<p>edit:  and I did, I read through about half the links on that page earlier just totally dumbfounded that you people exist.  There is so much BS there its not even funny, and its actually a little scary.  Have you just never been in a plane, or out in the ocean before?</p>

<p>edit 2:  and I just read the part about the plane&#39;s windows being curved.  So I&#39;m going to go ahead and answer for you:  maybe you&#39;ve been in a passenger jet but you&#39;ve clearly never been in a light airplane.  I&#39;ll save you the trouble, many of them have totally flat windows and you can still see the curvature of earth.  Go rent a ride in one and look at it for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not a believer in the &quot;Flat Earth&quot; theory at the present time.  As well, I take issue with several points in the presented video.  However, I am always willing to approach subjects, when presented with potentially &quot;new&quot; evidence related to it, with an open mind, and judge it based solely on its own merits in relation to known evidence on the given subject.  Approaching it in any other manner is a disservice to yourself more than anything else.</p>

<p>As a result of that, when one decides the best course of action in response to a newly presented set of data is to attack the character of the presenter of the set of information based on the way they chose to word a tiny portion of accompanying text  <strong>rather than</strong> the evidence within the dataset, it only reflects poorly on one&#39;s self.</p>

<p>As an incredibly smart man of many talents and of great wisdom once said, &quot;Your assumptions are your windows on the world. Scrub them off every once in a while, or the light won&#39;t come in.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really appreciate your point here. I truly have to agree, it&#39;s unwise to just believe the earth is round because you&#39;ve always been told that. But there are super easy, scientifically replicable experiments that consistently show the earth is round. Explain the shape of the shadow during an eclipse if the earth is flat. OP is insane. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But at what point can we stop lending credence to this absurd notion? You know as well as I do that this sub as been inundated as of late with flat earthers.  In the beginning yes, approaching the subject with an open mind then doing the research and finally countering with facts was my preferred method. But how long must we keep that up?  After doing the same research and countering with the same hard facts time and time again to no avail, why must we keep treating the subject as if it hasn&#39;t been proved already?  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried providing these flat earthers with video proof.  They respond with &quot;It must be fake&quot;.  I&#39;ve tried providing them with simple experiments they can reenact themselves that will recreate the results proving a spherical earth. They respond with &quot;Nope, it&#39;s fake&quot;. </p>

<p>So exactly how long do we have to keep treating their cockamamie ideas with same rational thought that we lend to other subjects when this one has been so definitively proven to be... well... bullshit!? </p>

<p>Why did you say that?</p>

<p>I was one of those people who believed what main stream media says about things, for example take 9/11, to be largely true. I believed the official story for a long time until I did the research for myself, then I realized that the official story can in no way be true and anyone who researched the topic would agree, and most people who do, did. Anyway, yeah I was one of those people. What&#39;s difficult to understand about that?</p>
