       I am just curious if any else finds its highly implausible that the most powerful conspirators, if they do exist, somehow focus thier efforts on the music industry? I feel like there are way better industries to control the masses like oil, food or pharmaceuticals? Maybe its just a branch of a larger organization but i feel like the major focus of CT's  look at the music industry and not the larger picture, any thoughts?

       Are you new to reading up on conspiracies? I figured you are based on how you assume that people who are knowledgable about Illuminati symbolism and agendas already aren't aware that their efforts are not exclusive to any industry. 
These days I don't even know what to call
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       anymore, but there are definitely groups of people who are involved in every facet and industry of life trying to poison people in one way or the other. 
The food industry is indeed being attacked on as well, so are the pharmaceutical industries, just like the music and movie industry. They are attacking humans from all angles to weaken your body and your mind. Just spend a week or two on this forum and you will see various articles being posted from different spans of life, ranging from Genetically Modified Foods to how vaccines or medicines are harming you to politics and more.
      </p>
      <p>
       When talking about this forum exclusively, I actually noticed how little attention conspiracies in the entertainment industry gets and are being discussed.

       OP, Sounds like Youtube was your gateway drug (was for me too), but it's far beyond that. Tis' just the tip of the iceberg. Most people on YT are just creating click bait videos, or are posting retardation, because they have yet to go to the next level of conspiracy theory (or are producing dis/mis info). Hangout here for a little OP, the rabbit hole is deep. As for music, why would they not use it as propaganda/mind control? Music transcends the lines of nationalities/languages/cultures/etc. Catchy tunes and imagery is what people boil down to. For example, Gangnam style by Psi (or w/e). Speaking in a different language, but went viral.

       You in particular. You're response was passive aggressive to say the least. Particularly answering my question, which was sincere, with another question. I am trying to strike up a legitimate conversation as a group while you try to show how much you know about the subject. Well no one gives a ***, you're the gold winner at the special olympics

       It truly is. In the words of George Carlin: "It's a big club and you aint in it". They attack us from all angles. Which is why I turned off the TV and do not listen to the radio/pop music/new music/etc. I've always enjoyed hippie/70's rock music, but even there, there is a conspiracy (Beetles, Doors, Mkultra, CIA psyops, etc). Sigh...

       I suspect the music industry was identified by TPTB as the most effective platform for influencing adolescents and young adults. This group is not reachable via the usual mind-control mechanisms of organised religion, mass media and restrictive "social norms" that TPTB use to control older adults.

       Music is the oldest form of 'mass media'. Long before we developed writing we were singing songs and those songs shaped the world our ancestors lived in, just as modern music shapes ours. Music is essential to religion and always has been. It produces an altered state of consiousness in both the performer and audience, but in the latter case that altered state is
       <em>
        shared
       </em>
       . The tribe dancing around the fire in honour of the storm god share in a mind-altering experience no different to the congregation singing hymns to Jesus, the mosh pit headbanging along to Metallica, or the ravers that follow the beat for hours on end. The CIA programs were an attempt to do what shamans have been doing for thousands of years.

       Yes, music is a huge part of human life. Everyone, well almost everyone listens to music. Music has a huge influence on people. It makes sense that music is being corrupted and used as a manipulation or idea-implantment device. And there are surely more things they can achieve through the control of music, but I don't have knowledge to speak about things like what the rhythm and melodies does to the human mind. It would be great if someone could explain the effects of music on the mind, and especially how
       <em>

       evil music specifically affect us.

       Very good points. Congregational singing is a fundamental pillar of Christian indoctrination. A good hymn (and there are quite a few) was the only thing that made Church bearable when I was a kid...

      <p>
       I suspect listening to music (as opposed to singing) affects you in a slightly different way. The real impact of TPTB music is that the listeners idolise the singers and believe the singers are "on their side" and thus absorb whatever message is being put out without any critical analysis.

       Being born mid 80s I think the most noticeable for myself would be the cultural change in western societies once rap/hip-hop became more mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember the 90s enough to have seen the cultural change into 00s when 50cent, D12, etc became popular. Everyone all of a sudden wanted to be a gangsta. People started wanting to look gangsta, kids instead of riding bikes and skateboards in the street together wanted to run around in groups and fight everyone. Now it's all about money because that's what they're rapping about. Everyone now needs 23 pairs of shoes, a gold chain, 43 hats and a pimpin car they can't really afford. And for girls now, it's all about having a big fat ass that you can shake. These are our biggest aspirations. I remember when girls having a big ass was a turn off for most guys, not that it should matter, but the sway of opinion is definitely there since all this nikki minaj, kim kardashian, iggy, etc came about. I live on the Gold Coast of Australia and lately I've seen several different classes advertised to learn how to 'twerk'...what the fuck. Hollywood has people literally worshipping where shit comes from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the rant and maybe not the best examples but cultural influence in music is bigger than most people believe.

       I'm neither an avid listener of Elvis nor the Beatles but for the sake of maybe a brief explanation of how the Beatles changed the way music was received, you should consider that at the start of their career they were show oreinted performers. The music they wrote was meant to be played by the 4 man ensemble they were.  Towards the end of their career they helped pioneer the concept of making studio music that would otherwise be impossible to perform practically on stage before an audience. This in turn left the mental imagery in the hands of the listener,  who used their own imagination to explain all the new and odd noises they were potentially hearing. They started playing around with unconventional ways of making music, by looping  chords and playing them backwards, backmasking spoken words and other such techniques. The song  Revolution 9 to me sounds like what some purport to be very similar to the sort of thing one might expect a MK Ultra trigger tape to sound like.  I'm not claiming this to be the case,  just noting similarities ahead of our cultures curve. Of course famously Charles Manson claimed he heard his directives by listening to the Beatles records,  if I recall they were the more psychedelic sounding records in the discography.  A connection could perhaps be made between the psychedelic drug culture present at the time, and the knowledge we have now that the CIA was at roughly the same time using visual and auditory stimulus in combination with mind altering drugs with project MK ultra and Monarch to fuck with the human mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the subject of Elvis, I have nearly nothing to offer other than both the Beatles and Elvis were presented popularly by the current US establishment as being rebellious. Elvis helped make a predominantly black form of music sexy to a white demographic.  He helped encourage the greaser motifs, and the Beatles some would argue gave drug culture (anti-establishment at the time,  more so than now) a friendly face-lift. Was this a malicious plot?  I don't claim to know.  All I suggest is they could have been easily used as testing grounds for a number of culturally changing things.

       I came accross some convincing information a while ago in support of the "Paul McCartney died and was replaced"  conspiracy theory (an article claimed that an expert said you can actually measure changes in the bone structure of his face before and after his replacement.)  It sounds absurd but yeah, the Beatles had a huge cultural impact while not being all that origional in the beginning.  It's very plausible to me that they were guided into stardom through a propaganda effort that was advanced enough to pull it off.

        the most powerful conspirators, if they do exist, somehow focus their efforts on the music industry?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Who says they only focus on the music industry?
      </p>
      <p>
       For starters, the music industry is no longer a separate business from other forms of media. Most media, including music, is owned by a very small number of corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       That means everything you read, see and hear is controlled by a small number of people. So when you see Illuminati symbolism in music videos, that's not the only place it shows up. There's plenty of suspect imagery/content in TV, movies and the fashion industry as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your question about why "focus on music". Well, it's all media, not just music. But if you want to influence (or even control) public opinions, what people think, what they buy and how they act... control over the media is an excellent way to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compared to using brute force or political/legal forms of coercion, total media control is far superior. You can deliver whatever message you want. If anyone tries to contradict your narrative, you can use the media to neutralize them in any number of ways. In short, you can control the population and 98% of them will never even realize it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I was the Illuminati, I'd be focused on the media too.

       what, seriously? of course they want the music industry. and the video game industry. and the sports industry.

      <p>
       the primary focus of the music industry is to spread their ideology and ruin the innocence of the young. have you listened to lyrics and watched any music videos of mainstream music? it's all sex and body worship and satanic undertones. 
kids these days are dating so young now, and have cell phones and Internet access way too early on. they're thinking about boys when they should be watching fucking blues clues.

       It's because for whatever reason this is where some of the really obvious symbolism is.  I mean, it is so obvious that if you look into it even a little bit you either have to admit there is some sort of weird cult in charge of the music industry, or it is some sort of tightly organized highly coordinated practical joke.  The latter option seems totally unfeasible to me, no matter how bizarre the other option is.

       But masonic symbolism in art work is nothing new.  In fact Mozart and Goethe put masonic symbols into their artwork too.  Same goes for the Architecture in Washington DC.  As far as I can tell it is part of the Masonic initiation and/or ritual that you put the symbols into your artwork.  It's not a disputed fact that these symbols are there, the only real question is...why?

       I think there is a little more "this stuff sells" vs. "we believe in this" mentality in the music industry. The "illuminati" tie to an artist automatically increases their exposure.

       Honestly if there are powerful conspirators - which is more likely than not - then the media in general is a great place to focus efforts. They would already be those in control of oil, food, and pharms, and the important thing to do with media would be distraction and subtle indoctrination. But the illuminati aren't exactly that kind of group anyway, but much closer to a religion (a creepy one). Part of that religion, supposedly, is that they have to telegraph any moves to the public before they actually make them. And that's where the music industry looks weird as hell.

       Music is quite powerful. A catchy lyric can be repeating in your head all day essentially programming you based on the emotions/ideas/images contained in that song.

       what better way to reach young minds than with music? today it's easier with the images in videos. hip-hop's origin wasn't violent or "gangster" it was made that way to influence the next generation. the "illuminati" controls all music genre today, including gospel &amp; country.
i'm not implying that youtube videos make this true, just that info is available.

       Thats the reason i asked the question. Are we talking that they control everything and its just most Overt in the music industry or is it that its just the music industry because media is effective and powerful. I asked all this because to tag someone "illuminati"
seems to happen to anyone who becomes successful in the music industry. I personally feel its more that musicians are just tools of a group and they profit from appearing to be part and pacted with a dark force.

       People are going to point out the symbolism in popular music and movies more then anything else. It has a large audience, and some of that audience is going to be privy to the symbolism, not the meaning of it, but they've seen it often enough  or someone has talked to them about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does the symbolism mean? Like most everyone else, I don't have a damn clue. The Christians tend to think it's satanic, others think it's about unifying the world, some truly devout conspirators even claim it has to do with the 4th or 5th dimension. Maybe it is just a way for the content creators to pay homage to a group through which they gained the power to create content. Whatever the case, we certainly have a lot of theories, all of which reflect what these people are already concerned with.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the point of it? Subverting peoples thoughts and self control to be certain, simply put, advertising. If companies are willing to pay  over 4 million for a 30 second ad on the superbowl, Advertising obviously works. Even if this 'illuminati' is just going for an appearance of power by having their symbolism plastered on and in everything, that has obviously succeeded.

       It's not just the Christians who think that it's satanic. Each of the Abrahamic religions essentially believe in the one and only same God, they just haven't found a way to allign together yet.

       it isnt just the music they are interested in , its what the artists are wearing and how they can sell it to the public , they dont just own recording companies they own clothing  companies too , they have an artist flaunt the latest styles to make teen age girls wet for it , same with movies , an actor being seen in jeans and a leather jacket back in the 50's created a whole movement and he was mur ... died in a car crash ... think of the sales in jeans and leather jackets after that .. kerching! if you notice all the boy bands pay tribute to one of the first public sacrifices of a "star" by wearing jeans and leather jacket you will notice the bands they "own"

       The music industry is a slim branch on a fat tree; it's just one propaganda tool used to stupify and manipulate the general populace by controlling the songs released and the artists on show. It's probably not every artist, but their roots are firmly planted in all forms of major entertainment from music to TV, film, and video games.

       Music industry seems to be the long-con here, controlling water, gas and food would cripple/control a nation or peoples immediately where as music is like saying "i planted this bomb 15 years ago knowing my enemy would eventually get here" Every generation has music that pushes the limits of what is acceptable, i feel like maybe we are just slapping a new label on it.
