       Now they have gone a step forward. They want to spy on your children for 'market research' (Reality: to compile and analyze behaviour, interests, speaking patterns and personality and character of the child).
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, each time you read about how spying is done for 'market research' or for 'advertisment purposes' you are being
       <strong>
        lied
       </strong>
       to. This is more sinister in nature.

       It also normalizes surveillance. Kids may very well grow up thinking police in schools is normal, along with active-shooter scenarios, that dossiers on them is just the way the world works.

       Most surveillance is just perception.  They're
       <em>
        hoping
       </em>
       that everyone will
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       they're being watched and monitored but in reality, there isn't enough storage, man power and time to keep tabs on everyone's behavior or internet activity.  It's too much data to sift through so they're forced to prioritize on the most outrageous offenders who continuously trigger built in red flags and key words.  So the idea of "hey we're already used to it anyway" is mostly based on bullshit.  Its important for you to percieve you're being monitored so you'll stay in line.  If people knew how free they really were to say, do and type whatever the fuck they want to, the surveillance state would lose control, but most people have an inner fear that if they say the wrong thing, it will come back to haunt them.  This is mostly bullshit and you shouldn't self censor your thoughts and feelings in a supposedly free country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if every American had to put a camera in their house that monitors behavior.  The worst thing every American could do, is tip toe around this camera and try to say proper things in front of it.  The best thing every American could do, is up the ante on saying whatever the fuck they want, as if the camera never existed, because this would defeat the purpose of the camera.  The whole purpose of the camera was to generate fear and modify your behavior.
       <strong>
        Never let real or perceived surveillance modify your behavior or your identity.  Do and say whatever the fuck you were going to say and move on with your life.

       The ability to

        store

       data is different than being able to
       <em>
        actively
       </em>
       keep tabs on everyone.  To give a comparison, think of the ability to store data as an earth holding oceans of data.  After thousands of years, we finally have the ability to scratch the surface and send a robot down to the bottom of the Marianas trench to attempt to find a lost ring, but it's time consuming, expensive and the tech isn't good enough to fully explore the ocean.  However, to be comparative to all the data happening every second, imagine if the earths ocean doubled in size every 30 days since 1994.  This data ocean is going to remain 99% unexplored, and the 1% they do bother with will be expensive, time consuming and bothersome for everyone involved.  Then, on top of all that, just to make it more complex, you have another constant external force of hackers who can potentially modify, steal or delete this information at any given moment.  The tech does not exist to handle all this in the way that most people

       You're missing the point, they can collect everything and then if you get targeted by a flag they can have everything you have done for years. It's not about keeping tabs on everyone live, it's the ability that all of this data can be used for.

       The problem becomes when you are trying to change things politically and you dont follow the narrative, they find things to discredit you and that's that. I think we have a certain right to privacy, this is a new age, digital technology with these capabilities are very new, we most definitely have  say in if it is going on or not, we need to vote though to maintain our rights.

       Keep in mind that the real capacity of this center is unknown and is probably far larger than what is admitted on wikipedia. In addition, it is likely that this is in all honesty a

        minor

       Of course it does because every laptop sold in the past decade has a webcam, and a microphone. These are always active, and can positively identify you immediately.

       You don't have to parse ever piece of data worldwide in real time, just record everything, and look for keywords to build off of. The NSA supercomputers

       There isn't enough hard drives on earth to store every humans communication activity, not even from January 2015 to November 2015.  Whats happening is a hoover damn sized water fall of data is happening every second, they reach in and scoop 3 buckets while 700 buckets go past to never be seen again.  And those 3 buckets they grab every second are accumulating beyond their ability to keep them.  They have cooperation from a few ISPs, and a few major websites who make up only a portion of the worlds data, and even with that, they can't manage it, they simply try to store it.  It's like Walt Disney cryogenically freezing his dead body, no one knows how to use it to bring him back, but we technically do have him stored in a vault somewhere.  It's not nearly as useful or scary as people would like to imagine.

       An exabyte is 1 billion gigabytes.  My computer alone has 4,000 gigabytes (4 terabytes).  An exabyte is a lot for a single corporation, but if you could literally grab all data in the world, everything typed, every surveilance camera recording live, every website visited, every phone call recorded, every photograph taken, etc (not possible to take in the world) you would fill an exabyte in about 4 hours of full world electronic device recording, all 12 gone before next week, are they going to build another facility to record next weeks full world data?  Not only that but they don't even have 3-12 exabytes right now in the present, they
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       have 3 to 12 worked out with their plans in the future.  It's too much data.  Many people are shitting their pants without understanding how meager these attempts are.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2010, it was estimated that there's 1.2
       <strong>
        zetabytes
       </strong>
       of data online.  That was 5 years ago.  Every year the data dramatically increases exponentially.  It grows at such a fast pace, that even if you had magic infinite storage, and you hit the copy-paste button to attempt an internet copy, it would take so long to finish pasting that by the time it did, the internet has doubled in size again.  The cat is out of the bag and can never be caged, its multiplying far too quickly.  The best they can do, is identify a portion of the population that they are concerned about, and focus on them, you simply can't record the world at this stage of global data use.  Even in a fictional James Bond movie, a concept of a villain attempting to copy the world would be laughed at and considered too implausible for a storyline.

Any sound Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it; moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever the wanted to. You had to live- did live, from habit that became instinct- in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized."

       I know what you're saying is true, and I try to live my life this way, but I also really notice the fear factor. Irrational, yes, but present. I tell myself and others "it's important to be naughty lest one day you forget how" so I always try to un-censor myself and break as many laws as possible that don't make ordinary people unhappy, but when trying to do something particularly obvious, it's a real psychological war going on between my ears.

       When I was in high school about a decade ago, we used to have drills for what we should do in the case of an active shooter on school property. Kind of like a fire drill, except you'd run into the nearest classroom, barricade the door with whatever was available, turn off the lights, and silently hide in a corner away from any doors or windows (if possible) until it was over.

       What's wrong with having active shooter drills? I'd refer to them more generically....onsite threat or something, but it just seems like a reasonable drill..

       Sure, one could argue that its reasonable, but the fear generated is pretty intense. For me, it seems terrifying kids and making them think such a could happen instills a lot of pretty bad thoughts in their head...

       You're probably right. I mean, even in the US, active shooter scenarios are realllly rare. It's almost certainly a fear tactic...kinda like the Russian invasion drills that were held in the 80's.

       That's true enough, but on the other hand, don't fire drills scare kids and make them think a terrible fire could happen? Hurricane and tornado drills?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly, active shooters aren't as unlikely as we might hope that they would be. Knowing what to do if it ever did happen can maybe keep people safer and help keep the panic under control if a shooter really does attack the school.

       For myself, I think fires, hurricanes and tornadoes are far more likely to happen than a crazed person shooting you. Also, I feel, that a kid worried about a fire does not cause as much stress as a random shooter...
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, yes one can argue, and its a good view that these drills must be done... but the real problem is why is this happening, not how to survive a real life shooting...

       It
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       for market research, but it's still creepy, intrusive, and downright unnecessary. There are very good reasons why there's quite a bit of regulation on where, when, and how advertisers are allowed to target children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spying on our children is absolutely unnecessary. I don't have kids, nor do I want them, but I feel like this is crossing a line. Is it even all that beneficial? There are other ways to conduct market research for children's products. Sure, they might be more costly, or less convenient, or less far-reaching and comprehensive, but so what? It's stuff. You're selling stuff. I say that as someone who loved Barbies and other dolls as a child, and who had quite a few of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it worth being this intrusive, just to sell things? No, I don't think the government wants to monitor our children for thought crimes. With that said, I think that microphone-based data mining is simply excessive. What's the end goal? Sell more consumer products, for more profit? It doesn't seem "worth it." Sure, it's worth it to companies, but I mean on a broader social scale.

       Do you know how nearly impossible it is for me to present you absolute proof of my claims? We reach these conclusions through having read extensively on New World Order agendas and viewing multiple multi-hour documentaries explaining various stuff in extensive detail with many substories that derive from it.
This is just like how people always suspected Microsoft for spying on us ever since the earlier editions of Windows, but it hasn't been a concrete proof that they indeed did until these last 2-3 years.
This also doesn't mean that those people 50 years ago who believed that the JFK assassination was a conspiracy and that the offical story was bogus are wrong just because they couldn't present you with documents and solid proofs which came out to daylight only decades later.

       On the contrary.  I would prefer to hear discussion from multiple viewpoints on an issue rather than one agenda driven source.  I take every conspiracy with a grain of salt, use it as a source in my mind to be aware of.  A theory may or may not be true.  But believing things just based on hearsay is no better than believing in God because some guy said he exists.  If you really think critical thinkers do not belong on a conspiracy forum it seems like you just want a circle jerk forum that will agree with every theory put forward based on the authors word.

       Where is the evidence that Mattel
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       using this for market research? According to Mattel the microphone records the child's voice so that the doll can interpret and respond to the child; they are actually claiming not to use the information collected for commercial purposes (if you wish to believe them). The "market research" idea was first brought up by OP and then repeated by photonasty, but it never really mentions this in the article.

       Yeah it's all about the dolla dolla bill right? Haha you guys it's just about the money don't worry. I mean sure it's kinda creepy weepy that they spy on your kids but all is well, those kind people are just doing it so they can figure out ways to create more profit because they have to eat too. That's why they resort to such intrusive, offensive and privacy-invading tactics haha don't be silly guys it's just for money! Just forget about it guys, it's all good :D

       ...are you high or crazy? I never said their actions were okay, or that Mattel
       <em>
        had
       </em>
       to do it to afford food. I just don't see what's so unbelievable about Mattel invading users privacy in order to make more money. That seems like a very likely "main goal" to me.

       That is so creepy... Aside from the obvious spying on children, what about the security of these things? Reminds me of all those baby monitors that got hacked so of course these would be just as targeted.

       This is not aimed at you kisekikumo, but you have to be really gullible and naive if you really think regular hackers would have an interest in hacking baby monitors. They always blame this stuff on 'hackers' while the hackers are themselves.

       I work for game studios and we have kids play test in monitored rooms all the time.  It's a great way to learn what to change about your product to be more intuitive.  The kids parents are typically paid pretty well for their time and it's obviously consentual.
      </p>
      <p>
       This borderline unconsentual spying is definitely not the same as legitimate market research and is not OK.

       I have been wondering about kids recently. With the way I see my generation talking about kids, or rather talking about never having kids, I have been theorizing on how companies will change in the way of children's entertainment/products. Right now there is a huge business for children's toys and clothing, and I work at a major retailer so I get all the news on newest products and see the people who buy them. Sometimes I have conversations with parents about what they are buying for their child, and sometimes they start the conversation. The future of marketing will change when there are less children being born. The types of advertisements seen will change, and I can see companies like Mattel downsizing when the market weakens.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a strategy, as I see it, to gather information about the youngest generation right now. These are the people companies will have to follow and market towards, seeing as their current target demographic will steadily decrease in size as the years go on. When will children start to get tired of "Hello Barbie?" Kids may mention some other toys and products they are not using as much as they age. This is valuable information, as this can help Mattel rule out what kids do not like anymore and innovate what they still enjoy as they age, while getting new ideas with where to go next.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see a future of kids with smart devices taking surveys for money, in order to buy newer products or play games, etc. These surveys are nothing new, but as the pre-teens of our time are getting more and more unrestricted phone-time and internet access, they will be invaluable to companies. "Hello Barbie" is a survey without prompts, as young kids talk openly and naturally to their toys- I know I did when I was a lonely kid with just some toys and my imagination for company.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Hello Barbie" is shocking in nature, but really should not be too shocking when you consider what these companies are up against. They cannot simply refresh old products, anymore. Toys are becoming less and less popular, and the birth rate of the United States is on a downward slope. I predict a birthrate lower than 10 per thousand of the population within a decade. Drastic changes up ahead for producers of children's entertainment.

       It's not a coincidence that birth rates are going down with the intended sexualization of society, the push for people to become more sexually active which largely destroys the chances of someone actually settling down, getting married and having children.
The push for the lie that is "gender equality" which causes female and male roles to being turned from something unique to something bland.
The push and propaganda for homosexuality, for transgenderism and for feminism in the media... these are all planned social agendas to destroy the concept of the 'family'.

       Males are becoming emasculated and females are becoming masculine. You have to do research on this and protect your own identity.

       Yeah it's all about the dolla dolla bill right? Haha you guys it's just about the money don't worry. I mean sure it's kinda creepy weepy that they spy on your kids but all is well, those kind people are just doing it so they can figure out ways to create more profit because they have to eat too. That's why they resort to such intrusive, offensive and privacy-invading tactics haha don't be silly guys it's just for money! Just forget about it guys, it's all good :D

        The completed facility is expected to require 65 megawatts of electricity, costing about $40 million per year.[7][19] The facility is expected to use 1.7 million gallons (6435 m3) of water per day.[24]

         An article by Forbes estimates the storage capacity as between 3 and 12 exabytes

       Where is the evidence that Mattel
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       using this for market research? According to Mattel the microphone records the child's voice so that the doll can interpret and respond to the child; they are actually claiming not to use the information collected for commercial purposes (if you wish to believe them). The "market research" idea was first brought up by OP and then repeated by photonasty, but it never really mentions this in the article.

Any sound Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it; moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever the wanted to. You had to live- did live, from habit that became instinct- in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized."

       It's definitely an illusion, but a strong one. It's a bit like how it's so fucking hard when you're a young teenager to accept that people aren't secretly judging and admonishing you.

       I know what you're saying is true, and I try to live my life this way, but I also really notice the fear factor. Irrational, yes, but present. I tell myself and others "it's important to be naughty lest one day you forget how" so I always try to un-censor myself and break as many laws as possible that don't make ordinary people unhappy, but when trying to do something particularly obvious, it's a real psychological war going on between my ears.
