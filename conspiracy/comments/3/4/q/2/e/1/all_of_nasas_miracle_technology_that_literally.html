       I know that plenty of people on this subreddit think that the "Moon Hoax" posts are trolls or people trying to discredit the subreddit. That is false.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe or disbelieve the moon landing, though for 30+ years I did
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       it. But I can surely entertain the thought that maybe it was the largest hoax in human history, just for arguments sake. I have a hard time understanding why this is so hard for people to do, particularly Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one were 100% secure in the historical accuracy of the Apollo missions, that person would have no problem entertaining questions. And it would be easy to supply the answers for any inconsistencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA itself is supposed to be the beacon of science. But when asked about any inconsistencies and strangeness about the Apollo missions not only can they not give proof or a straight answer, but it is becoming more and more clear that they cannot even remotely prove what happened during the Apollo missions because they literally "misplaced" almost everything that would corroborate the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       But hey, it MUST have happened right? Just like the recent TIL post that went viral on reddit where a guy is saying "It was easier for NASA to go to moon than for NASA to fake the footage".
      </p>
      <p>
       Since "how easy it is to go to the moon" is only a known variable if everyone assumes that we did go to the moon (defeating the purpose of the statement itself), then the statement should be rewritten as "Since NASA went to the moon, going to the moon was easier than pretending to go the moon".
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        And there we have it, the kind of argument that millions of people made go viral: "Since NASA went to the moon, going to the moon was easier than pretending to go the moon".
       </strong>

       Take a look at the Van Allen Belts, the ONLY time in history that humans have ever passed through it was during the Apollo missions, never before and never since.

       NASA, in 2012, has publicly stated that we

        still
       </em>
       can not currently send a manned spacecraft through the VAB.
      </p>
      <p>
       But somehow we did it 7 times, over 50 years ago, during a period of time where we would have the most reason to fake it.

       The word "radiation" does not preclude manned spaceflight though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, I understand there is radiation in the Van Allen Belts, and in fact, there is a lot of radiation everywhere in space outside of the earth's magnetosphere and atmosphere, not to mention radiation that we encounter on a daily basis here on earth. The thing is, though, scientists have a reasonably good understanding of what produces radiation, what the effects of radiation are on both animate and inanimate objects, how to measure it and how to shield it. Also, the physiological effects of "radiation" are more complicated because it depends not only on the strength, but also on the length of exposure and type. Honestly, I'm not a scientist that can school you in the finer points of space radiation, but you don't exactly sound like one either.

       What makes you say that others can't get through it?  Again, not

       And frankly when it comes to "I want to go to space for fun and as a testament to the human condition" there's little, if any difference between LEO and beyond.

Just take a look at the lander and tell me that that looks like something that landed on the moon. The thing about this hoax is it has a time limit, and its been 40 years already...

       I'm confused on what the issue is then with sending people along with. If we're able to send craft, then why not people?
      </p>
      <p>
       You could argue that nothing has returned, enforcing the idea that we can't send enough fuel to bring anything back.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then, why wouldn't they be able to bring something back, you'd need only a fraction the fuel to get off the moon with its low gravity and lack of atmo?

       Rockets that hold unattainable amounts of fuel necessary to go to the moon and back. Rockets that can shield against the Van Allen Belts. Spacesuits able to heat and cool according to the extremes of temperature on the moon.

       I invite you to dig around a little, you will find that NASA cannot solve these problems even today. And they have apparently lost the blueprints and data necessary to prove how they did these things the first time. I am not even making this up, NASA is sketchy as fuck.

       Hey, just gonna throw in my 2 cents here, because you inspired me to do some of my own research. I didn't really come to the same conclusion you came to though, but I wanted to share what I found for you and others to talk about. For me, I figured that if I didn't believe the moon landing was possible/happened, I'd have to have some issue with the facts involved as explained by NASA, so that's what I researched.
      </p>
      <p>
       It looks like the lost blueprints and the "Van Allen problem" have been more or less debunked as reasons not to believe the moon landings. I read up on the blueprints on various websites. Its apparently not standard procedure to hold onto all the original design documents, or distribute them freely afterwards (not worth the cost of storing millions of documents for a project which will never see use again), but a massive amount of documents were still preserved in Huntsville, the Federal Archives, Rocketdyne, etc for anyone's perusal (
       <a href="http://www.moonlandinghoax.org/25.html">
        http://www.moonlandinghoax.org/25.html
       </a>
       ). That's not the greatest source, but the info there can be verified easily. I can understand why you'd want to see more diagramming than is available here (
       <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/diagrams/diagrams.htm">
        http://history.nasa.gov/diagrams/diagrams.htm
       </a>
       ), but it seems there are likely those places above to do so. Also, despite common belief in the conspiracy community, NASA has never said the Van Allen Belts are impossible to traverse safely (Van Allen HIMSELF said the idea was "nonsense"
       <a href="http://www.clavius.org/envrad.html">
        http://www.clavius.org/envrad.html
       </a>
       ). The ORION engineer quoted as saying this (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlXG0REiVzE">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlXG0REiVzE
       </a>
       ) actually never mentions the safety of the astronauts, only stating the issues the relatively minor proton radiation can pose for the onboard computers. Apparently, we didn't have issues with this in the 60s because we were using primitive analog computers, which are apparently much less susceptible to radiation/emf (again, an easily provable claim by anyone with a little hardware). The actual radiation shielding for the astronaut's sake was not as important as the electronics' shielding, as they did not spend days in the VA belts, and even took a clever route avoiding the worst of it (
       <a href="http://www.popsci.com/blog-network/vintage-space/apollo-rocketed-through-van-allen-belts">
        http://www.popsci.com/blog-network/vintage-space/apollo-rocketed-through-van-allen-belts
       </a>
       ), resulting in a very small amount of rads taken per astronaut, as recorded by their dosimeters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, of course, none of this "proves" that the moon landing happened, but to be honest, if it wasn't already obvious, I believe they did. For every question as to how the lunar landing worked there will always be an explanation from an engineer or scientist vastly more educated than ourselves from NASA. And then you face a decision - do you go by these explanations? I mean, the US had EVERY reason to fake the moon landing, I don't dispute that. Every reason. But if you look into the other side, NASA always provides a scientific answer. I can't disbelieve that answer until hard evidence comes up that suggests NASA is in the business of lying. For sure, the CIA is in the business of lying - they've been caught doing so a vast number of times. But things that involve huge amounts of engineers and scientists need a lot more strong scientific opposition to discount as conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I left out the official answers to temperature extremes on the moon and rocket fuel capacity, any NASA answer is easily found via google. I also
       <em>
        respectfully
       </em>
       dispute your title, that the insulated spacesuits and big rockets are "miracle tech" for which all documentation has been erased.
      </p>
      <p>
       To clarify, I respect everyone who is watching the government to keep them honest, I just don't think NASA is guilty of doing anything wrong, based on the facts. They have to keep working to solve new problems as the spacecraft delivery systems necessarily change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: So I have a bit of evident bias, so let me give a short bit of background on where I'm coming from. I'm related to folks who know people who actually worked on space stuff. No matter how you slice it, NASA hires a bunch of real scientific minds, who I believe would quickly figure out if there was something weird happening.
