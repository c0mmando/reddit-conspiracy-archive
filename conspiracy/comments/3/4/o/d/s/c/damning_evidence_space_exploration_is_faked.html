    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been following these space related conspiracy theories for some time, and I find them intriguing. There are <em>lots</em> of different camps of course. Many of them share some similar foundations so it can be difficult to assess where someone is coming from if you only hear one portion of their beliefs.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Crrow777">Fake Moon - Crrow777</a> seems to believe that the Earth is round, but that we have never escaped low earth orbit. The moon, however is fake. I believe at first he thought it was entirely fake (there is nothing there and it is a free floating hologram). However, it seems that in more recent videos after coming across the writings of <a href="http://lit.lib.ru/h/hatybow_a_m/lunak.shtml">Khatib Alexander</a> who he refers to as &quot;Hatybow&quot; he has come to believe that the moon is an actual physical object, but the appearance is a projection or hologram hiding what is actually there.</p>

<p>Key Features of this theory: The moon landings are faked, Geostationary orbits are faked, Low Earth Orbits are real, the Van Allen Belt is superhot thermally (there is not ionized gas in the Van Allen Belt and electrons are too low mass to create the sort of thermal energy he expects, need to talk to someone with a good science background to figure out what&#39;s up here). </p>

<p>But, the earth is still round we aren&#39;t necessarily trapped here except by this radiation belt. He does, however, make a special point of emphasizing a quote about the Van Allen Belt that it&#39;s &quot;almost like these electrons are running into a glass wall in space&quot;. I haven&#39;t heard him come right out and say it, but I think he does believe we are under an actual dome of some sort but doesn&#39;t want to come right out and say it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7rXdy3dOinCLNpPjPkc8Kw">Flat Earth - Mark Sargent</a>. These guys believe that the earth is flat and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuthal_equidistant_projection">azimuthal equidistant projection</a> map is the accurate map of the world. Most flat earth believers believe we are under a &quot;firmament&quot; and cannot leave the earth. Thus all space travel is fake. Some account for low earth orbit, but I haven&#39;t gotten a handle of their explanations. You will notice if you look at the map that globular geographical expectations are more or less maintained in the northern hemisphere and that the further one travels south the more radically geography departs from what is expected. Distances between South Africa and Australia for instance are greatly magnified in this model. They also believe that Admiral Richard Byrd found the firmament in his travels in the Antarctica and that all major states were willing to ratify anti-corporate treaties in order to keep the uninitiated away from the &quot;edge&quot;.</p>

<p>Key features of this belief system: All space travel is fake. The earth is flat. The moon is 100% unreachable.</p>

<p>Mark Sargent&#39;s reasons for this being kept a secret are that it would cause a panic that would send people rushing to religion. However, he strangely doesn&#39;t seem to believe that religion is the answer. Rather that it would be actually harmful for people to embrace religion just because science got this one thing wrong. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YjZ6zPs0ac">The Moon Landing was Kind of Fake - Joe Rogan</a>. This one is pretty straightforward. The world is round. Space is real. We can put satellites in geosynchronous orbit. Hell, we can even put people on the moon... probably. <em>But</em>, we didn&#39;t get all of the footage we wanted during the moon landings and faked some stuff.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sold on this 100% but it doesn&#39;t strain my credulity at all. In my experience people are always happy to take the easy way out, especially if they already did a sub-standard job on something and are trying to get off of the hook. This also isn&#39;t <em>quite</em> a conspiracy theory, it&#39;s just mostly the human element of people covering their own asses and doesn&#39;t require a massive cover up. Just someone fucking up at their job and not wanting to tell people about it.</p>

<p>Key features: For the most part the standard story is correct. But some of the footage from Apollo missions are faked. Rogan used to believe that the entire moon landing was faked, but several discussions with influential scientists like Phil Plait and NDG changed his mind. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDLFm-DRPQg">Here he is talking to Phil Plait on Penn Gillette&#39;s radio show a long, long time ago.</a></p>

<p>Then of course there is the standard &quot;the moon landing is a hoax.&quot; There is way more of this stuff out there than the more fringe stuff, but it&#39;s somewhat less interesting. They just think that the moon landing was faked for political (and sometimes religious) reasons. It&#39;s cool and all, but nowhere near as cool as holographic moon concealing a space station.</p>

<p>Where does this happen?</p>

<p>Bubbles in space?</p>

<p>You mean that small shadow or piece of derbris which most definitely does not resemble a bubble?</p>

<p>Anyone whose ever spent <em>any</em> time underwater can see that none of those movements are consistent with any kind of activity as such.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I need to bother with the rest of those terribly, terribly braindead statements. They apparently don&#39;t even know what the word orbit means.</p>

<p>Yes, and? Helmet malfunctions are actually common.</p>

<p>Yes. Chris Cassidy was talking to students to a town on the other side of where he used to live which is what he was talking about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And that most definitely had the look and attitude of a bubble,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it didn&#39;t. Bubbles are round and bubble shaped. It also behaves in a many quite different from all the other &quot;bubbles&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>WTF, water in the helmet? How does that happen if he isn&#39;t underwater?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because there are several liquids contained throughout the suit.  Specifically drinking water, which he thought it was, defrosting fluid which has leaked in the past, and cooling liquid, which is what it turned out to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scripture says that there are waters above and below the firmament. We&#39;re in a finite creation of space and time. We also know that God can exist outside of creation.</p>

<p>Other than that, we don&#39;t know. Everything we could know about it will be found inside the scriptures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok first off </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t you say you were an engineer?</p>

<p>We don&#39;t bounce off radio waves. The ion spenders is strong in that not all waves can make it through. For example light waves area strong enough that they pass through, although some visibility is lost. </p>

<p>AM radio (as in your experiment) doesn&#39;t need to leave the earth so it uses the ionosphere to help keep signals inside.</p>

<p>So no the government or nasa doesn&#39;t control the ionosphere</p>

<p>And you didn&#39;t answer OPs question.</p>

<p>How do satellite telephone calls work? Since they use a different type of radio wave other than am radio?</p>
