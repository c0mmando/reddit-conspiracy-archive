       The name of the component is HPT Stage1 Cooling Duct Assembly. There is a history behind this assembly as I began to read more. This component was part of the early JT9D-7 series engines that were used in development of Boeing's 747 line of aircraft. The "7" series engines have gone through many revisions but are exclusively used on 747's. Many years later, P&amp;W decided to work with NASA in the development in a new technology to improve engine performance and reliability. This improvement was made specifically to this section of engine. Tangential On-Board Injection (TOBI or "R" for Radial) was the newest improvement to reduce nozzle temperatures by over 2% which could open the door for a more powerful engines based on the "7" series engine. The new model of engine would be called 7R4+Revision Letter. The 7R4D engine is the one that is specified for United Airlines Boeing 767's.
      </p>
      <p>
       The engine found at Church and Murray didn't seem to be a 7R4D.....it seemed to be a 7J. The only way to confirm this is to search for the engine and take a look at the diffuser casing to verify a match. This was another needle in a haystack but I found it......a photo of a stripped down 747 engine at an outdoor museum. The diffuser casing is a perfect match!
      </p>

       Take note of the arrows to see that they match the JT9D-7 series engine on the 747 shown in the photo. Click to enlarge.

       "We have two data points indicating that the Murray Street engine is a Pratt and Whitney JT9D-7 series engine: the HPT Stage 1 Cooling Duct Assembly which the manufacturer indicates is for use only with the 7 series engine, and we have the diffuser casing of the Murray Street engine matching perfectly the diffuser casing of a 747 engine --for which model of Boeing aircraft Weezula says the JT9D-7 series engine was exclusively used."
      </p>
      <p>
       All data so far seem to indicate that the Murray Street engine is not a JT9D-7R4D engine, as would have been on Flight 175. (And the Murray Street engine certainly is not a GE CF6 engine from Flight 11.)
      </p>
      <p>
       "So how did a 7-series 747 engine wind up on Murray Street?"

       If you are actually interested in this and not just being a turd, I would highly recommend listening to pretty much any interview by former flight attendant Rebekah Roth. She gives her theory and it's one of the best I've heard.

       Well... It actually could have come from a 767 since according to Boeing, 767 engines are interchangeable with 747 engines with only slight modifications, so there's that.

       wow.  They probably needed a different engine to ensure the maximum performance speeds could be maintained.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its interesting to have proven that that the plane approached the south tower constantly at its maximum stable flying speed (which it could
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       achieve by diving*), without exceeding it into the danger envelope.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is irrefutable proof that the plane cannot have been piloted by an amateur. More likely was remote cuntrolled.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plane had maximum impact speed, with no risk breaking up/crashing prior to hitting the tower, leaving embarrassing evidence to be found.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have to admire it's enginuity though.

       Great comment...but just so you know a REAL 757 going that far over VMo in sea-level air would have fluttered apart about 10kft before it got to the level of that building. Even Boeing confirms this in "9/11--The New Pearl Harbor."

       Its even more fascinating than that-
      </p>
      <p>
       IIRC it was a 7
       <strong>
        6
       </strong>
       7, built in 1984 and tested to FAA FAR regulations to be stable at higher than Vmo.
       <br/>
       In fact the plane proved in testing it could maintain stable flight at Vd+20% (the minimum required by the regulation at the time) at all altitudes up to 18000ft-ish. (Vd is dive speed. and the plane was constantly diving right up to impact)
      </p>
      <p>
       At 1000ft Vd+20% is 504KnotsEAS.  And guess what our 767s speed was approaching the tower?
       <br/>
       Thats right!
       <em>
        EXACTLY
       </em>
       504knotsEAS.

       The 1000ft Proof proves it could
       <strong>
        <em>
         not
        </em>
       </strong>
       have been an amateur to keep flying exactly on the limit without risking exceeding Vd+20%.
       <br/>
       They programmed the plane remotely to achieve the fastest possible speed, with no risk the plane would lose control and crash. (There HAD to be zero crash risk for obvious reasons).

       Absolutely Vmo is nowhere near 500mph! aand it is not Vmo anywhere near the 510kGround speed (586ish MPH or 504KEAS) the 767 was measured at.
      </p>
      <p>
       Naturally - Vmo is irrelevant once proven it exceeded Vd.  Vd (420kcas) is way higher than Vmo (360kcas).
      </p>
      <p>
       Vd is 420kcas, which at 1000ft is just about equal to 420KEAS -(the conversions does not make any real difference at the planes altitude of 1000ft).
      </p>
      <p>
       420KEAS  + 20% = 504KEAS!

       If these engines fell from about 80 floors up, shouldn't it have made a hole in the ground? I would have thought that there would have been some damage to the sidewalk/road where it was found.
