        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>to the newbies &amp; a reminder to us all, as &quot;bad&quot; as things may seem, the TPTB are afraid of <em>losing control</em>,</p>

<p>&quot;Waking up to the realities presented before us and even more importantly what they imply is a very profound and personal experience. <em>Once we become aware we are living in a world that’s been deliberately fabricated in ways we never would have imagined</em> and that even our own true nature is anything but what we’ve been told, <em>there’s no turning back</em>.</p>

<p><strong>It may appear to be a lonely path at first</strong>, but we are by no means alone in this awakening. <em>It is happening in all walks of life</em>. Whether a banker or corporate employee wakes up to the scam being perpetrated on humanity and pulls out of the matrix, or a normal taxpaying worker realizes they’re contributing to a military industrial machine hell bent on control and world domination, we’re all the same.</p>

<p>. . .Triggers for Awakening</p>

<p>There are many such triggers that wake people up. Once someone realizes, for example, how the world was scammed on 9/11 and that the powers that be are willing to continue to perpetrate such atrocities to promote their agenda, the digging begins. When we realize we seem to be at the complete mercy of parasitic central bankers more than willing to not only implode the world’s economy, but finance both sides of any conflict for personal gain and control, and that our governments are complicit in this scheme, we start to grasp the enormity of what befalls us.</p>

<p>That we have rapidly evolved into an advanced militarized surveillance police state is driving many to ask some hard questions – and the answers can be startling and difficult to swallow, especially <em>when you realize they’re attempting to cut off all avenues of recourse</em>.</p>

<p>What exactly is their agenda? Volumes of evidence points to not just control, but literal depopulation motives. Is this shadow force literally that Machiavellian?</p>

<p>. . .To realize this massive program is being orchestrated by some form of “they” soon becomes obvious. The reality of the conspiracy that JFK so eloquently pointed out before he was surgically removed from office via assassination hits squarely home. Here’s an excerpt from this landmark speech.</p>

<p>&quot;For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence–on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day.</p>

<p>It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. <em>Its preparations are concealed, not published</em>. Its mistakes are buried not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed.&quot; – John F. Kennedy</p>

<p>Waking up from that media and education entrancement is another shocker. Could they do such a thing? Could we really be facing such a totalitarian crackdown and mind and information control? Do they really have such sway on humanity?</p>

<p>The Shock Does Wear Off – But the Indignation Doesn’t</p>

<p>There are so many interconnected “rabbit holes” of similarly repressed, twisted or hidden areas of information that it can be staggering. <em>Once we realize we’ve been lied to about any one of these serious issues, we begin to question everything</em>. And that is extremely healthy. You may not find support for your new found perspective from those around you, but there are millions who are sharing your experience. Thanks to the internet you can find others undergoing the same transformation quite readily and derive a lot of affirmation, encouragement and support.</p>

<p>We are Responding – They Know It and Don’t Like It</p>

<p>Globalist adviser to 5 American presidents including Barak Obama, Zbigniew Brzezinski has clearly laid out the plan for global hegemony at any cost. His book, The Grand Chessboard even alludes to the need for a new Pearl Harbor, later echoed by the oft quoted PNAC report issued before 9/11 literally forecasting the event.</p>

<p>. . [The] major world powers, new and old, also face a novel reality: while the lethality of their military might is greater than ever, their capacity to impose control over the politically awakened masses of the world is at a historic low. <strong>To put it bluntly: in earlier times, it was easier to control one million people than to physically kill one million people; today, it is infinitely easier to kill one million people than to control one million people</strong>. - Zbigniew Brzezinski</p>

<p>The Conscious Awakening</p>

<p>This dark yet ultimately empowering information goes hand in hand with anyone experiencing this paradigm shift. If things here are so massively manipulated, what lies beyond all of this? What are we being kept from? Why do we sense we are so much more?</p>

<p>Awake, But Never Alone</p>

<p><em>A sense of isolation following the initial awakening is natural</em>. It’s foreign to everything we’ve been taught, with implications that can be mind-boggling as well as heart breaking. However, we are very much connected and sharing a profound common experience. Knowing we are not alone is very important to keep in mind.</p>

<p>Building community also becomes a priority, where we can contribute to the healing of the planet at every level possible. Whether it’s activist or spiritual associations these are very important. It may only be on-line at first, that’s fine. Find kindred spirits and empowering and informative websites and blogs and even attend meet up events in your area on some of these subjects of concern.</p>

<p>This awakening of empowered consciousness is upon us, and is transpiring at an accelerating pace, and something to be very encouraged about. Once you get past the shock of what you’ve “found out”, it becomes easier, <em>but it will drastically alter your life. For the better</em>.</p>

<p>Enjoy it, be empowered, and take action accordingly.</p>

<p>The beginning is here.</p>

<p>Much love, Zen</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zen has it absolutely nailed on the head. Once you begin to question your reality you realize that there is much more to life than you ever been told. You have been manipulated and deceived into thinking that you have no power, you&#39;re worthless, you have no control, and the best thing you can do is &quot;nothing.&quot; This is their  prerogative. They want you to believe that you have no power. This is how they create disenfranchised youth, complacent workers, and apathetic drones. BUT! There comes a point when you wake up. From your own set of experiences there will be some sort of trigger that causes you to question. To see life in a completely different perspective that what society has taught you. You begin to realize that you came into this life for a purpose and a reason. And in fact, you are powerful. In fact, you have been creating the very life you live your entire life. And that every thought, feeling, and belief draws into your experience the reality which you call your life. And when you wake up the illusion of duality, us vs. them, right and wrong, begin to fade away. And that is what we call a conscious awakening. The next revolution will not be one that is fought with guns and explosions. The revolution that is here is a conscious shift in the way we see one another and ourselves in the environment in which we live. When we realize when we are all in this together as whole; then there will be no reason for war, poverty, hate, or inequality. You would see one another as your fellow brother and sister. And the earth as the mother that provides all. Such is the shift that is occurring....a move from duality into unity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was made aware of this as a child, and I feel so lucky that everyone is finally starting to wake up from this. My story is sordid, but I was born black and aware of the unity of the world, long before I remember knowing what racism was. So it is truly a blessing to see everyone waking up finally and seeing what my people have been trying to let everyone know for so long. I feel sorry for the many souls and energies that have passed away from time due to wars, famine, sickness spread by colonization and capitalism. If everyone could just stop and think for one day, how a world where complete balance with nature and every living being would be, a world where we would be okay. We would be able to feed the world with natural gardening, respect each others choices more willingly and create for fluidly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The elitist global agenda will expect to ascend this year around the Harvest Moon (September 23-28th) when CERN will anticipate opening portals to begin a false flag invasion, and this will be the 5th trumpet. Everyone should be aware that they will stop at absolutely nothing, even bringing in anti-matter from outside our dimension, to destroy us. The magnitude of their will is stronger than most of us cold ever dream of. I dont want to believe that this is true, and I know how strange and crazy it sounds. But if there weren&#39;t confirmed scientists and physicists saying this as well, I wouldn&#39;t give it a second thought. Please if anyone is reading this, please look into this and decide for yourself how true or not it is. The elitists will create events like this to distract the masses while they continue their global domination. They will use events like Tomorrowland to enslave minds with music, and drugs. They want you to be unaware. I cant stress enough how crazy important it is to stop this CERN portal from opening. I can&#39;t describe the physics of it well, but it has something to do with gluons(?) which bind weak forces within an atom. They smash billions of quantum forces together to create anti-matter which is absolutely unstable, however over 60% of matter is anti-matter, and they want control over this too! I&#39;ve been up for days, my eyes are red, I can&#39;t sleep. I can&#39;t type anymore....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with you coldbloodedstyle. I believe that with the advancement of communications technology, more people per capita will be able to receive the frequencies needed to awaken. Frequencies are important, because even though I don&#39;t know you and you may post this a day or so before my reply, I can still sense your frequency by the words you speak, so we are all connected. Some more awake of these frequencies than others, but those that are not able to recognize these facts will either accept these principles or deny them at least three times. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems ridiculous at first because we are preprogrammed to think the idea is hilariously stupid. </p>

<p>Some truths:
Seeing Chicago skyline from Michigan across the lake.
Seeing Cuba from Key West.
The fact that earth rotation does not aid or diminish flight times east or west.
The lack of earth pictures that don&#39;t look fake as fuck. With 13,000 supposed satellites you would think they would equip one with even an 8mp camera.
The fact that Nasa states they measure distance to the stars with lasers (an impossibility). Would take the laser the amount of light years there and back to get that data.
Centrifugal force is stronger than gravity swing a water bucket around, merry go rounds spin people off is a sure sign that if we were spinning 1000 mph we would be flung off.
The fact no one has ever seen a new moon pass in front of the sun. The fact that sun and moon are relatively the same size as indicated in eclipses. The fact that Freemasonry and Luciferians worship the sun.
