<p>Yeah, just look at all the crazy conspiracy theorists who read your comment and now are believers in your theory!</p>

<p>Oh wait, you don&#39;t actually think we&#39;re all that dumb, do you?</p>

<p>Do you really think the persona of &quot;hangs out in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to tell people they are dumb constantly&quot; is convincing to the type of person who would view this subreddit in the first place?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My example is exactly the same as many &quot;real&quot; conspiracy theories. It finds most ridiculous connections and then implies that because of those connections there must be some conspiracy.</p>

<p>I would hope that you all would be too smart to believe my theory, but the evidence indicates otherwise.</p>

<p>So did you believe my theory? Are you saying that Jews are not controlling the world through media among other things? Don&#39;t you find the connection between the OP&#39;s username and the powerful Jewish family at least a bit suspicious? It looks to me like the typical &quot;hidden in plain sight&quot; conspiracy that all aspiring NWO members use according to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>No, if that&#39;s your understanding of what &quot;conspiracy theories are&quot;, that is my example to show everyone else that would read this that you aren&#39;t genuine. Can&#39;t think of one real conspiracy theory that has legitimacy? If you&#39;re here posting this frequently in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> with that attitude, you must be a liar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly what conspiracy theories shouldn&#39;t be. </p>

<p>One of many reasons I hang out here is because I want to hear alternative views. I know that things are almost never what they appear. There are definitely conspiracies in this world. </p>

<p>But then instead of well considered and possibly real conspiracies, all I see here is the most ridiculous nonsense that is based exactly on the same &quot;quality&quot; logic like my example. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not, unbelievable. Stupid. I would describe them as stupid. And not all, but mostly. </p>

<p>My first post on reddit was related to my background as a mercenary. It was relevant at the time. If I thought I would spend so much time here, I would call myself &quot;2smart4you&quot; for example</p>

<p>But don&#39;t tell me that you really make judgment about the people based on their reddit usernames.</p>
