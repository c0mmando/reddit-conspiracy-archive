       Same crap like thousand other conpiratard videos. Imagined tenuous connections between various events are not an evidence of a connection and conspiracy.

       Watch me do it: The Wired World is a feature from the Wired magazine. Wired magazine is owned by Conde Nast. Conde Nast is owned and operated by a powerful Jewish family. And.. and, Conde Nast also owns Reddit. Only a fool would believe all this is just a coincidence.

       My example is exactly the same as many "real" conspiracy theories. It finds most ridiculous connections and then implies that because of those connections there must be some conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would hope that you all would be too smart to believe my theory, but the evidence indicates otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       So did you believe my theory? Are you saying that Jews are not controlling the world through media among other things? Don't you find the connection between the OP's username and the powerful Jewish family at least a bit suspicious? It looks to me like the typical "hidden in plain sight" conspiracy that all aspiring NWO members use according to

       No, if that's your understanding of what "conspiracy theories are", that is my example to show everyone else that would read this that you aren't genuine. Can't think of one real conspiracy theory that has legitimacy? If you're here posting this frequently in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       with that attitude, you must be a liar.

       That's exactly what conspiracy theories shouldn't be.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of many reasons I hang out here is because I want to hear alternative views. I know that things are almost never what they appear. There are definitely conspiracies in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then instead of well considered and possibly real conspiracies, all I see here is the most ridiculous nonsense that is based exactly on the same "quality" logic like my example.

       No, not, unbelievable. Stupid. I would describe them as stupid. And not all, but mostly.

       My first post on reddit was related to my background as a mercenary. It was relevant at the time. If I thought I would spend so much time here, I would call myself "2smart4you" for example

       Of course I judge people on the names they use.  I'm human, so I actually can't help it.  But also because people are telling you something with the names they choose.  Sometimes what they are telling you is subconscious, but they are telling you something.
      </p>
      <p>
       My name, for example, is telling you that I once felt very clever for finding a 12 letter anagram for my real name.  If you think about it a bit, that tells you a lot about me.

       What you said above (which I commented on) was a bit different.

        Watch me do it: The Wired World is a feature from the Wired magazine. Wired magazine is owned by Conde Nast. Conde Nast is owned and operated by a powerful Jewish family. And.. and, Conde Nast also owns Reddit. Only a fool would believe all this is just a coincidence.

       Yeah, just look at all the crazy conspiracy theorists who read your comment and now are believers in your theory!

       Oh wait, you don't actually think we're all that dumb, do you?

       Do you really think the persona of "hangs out in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to tell people they are dumb constantly" is convincing to the type of person who would view this subreddit in the first place?

       Of course I judge people on the names they use.  I'm human, so I actually can't help it.  But also because people are telling you something with the names they choose.  Sometimes what they are telling you is subconscious, but they are telling you something.
      </p>

       My name, for example, is telling you that I once felt very clever for finding a 12 letter anagram for my real name.  If you think about it a bit, that tells you a lot about me.
