       I love how so many people are willing to take jobs that put them in a position to try to suppress information from the general public when they themselves,(the underlings that are just doing a job), are also going to get completely fucked by stuff like this. This deal  isn't good for anybody, it only benefits corporations. We're going to be giving up national sovereignty in an effort to help businesses make more money. They are going to be allowed to sue nations anytime policy interferes with them making money, This is how nations disappear and corporations become the true power. This is the type of stuff that is going to start happening in our country and everywhere else that has it's leaders sign this thing,

       I used this example against the woman that worked for a law firm that stole money from poor people to give it to the banks. She tried telling me she was just doing her job, but I said that her job required her to take money from people like, that got completely fucked by the "great recession", which was largely brought on by wild speculation by the banks, and now I'm stuck having to cover their losses. Her company seizing $1,000 cash from my bank account while I was in college trying to finish a degree nearly had me homeless and out of school. It's unbelievable how fucking stupid this country is and how it treats its citizens. Had that happened to me, it likely would have been something I would not have been able to recover from, and I'd be another homeless statistic holding a cardboard sign while most of America passes me by, gritting their teeth, holding back their lashings about what a "Lazy fucking loser I am."

       I had an article pulled from r/politics today. It was an interview with Neil DeGrasse Tyson discussing science and politics. It was pulled for being "off topic". Reddit has become a joke. The Fascists are in charge.
