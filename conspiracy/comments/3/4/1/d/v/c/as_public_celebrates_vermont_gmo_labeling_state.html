<blockquote>
<p>With the public focused on the lobbyist-driven California Senate Bill 277 (SB-277), the Vermont Senate quietly eliminated vaccine exemptions Thursday with an 18-11 vote. </p>

<p>Missing the starting gun, communities across America are now facing the political push to remove the barrier between their bodies and a private company’s medical product. </p>

<p>Attempting to squeeze every last drop of credibility from the “safe and effective” argument, senators across the U.S. appear to be ignoring the voices of their people in addition to over <a href="http://www.infowars.com/the-us-government-has-paid-out-3-billion-to-vaccine-injured-americans-since-1989/">$3 billion of payouts</a> in the U.S. alone from The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.</p>

<p>Recently, the population of Vermont, and the rest of the country, is swooning over the state’s political representatives for enacting the nation’s first mandatory <a href="http://www.jeffereyjaxen.com/blog/-mainstream-media-folds-as-gmo-backlash-goes-mega-viral">GMO labeling law.</a> </p>

<p>After a short legal hang-up forced by corporate influence, the law will begin on July 1st, 2016. What better state to remove vaccine exemptions than one in which its politicians can do no wrong. As first reported by <a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2015/04/on-wednesday-keep-one-eye-on-california-and-one-eye-on-vermont.html">AgeofAutism:</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Friday, April 10th, Jennifer Stella, head of the Vermont Coalition for Vaccine Choice learned that Sen. Kevin Mullin, R-Rutland, and Sen. John Campbell, D-Windsor, had tried to tack the exemption removal language onto another bill. The move was ruled to be non-germane and was disallowed.</p>

<p>“The following Tuesday evening Stella learned that another attempt was coming, this time to tack the bill onto a vaccination registry expansion bill that had already passed the house, and would be debated the following morning. By the time the bill (H98) hit the senate floor on Wednesday, a barrage of phone calls had been made to concerned parents, who showed up in the Senate Chamber ready to fight the measure. The bill surfaced as an amendment introduced, again by Senators Mullin and Campbell, and this time joined by Senator Sears, D-Windsor.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was at this point the process went from underhanded to simply corrupt. Appearing it would fail, the <a href="http://legislature.vermont.gov/bill/status/2016/H.98">Vermont H98</a> sponsors decided to postpone their bill a week mirroring the exact techniques seen during California SB-277. </p>

<p>This was presumably at the advice of lobbyists who were present on the Vermont Senate floor from the <a href="http://influenceexplorer.com/organization/american-academy-of-pediatrics/f52c9290cdde4094b03006afc97d4d1d">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>, <a href="http://www.medicarenewsgroup.com/news/medicare-faqs/individual-faq?faqId=6f43f458-fceb-4185-bae2-d4285f6e28f4">phRMA</a>, and others. </p>

<p>Reconvening a week later, on the same day as the final California vote (4/22), Health and Welfare Committee Chair, Senator Ayer announced that no testimony was to be heard from parents. Only “experts” would be allowed to testify with an MD, PhD or greater. </p>

<p>Among those testifying for removal of parent’s rights was <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Polio/Strategy-Leadership/John-Modlin">Dr. John Modlin</a>, MD, Deputy Director of Polio for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation via phone from Geneva, Switzerland.</p>

<p>Minutes before the Vermont bills final 18-11 approval, Senator David Zuckerman proposed an amendment (to the vaccine exemption elimination amendment) that would allow children with genetic vulnerabilities to vaccine injury to be immune from mandated injections. </p>

<p>In a truly telling move, Zuckerman’s plea to exempt children virtually guaranteed complications from vaccines, was quickly denied.</p>

<p>Both the California and Vermont bills come at a time when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24IZ4uwiflk">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a> is calling for, at The Centers for Disesase Control, a “Credible (vaccine) regulatory process with regulators with integrity and we don’t have that today.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When some people in society are viewed as exploiting rules made for a specific group, society can often take away options for everyone, including people that need it.  It is terribly sad that a minority of society is screwing things up for people that need the exception.</p>

<p>This is equivalent to what republicans are trying to do with welfare: a few people are exploiting it and they are using that to take it from everyone that needs it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccination rates are high and climbing.  There is no growing anti-vax movement.  There is no growing rash of outbreaks.  Measles itself is a total non-issue in the U.S. particularly compared to the growing waves of drug resistant STDs, deadly tick-borne diseases, even Dengue is spreading right here in America.</p>

<p>This whole vaccine debate a giant social media and news campaign.  I&#39;d look first to LiveWorld, employed by Sanofi (domestic MMR distributor), fabricating a debate in order to drive new legislation requiring vaccines and thus boost sales.</p>

<p>In the 1950s, Edward Bernays was paid by United Fruit Company to topple the democratically-elected Guatemalan government, and he used this exact template.  You can read about it in his book, <em>Propaganda</em>, wherein he describes a template for public relations that is being used by a multitude of major industries today including the large pharmaceutical corporations.</p>
