       I'm going to try and keep an extremely long belief and theory of mine extremely short.
      </p>
      <p>
       Middle class white people are being phased out in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's painfully obvious. We are ALWAYS the bad guys. We are portrayed in both commercials, movies and TV shows as the idiots. When is the last time you saw a commercial where the black guy was the goofball doing something wrong and the white guy corrects him? Exactly, now ask yourself the reverse. It's always about what we do wrong to the blacks, to the mexicans, what we have done wrong in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only whites who are "good" are the elite upper class who step in to point a finger at (seemingly) themselves to say how horrible we are. They step in to support illegal mexicans, to support blacks who commit crimes, break laws and riots. Now, to make it clear I'm very far from racist. I don't judge a person based on their race. In fact, I think this whole problem is coming from upper white class imperialism, I don't even blame the blacks and mexicans as much as I do the upper elite who are using them and manipulating them to once again create a true hierarchy society.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's common knowledge and was even posted in a yahoo news article about how the politicians want to allow more illegal mexicans in to appease the huge corporations, to garnish their votes and receiving funding and favor from them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see the quality of life for middle class "Americans" (of all colors) dropping drastically as time goes on. They are allowing all the illegal mexicans in to do the slave work, while the corporate owners, tycoons, families and executives rake in all the wealth and live the high life. We're going right back to the Egyptian era.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't come from a wealthy upper class family, I come from a family of blue collar working folks. I keep watching our wages and jobs drop, competition grow and the ability to have things like a home, a decent car and the ability to maybe take some vacations vanish. They say the illegal mexicans are "dreamers" yet so many Americans cannot live the "American Dream." The illegal mexicans are not coming here to live the American Dream, they're coming to be in America and have a slightly better way of life than they do in their own country, fleeing from a horrible economy and the fear of being killed at any moment by the cartels (which for some reason America does nothing to try and stop).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whites are continuously portrayed as oppressive, horrible, terrible people. What have I ever done to oppress anyone? I've had GREAT Black and Hispanic friends my whole life. I'm just tired of being made out as the bad guy, while the upper class whites get up and scream out how bad we are, to give the "minorities" favor so that they will cheer and labor for the almighty empire while the upper class sits around in chairs and bosses them around.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just feel as though being a middle class, white American I'm being phased out. Soon there will be no room for us. Only blacks, Mexicans and Super elite whites who one day will be overthrown by those they are catering so much to.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does the future hold? Will the middle class white folks ever have enough balls or pull over the media to stand up and shout out for ourselves? "We are NOT the enemy, stop blaming us, stop stepping all over us?"

       You've fallen into the trap of viewing people differently because of the colour of their skin. We're all brothers and we need to look at issues beyond race in order to truly change things.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 2011, New York officers fired at 41 suspects and killed nine of them—an astonishingly low number in light of New York’s population (over 8 million) and the size of its police force (35,000 uniformed officers). Blacks were 22 percent of those fatalities; whites were 44 percent of police fatalities. Yet blacks were 67 percent of all suspects who fired at the police; no white suspect fired at the police. Moreover, blacks made up 73 percent of all shooting perpetrators in the city in 2011, according to the victims of, and witnesses to, those shootings, though blacks are only 23 percent of the population. Whites committed less than 3 percent of all shootings, though they are close to 35 percent of the city’s population.

       Nope, viewing people differently because they are different. You realize that "race" is not just the "colour of the skin" - it's genetic.

       But I completely explained and expressed it has nothing to do with that. I don't view anyone differently based on their ethnicity. I'm tired of people doing that to us because we are white and because of what our great-great-great-great-great-great grandparents did. I see manipulation of different races, cultures and origins and I see lies being spread in many directions.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I wish for more than anything is ABSOLUTE, true equality, where there IS NO discussion over race, only law or lawlessness, right or wrong, no more "this race that race, because of this or that."

       You've fallen into the trap of thinking we are all the same. We're not. White people commit far less crimes than black people. Whites are more intelligent and more responsible.

       Well, the rich are still pretty pissed that we outlawed slavery so they are doing everything in their power to bring it back. That means showing you to be the oppressor and having them/government make more rules to protect people from you. Once they have everyone protected from the likes of your racist culture, they will simply enforce the laws against everyone giving them a workforce that would shame all the empire previous.

       They outlawed slavery because it didn't apply to whites too, and debt slavery is more efficient anyway.

       Exactly. It's like people don't see what's going down. They're just bringing back slavery. There might not be physical chains, but with high debt, high costs of living, low wages and long hours it's the same difference and only getting worse. If you don't make it to the top, you'll end up be groveling at the bottom while being told to be thankful that you have some cereal in your morning bowl so that you can work another 12 hour day for some more.

       The elite in America wants to replace the middle class Whites with third-world populations who can't or won't vie for power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Middle class Whites are dangerous and have the possibility of resisting the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you can see, anti-white fanatics - plenty of them here - are useful idiots for the elites because of their ignorant hatred against White people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have no doubt, these anti-white "progressives" would shove your white ass into an oven the second someone told them it was ok to "kill whitey."

       But see, that's the problem. That's what has lead to so many overthrown empires. Eventually, when the middle class whites has been phased out, the Mexicans will realize that they out number the upper class elite whites by about 999/1. At that point why WOULDN'T they overthrow the government? They will and rightfully so, at that point it will be expected. America is BUILT on a middle class society structure. When you try to replace the middle class with true slavery, they'll EVENTUALLY realize what's being done and overthrow it.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR their plan will backfire in the end.

       I was being sarcastic. I'm not sorry for being white, I'm proud of it. The media and the country around us makes us feel like we NEED to apologize for being who we are. It sucks. I apologize for the sarcasm my friend. That's basically what the upper class whites controlling the media and portraying all this bullshit propaganda are doing, it's where my sarcasm came from. Why do we have to keep being apologetic for things we haven't done?
