        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Where I&#39;m from in the United States the school system works like this (it&#39;s similar around the country). Note the increased centralization and more intense conditioning at every phase. </p>

<p><strong>Grade School: Kindergarten through Fifth Grade</strong> is usually housed in the same complex. You attend school roughly from 8:30 am - 2:30 pm and learn essential concepts like reading, writing, vocabulary, and basic math. Free time and play is scheduled regularly. Learning is very hands on, and movement around the classroom is frequent. At my school we had two recesses and snack time every day in addition to gym class a couple times per week. Homework is infrequent; school generally ends when the bell rings. At this age, <em>everything is decentralized. You learn at school, play sports on club or town teams, and take piano lessons from some old lady that comes to your house.</em> There is ample time for hanging out with family and friends. </p>

<p><strong>Middle School: Grades Six Through Eight</strong> </p>

<p>Centralization slowly begins. In my town, football switches from private club teams to the school team in seventh grade. The school begins to exert influence outside normal hours; for example, it organizes dances for the students a couple times per month. Recesses and other free time are eliminated. Learning is now done while sitting down and staring at a board. Like cattle, students move from class to class at the sound of a bell. Real homework is now assigned, extending the school&#39;s reach into one&#39;s personal time. Social hierarchies begin to form. Pop music and culture - often with explicit sexual themes - targets this demographic. I&#39;ll never forget hearing Lil&#39; John scream &quot;TO THE SWEAT DROP DOWN MY BALLS! TO ALL THESE BITCHES CRAWL!&quot; at dances where half the kids hadn&#39;t gone through puberty yet. </p>

<p><strong>High School: Grades Nine Through Twelve</strong> </p>

<p>All sports are now school run. A plethora of clubs (school newspaper, mock trial, band, etc.) are introduced that you really should participate in if you want to go to a good college. More homework and studying is required. Life now revolves around school: it is not uncommon to go to class from 8:30 - 2:30, then school-sponsored sports (or band) practice from 3:30-5:30, and then do school-assigned homework from 8:30-11 pm. Competition for status and resources is encouraged. Students compete academically for college acceptances, physically on sports teams against other schools, and socially for the attention of attractive females and the companionship of high-value males. This competition naturally gives rise to gangs (aka jocks, stoners, preps, etc.) who find strength in numbers and exert varying amounts of influence over the general student body. If you fall behind or don&#39;t provide obvious value to the group you may be socially ostracized or bullied. Passions - like service work or playing a musical instrument - are valued for how they look on one&#39;s college application instead of just for being enjoyable in themselves. This leads to people doing a bunch of crap just to get into college. As a result of all this pressure, drinking and drugs become increasingly popular.  </p>

<p><strong>College</strong></p>

<p>Marketed as the &#39;best years of your life,&#39; this experience can cost up to $60,000 a year. By this age kids have been exposed to countless quasi-propaganda films (Old School, Animal House, Accepted, etc.) that portray college as an endless party that is occasionally interrupted by classes. Often thought to be &#39;the most free&#39; time in one&#39;s life, despite the fact that you <em>pay</em> for everything at this central institution and spend <em>all</em> your time there. Subconscious anxiety about this fact is sublimated via binge drinking and casual sex, which are thought to be rebellious despite being semi-encouraged by the University. Furthermore, college pushes a notoriously liberal worldview and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ccap/2012/02/16/the-male-female-ratio-in-college/">enrolls student bodies that are now on average 57% female</a>. Students not involved in fraternities or other traditionally male activities may find the environment anti-male at times. Most importantly, <a href="http://ticas.org/sites/default/files/pub_files/Debt_Facts_and_Sources.pdf">71% of students now graduate in debt</a>, making their dependence on the system official. </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>I know every one has different experiences in school. Some of you may&#39;ve been in the stoner clique that did their own thing in high school, or maybe you had a blast in college and had some awesome professors. I&#39;m not trying to argue that those experiences aren&#39;t valuable. </p>

<p>However, it is clear that school incrementally extends the reach of central authority into one&#39;s life. I contend that this is dangerous, since no matter how many opportunities for enrichment school seems to offer, it eventually forces you into debt slavery and a state of learned helplessness in which you are totally dependent on <em>the system</em> for your identity and livelihood. </p>

<p>Furthermore, it is not hyperbolic to say that school indoctrinates young people into a specific worldview/value system. Why, for example, is spending time at after school clubs necessarily better than helping out around home? Why does &#39;education&#39; only consider the government&#39;s side of the story? Why are self-knowledge and introspection not taught? I could go on forever. </p>

<p>To the younger people reading this: I&#39;m not suggesting you drop out of school or become an anarchist. But I urge you to see the system for what it is so that you can make intelligent decisions going forward. Saving money and going to a state school, for instance, might make sense even if your parents want you to go into debt to attend a top private university. Furthermore, be careful of all the propaganda. Freedom is about <em>self-knowledge and self-ownership</em>. Freedom very rarely involves paying other people and it certainly isn&#39;t about who drinks the most or has the most sex (these things actually get boring). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very well said.  I&#39;m about a year out of college, and if I could go back and talk to my high school self, I&#39;d tell me to skip it and learn a trade while saving money.  Instead, hopefully someone who can still make that choice will see this. </p>

<p>All the socialization and extra curriculars are available without committing to wage slavery if you put effort into seeking them out.  Hell, you could just move to a college town and get most of the benefits of being in college simply by living there.  Granted, you&#39;ll have to pay out of pocket for a gym membership, concerts, and maybe for some extra curricular classes like painting or woodworking, but if you&#39;re not paying an exorbitant tuition and instead are working full time, that won&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>If I&#39;d skipped college like I wanted to do and hadn&#39;t caved in to my parents&#39; and high school facultys&#39; push towards &quot;higher education,&quot; I&#39;d be rich from Bitcoin (long story, but I would&#39;ve started mining in 2009 had I not left the state/my desktop PC for school), and at the very least, have a small nest-egg saved up from working rather than the 40k in debt I&#39;m going to be slaving away at paying for the rest of my life.  My degree has done absolutely nothing towards getting me a &quot;good&quot; job. I&#39;m working for minimum wage and trying to find something better.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant, but excellent post OP.  Young redditors, think long and hard about whether college is truly worth it, and perhaps consider an apprenticeship to learn a trade.  <strong>Check out <a href="http://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/find-opportunities.htm">this US government website</a> that most counselors/parents/educators frequently neglect to mention to you before you begin your path towards a career.</strong></p>

<p><em>EDIT</em></p>

<p>Also, even if you don&#39;t agree that our education system is &quot;slave conditioning&quot; and think that&#39;s a little too out there for you, it&#39;s undeniable that most higher education institutions are in it to make a profit.  Their #1 priority is the bottom line, not your well-being.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn, sounds like you had the right idea with learning a trade and investing in bitcoin. </p>

<p>The harsh truth is that parents and school administrators have every incentive to push college on you. Parents like it because it&#39;s &quot;safe&quot; and so they can put the bumper sticker on their car. As for administrators, it&#39;s literally their job to prepare kids for college and when kids get into prestigious schools it makes them look really good. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that pretty much anything that used to be noble or off-limits for business is now being exploited for profits. K-12 and colleges, and the only reason I chose to attend is because I wanted to study with and meet like minded people. So far its been ehh, but its been fun too. I do realize I could have easily taught myself most of what I&#39;ve learned, especially math - there are so many resources for self-education.</p>

<p>The only reason I would object to the description of school as slave conditioning is to avoid striking fear into the hearts of young ones. Especially the inuitively rigorous types who are usually over-sensitive and have a knack for identifying negative things, fixating on them. This is an easily fueled fire, and it will burn bright all on its own - if there are young ones here they are likely to be inuitive, I&#39;d think. When I was younger, I put a lot of trust into these communities, and they scared the shit out of me most of the time which kept my interest, but I also didn&#39;t realize the brevity of what was being said, versus what those words made me feel. They we&#39;re inequitable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good stuff, OP. Those of you who are still in school, take heed.</p>

<p>I was sent to a Montessori school starting with kindergarten (or maybe pre-k, I don&#39;t remember). It was an <em>amazing</em> experience. We had Spanish lessons, and we could even bring in a blank audio cassette that the Spanish teacher would record phrases and stories on. Different age groups were encouraged to interact with one another. Everyone learned at their own pace, and there wasn&#39;t really a set daily schedule other than for recess, lunch and cleaning up at the end of the day. I was learning multiplication by the second grade. There was a physically disabled girl who attended the school, and all of us took turns helping her when needed. The students all genuinely cared about one another, and negativity was incredibly rare. It was just so nice.</p>

<p>Then, something happened. A conflict of some kind between several parents and the head administrator. A few of us were pulled out and cast into the wilderness of our various public school systems. It was <em>terrifying.</em> I felt like an alien. The whole idea of sitting in desks in neat little rows and being talked at for hours on end just felt so wrong. Gone was the one-on-one interaction with teachers. So too was the mingling with older and younger children. I constantly felt belittled, having already learned most of the stuff this teacher was saying, but having to re-learn it in a different way. No more self-direction, no more learning at your own pace. I never really grew out of that feeling, all the way through high school. I only grew more disillusioned.</p>

<p>After high school, I enrolled in a local community college, because &quot;that&#39;s what you&#39;re supposed to do,&quot; and I had <em>zero</em> interest in going to university. So, I grinded through a couple semesters, not giving a fuck about the vast majority of what was being crammed into my skull. The only classes I truly enjoyed were photography and political science. Not seeing much of a future in either of those, my disillusionment continued to grow until I simply couldn&#39;t take it anymore. I dropped out, got a job and moved out of the house and in with some friends. It was the most liberated I had felt in a <em>long</em> time.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll end the story here for now. If anyone actually read all of that, hopefully you gained some sort of insight from it. My personal takeaway from the whole experience is that public education is incredibly toxic. It seems to breed negativity and divisiveness, the complete opposite of my early education. It makes learning a chore rather than the joyful, almost magical thing it can be when self-directed and collaborative. So, in conclusion, to the younger generations I must say; don&#39;t lose that spark. They are trying to beat it out of you.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Curious why you think this. Maybe because you have more freedom to choose your classes as you get older? It&#39;s certainly true that you can take more ownership of your education; however, in my opinion it&#39;s rare to come across a class that really explains what&#39;s going on in this world. There&#39;s no Propaganda 101, The State as Violence, or International Banking and its Influence on Government in your course catalogue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole &quot;merica&quot; mentality is horrible too. The pledge of allegiance, now that&#39;s something I did NOT like doing, and encouraged others not to do. I wish I could have started working when I was 14, instead of going to school. I could have owned a house by now at 18 with my line of work. People didn&#39;t need college 50 years ago to own a house being a bellhop, but that has a bigger underlying problem. The only reason to go to college, even if you want to be something that seems like it &quot;needs&quot; it (doctor, lawyer) is only either to get a piece of paper that may or may not prove your understanding of the subject and that allows you to work legally in those professions or to network yourself, which I believe the first only feeds into the controlled economical system we current live in, and doesn&#39;t really allow people to find genuine interests and create a better free market. And after basic skills, most of school is either a waste or a joke depending on what career interests yourself. YouTuber&#39;s can better teach most lessons then teachers and some professor&#39;s who are there only because it&#39;s their job, and not a passion or interested in the slightest at the mental development of others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Construction- I install granite. I flip cars. I make more money when both markets are good then some high end paying professions. My father began working when he&#39;s was 11 at a hotel, a theater at 13, the mines when he was 16. He moved out of his state at 15 on his own and owned several cars himself. Not everyone wants or needs to go to school/college outside of basic grade school. I enjoy what I do, and could have learned more about both trades earlier in life. I originally wanted to be a personal trainer, I studied and know more practical working things then someone who has spent years studying things at a college, I just studied over the internet. There are lots of jobs that have skill sets a 14 year old could pick up and learn. Things have changed, and that&#39;s frowned upon and laws against it and unions have been set up to stop it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say slave conditioning, because this can have the same negative effect of fear mongering. Not that you&#39;re doing that, but it could scare these guys. I would say though, that when in school it is definitely a damaging environment if one isn&#39;t aware of themselves. It&#39;s important to know that the expectations of mainstream society, and schools in general can be skewed and only serve the mainstream ideal. These epxectations are pushed down our throats, and constantly forced on us as if to condition us into &#39;being successful.&#39; The point I want to make is that you are and can be whoever you want, you never need to let a test score or a teacher tell you what you are or aren&#39;t capable of.</p>

<p>Look at it this way, school has turned into a way for private companies to make money when schools subscribe to their programs which require new books and proprietary programs annually, which costs are justified by manfactured failure by said companies. I don&#39;t know if boards of education know this yet, maybe they get kick backs, not sure - they might have an incentive to not have an efficient system, i mean. For all time though, school has been a place to teach people how to think, and it&#39;s doesn&#39;t do too much for you if you already think. If anything it can stunt your growth because if you think for yourself, you&#39;re already ahead of the game and you will likely be labeled as a rebel and a problem child.</p>

<p>Schooling can be a good or a bad thing depending on your perspective and what you want to get from it, but the best rule to follow is follow your heart, always be true to yourself, and also in one wise man&#39;s words, &quot;never let schooling get in the way of your education.&quot;</p>

<p>edit: syntax.</p>
