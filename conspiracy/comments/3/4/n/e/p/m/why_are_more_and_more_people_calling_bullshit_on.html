       I have recently noticed that there's been a huge influx of people who are either completely dismissing the official narrative or at least finding it suspicious. On sites such as YouTube 'conspiracy-like' comments get hundreds of likes and people are actively voicing their disbelief. And this isn't just restricted to the internet.

       Because they've grown more dismissive of their government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, most people who reject the official story seem to be college aged young adults. They weren't able to actively engage in their own opinion at younger ages due to lack of interest, as well as school and parental brainwashing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Older generations are generally more patriotic and resistant to ideological change. They were fully cognizant of 9/11 when it occurred, and so they were immediately exposed to the official story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Young adults, however, are a threat because they do not believe the MSM, which is why government is tightening control over social networking.

       I was 26 years old when it happened, and when I watched it live on TV and the official narrative came out, they said "fire took the buildings down". My husband and I carried on, shouting at the TV that they were ignoring Newton's third law of basic physics taught in middle school. We couldn't believe the public were so stupid. Maybe they are catching up now, with the spread of information on the internet?

       I don't mean to split hairs, but are you supporting the narrative or opposing it? Because I don't think you have a grasp on that law if you are supporting the official narrative. At all. Just play a game of Jenga if you need to see how it works.

       I'm all for a sound argument. How do you explain that the towers came down as they did without the force underneath collapsing first or simultaneously? That's about 90% of the building. That is what is in question with Newton's third law of physics.

       NIST says the beams weakened due to fire.  So the static force of the beams pressing up against gravity was removed.  The force of gravity took the floors etc down.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's a pancake thing.  Whole building didn't collapse simultaneously.  One or two floors go, and start carrying the rest with them.

       Okay, so you still don't understand Newton's third law of physics. Either Voldemort put some sort of witchcraft spell on 9/11 or the official narrative is false. Let's say that 25% of the building collapsed on 75% of the building. There is TOO MUCH FORCE from the 75% of the building to allow it to be entirely decimated. That is how Newton's third law works.

       I think you are confusing static and moving forces.  Floor 80 lets loose because of weakened beams.  Drops onto floor 79, wrenches it loose from its own weakened supports.  Both drop together onto floor 78, which lets loose even though its supports are fine; they're not designed to stop a 2-floor moving mass.  The three floors drop onto floor 77, and so on.
      </p>

       says it wasn't a "floor pancake" exactly like I described, but something a bit similar.  Stuff above collapses onto stuff below.]

       “The structure below the level of collapse initiation offered minimal resistance to the falling building mass at and above the impact zone. The potential energy released by the downward movement of the large building mass far exceeded the capacity of the intact structure below to absorb that energy through energy of deformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the stories below the level of collapse initiation provided little resistance to the tremendous energy released by the falling building mass, the building section above came down essentially in free fall, as seen in videos. As the stories below sequentially failed, the falling mass increased, further increasing the demand on the floors below, which were unable to arrest the moving mass.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, the momentum (which equals mass times velocity) of the 12 to 28 stories (WTC 1 and WTC 2, respectively) falling on the supporting structure below (which was designed to support only the static weight of the floors above and not any dynamic effects due to the downward momentum) so greatly exceeded the strength capacity of the structure below that it (the structure below) was unable to stop or even to slow the falling mass. The downward momentum felt by each successive lower floor was even larger due to the increasing mass.

       Yes, "pancake" is not quite the right term; floors did not move separately from everything else.  But it was indeed a progressive, top-to-bottom collapse.  See item 8 in

       I've seen this FAQ. Especially #8. That is where I took my exact statement that NIST doesn't support the pancake theory. Those were their words. NIST is also unable to provide a full explanation of the total collapse.

       As I said, they define "pancake" as "floors separated from everything and fell progressively", and say that's NOT what happened.  Beams bent and stayed attached to floors, and then floors and everything fell progressively.  So they do have an explanation, and I assume it's backed up by facts and evidence.  In what way is it not "full" ?  There will always be unknown details in such a huge event.

       So, you agree that it's no problem that NIST says their explanation is not "full", that they say it wasn't a "pancake".  Not issues.  The official explanation seems to be right, is the only one backed up by the evidence, etc.

       I'm saying that NIST being "unable to provide a full explanation of the total collapse" means that there is no full official explanation of the total (global) collapse. And if someone is going to promote the official story, they shouldn't pretend that there is one. And they certainly shouldn't state that there was a "pancaking."

      <p>
       Why are you trying to give a summary of the day of 9/11? That is not what is being discussed. I'm talking about the global collapses of the Twin Towers.

       Again, in reference to WTC1 / 2 "We are unable to provide a full explanation of the total collapse"

       There is no official explanation. I'm saying that's a "nothing" explanation. So it can't be backed up with evidence.

       The beams were said to have been weakened by kerosene. Kerosene will normally cook you a hamburger but it will not weaken steel. I've used Reddy Heaters for years. They have a thin metal nosecone that heats up to help accumulate heat before dispersion. The thin metal lasts for the entire life of the heater without 'weakening' or melting. There was no source for the forced air that would even make the kerosene burn this hot.

       here's the math. It's impossible that the WTC frame could have gotten hotter than 537 F. with all of the fuel available burning on a single floor at perfect efficiency and none of the fuel being burned in the giant flash outside.

       Finally, PLEASE NOTICE that in  the debris after the demolition the government story requires that we see the results of a gravity fed collapse. that would mean a pancake collapse and that would mean 'pancakes' which is a term that means layers of squashed floors.
      </p>
      <p>
       There WERE NO layers of squashed floors as the government version requires. There was SHRAPNEL as our version requires. Case closed.

       says "Normal building fires and hydrocarbon (e.g., jet fuel) fires generate temperatures up to about 1,100 degrees Celsius ... when bare steel reaches temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius, it softens and its strength reduces to roughly 10 percent of its room temperature value."

       Under absolutely  perfect conditions, which cannot be demonstrated to have existed in the completely invisible steel weakening inferno.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steel doesn't heat instantly and most of the fuel was burned in the first two seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Reddi Heater makes a purposeful attempt to make the same fuel burn as efficiently as possible and yet never damages the thin metal panel that's directly in front of the fan driven flame. Most of the fuel was exhausted outside of the buildings. what was left had no chance of weakening the 280 plus upright beams per floor plus the floor joists. It's just a fairy tale for sociopaths.
      </p>
      <p>
       The law of conservation of momentum was violated. Things never fall in the direction of most resistance and gravity does not produce shrapnel which is what the debris pile consists of. The government story requires layers of squashed floors which simply did not exist in the debris of the twin towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the government is allowed to violate physical laws just by their say so then you could possibly be on to something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Supposedly an inferno existed in the elevator shaft. It did not. One elevator was still being used right up to the collapse of the south tower. Fire Chief Orio Palmer reported two scattered flames on the affected 78th floor and to send up two hoses to  knock it down.
      </p>
      <p>
       . Nothing in NIST's coverup can be demonstrated with forensic facts. Actually they speak the opposite that the buildings were demolished with explosive force. That is why NIST stopped their story at  the initiation of collapse and did not try to explain the actual collapses.

       Those were airplanes that had taken off fairly recently, for long flights.  They must have had ten or twenty thousand gallons of fuel aboard.  I don't think it's possible for that much fuel to burn "in the first two seconds".  Got a source for that claim ?
      </p>
      <p>
       And the buildings had paper and wood and carpet and people in them, which burn.  The fires burned for what, half an hour or so ?  And the impact probably broke beams and broke off fireproofing from steel.  No one says the steel "heated instantly".
      </p>
      <p>
       "Weakening" a beam under heavy load is not the same as "damaging a thin metal panel".  If the panel had been under load that required it to maintain full strength, the test might have some validity.

       That analysis seems flawed in at least two ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         jet fuel was not the only thing fueling the fire
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         not all of the steel and concrete etc had to be heated to the steel-weakening temperature to make the steel fail and the floor fall
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The govt explanation "has no evidence to back it up" ?  They have IDs of the hijackers, their records of traveling to USA and taking flight lessons, claim of responsibility by OBL, evidence that the planes took off and hit the towers and Pentagon, evidence that all the passengers are missing, debris from planes at the sites, etc.

       Because the official conspiracy theory doesn't have a leg to stand on, it's bullshit without a single piece of evidence to back it up.

       I would suggest it may have something to do with Rebekah Roth's new book. She has been doing a lot of radio interviews about it. Here is a link; Rebekah Roth Methodical Illusion Missing Pieces of 9 11

       People are acting out against authority.  People are scared because the economy has been terrible, inequality is rising, wars, terrorism, social morals such as homosexuality are changing, they feel their religion is threatened, etc.  So they lash out mindlessly at any authority: against govt, police, scientists, etc.  That's a big factor behind most conspiracy theorists, anti-vaxxers, climate change deniers, etc.

       Okay.  And I repeat, there will always be unknown details in such a huge event.  That's not evidence of govt conspiracy or something.
