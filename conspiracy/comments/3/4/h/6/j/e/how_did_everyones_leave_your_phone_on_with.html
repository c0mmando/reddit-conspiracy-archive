        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just curious as to whether or not people actually tried this, and wondering what they found. Here are my results:</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any Spanish channels available on TV, as I live in a very rural part of northern New England. I couldn&#39;t find a Spanish radio station either. But I did find an ESPN sports radio station and, since I&#39;m not particularly interested in any professional sports, I figured that this might suffice -- sports stuff isn&#39;t something I would ever search for or look at on my phone, so if my microphone is doing voice recognition stuff to advertise at me, then I should start seeing sports advertising on my phone, right? </p>

<p>Prior to running this experiment, I downloaded a few free games and apps, as I figured they would advertise at me, including 94%, Tiny Death Star, Accupedo (a pedometer with a terrible-sounding name), QuizUp, and Burger. I played / used them for a bit to see what ads would pop up. They seemed fairly random, most being for other games and apps from the Play Store. </p>

<p>After this, I left my phone about 4 feet from the radio overnight, with the volume up high enough that it could be comfortably heard. (EDIT - both the main Facebook app and Messenger were running throughout this experiment). I didn&#39;t plug my phone in to charge, as I wasn&#39;t sure if maybe it would think &quot;I&#39;m plugged in so I won&#39;t listen right now.&quot; My phone was fully charged when I started at around 6 PM (EST) let it go for about 8.5 hours, had around 65 percent charge when I woke up around 2:30 AM (I work third shift and sleep weird hours on my days off).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve used the new applications, as well as others I had previously installed on the phone (including Chrome, Reddit is Fun, MyFitnessPal, Facebook, Messenger, Amazon, FlowFree, Pixel Dungeon, and others). I have not noticed any significant change in advertisement content, nor have I noticed any sports-related games or apps taking the place of the games and apps that were previously being pushed by the ads.</p>

<p>My phone is a T-mobile Motorola/Google Nexus 6. It is not rooted or unlocked, and I&#39;m running the stock OS, updated to Lollipop 5.1 via the OTA update from T-mobile. I have the Facebook app installed, as well as Facebook&#39;s Messenger app. I was on my home WiFi, which is Comcast Xfinity. If I were to ever actually be a shill for any company or organization, it would be T-mobile, as their customer service is the best and they are awesome. But I digress... </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to continue doing this for a few more days/nights, as maybe my phone hasn&#39;t heard enough about sports to make a difference. I&#39;ll also try it with my phone plugged in, as well as with WiFi turned off so I get an internet signal from the cell tower instead, just to cover my bases. If you can think of any other variables I should switch out, please let me know and I&#39;ll give it a shot. </p>

<p>If I notice any difference, I&#39;ll report back.</p>

<p>EDIT - I just downloaded Pandora and will see if that does anything, as someone here mentioned it and I believe it was mentioned in the other threads about this. I&#39;m also going to try finding a Spanish radio or TV station on the internet to try after a few more days of the ESPN radio. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. However, others said that they were also going to run the experiment, which would give us more information to analyze. Though nobody else seems to be reporting in so far. </p>

<p>(EDIT - The above statement is incorrect, as one other person did report similar findings elsewhere in this post prior to me writing this comment. My apologies for the oversight.)</p>

<p>I would also argue that it&#39;s not even a particularly scientific experiment at that, as there&#39;s not really any way to confirm the validity of any data that may be collected. For all you know, I could just be lying about the whole thing. I&#39;m not, but you really only have my word to go on, I suppose. Just as else who reports on this could also be lying, and we can only use our best judgment to determine whether what they present is factual or not. </p>

<p>Assuming any of the other people who said they would participate actually present their findings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you gave them that information.
though still a bit weird, you shouldn&#39;t fear that... post-capitalism this will be a good thing, hopefully bringing you news and initiatives from within your local community as relevant to your interests etc. never fear progress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difference is, Google specifically tells you it&#39;s going to do this. You&#39;re also willingly giving information about something you&#39;re interested in.</p>

<p>Facebook has never said anywhere &quot;we may turn your microphone on, listen to you, and serve ads to you based on what we hear.&quot; But some people are assuming this is happening. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen this ToS argument made a few times, but I can&#39;t find any relevant text to confirm it... Could you point out where in the <a href="https://m.facebook.com/terms.php">Terms of Service</a> it states that it can turn my microphone on without my consent and listen to me?</p>

<p>And honestly, I am doubtful that this will come out with a positive result; however, I am at least willing to put my preconceived notions about this to the test.</p>

<p>EDIT - I&#39;d appreciate it if people would refrain from downvoting the poster above for voicing his thoughts on this matter (was at -1 when I made this edit). Censorship is not beneficial to reasonable discourse. </p>
