       I've seen many posts on here about how people just woke and feel alone. You aren't alone, there are so many of us out there. I may hide behind this shit job and shitty water cooler talk but I feel you, I get you and understand you. I was was once there, it's dark and scary. But throw hints, we are many and we wanna fucking revolt. We hide behind the day to day shit. I wear a shirt and tie, but tonight I'm a revolutionary. You'd never never know, people are good at hiding shit. You drop a hint I'll talk to you. I will speak the truth. People are weird, never think you are alone. I make a lot of money and I am a "truth seeker/conspiracy theorists".  You aren't alone, this is a PSA to all. You aren't alone. You are beautiful and you mean something to all. I had a convo with someone which led me to this. Don't think you are alone. Please..... I'd trade my money for peace (I currently donate most to good causes). I don't drive a ferrari but a ford escort. I wear a suit and tie, but dshop at TJ Max.

       Nice thoughts here. Just raising a few alarms in my mind though. We know there are government operators on social networks. We know the FBI likes to manipulate people into doing stupid stuff like triggering fake explosives.

       To me this post looks like it may be intended to attract some dumb loner in to joining a group and doing something stupid.

       Who the fuck writes "don't off yourself" to be interpreted as "don't wall yourself off from society"? There's a dozen better ways to phrase "don't off yourself" to avoid the connotation of suicide.

       TIL I'm a FBI/NSA recruitment tool. I'm a dude who talked with a man who was alone and helpless. He express a concern and was lonely because of what he learned. He said, "what is the point, why dont I just off myself", which I went to tell him what I'm saying to you all. I'm not FBI, dafuq. To say people awakening feel this world is wrong and they feel lost, it's our job to tell them. Dude, there are many of us. You aren't alone and don't fucking think leaving us matters/helps anything. But yeah, I'm an FBI agent. Go fuck off. You are all too paranoid. I'm a conspiracy theorist, but holy shit.

       Edit: by the way, I talked him out of it. Fuck off. I helped a man. smh. You are all are so fucking paranoid, wth.

       Having suspicions of the government and disarming explosives are two separate things.  Honestly some people on this subreddit need to get treatment for their paranoia.  This post applies to pretty much every post downwards as well.  People coalescing is not a danger, it unifies people and allows people to make friends + etc.  The paranoid posters posting stuff like this just sets up barriers in the community and separates people.  So if u don't have an ulterior motive to posting this crap, DON"T

       Guess I should take my meds right? Because separation is bad, in fact meeting strangers on the Internet who discuss "wanting to revolt" or "being revolutionary" is 100% safe!

       So what? I make new accounts. If I had one, it'd be in the 10k of karma. You really think a stable account matters? For being a conspiracy theorist, you are doing it wrong. I'd suggest, making a new account every 500 points, they catch on ;). But as people think I am a agent. Dumb fucks. I'm trying to actually help those who need help. You know there are some out there. I care about humanity.

       Being
       <em>
        connected
       </em>
       is not the same as being "all one".  We are not hive mind or colony, we are individuals connected to the same source but still autonomous.  You should listen to the mushrooms you try. ;-)

       I agree with this post, I would say most people have dissatisfaction with the government.  To be honest, most is probably an understatement.  They smell corruption, it is just the amount they care that differentiates them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally not only should people have the understanding of like minded people around them, but if they seriously want to help, they should pursue beneficial jobs/do work to aid the cause, not to be too corny.

       An instance of this is my interest in computer security.  I wish to learn how to be free from surveillance when I'm on the computer.  I plan on making a career out of this.  After I learn what VPN's are most secure/other methods to stay safe on the internet, I will pay it back to the community providing tips and etc.
