        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello, I&#39;ve never posted here before so forgive me if I&#39;m breaking any rules or something like that.</p>

<p>so, if any of you post on r/news like I do, you may have noticed recently there is a new shill for the US gov/cops going by <a href="/u/MRB2012">/u/MRB2012</a></p>

<p>Almost all of his posts, all of them, have to do with the police, and he&#39;s always defending him. His account was a normal account that posted only on TIA for a few months then he went inactive. Well, suddenly, just 2 weeks ago he started posting again.</p>

<p><strong>A lot</strong></p>

<p>How a lot you ask?</p>

<p>1,000 posts. 40,000 comment Karma. <strong>In two weeks.</strong> <em>yeah fucking right</em></p>

<p><strong>I lost count but he&#39;s at like 5k posts since he came back, it&#39;s pretty fucky the mental gymnastics he does lol</strong></p>

<p>That&#39;s <strong>60 posts a day</strong>, on a <strong>normal 8 hour shift that would be 7.5 posts an hour</strong>, or around <strong>8 minutes per post</strong>. I&#39;ve met basement dwelling no lifers (no offense, swear to shit, by this statement, I love being a fat nerd more than anything in my life) who would have trouble posting at this rate for their own hobbies, let alone if they worked or did anything else, even just fucking play games or watch anime. No, I&#39;m 100% sure this guy is a paid shill. But why?</p>

<p>It&#39;s highly discouraging to me personally, though that may actually be the point, it&#39;s just that i already know r/news is censored to shit and you can&#39;t really trust anythig posted there, I just feel like it&#39;s one of the only default subs I can go to and post something serious without getting laughed out of the room, and it&#39;s nice to be able to talk news and politics without having to go somewhere crazy like r/politics. But if the people I&#39;m talking to are fake shills and the news articles are carefully selected by mods to craft a story thread, what&#39;s the fucking point? this is a more personal final point but I hope none of you ever gild anyone, this site deserves no support after what happened when the new bitch stepped in to lead this forums.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked around on reddit and I&#39;ve found nothing about this guy, who&#39;s paying him, if he&#39;s even being paid or why? What is his end goal? Is he just a troll with WAAAAY too much free time? Or is something more sinister going on here. Do you guys think this shill was setup by reddit themselves or do you think an outside company hired him? Who knows, maybe he&#39;s an NSA shill.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/u/MRB2012">/u/MRB2012</a> how does it feel to sell your humanity for $10 an hour. How does it feel to spend your entire life being a shill for child rapists, murderers, and satanic cult worshippers. How does it feel  when you are no longer human, when you are just an empty hollow fucking loser? I mean honestly, really tell me. TPTB will never speak to us, they are too cowardly, too afraid of their own shadows but you apparently don&#39;t mind &quot;being in public&quot;. What&#39;s it like to want to propagate a destructive police state? To push for the distractions against the TPP? Do you have children? I hope not, you are no longer a normal person, if you ever did have kids my moneys on you would beat them and completely fuck them up.</strong></p>

<p><strong>How does it feel to be hardly better than the pathetic losers and violent demons of stories, to work on behalf of those obsessed only with pain and destruction?</strong></p>

<p><strong>How does it feel to be a walking, moving, living pile of shit? I&#39;d love to know what it&#39;s like to live such a pathetic life, I would never know, If my life were as worthless as yours I&#39;d likely have hung myself at that point. I&#39;m sick of you pathetic faggoty little shills pretending they can run the fucking world. You know what you are though, you are a parasite, you are a fucking virus to other humans. You produce nothing of value, you contribute nothing to humanity. Through and through you are LITERALLY WORTHLESS. Stop being a piece of shit and help humanity, if you&#39;re that fucking obsessed with death and desctruction, then why don&#39;t you just kill yourself? No, I&#39;m fucking serious, if you love death and violence so much, why not die? It would be a rush wouldn&#39;t it? No one could do a job like yours unless they reveled in pain so clearly you&#39;re fucked in the head mate, so why not just put a bullet in your brain? Would probably give you a rush, bet you&#39;d get a quick stiffy as you bled out wouldn&#39;t you, ey? I don&#39;t feel bad typing this shit at all because you and I both know beyond these stupid words and stupid servers and everything else, that you&#39;re just a fucking pile of shit who will NEVER be honest and will NEVER fucking face me here, fucking never. You will NEVER acknowledge your egregrious posting history, you will NEVER note how you post 8 hours a day 5 days a week, you will NEVER admit that you constantly are posting pro-police propaganda, and you will NEVER do any of that because you and I both know that you&#39;re a fucking coward.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, and I&#39;ve noticed them call people cowards like, a lot. Excuse the arm chair psychology, but I&#39;ve noticed people who use the word coward a lot tend to be violent and irrational people.</p>

<p>By the by, why did you downvote this? Are paid shills not worthy of discussion in this sub? Or was it dowvnoted by non other than MRB2012 himself?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I was just saying. I dunno it&#39;s just really weird to me, although I guess everyone here has already had many encounters with paid shills so it&#39;s nothing new to them. I just wish I could figure who&#39;s paying them and why. Honestly, I seriously think someone from P&amp;S might be behind this. If there&#39;s anything our government should put on a terrorist watch list it&#39;s that fucking sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not military. My brother was in the military, and as far as I can tell, they wouldn&#39;t do something like this. To be honest, on a side note, I don&#39;t know what people like Nixon were so afraid of in consideration of the anti Vietnam war protests and their subsequent shut down. So they made drugs illegal to prevent people from expanding their minds and realizing the amount of bullshit going on, however I don&#39;t think if they fully legalized all drugs and stopped the &quot;war&quot; tomorrow that people would suddenly be anti-military. So I&#39;m just not sure what the goal is, it just doesn&#39;t make sense. Sure we fight for the oil and the poppy seeds, however if religion has taught me nothing else, it&#39;s that humans don&#39;t need a reason to hate and kill each other.</p>

<p>Murder cover up.</p>

<p>MRB2012 has made 1600 posts and almost all of them pertain to the police in the past 3 weeks.</p>

<p>You are incapable of defending yourself, so you instead resort to mockery. You are a person who aspires to be in a position of power, but your absolute lack of empathy and your gross incompetence only reassures me that there is something seriously wrong with officers across the nation. But don&#39;t let information, facts, and reality get in the way of you posting memes. It&#39;s really cute when you guys call your dead gang bangers &quot;brothers&quot;.</p>

<p>If you are incapable of responding in a real manner, I will refrain from responding to you any further and assume that you are literally a paid government whore that has no emotions and no friends of family. In other words, you are a dangerous psychopath and I refuse to let you and your cronies take over reddit and dictate the dialogue.</p>
