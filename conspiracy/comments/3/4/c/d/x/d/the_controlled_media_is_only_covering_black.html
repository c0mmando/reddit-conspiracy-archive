       The problem is an epidemic among all races. News outlets never even examine this angle, let alone look into statistics. Maybe the percentage is higher for blacks, I don't know, because the goal isn't to do an honest examination of the facts anyway.

       I absolutely hate this argument on here (and it's a popular one). "Divide and conquer". I don't know what world you live in but shit is divided. Black people are marginalized and put down so much in American society its disgusting. The media makes it about "oh those black folks are burning shit again." But never talk about why. They never talk about why because if we question the way police and society as a whole treats a segment of the population we will question other things too. We need to stand together with the blacks in this country and get some real change to happen.

       Yes and no. An easy way to make a problem seem somewhat isolated is to use race. The fact is black people. White people. Brown people. Are all little people to the government. It's bigger then a race issue.

       100% agree. While TPTB's definitely want to divide us over wedge issues at election time (media is complicit), we have to acknowledge that our black brothers and sisters are marginalized and "hunted" by the police state at an alarming rate. Just look at the prison inmate statistics by race in this country for evidence.

       anyone who is part of a separate subculture is hunted this way -- especially blacks and drug users -- because there is a history of resistance, free thinking, rebelliousness, and a history of fighting abuse/tyranny.

       they dont want groups like that to have unity and strength. it is MUCH bigger than race alone.

A few final words tho, I hope you have a good day, as I don't seek any sort of negative engagement, and also, damn that new Kendrick Lamar album, sick with it... take it from someone who's friendly to all races.

       I think that's what the OP was getting at. The media plays both sides to drive the wedge deeper. African-Americans watch the media and see "another white cop killed a black kid" while at the same time the same news source is reporting "these black animals are burning down their own neighborhood, again." Paraphrasing obviously.

       It's both though...
      </p>
      <p>
       Police absolutely go after blacks differently than whites, no question at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       But police will still shoot white people or beat them without consequence as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the media wants to focus on just black deaths so they can have two sides bicker and fight. Racists are always going to say it's  black criminals fault, they won't be swayed no matter what.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if the media were also showing John Geer and David Hooks on the news constantly then maybe racists would actually side with black people on something. The media doesn't want that

       I completely agree with this sentiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media keeps us focused on the violent and "menacing" behavior of a small fraction of the black community. Even now--after perusing the headlines--I have no idea what's going on in Baltimore other than looting and rioting.
       <em>
        Why
       </em>
       these things are happening isn't covered. The goal isn't to have the public feel compassion or empathy... it's to instill a sense of fear and otherization.

       Perhaps don't call them animals, then maybe you can connect with them at a human level more. They've tried non violent ways of change for decades and have been suppressed. They have finally had enough, and this is the only thing that gets people's attention. Unfortunately the media just talks about the fires and looting until the next big story then it all goes away. It will keep happening.

       First of all, what does it matter to a store owner when blacks loot and burn down his store? Do you think he cares why they did it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, blacks are criticized because they do things that merit criticism, like looting and burning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, blacks are involved more with police than whites because blacks do far more crime than whites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fourth, we don't need divide and conquor tactics. Blacks are already divided from whites and always have been. The difference is genetic, and no social program can overcome it, as the experience of the past fifty years in American has amply demonstrated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fifth, there is no standing together with blacks. They hate us and always will hate us, because they know we are more intelligent and more capable than they can ever hope to be, both as individuals and as societies. Blacks build nothing, accomplish nothing, achieve nothing. Look at the history of subsaharan Africa. That is the legacy of the negro race -- nothing.

       Before you get flamed for being a rabid racist, which maybe you are, people should ask themselves how it is Asians and Indians can migrate to America without a cent to their name and in a short time frame own their own businesses and their kids win spelling bees and get the highest grades in school. I try to be as color blind as possible (which according to the Left makes me a covert racist) but there is definitely something cultural going on here. And it has been exasperated by the "helping" hand of Uncle Sam.

       Well that's it right there, culture. Asian parents have the reputation of mercilessly pushing their children to achieve in school and that comprises their culture since everyone doing the same thing is the essence of culture itself.  If you are surrounded by people who don't exercise and have poor diets, it's quite likely that you will adopt such a lifestyle and yet many will still blame being fat as genetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me what kills the genetics argument is that many racists also go after women as they believe the cornerstone of society is the traditional family unit so a woman's place is in the home raising children and not in a man's workplace because they are naturally less capable. Simply living and working in the world proves this is a loser's fantasy because I've found that women are as capable if not more so than men (because maybe too much media (distraction) is directed towards men) to do any kind of job, from doctors, lawyers, engineers, business owners to driving cabs.

       Your argument stems from the assumption that races can be considered of value over one another. In fact, European success has been luck and historical circumstance. Another historical circumstance has been the oppression of the negro race in America for its whole history and only legally stopped not even a generation ago. All those generations unable to accumulate and pass on wealth. We're unable to control the time and place of our birth and their accidental impoverishment as much their fault as a white persons relatively comfortable breeze through life, a result of INHERITED wealth.

       The establishment is expert at dividing America's anti-government sentiment along racial lines: white anti-gov protesters are called "racist gun nuts," and blacks are "criminal looters." Yet unjust laws permeate our lives and are enforced with excessive violence. Both races have legit grievances. The common enemy is out of control government; we should never let the media divide and conquer a righteous populist sentiment.

       Blacks are criminal looters, and it is not racist to say so. Look at the looting videos, and count the black faces doing the looting. Now count the white faces looting, if you can find one white face.

       First off, American society is based on civil disobedience. If in these stories the media would bring up the fact that most every freedom we won in history involved lawless protests (Tea Party, Whiskey Rebellion, Shay's Rebellion, slave uprisings, etc), I'd give them them the benefit of the doubt. But they pretend like it's not a legitimate tactic of protest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right wing gun protests often times involve violating the law. So do tax violators. But in each case the media carefully uses terms and perspectives to keep common white and black people from joining forces against the corrupt establishment.

       Governments literally create false realities to keep people in conflict. That is so that populations remain fearful of each other and divided and do not unite to overthrow the elites. It is a part of a strategy of tension that has been employed for at least hundreds of years through governments and probably thousands of years through relgions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not natural for people to hate each other like this. We are manipulated into it. The following is a passage from Howard Zinn's "A People's History..."
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Black and white worked together, fraternized together. The very fact that laws had to be passed after a while to forbid such relations indicates the strength of that tendency. In 1661 a law was passed in Virginia that "in case any English servant shall run away in company of any Negroes" he would have to give special service for extra years to the master of the runaway Negro. In 1691, Virginia provided for the banishment of any "white man or woman being free who shall intermarry with a negro, mulatoo, or Indian man or woman bond or free."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       from another section:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Bacon's Rebellion brought together groups from the lower classes. White frontiersmen started the uprising because they were angry about the way the colony was being run. Then white servants and black slaves joined the rebel­ lion. They were angry, too-mostly about the huge gap between rich and poor in Virginia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The greatest fear of wealthy southern planters was that black slaves and poor whites would combine in another uprising like Bacon's Rebellion. One tool to keep blacks and whites from uniting was racism. Edmund Morgan , a historian of slavery in Virginia , wrote in his American Slavery, American Freedom that racism was not a "natural" feeling about the differ­ences between black and white. Instead, white leaders encouraged a negative view of blacks. If poor whites felt contempt for African Americans, they were less likely to join with them in rebellion.
       </p>

       White kids have better access to rural areas and more in-home training at hiding shit from their over-protective parents - and thus they get sneaky with their drug use. I've seen paranoid white kids tripple-ziplock and burn shut their baggies to smell proof them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black kids, on the other hand, aren't as likely to be out in the sticks. Try smoking a blunt in a big city sometime, it's not the most subtle of activities to do illegally. They also aren't on quite the same level of paranoia about getting caught, at least from my experience.

       Ding-ding-ding. Somebody gets it. What is every white man's worst nightmare? To come home and find several black males in his living room. What is every black man's worst nightmare? To come and find several white police in his living room.
      </p>
      <p>
       In retrospect, it is obvious that policies and practices were enacted to criminalize blacks through the deliberate decimation of their communities and infrastructure. During the 1970s, racial equality was a reasonable and attainable goal. Then crack cocaine and Reagan's War on Drugs were used to restore segregation.

       The White guy who finds several blacks in his living room finds people who have no reason to be there. The black guy who finds White police in his living room usually -- but not always -- finds people who deserve to be there.

       I'm white and this is true - they held me locked up in the back of a car in cuffs and I only had pot. they told the person driving to leave, after pulling us over for no reason. when they said no theyd wait for me, they told her to leave, and that I should "walk home" - where I live this is a minor violation, having pot.
      </p>
      <p>
       i lived 50 minutes away. they knew that. when she didnt leave, they gave her a ticket for waiting for me! made up the cause. she fought it in court and won cuz her dad is a millionaire who won the lottery.
      </p>
      <p>
       if she hadn't waited for me they were going to take me somewhere and do god knows what. maybe even kill me. I just know it in my heart that its true and thank god she waited and took the ticket
      </p>

       Im white - and Ive been abused countless other ways too - thankfully no violence yet, but that time was very close.

       I don't know. I mean racist people do exist but most people aren't racist. I feel like the media is trying to make black people hate white people and vice versa. Too bad my family's mixed so those strategies don't work on me. You're right though the main threads are horrible. Don't let them get to you, because that's the entire purpose of this whole shit storm. They're trying to divide us by playing on our prejudices.

They do not present news in which the white person is the innocent victim, or they distort that news so that it seems like other whites are the criminals, rather than blacks. It's all slanted against whites.

       More black people would see what other blacks are doing to innocent whites, realize there is unjust behavior on both sides, reason would gain ground over rage.

       People who think like this need to read some fucking books about how the world is for black people in America.  I would start with The Prison Letters of George Jackson to provide some perspective in order to do something more productive than make delusional claims on

       Saying "maybe the the percentage is higher for blacks, maybe I don't know" demonstrates that you haven't even looked into the issue enough to make an informed opinion, yet we're supposed to accept your sweeping generalization about the issue?

       You're pretty much agreeing with my general point. The facts, including what you stated, are never discussed. One case is honed in on, the violence is covered, and it is made into a divisive issue. Of course showing data proving bias wouldn't fit the narrative of selling stories on emotion, it might lead to an actual discussion of facts.

       First off, American society is based on civil disobedience. If in these stories the media would bring up the fact that most every freedom we won in history involved lawless protests (Tea Party, Whiskey Rebellion, Shay's Rebellion, slave uprisings, etc), I'd give them them the benefit of the doubt. But they pretend like it's not a legitimate tactic of protest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right wing gun protests often times involve violating the law. So do tax violators. But in each case the media carefully uses terms and perspectives to keep common white and black people from joining forces against the corrupt establishment.
