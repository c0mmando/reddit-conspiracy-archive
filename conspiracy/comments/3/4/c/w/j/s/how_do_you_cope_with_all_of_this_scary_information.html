    <div class="md"><p>Aww, man. I&#39;m sorry this sub has you freaked out. I suggest you take a break from it for awhile. Try and give meditation a go - 20 minutes before bed works wonders to relax the agitated psyche. You don&#39;t need to make your &quot;mind go blank&quot;, just repeat some self-affirming thoughts with your eyes closed while focusing on your breathing. Some soothing music also does wonders.</p>

<p>This might be part of the problem. I&#39;m not saying to stop taking them, and it can be very dangerous to do so without direction. Maybe for now you could just take a break from researching and calm your nerves. Take a vacation if possible and get lost in the pleasures of life. It&#39;s good to remind yourself every once in a while that it isn&#39;t all doom and gloom.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve stopped researching for a while now.

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone goes through this as they &quot;wake up.&quot; I was depressed, ant-social, smoked a ton of pot, lost myself in Netflix and comic books and porn. After a while, if you&#39;ve got any kind of humanity left in yourself at all, you&#39;ll get sick of it. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t endorse loudly enough the importance of staying social. Meet other good people. Join a group that does something you like -- for me it was biking and filmgoing. Exercise. Keep your thoughts and opinions about the world beneath the veil to yourself at first. You&#39;ll be surprised by how many people are aware things are a mess and need changing. </p>

<p>The thing to remember is that under the veil there are Good Guys as well, who are pushing back against the darkness. There&#39;s bad shit that gets foiled that we never hear about. </p>

<p>Hand on. WORK towards your happiness, or at least a balance of good and bad. This material world cannot, by definition, be all good or all bad. It&#39;s a balance, same as day/night, man/woman, awake/sleep, and so on. Problem is, you&#39;ve been living in that &quot;one&quot; world and now you&#39;re seeing the other side. Don&#39;t forget the &quot;one&quot; world exists, too. </p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Breathe. Relax. Grab a towel if there&#39;s anything else bothering you right now.</p>

<p>What you&#39;re feeling is the result of the enchantment that David Icke cast over you. He is a sorceror and if you give him control of your mind then you will feel lost and alone. <strong>You are not alone, we are all together</strong>.</p>

<p>Knowledge can always free you, but beware there&#39;s more darkness in the way before you dig yourself out. You absolutely can stand living, it&#39;s why you&#39;re asking for a better way!</p>

<p>Don&#39;t take it all so seriously; the wisest sages throughout history have told us that it&#39;s all just a game, a ride, it isn&#39;t real. Don&#39;t worry. Go play. Find something fun and engage with the world around you. Play opens up our creative energies and attracts others to join in. Channel some creativity and suddenly problems will seem like opportunities for growth. Remember there are 7 billion other people here too. You can&#39;t mess this up too much, so don&#39;t try so hard that you stress out. Have faith and try to work some magic in your own life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weed/psychedelics, meditation, cooking, taking walks in the woods.</p>

<p>Make friends with the darkness, make friends with feeling lost. If you &quot;know where you are&quot; in the world and are comfortable with it then you are either sociopathic or enlightened. If you&#39;re the former, you wouldn&#39;t be looking for answers and if you&#39;re the latter you&#39;d know there is nothing to worry about.</p>

<p>It is perfectly reasonable to feel paranoid and uncomfortable. If you don&#39;t feel despair, anger, fear etc then you don&#39;t understand the scope of the situation. If you do feel those things, don&#39;t dwell on them or carry them as burdens when they aren&#39;t relevant to the moment; just let the experience gently remind you that you are in fact a functioning human being and in this day and age that practically makes you a demigod. </p>

<p>It is hard, but there is a reason you as an individual have encountered the information. It means that in some way you were ready for it. Shouldn&#39;t that be empowering instead of scary and depressing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aww, man. I&#39;m sorry this sub has you freaked out. I suggest you take a break from it for awhile. Try and give meditation a go - 20 minutes before bed works wonders to relax the agitated psyche. You don&#39;t need to make your &quot;mind go blank&quot;, just repeat some self-affirming thoughts with your eyes closed while focusing on your breathing. Some soothing music also does wonders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not like the &#39;mentally ill conspiracy theorist&#39; isn&#39;t already a beaten dead horse cliche, you have to come here and pretend like it&#39;s a real thing and act like you are part of this community when this thread and it&#39;s comments are the only post you&#39;ve ever made here.</p>

<p>The question is are you just some sociopathic troll who does this pro bono or is this actually your job.</p>
