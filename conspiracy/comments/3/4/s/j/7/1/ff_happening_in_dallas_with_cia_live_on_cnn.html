<h2>THIS IS A CIA SPOKESPERSON REMINDER WTF</h2>

<p>islam is incompatable to the first amendment linked to the fact that people can so easily get guns in the US
There is a conflict.</p>

<p>people who muslims of converts to muslims will be followed by violence</p>

<p>CNN: american freedom defense anitiative, the AFD is the anti-muslim group and that the anti muslim group says islam is a war on free speech.</p>

<p>talking about &quot;moderate anti-muslims&quot;</p>

<p>Bob Bayer from new-port beach ca.</p>

<p>Thanking the quick action of the swat team &quot; our thoughts and prayers are with them tonight, and it was indeed swift action&quot;... &quot;[both news anchors at the SAME FUCKING TIME: <strong><em>The swat team</em></strong>&quot; and the man continues: &quot;was assigned there ***ahead of time expecting possible trouble like this and it seems they intercepted two gunman before they pretty much got out of the car, they did get out of the car but they were pretty much shot dead&quot; then the female says &quot;within an instant, and it was only 15 seconds and it was over what could have been a very long night, a very ugly night there...&quot;</p>

<p>This is fucking crazy.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Action outside freespeech event, CNN comes back on - a cop/soldier announces with authority two gunman and one cop shot, but that yall need to get calm and we need to move you to the other hall!</p>

<p>first yelled question from audience:</p>

<p>&quot;WERE THE SUSPECTS MUSLIM?&quot;</p>

<p>Cop: we dont know yet, we are just going to get you all moved. </p>

<p>CNN then cuts immediately to &quot;that was the scene&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>CNN says they have no idea if they were muslims, but their motives are obvious at this stage.</p>

<p>Arabian peninsula - swat was pre-placed at the event because they expected trouble - and &quot;we dont even know where the people are, they are still being held</p>

<p><strong>ITS A PSYOP SYMBOL</strong>:</p>

<p><strong><em>&quot;The american LEOs/Nat. Guard are &quot;defending the right to make fun of Muhammad!&quot;</em></strong></p>

<p>They are showing soldiers in desert cam gear. Huge guys.</p>

<p>There appear to be ~80 actual attendees.</p>

<p>CNN just re-confirmed that there were swat pre-deployed to the &quot;free-speech&quot; rally.</p>

<p>Both bodies still laying at scene - checking for bombs in car</p>

<p>Happy with all the LEO cooperation</p>

<p>CNN: <strong><em>The two dead gunamen are the ONLY people involved&quot;</em></strong></p>

<p>Cop: &quot;*oh yes, no indication that there was any one else eing involved. We havent cheked all the vehicles for bombs&quot;</p>

<p>Talking about how much private security they hired - cop says he doesnt know... </p>

<p><strong><em>this is a budgetary psyop to get more LEO funding</em></strong></p>

<p>HOLY SHIT, CNN just asked if the <strong><em>Feedom of speech rally</em></strong>  WAS ASKING FOR AN ATTACK.</p>

<p>It is &quot;<strong><em>irresponsible</em></strong> to hold a freedom of speech rally when you know you need this kind of security&quot; -- ACTUAL QUOTE</p>

<p>&quot;They said exactly that - that Muslim extremists don&#39;t want us to have freedom of speech&quot; -- Worst PSYOP PR firm script ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A false flag event is best-defined as an event or reality that has been contrived and created for manipulating public opinion and/or policy in both foreign and domestic governments.</p>

<p>For instance, while the attack on the Lusitania was real, in the sense that Germany did sink it, the whole situation was artificially created to cause them to fire upon the boat and kill Americans.  This drove public opinion in the US to join in the war against Germany.</p>

<p>This is just the same as another false flag that didn&#39;t involve direct killing:  The Nayirah testimony.  She was given acting lessons and lied about babies being thrown from incubators in hospitals.  This drove enough opinion to go into Kuwait for &quot;humanitarian reasons&quot; while conveniently ignoring the fact that Iraq invaded Kuwait because Bush-connected oil companies were slant-drilling into Iraq.  Saddam also gave them multiple warnings to stop.</p>

<p><strong>Pamela Geller</strong>, president of the American Freedom Defense Initiative, <strong>put on the Muhammad Art Exhibit</strong>. She referred to it as a &quot;free speech event&quot; on Twitter. One tweet from her after the apparent attack read &quot;this is a war.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Notice that EVERY single media outlet WILL NOT tell you that Pamella Geller is the leader of a anti-muslim hate-group</strong>.  </p>
