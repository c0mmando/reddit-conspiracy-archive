       " and the man continues: "was assigned there ***ahead of time expecting possible trouble like this and it seems they intercepted two gunman before they pretty much got out of the car, they did get out of the car but they were pretty much shot dead" then the female says "within an instant, and it was only 15 seconds and it was over what could have been a very long night, a very ugly night there..."

       This is fucking crazy.

       Action outside freespeech event, CNN comes back on - a cop/soldier announces with authority two gunman and one cop shot, but that yall need to get calm and we need to move you to the other hall!

      <p>
       Cop: we dont know yet, we are just going to get you all moved.

       CNN then cuts immediately to "that was the scene"
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       CNN says they have no idea if they were muslims, but their motives are obvious at this stage.

       Arabian peninsula - swat was pre-placed at the event because they expected trouble - and "we dont even know where the people are, they are still being held

       There appear to be ~80 actual attendees.

       CNN just re-confirmed that there were swat pre-deployed to the "free-speech" rally.

       A false flag event is best-defined as an event or reality that has been contrived and created for manipulating public opinion and/or policy in both foreign and domestic governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, while the attack on the Lusitania was real, in the sense that Germany did sink it, the whole situation was artificially created to cause them to fire upon the boat and kill Americans.  This drove public opinion in the US to join in the war against Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just the same as another false flag that didn't involve direct killing:  The Nayirah testimony.  She was given acting lessons and lied about babies being thrown from incubators in hospitals.  This drove enough opinion to go into Kuwait for "humanitarian reasons" while conveniently ignoring the fact that Iraq invaded Kuwait because Bush-connected oil companies were slant-drilling into Iraq.  Saddam also gave them multiple warnings to stop.

       So pay attention to who put on the event.... a warmongering, "Israel First" Zionist-Jew.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Pamela Geller
       </strong>
       , president of the American Freedom Defense Initiative,
       <strong>
        put on the Muhammad Art Exhibit
       </strong>
       . She referred to it as a "free speech event" on Twitter. One tweet from her after the apparent attack read "this is a war."

       The BBC will unabashedly spew anti-islam/arab/muslim terminology, and yet it won't even mention Jew/Zionist-Jew/Israel one fucking time.

       Also google "Elton Simpson + FBI Informant" - In 2006 the fbi had an informant cozy up to him and record conversations.  In 2009-10 he supposedly attempted to join a group in africa.  I'd really like to know if they radicalized him.
