        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For me, this is the ultimate conspiracy. </p>

<p>My understanding is that the U.S. government runs deficits into the hundreds of billions every year. To pay for everything, it sells bonds to the federal reserve. The Fed buys these bonds with money it prints out of thin air and thus makes around a 99% profit on each bond it purchases. Theoretically, the Fed is supposed to give (at least some of its?) profits back to the Treasury, but audits are <em>prohibited</em> (how suspicious is that?) so we don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going on. Furthermore, every branch of the Federal Reserve is a private corporation and the ownership of the Fed itself is purposefully kept secret. </p>

<p>Is this basically correct?</p>

<p>The fact that there&#39;s an institution with this much leverage over the federal government is nuts. In fact, it seems to me that the Fed <em>is</em> the government. At that level it&#39;s not about getting richer (you already have basically free money on your hands.) It&#39;s about power. We are truly living in an Empire type system run by technocrats. </p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to realize that Democracy doesn&#39;t really mean anything and probably never has.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you are correct, OP. The federal reserve is how our government is primarily controlled. The government cannot create its own money, but instead has to borrow, at interest, from this private bank. </p>

<p>&quot;Give me control of a nation&#39;s money, and I care not who makes its laws.&quot; -Mayer Amschel (Bauer) Rothschild, the central banking family founder</p>

<p>They tried so many times to get the bill that created the federal reserve passed through congress, and on the day before christmas in 1913, they rammed it through, and from that moment on we have been accruing an ever-larger national debt. As has every other country that has been taken over by this system since then, which is almost all of them. We go to war to take over the ones that aren&#39;t, like: Libya, Iraq, Syria, Iran, etc. </p>

<p>This is by far the biggest loss for the U.S. Gov in history. JFK famously tried to fight the Fed by issuing his own federal currency backed by gold and silver. We all know what happened to him. This was the closest we have come to taking on the corrupt system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, Andrew Jackson&#39;s entire presidential campaign was based around defeating these banks, and he did, temporarily. But just a few years later they came back and took over, and unlike the two charters for the previous federal banks in the late 1800s, this time it was permanent. JFK tried to undo this and they killed him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to remember America wasn&#39;t intended to be a democracy. It is supposed to be a representative republic. Basically the house is for the most direct representation of the people&#39;s will, it&#39;s the lowest because people are stupid and the masses are easy to fool. The Senate was originally elected by the state legislatures, but that was changed to direct popular vote, and I&#39;m my opinion this was as bad as the federal reserve decision if not worse.  Then the you have the president who is elected by electors who originally were people you knew and elected who&#39;s job was to be educated about the issues and the candidates, then they pass their vote for president.</p>

<p>It was a great system, I don&#39;t think we should have changed it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ll see me mention that people should be paying to policy, rather than conspiracy.</p>

<p>The situation you have described is policy. It is not controversial, and quite a few people are aware of it.</p>

<p>It is also antithetical to everything we pretend our government is.</p>

<p>Why doesn&#39;t the government run at least one bank in competition with the private sector, and use the seignorage profits for operational expenses?</p>

<p>It really would not be at all difficult to convince people to take home and car loans from an entity that used their payments to reduce everyone&#39;s tax burden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Fed is fraught with politics, sure, but there&#39;s no need to mystify this. </p>

<p>&quot; The stockholders in the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks are the privately owned banks that fall under the Federal Reserve System. These include all national banks (chartered by the federal government) and those state-chartered banks that wish to join and meet certain requirements. About 38 percent of the nation’s more than 8,000 banks are members of the system, and thus own the Fed banks.</p>

<p>The concept of “ownership” needs some explaining here, however. The member banks must by law invest 3 percent of their capital as stock in the Reserve Banks, and they cannot sell or trade their stock or even use that stock as collateral to borrow money. They do receive dividends of 6 percent per year from the Reserve Banks and get to elect each Reserve Bank’s board of directors.</p>

<p>The private banks also have a voice in regulating the nation’s money supply and setting targets for short-term interest rates, but it’s a minority voice. Those decisions are made by the Federal Open Market Committee, which has a dozen voting members, only five of whom come from the banks. The remaining seven, a voting majority, are the Fed’s Board of Governors who, as mentioned, are appointed by the president.&quot;</p>

<p>[ from <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2008/03/federal-reserve-bank-ownership/">http://www.factcheck.org/2008/03/federal-reserve-bank-ownership/</a> ]</p>

<p>It&#39;s a weird system but it seems to work pretty well. And, it has some fierce critics. I&#39;d look to William Greider&#39;s 1988 book &quot;SECRETS OF THE TEMPLE: How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country&quot;. Here&#39;s a NYT review:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/21/books/books-of-the-times-403888.html">http://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/21/books/books-of-the-times-403888.html</a></p>

<p>In a nutshell, the politics of the Fed always comes back to the fight between the &quot;loose money&quot; people who advocate for increasing the money supply (which spurs economic growth, jobs, etc.) and the tight money crowd, who hate and fear the &quot;loose money&quot; approach because it can drive inflation, which can hurt their financial investments, drive investment out of the country, and allow debtors to pay back loans with less valuable dollars. So the Fed is always walking a line between those antagonistic political and financial constituencies. The &quot;tight money&quot; people tend to be the ultra-rich.</p>

<p>Now, to the &quot;scam&quot; - note that little sentence, &#39;They do receive dividends of 6 percent per year&#39;.</p>

<p>So, the 8,000-odd banks that are members of the Fed system don&#39;t get a controlling vote but they do get a very nice guaranteed return on their investment. It&#39;s not a killing, but if I had an investment choice, 6% return on my money vs. a chance at windfall profits I would take the 6% every time.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, it&#39;s certainly a scam, and it&#39;s institutionally very big. Why not peg the return to the average U.S. rate of inflation, which is about 3.22% ? Oh yes, the additional 2.78% (the profit the banks in the Fed system get for lending to the Federal Reserve) covers the risk, except - whoops - there&#39;s no risk at all. The resources of the most powerful nation on Earth are marshaled to reduce that risk, effectively, to zero.</p>

<p>2.78% isn&#39;t that much, except for the miracle of compound interest. Reinvest that zero-risk take year after year after year and you&#39;ve got some real money.  </p>

<p>But there&#39;s not much of a &quot;story&quot; to uncover - it&#39;s all out in the open. No coverup, no lying. It just is. Where&#39;s the human interest angle ? The big Kardashian butts, the titillation factor ? Natch.</p>

<p>Mainstream media doesn&#39;t like to cover such dry fare, regardless of the fact that American police and the federal government have been waging war, for almost a century now, on mafia organizations that have historically made their comparatively modest fortunes off skimming similar percentages from construction jobs, union labor, and so on. Mafia activity gets branded, in endless TV and films about the Mafia, as &quot;corruption&quot;. But the American economy is built on rationalized, institutionalized corruption. The 2.78% guaranteed take that banks get from the Fed deal is just &quot;business&quot; (as usual - BAU.)</p>

<p>It&#39;s not considered a &quot;scam&quot; because the boffins and media wonks who help construct public perception of reality don&#39;t deem it to be the slightest bit improper. And, in context, is it ? We, as a society, collectively tolerate far worse. I could go into detail with examples, but I imagine you can think of a few (the &quot;in joke&quot; of The Sopranos is that the &quot;s&quot; in Tony Soprano&#39;s last name is lower case; he&#39;s small time. What&#39;s &quot;big time&quot; ? - well, look to Dick Cheney, and Halliburton in Iraq.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the endless, muddled conspiracy theories that accrete around the Fed obscure these basic truths with baroque yarns of Rothschild banking conspiracies tracing back to Illuminati who are of course in league with Satan. Guess who pushes those conspiracy theories most aggressively ? - Conservative evangelical Christians whose missionary work, beyond American shores, has for decades been integrated quite closely into the machinations of American covert foreign policy.        </p>

<p>In the end, the guaranteed 2.78% yearly take is the cost of America&#39;s neo-imperialist gobal dominance. Like the petrodollar (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrodollar">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrodollar</a> ), the Fed system keeps the dollar strong and stable, making it a reserve currency of choice; that in turn helps maintain the U.S.&#39; global economic hegemony. It&#39;s integral to the machine of perpetual economic growth, essential to the American Way. Now, away with you and your pesky questions.    </p>
