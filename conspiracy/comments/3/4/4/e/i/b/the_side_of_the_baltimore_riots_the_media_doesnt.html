        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was just watching coverage on NBC WBAL-TV 11 (Baltimore) and one of the field reporters was approached by several gang members and requested to tell their side of the story. Basically, they were members from different gangs who took the time to come together and say that they did not make a plan to come to an agreement to kill white cops like every news source is saying. They claimed that they were in fact trying to stop the rioting because they are in support of Freddie Gray and believed that these riots were not helping the cause they were supporting. I know it is hard to believe something like that, but the point is, we are not being shown a separate point of view from the media. They flat out accused the media of twisting the story, and they seemed very genuine and authentic about it. I cannot find an article or video ANYWHERE about it. If you guys could keep an eye out for this interview, that would be fantastic, but I have a very strong feeling we are never going to see it again. Only time will tell. I&#39;m sorry if you disagree with me, and I want to clarify I do not support what gangs do. I am just sick and tired of being told what mainstream media wants me to hear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s the point of backpedaling if their story of them not killing cops isn&#39;t a proven lie?</p>

<p>There&#39;s only two realistic options, the gang members put on a good face and lie about not killing the police in order to point blame away from them, or they&#39;re telling the truth and trying to clear the air by showing people that they aren&#39;t behind what the media is claiming.</p>

<p>No need to backpedal if you&#39;re not confirmed guilty. That&#39;s when you start piecing together reasons and excuses, if you so choose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about the legitimate protestors who were sincerely upset about Freddy Gray? I guarantee you the gangs you see on TV had nothing do with them. Why? Because when the rioting started they got the fuck out of there. These &quot;protestors&quot;, or more like barbaric opportunists, have already attacked journalists and all but shut down the city of Baltimore. If the news reporters want to say &quot;fuck these protestors, they can shove their side of the story up their ass&quot;, given the current safety situation (or lack thereof) in Baltimore right now, I think that&#39;s perfectly understandable. You can&#39;t expect to have a fair discussion with bullies.</p>

<p>And yet people argue against the protesters/rioters for abominable behavior when they&#39;re standing against the tyranny of bullies in the police force. I&#39;m not saying their actions are admissible, but far more likely to be reactionary than incendiary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some protestors were reacting to the death of Freddie Gray by peacefully protesting.  The police involved have been taken off duty and an investigation is on-going.  We will see what comes of that.  The people vandalizing, assaulting other people, looting and committing arson are not reacting to the death of Freddie Gray.  They are seizing an opportunity to commit crimes and steal free shit for themselves.  If any of these people were truly worried about black lives being senselessly taken they would be protesting in every major city where dozens of young black men are killed at the hands of other young black men every weekend.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe that is the case according to the gentleman in this video, but on CNN the other night a member of the Black Guerilla Family got in front of the camera during a report and started yelling about how they were, in fact, going to &quot;kill the fuckin police.&quot;  Basically, every black gang member might not be speaking for every other black gang member.  It seems that some of them might be trying to protect the city and others are just trying to redirect the violence away from their businesses and towards the police.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was from Friday I believe.  Before any of the actual rioting/looting really broke out.  Angry &quot;protestors&quot; were frequently hijacking the camera from the reporters to scream &quot;fuck the police&quot; and call for violence and every time it would happen the anchor in studio would make excuses for them and say that it was just a small handful of people who weren&#39;t from Baltimore (as if they have any way to actually know that) and apologize for harsh language and not even mention the calls for violence.  They did their best to white-wash the fact that this was spiraling into an all out riot and try to paint it as a peaceful protest until it was impossible to do.  But don&#39;t worry... last night they had several people on who said that all of the looting and rioting was done by a handful of 14 year olds who are just bored kids being kids.</p>
