       People should instead be focusing on why people loot/riot. I'm not saying they are not at fault and they are all purely victims of an intolerant society, but happy, healthy people with access to good education, healthcare and rule of law DO NOT RIOT.

       Yep. So counterproductive to be a bigot about it. It's about time we set aside our petty differences on the lines of ethnicity, religion and ideology among average citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Solidarity is the only thing that can possibly protect us from nefarious individuals in high positions in business and government. White people need to stop blaming blacks for crime, Blacks need to stop blaming whites for institutional inequality. I know a ton of black people, none of whom contribute to the common perception of them as criminals or more predisposed to committing crimes. Nearly every white person I've met does not in anyway contribute towards institutional inequality towards minorities, but certain groups will try to paint all white people as some kind of barrier to "progress"
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to work together. We won't be taken seriously if we can't unite as citizens behind improving our common destiny.

       The mantra
       <em>
        "Diversity is our strength"
       </em>
       sounds sweet, but it is a lie. Strength lies in
       <strong>
        unity
       </strong>
       , and by highlighting our differences, rather than our similarities, those who have been pushing the "Diversity" spiel have effectively been pushing division, discord and disharmony - "us vs them". It is reinforced through the news, entertainment media, music, pop culture, and by injustices meted out by government and legal systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       A people united in purpose are a formidable force, but when communities are divided into squabbling factions with (often artificially defined) divergent interests, the various groups can be pitted against one another, making them far easier to manipulate and control, and blinding them to the real enemy - the hidden hand of the elite.

       Yep. The Dutch were able to control all of Indonesia with extremely small military forces by cleverly pitting different groups against one another. If people really think our governments in the 21st century are above doing this to their citizens, then they are incredibly naive.

       the contraception example is in general. It couldn't be truer. Contraception/birth control/ability to abort=less unwanted children, less STDs. Unwanted children tend to commit crimes and also cost money. I do agree with your drug war statement though, as it is definitely targeted at low income neighborhoods and also turns the poverty wheel.
