       We are hitting a boiling point. The youth is pissed and starting to take action. There is a strong force telling parents to put out their children's flame. The children are fucking pissed and getting even more mad by the day. The old generation who think peaceful works (delusional) or just not realizing where we actually are, are being told to oust the children's revolutionary flame. I'm not saying this is fake, this shit is real. But, is this a psyops? Older generation (status quo) telling the young, debt enslave children, just do this (peace protest), even though it doesn't work and they know it doesn't but that is all they know. Your thoughts?

       Destroying and stealing from their neighborhoods is not fucking revolutionary, it's literally as stupid as stupid can be. These people, young and old, should be out front of the police station and city hall and city/county jail protesting there where it makes a statement. How does pulling knives and stealing purses and looting stores make any type of positive change? It's not the city's other residents who killed Freddie Gray, it's the goddamn police who did it. The system is fucked it's not a race thing which seems to be the driving force behind these riots that the problem, it's the prison/industrial complex dividing people against each other.

       Its just a thinly veiled excuse to anything for attention. The young rioters are in the spotlight right now, but they are also distracting us from the real problem the news refuses to talk about. Was this an freak accident or police corruption?

      <blockquote>

       Haha, you are absolutely delusional if you think statements do ANYTHING.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you break it down you have to consider that those kinds of protests are only credible threats in civilizations past because the very
       <strong>
        statement
       </strong>
       of the thing is an implication that "we are gathering as a precursor of physical destruction. Heed our words and desires". i.e., this "statement" only has weight because we are prepared to do something worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the ruling powers know nothing worse will happen, then the statement never has any weight or believability.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you believe protests have ever done anything by themselves, please sign my petition.

       There was something really "off" about today's situation, almost like it was an op.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rumor circulated about "the purge." Evacuated buildings in the city before 3pm. Stopped busses, stopped subways as soon as school let out. In fact, the police were stopping busses and pulling kids
       <em>
        off the busses
       </em>
       so they couldn't get home. Then, giving them shit for being in "groups."
      </p>
      <p>
       I read something from a teacher today trying to get kids home who witnessed this and she was like, "
       <em>
        I'd
       </em>
       be throwing rocks, what the hell."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's either massive, massive incompetence (and can you imagine them getting away with doing this sort of thing to a bunch of majority white kids?) or calculated to blow the powder keg.

       I'm not sure what it is. What I can see is that kids are fucking pissed and are organizing. There is a massive effort by the MSM and "community leaders" to herd them in. I think the psyops come in for the parents to brainwash the kids into, "yeah, peaceful protests work", even though it has never worked. Once you push people into a corner where peaceful is not an option, they get violent. Which is what we are seeing. But the old gen are being told to qualm this. Works in favor for TPTB.

       You are wrong. Not saying peaceful is the only way to go, but peaceful protesting has worked many times in the past. If you want to make a point, you shouldn't say something so easily disproven:

       Enough people simply asserted that the government had lost credibility, and refused to back down from that position.

       In point of fact, once the government has lost legitimacy in the eyes of the people, the game is up.

       I can tell you one thing for sure. The cops picked the wrong city to fuck up in this time. I'm not sure there is any city in the country as ripe for conflict. Just look at the employment situation:

       No, there are plenty. Was just down there for a concert. That city is locked and loaded. It's a central hub for the Chi-town drug export/import. The crips and the bloods along with the mob run Detroit.

       I considered Detroit, a difference that might play a role is that Baltimore is surrounded by areas of great wealth. I used to live in Chicago, and yea, there are some rough areas, but I heard they've been working to improve the situation over the last decade or so.

       This is the exact wrong way to think of things! Things are being directed towards a type of person to hide the real issue! Divide and concur. It's an aged old tactic that applies today! If you convince the currently misconceived middle class to "rise up" against some sort of common enemy and win then they calm back down. The problem is we are being driven towards the wrong enemy ( or better yet we are being driven towards the enemy of preference). This isn't a black vs  white issue, as much as they want you to believe that. This is us vs the ultra rich.

       While I agree with some, imagine if 100 15 year olds put them in hospitals. They are doing this. They are pissed (as we all should be). Violence is never the answer, but they corral us into free speech zones. These kids are spawning something the adults could only wish in their wettest dreams. I support them and say fuck all. Boo hoo a CVS was looted, it's a message to society on so many fucking levels.

       Thing is, there are social scientists, historical statistics, specific things that have to happen in order for this thing to open up a nation wide can of worms. Occupy didn't do it, Ferguson failed, the Brazilians failed around the last world cup. All of these failures happened because of certain factors, many of which are prevalent in this Baltimore scenario.

       I'm an older one here.

       Men, like John McCaine sealed the
       <strong>
        Records of His Service
       </strong>
       and the Fate of Soldiers left behind. Hear me out! These were
       <em>
        Drafted Soldiers
       </em>
       that he intentionally abandoned. There were, are, diligent people that fight the slime of John McCaine to this day!
      </p>
      <p>
       He abandoned soldiers from every walk of life to Cover His Ass and those Cronies on the Hill!

      <p>
       Like with the Hippy Peace Movement being co-opted psyops... so is this.

      <p>
       If the Crips and Bloods Unite to Take Out Cops it only means that they are
       <em>
        tickling the tail

       You don't join crowds. You don't rob and pillage wantonly.

      <p>
       You struggle to understand a mother clobbering her kid in the street for his actions and I get that, you think he's all Justified and you think mom is
       <em>
        holding him down
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth be told, his mom would probably like to see the Criminal Element of Decay and Destruction Perp Walked so fucking hard that Not Another Politician would do A Drugs For Gun Scheme ANYWHERE on this Planet, ever again. She's knuckled down, fought hard and that is her kid!
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot instruct your kids to kill those very Politicians! Absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot not protect your kid from being
       <em>
        ignorant
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot instruct you about corrupt politicians but kid they are the Very Ones that want you silenced, want that mother silenced, that divide us by Age, Religion, Politics.

       The most amazing thing to me was the fearlessness of the people. They were clearly not scared of the police, not trying to protest as much to hold their ground and fight back. It was very different than the feeling I got from Ferguson.
      </p>
      <p>
       This actually makes me happy to see communities fight back against their own oppressors. I don't care for the burnings and looting but I can understand the rage and desperation of those impoverished.

       you're failing to see why they are doing it. Just because they have an iphone doesn't mean that LEO militarization isn't real and cops are using excessive force (killing people, of all colors). What the hell does anything you said have to do with the underlining issue? I see you came out of the wood works on this issue. You a stinky fairy tale creature?

       All this talk about the police state and the militarization of the police force, and yet here's a full blown riot and they just stand around holding shields.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is the aggressive assault rifle action everyone always talks about?

      <p>
       People whine and whine about "police brutality" when the American police are restrained to the point of complete ineffectiveness. In nearly every other country in the world, the police would have started clubbing the shit out of people, and in most of them they'd already have moved on to shooting live rounds.

       Police restraint? Lol, cops are scared of dogs these days and won't hesitate to shoot em. People die at the hands of cops 100x more than they die at the hands of criminals. The cops in this riot backed off because 15 year olds threw bricks at them. The cops are a bunch of pussies. Are you a cop?

       I didn't quite understand the second part, though.  apparently you clicked on my name and read at least three comments, because you're a fag that thinks this gives you some sort of advantage over people.  but what is the hollar part about?  is that supposed to hurt my feelings or something?  I'm white, faggot, so better luck next time.  not that any of that would've made sense if I were black

       I'm not sure what it is. What I can see is that kids are fucking pissed and are organizing. There is a massive effort by the MSM and "community leaders" to herd them in. I think the psyops come in for the parents to brainwash the kids into, "yeah, peaceful protests work", even though it has never worked. Once you push people into a corner where peaceful is not an option, they get violent. Which is what we are seeing. But the old gen are being told to qualm this. Works in favor for TPTB.

       Violence is the stock in trade of government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Violence is the source of government power.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you wish to reduce the power of government, engaging in violence is counterproductive. You will discover that they are much better at it than you are.

       Kitchenware revolts, on the other hand, are much more effective.
