These people, young and old, should be out front of the police station and city hall and city/county jail protesting there where it makes a statement. How does pulling knives and stealing purses and looting stores make any type of positive change? It&#39;s not the city&#39;s other residents who killed Freddie Gray, it&#39;s the goddamn police who did it. The system is fucked it&#39;s not a race thing which seems to be the driving force behind these riots that the problem, it&#39;s the prison/industrial complex dividing people against each other.</p>

<p>Haha, you are absolutely delusional if you think statements do ANYTHING.</p>

<p>Even if you break it down you have to consider that those kinds of protests are only credible threats in civilizations past because the very <strong>statement</strong> of the thing is an implication that &quot;we are gathering as a precursor of physical destruction. Heed our words and desires&quot;. i.e., this &quot;statement&quot; only has weight because we are prepared to do something worse.</p>

<p>If the ruling powers know nothing worse will happen, then the statement never has any weight or believability.</p>

<p>And if you believe protests have ever done anything by themselves, please sign my petition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was something really &quot;off&quot; about today&#39;s situation, almost like it was an op.</p>

<p>Rumor circulated about &quot;the purge.&quot; Evacuated buildings in the city before 3pm. Stopped busses, stopped subways as soon as school let out. In fact, the police were stopping busses and pulling kids <em>off the busses</em> so they couldn&#39;t get home. Then, giving them shit for being in &quot;groups.&quot;</p>

<p>I read something from a teacher today trying to get kids home who witnessed this and she was like, &quot;<em>I&#39;d</em> be throwing rocks, what the hell.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s either massive, massive incompetence (and can you imagine them getting away with doing this sort of thing to a bunch of majority white kids?) or calculated to blow the powder keg.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what it is. What I can see is that kids are fucking pissed and are organizing. There is a massive effort by the MSM and &quot;community leaders&quot; to herd them in. I think the psyops come in for the parents to brainwash the kids into, &quot;yeah, peaceful protests work&quot;, even though it has never worked. Once you push people into a corner where peaceful is not an option, they get violent. Which is what we are seeing. But the old gen are being told to qualm this. Works in favor for TPTB.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t anything that will spread. It will be contained like Furgeson was.</p>

<p>The youth are right in 1 sense, peaceful protest doesn&#39;t do sh1t. But all out anarchy with the cops won&#39;t change anything either because cops are just pawns and they will all be outpowered.</p>

<p>What they need is some sort of middle path. Start a revolutionary party (tea party on steroids?) Get into gov positions, have your people in high ranking military, industrial complex, banks, corporations, then there could be a better coordination from the top down instead of down up.</p>

<p>Its the 1%ers you want, not the cops</p>

The problem is we are being driven towards the wrong enemy ( or better yet we are being driven towards the enemy of preference).

<p>Yes, internet facts without a source sure are believable. 100x? that&#39;s laughable. </p>

<p>Have fun <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers_in_the_United_States">reading this</a>, people killed by cops. Look into the stats, cops killing people vs cops killed.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you are a Jew why would you say that? I certainly never implied it, wtf is wrong with you. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FONN-0uoTHI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FONN-0uoTHI</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what it is. What I can see is that kids are fucking pissed and are organizing. There is a massive effort by the MSM and &quot;community leaders&quot; to herd them in. I think the psyops come in for the parents to brainwash the kids into, &quot;yeah, peaceful protests work&quot;, even though it has never worked. Once you push people into a corner where peaceful is not an option, they get violent. Which is what we are seeing. But the old gen are being told to qualm this. Works in favor for TPTB.</p>

<p>And none of them support your statistic, you tossed a Wikipedia article at me that doesn&#39;t even support your argument. Good job.</p>

<p>Violence is the source of government power.</p>

<p>If you wish to reduce the power of government, engaging in violence is counterproductive. You will discover that they are much better at it than you are.</p>

<p>Kitchenware revolts, on the other hand, are much more effective.</p>
