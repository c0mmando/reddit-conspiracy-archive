       Rip Keano THIS IS WHAT !!!!!!REALLY!!!!! HAPPENED TODAY IN BALTIMORE #1. the police created a "credible threat" about some high school students gathering at Mondawmin to start trouble. #2. the police showed up in force and riot gear before the students got out of school at Mondawmin, which is a major public transit hub, and SHUT DOWN THE TRANSIT, guaranteeing the kids couldn't leave. #3 the police started macing people and brandishing tasers. #4 the kids understandably responded to being stranded and maced by throwing rocks/bricks. #5 THE MEDIA I.E. CNN #CNN starts reporting it as "a riot and "violent protesters." ----&gt; This is 100% bought and paid for by the police department. &lt;---- This is absolutely vile". !!! do not be fooled to think that civilians instigated and started this sate of Chaos in#baltimore DO NOT LET THE MEDIA AND THE POLICE LIE TO YOU LIKE THEY ALWAYS DO TO MAKE THEMSELVES LOOK LIKE VICTIMS! THIS IS BEYOND A RACE SITUATION WE ARE AT WAR!

       These were just the ones I cared to snag had I known, I would have got them all, apparently twitter was run a muck with this same account of this incidence. Its interesting how the hivemind even in this sub will be swayed by an initial comment questioning validity, and the consequential dog pile that happens. This would be a great tactic for TPTB, letting us destroy our own from a nicely placed slightly accusatory comment, easily set aside by a little bit of query, however. I will be watching him, military man and volunteer fireguy. I'm not sure why he is so quick to discount this, is there something I'm not seeing because I'm too close to it, or what? The more I figure out the less I understand, this is what I know.

       I have a friend in Baltimore who told me that the huge majority of people in the streets weren't being violent at all and didn't run into any trouble.  She said what's being shown on the news is absolute propaganda and that they're only focusing on the
       <em>
        worst possible
       </em>
       scenarios they can.

       Um, didn't they close all the schools early and release everyone to go home?  And I believe what happened was, a majority of these students stuck around to "watch" the protests in large groups, instead of getting out of harms way.  Then they shut down the transit.  Then the police showed up.  From what I heard, the transit was shut down everywhere,
       <em>
        well after people were released early from school and work, to make sure they all got out of harms way.
       </em>
       I may be wrong, but that's what was announced,
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       any of this broke out again, they told the public hours beforehand that the transit was going to be shut down.  You sound like a shill trying to stir up trouble.
