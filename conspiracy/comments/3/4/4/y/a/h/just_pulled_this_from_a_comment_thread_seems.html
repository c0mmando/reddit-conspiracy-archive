<p>It appears that way, but I think there&#39;s more critical thinkers here than it appears most of the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, didn&#39;t they close all the schools early and release everyone to go home?  And I believe what happened was, a majority of these students stuck around to &quot;watch&quot; the protests in large groups, instead of getting out of harms way.  Then they shut down the transit.  Then the police showed up.  From what I heard, the transit was shut down everywhere, <em>well after people were released early from school and work, to make sure they all got out of harms way.</em>  I may be wrong, but that&#39;s what was announced, <em>before</em> any of this broke out again, they told the public hours beforehand that the transit was going to be shut down.  You sound like a shill trying to stir up trouble.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If you consider that top heavy, maybe we have different standards and definitions of heavy.</p>

<p>Compare the link karma that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/i_love_hezbollah">this guy</a> accrued in <em>two months</em> to the paltry (no offense Rando, it&#39;s twice mine I think) 6000+ <a href="/u/RandoKillrizian">/u/RandoKillrizian</a> link karma accrued in 1 year, 2 months and 28 days.</p>

<p>And of this, more than 20% (21.644%, repeating of course) was from <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2abok7/top_ex_al_qeada_does_interview_and_says_exactly">this post</a>, from this very sub.</p>

<p>If you think Rando is a power user that&#39;s your deal, and everyone&#39;s entitled to their opinions. I just see it (and him) differently.</p>

<p>And we all have an agenda here - don&#39;t kid yourself. I do too. At least I&#39;m open about mine.</p>

<p>I will also add that it is extremely interesting that if you compare Rando&#39;s link karma to yours, they are relatively close (4008 to 6750), with 91% of your karma coming from <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2zragl/deleted_from_rpolitics_iraq_war_veteran_you_grow/">this post</a> which was great, IMO and made the rounds on this site quite well. </p>

<p>My advice - increase your threshold for what you consider to be Top Heavy, and analyze each post and comment individually, but of course be mindful of a user&#39;s history if you&#39;re into that (which I am, obviously).</p>
