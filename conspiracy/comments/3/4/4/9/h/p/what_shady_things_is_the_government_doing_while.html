    <div class="md"><p>This is the question of the hour. A rule of thumb I hear is if it&#39;s a domestic story, look international; if it&#39;s an international story, look domestic.</p>

<p>What comes to mind immediately is Congress passing Trade Promotion Authority, aka fast-track for the TTP and likely TTIP as well. The bill would last 3-6 years which would likely cover both trade deals. This has definitely been gaining more traction ofer the last week, and the Baltimore riots will almost certainly draw attention away from it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why? If cops realize that people can fuck them up, maybe they will think twice about fucking them up. There is more of us then them. They work for us, if a few cops end up in the ICU, so be it. They wont beat people. Which I saw here. Literally HS kids led to the police action. They backed off because bricks and stones were hitting them. Our kids literally took the pants of what we should be doing! WTF.</p>

<p>No. That is not the way for fucks sake. They <strong>NEED</strong> to made <strong>ACCOUNTABLE</strong> in the court of <strong>LAW</strong>. You would see thousands of innocents maimed or slaughtered for what few have done. That is not justice. This fucking country isn&#39;t a god damn free for all. The reason those cops backed off is because they don&#39;t want to be put in a situation where they have to shoot a bunch of idiot children with shitty parents.</p>

<p>Not really, many of them were bused in from out of state to take the peaceful nature of the protests and turn it into a media frenzy/police crackdown. </p>
