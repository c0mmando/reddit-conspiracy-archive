       This is the question of the hour. A rule of thumb I hear is if it's a domestic story, look international; if it's an international story, look domestic.

      <p>
       What comes to mind immediately is Congress passing Trade Promotion Authority, aka fast-track for the TTP and likely TTIP as well. The bill would last 3-6 years which would likely cover both trade deals. This has definitely been gaining more traction ofer the last week, and the Baltimore riots will almost certainly draw attention away from it.

       TTP was one of the things that came to mind. I understand that the things going on in Baltimore are significant but it shouldn't be the ONLY thing the media covers while talks about TTP are going on. It's too much of a distraction and easy news coverage.

       That doesn't start until July 15th. They wouldn't have started stirring up shit in Baltimore just yet, as it will have faded out of the spotlight by then. And if not, it'll be old news and won't have everyone losing their minds over it by the time jade helm kicks off

       By doing this, you are playing into the game. There is real shit going down in Baltimore. Can we for once realize and support what they are doing. The youth is revolting. Have you not once thought this is what they want you to do? Youth, kids, literally teens, threw rocks and bricks at 15 officers, 2 who are in ICU. 15 year olds did this. We say, "we need to do something". Well, fucking HS students did!!!!!! They organized and did this, what the fuck.

       I don't really think putting a few cops in the ICU is sending the message we want, I mean it is a message but it seems this might only cause more tension.

       Those that own the government are going along with what they plan to do regardless of how much you want to organize a few friends to walk along in the street with signs. The only way you will have actual change is to convince people to stop going to work and shut the country down. I'm serious.

       Why? If cops realize that people can fuck them up, maybe they will think twice about fucking them up. There is more of us then them. They work for us, if a few cops end up in the ICU, so be it. They wont beat people. Which I saw here. Literally HS kids led to the police action. They backed off because bricks and stones were hitting them. Our kids literally took the pants of what we should be doing! WTF.

       Maybe you'll be thinking twice when the military presence is so heavy you can't lift your head up in public. Truth exists for everyone. Doesn't mean we all know what truth is. 15 year old kids in America are full of emotions and react with whatever one takes over. That's never good.

       No. That is not the way for fucks sake. They

       . You would see thousands of innocents maimed or slaughtered for what few have done. That is not justice. This fucking country isn't a god damn free for all. The reason those cops backed off is because they don't want to be put in a situation where they have to shoot a bunch of idiot children with shitty parents.

        There is real shit going down in Baltimore. Can we for once realize and support what they are doing. The youth is revolting. Have you not once thought this is what they want you to do? Youth, kids, literally teens, threw rocks and bricks at 15 officers, 2 who are in ICU. 15 year olds did this. We say, "we need to do something". Well, fucking HS students did!!!!!! They organized and did this, what the fuck.

       Not really, many of them were bused in from out of state to take the peaceful nature of the protests and turn it into a media frenzy/police crackdown.
