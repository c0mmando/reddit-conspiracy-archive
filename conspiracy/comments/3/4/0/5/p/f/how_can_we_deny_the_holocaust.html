<p>The Holocaust most certainly happened, but nothing like you think.</p>

<p>The Jews that were sent to camps were treated very well.  The Jews that &quot;went missing&quot; were deported to Palestine.  All those pictures of skinny people and skinny bodies were due to typhus.  Not starvation.  Not torture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s odd you post Irving.  He&#39;s a baldfaced liar.  He willfully uses outdated translations when he pleases (using the correct ones when it suits him and the incorrect ones when it doesn&#39;t), selectively quotes only parts of primary sources, and hazily attributes most of it.  For a comprehensive breakdown of the charlatan that Irving is, and a well-reasearched, very informed breakdown of many, many cases where he has lied, willfully omitted, or is simply wrong, check out a wonderful book by Richard J.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, let me put it this way -- what proportion of Irving&#39;s work would you say is erroneous? 0.01% 0.05%? 0.5%? [More? What figure would you suggest?]</p>

<p>Given the way that people (especially powerful people) feel about the sacrosanctity of the Holocaust narrative, and Irving&#39;s position on it (especially in the 90&#39;s), would it even possible that there <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> be establishment figures attacking his scholarship in this way?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The articles you linked posted by the VHO provides no coherent rebuttal to Evans&#39; work, they merely regurgitate Irving&#39;s points then claim victory.  There is no cogent discussion of Irving&#39;s distortion and lies, merely one sentence responses that essentially say Evans is wrong.  And following the great Irving tactic, they do not quote the full sections of the documents they are discussing.  Evans points this out on multiple occasions and shows how this distorts and turns on its head what the documents are saying.</p>

<p>I find it very telling that instead of reading the book you immediately searched out an article you thought could buttress your viewpoint.  Evans&#39; work raises plenty of shocking practices Irving used and uses, and is damning.  You chose to ignore this.  Remember, Truth does not fear investigation.</p>

<p>I never said this was a rebuttal to Evans&#39; attack on Irving, but a general critique of his errors and distortions when it comes to the Holocaust.</p>

<p>My point is that everyone makes errors, but in Irving&#39;s case, they are exaggerated [by] activists and used as part of a fallacious argument to completely dismiss everything he has ever written, all sources he has discovered (etc). I posed this question, which you ignored:</p>

<p>That is true, you didn&#39;t.  However, the articles you posted are attempted rebuttals to Evans&#39; work, and me saying they do not succeed is not something I am wrong about, as you are manipulatively trying to portray.  In addition, that you characterize <em>Lying About Hitler</em> as an &quot;attack&quot; on Irving beggars belief.  The book came out of Evans&#39; 740 page expert testimony for the <em>defense</em> in a 2000 libel case brought by Irving against Deborah Lipstadt and Penguin Books.  Evans&#39; work is the very opposite of an attack, it is a defense against a lawsuit filed by David Irving.  You are using manipulative and distorting language to, in fact, lead an attack on Evans!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My point is that everyone makes errors</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is fine for you to say, but that is not Evans&#39; point, nor my point, as I have stated multiple times in my posts.  Errors are one thing, they are unintentional, they are mistakes.  As Evans proves, Irving does not just make errors, he intentionally, willfully, manipulates the historical record by falsifying and misrepresenting it either through mistranslation, very selective inclusion of only certain parts of documents, or simply making it up.  By reducing what Evans has written down to just &quot;Irving has made errors,&quot; you are either lying or you have not read his book.</p>

<p>As to your question of what proportion of Irving&#39;s work is erroneous, I have no answer as I have not analyzed every piece of it.  It&#39;s an irrelevant game to play and a petty way for you to win some &quot;points,&quot; in saying I ignored it.  I understand some of his earlier work is held in high regard (though his work on Dresden has been largely discredited), and he has, as you have mentioned, a knack for research.  This is admirable, but what is not admirable is when he uses documents he finds to lie, hoping that no one will check them to see he is not representing them fairly.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>0.01% 0.05%? 0.5%?</strong></p>

<p>You choose to end with a manipulative question by only offering very low amounts.  You remind me of a police investigator asking over and over &quot;When did you stop hitting your wife?&quot;  &quot;But Officer, I never hit my wife!&quot;  &quot;Answer the question!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, as you seem set against reading Evans&#39; book, here is an excerpt.  I defy you to call Irving&#39;s behavior in the example below an &quot;error.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Irving had always seemed particularly sensitive to the charge that Hitler was anti-semitic. “Hitler,” he claimed at one point, “used his anti-semitism as a political platform from which to seize power in 1933, but that after that he lost interest in it except for occasional flights of public oratory; while Dr.Goebbels and other lesser Nazis continued to ride that horse to the hounds, to the mounting irritation of their Fuhrer Adolf Hitler who no longer needed antisemitism.”  Even before 1933, Irving argued, Hitler’s anti-semitism was only tactical, and in practice he was not personally ill-disposed toward the Jews.  In a discussion on BBC1 television in 1977, he said that once Hitler had become Reich chancellor, “he became a statesman and then a soldier . . . And the Jewish problem was
a nuisance to him, an embarrassment.”’ Irving summed up his views on Hitler and the Jews when he said in 1983 that “probably the biggest friend the Jews had in the ‘Third Reich,’ certainly when the war broke out, was Adolf Hitler.  He was the one who was doing everything he could to prevent things nasty happening to them.”  </p>

<p>When I looked through his writings and speeches, I could not help but conclude that Irving certainly had a strongly held bias in favor of Hitler. But did this amount to a distortion of the historical record?  Wasn’t it just a point of view like any other, even if it was a repulsive one?  Irving did not seem to think so.  He claimed that he was doing no more than reflecting accurately what was in the documentary evidence.  In the introduction to the 1991 edition of <em>Hitler’s War</em>, Irving declared:  “Every document actually linking Hitler with the treatment of the Jews invariably takes the form of an embargo.”  In 1983, Irving said:  “There is a whole chain of evidence from 1938 right through to October 1943, possibly even later, indicating that Hitler was completely in the dark about anything that may have been going on” with respect to mass killings of Jews.  “So far,” he boasted triumphantly, “I haven’t been disproved.”  Similarly, in his written submission to the High Court, Irving argued that when the documents were subjected to rigid historical criteria as to their authenticity, the reasons for their existence, and the vantage point of their author, “a relatively slim dossier of evidence resulted which portrayed Hitler intervening in every instance to mitigate or lessen wrongdoing against the Jews.... There were few, if any, documents of comparable quality--documents which met the same criteria--giving the opposite sense.”</p>

<p>What did these documents look like, then? Did Irving give an accurate account of their contents? Or did he knowingly and wilfully distort them?  The first link    in Irving&#39;s much-vaunted chain of documents related to an incident early in Hitler’s political career.  In 1924, Hitler stood trial before a Bavarian court for his leadership of a failed attempt the previous year to seize power in Munich as a prelude to a march on Berlin--the infamous ‘beer hall putsch’ of 9 November 1923.  During the putsch, according to Irving, Hitler disciplined a Nazi squad for having looted a Jewish delicatessen:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Hitler acted to maintain order. Learning that one Nazi squad had ransacked a kosher grocery store      during the night, he sent for the ex-army lieutenant who had led the raid.  ‘We took off our Nazi insignia first!”     expostulated the officer to no avail, as Hitler dismissed him from the party on the spot.  “I shall see that no other nationalist unit allows you to join either!”  Goring goggled at this exchange, as did a police sergeant who testified to it at the Hitler trial a few weeks later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Irving cited this incident again in his 1991 edition of <em>Hitler&#39;s War</em>, and also in his written submission to the court.      </p>

<p>Where did Irving get this information?  It was far from easy to find out.  In his <em>Goring</em>, he only told the reader that his narrative “is knitted together from the eyewitness evidence at the trial.”  The only way for me to examine Irving’s account was to read through the entire record of the Hitler trial, searching for the original source of his depiction of the events in question.  Fortunately, the complete trial transcript of 1924 was available in a scholarly edition.  The evidence to which he referred was in the court record for 4 March 1924, when a former police officer, <em>Oberwachtmeister</em> Hofmann, said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apart from this, I want to mention a previous incident because acts of violence which individuals have committed have always been ascribed to him.  I once went along to Hitler when I was still in the force and said to him:  this and that have happened again.  Some elements had attacked the Israelite delicatessen.  “That gives a bad impression of the party, and it’s rather embarrassing for us in the police that such a thing should have to happen.”  By chance the leader of the group, a young, wartime army lieutenant, was there.  Called on to speak, this man said:  “I took off the party badge.”  Hitler said: “By doing this you admitted that you did not belong to the party at the moment when you committed that act. You are expelled with immediate effect from the party with your whole team and I will take care that you don’t get admitted to any nationalist fighting squad again.”  Hitler always condemned these acts of violence and the individual excesses which occurred.</p>

<p>When I checked this testimony against the account given by Irving and quoted above, a number of discrepancies emerged.  </p>

<p>To begin with, Irving had simply invented the assertion that “Goring goggled at this exchange” between Hitler and the Nazi activist. Goring was not mentioned in Hofmann’s testimony as having been present at all.  Irving was also wrong to say that the police officer “goggled&quot; at the exchange.  Irving invented this passage to give the impression that Hitler must have expressed his views in an exceptionally forceful way. I could find no warrant in the document for such a description.  Moreover, the brownshirt leader was not summoned by Hitler, he was present “by chance” when Hitler was told about the incident.  Irving cast Hitler in a more favorable light than the document actually allowed.  He was also wrong to claim that the incident took place on the night of the failed putsch.  It was clear from Hofmann’s testimony that the incident had taken place at some unspecified time earlier than the putsch, about which Hofmann had been giving evidence up to that point.</p>

<p>That was not all, however.  For Irving failed to make the obvious inference from what Hofmann claimed Hitler did on this occasion: that Hitler disciplined the brownshirts because they had taken off their party insignia and therefore laid themselves open to the charge that they were engaging in a criminal rather than political act. This could have caused serious damage to the party’s reputation by associating it with common thieves.  Had the brownshirts kept their party badges on, Hitler might well have had no objection to their action. Nowhere did Hofmann imply that Hitler’s primary motive was to protect the Jews.  Nowhere did Irving imply that Hitler’s primary motive was to protect the party’s name.</p>

<p>More important still, Irving failed to mention the fact that Hofmann’s evidence in any case was highly suspect.  Hofmann was a fully paid-up member of the Nazi Party, which, it seemed, he had joined in 1921.  As a Nazi supporter in the police service until he left the force on 1 January 1924, he had organized a fast-track system for issuing visas to foreign Nazi sympathizers.  Hitler made him head of the political section of the NSDAP’s intelligence unit. Hofmann actually participated in the putsch of 8 and 9 November 1923.  According to his own testimony, he accompanied Hitler much of that night.  Hofmann also seemed to have visited Hitler in prison while he was awaiting trial.  I had no difficulty in discovering this from readily available published documentation, including the stenographic record of the trial itself.  All these facts cast serious doubts on the reliability of Hofmann’s testimony at Hitler’s trial. Hofmann was a long-standing Nazi supporter and party official who tried hard to present Hitler in a favorable light as a law-abiding citizen. This tactic was even recognized by the lenient court in 1924, which did not take his evidence on oath because it regarded him as biased.  At the end of his evidence, the presiding judge complimented the ex-policeman on the fact “that you are speaking out on behalf of your leader.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s simple to understand: People hate Jews and will bend over backwards to make them look bad. The Deniers&#39; new ploy is to claim that they&#39;re being called anti-Semitic because they&#39;re asking questions (ie Playing the Victim Card), when in reality, they&#39;re attacking the victim. Just look at their &quot;sources&quot; (anonymous blogs), if they even provide a source at all, and what they do to anyone who calls them out (ad hominem and downvote brigades).</p>

<p>Luckily, it&#39;s only half a dozen or so users on this sub, but they DOMINATE Holocaust threads and make sure only Denialist posts and comments hit the top. </p>
