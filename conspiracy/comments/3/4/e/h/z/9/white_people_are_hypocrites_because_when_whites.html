        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The argument that white rioters get off easy has been making the rounds of (primarily liberal) media in the last few days.  How dare white people judge black people rioting when &quot;white riots&quot; after games or in party towns down South don&#39;t raise any eyebrows.</p>

<p>What about Occupy Wall Street?</p>

<p>Three minutes into Occupy, the media was going crazy, calling them jobless, homeless, communist bums.  They&#39;re taking drugs.  They&#39;re having sex.  They&#39;re pooping in the street!</p>

<p>They&#39;re stopping hard working people from getting to work!</p>

<p>And when black flag people showed up, they were destroying businesses.</p>

<p>Think back:  Those arguments were the EXACT SAME ARGUMENTS used against this Baltimore stuff.</p>

<p>Why?  Because Occupy, like Baltimore, is political unrest.  So the media is trying desperately to define it as Black unrest.  Because Black unrest will be opposed by the white majority.  They need to cut the nation in half every time political unrest happens, because otherwise we might all decide to team up against the state and it&#39;s injustice.  Some of the injustice is economic, some is police brutality. But it&#39;s all under that general category.</p>

<p>Also remember Cliven Bundy.  The same liberals cheering on Baltimore called him a kook and said he should be arrested.  While the conservatives that cheered for Bundy want the kids in Baltimore shut down.</p>

<p>Watch:  Every time arrest is POLITICAL, you have widespread condemation, and splitting. The narrative is divisive.  Every time.  Because the state can&#39;t have us realizing that the only split that matters isn&#39;t Black vs White or Liberal vs Conservative.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s Citizen vs. System.  Every time.  They don&#39;t want you to see that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When people make that argument, they are mostly referring to the Medias reaction to white people rioting after sporting events, that pumpkin festival thing in Rhode Island etc. There is some truth to that argument that those are labeled less as riots and treated much differently (they don&#39;t typically create a national conversation).</p>

<p>Occupy is a whole different ball-game. There are many more vested interests between our kleptocratic government and Wall St. fat cats to crush dissidence when it comes out in force against financial injustice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. </p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to watch how liberals (many of whom have good intentions), make this entirely about race and thus fall into a <em>centuries old</em> divide-and-conquer trap. </p>

<p>I remember when I was young and learned all the arguments about how unequal America was, how screwed minorities get, etc. I thought I was really smart and informed and cutting edge. Most people seem to get stuck here. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a higher level discussion/debate to be had that isn&#39;t democrat vs republican or black vs white. That&#39;s why I love this sub - we take it to the next level and actually find out who&#39;s funding the racial division, who it benefits, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, this is absolutely the case. And it&#39;s such a hard mindset to get out of! You made and excellent point in including cliven bundy, even though it felt gross to see him as being on my side, racist asshole that he is. </p>

<p>What shocks me is how old the tactic is! A couple of months ago I learned about the bourbon conspiracy after the freeing of the slaves. I haven&#39;t been able to find much about it, but what i have found states that it was basically the plan to keep the poor whites and the newly freed blacks from joining together and actually changing the south. What the rich bourbon did was support the hell out of people who woukd later enact laws that privileged whites over black, so that the poor whites always had someone to feel superior to.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s the trap. Whenever you start feeling that you are better than others, that&#39;s when solidarity, and the chance for change, are gone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that statement is bullshit.  When white people riot, my friends and family cheer when they get the shit beat out of them and tear gassed.  There was a white kid on Long Island where I grew up, forget exactly what he did, but he was shot and killed by police.  He was a scumbag and I forget exactly what he did, but we were all very happy that he had died and had little remorse for it.  The &quot;white&quot; community if you want to call it that, was fine with this.  He was a shithead, he was robbing people to buy drugs or whatever, and killed or injured someone.  He was shot and killed by police.  His family tried to cry abuse, and they got no sympathy from the public, <em>including the black communities on Long Island</em>.  So tell me why it is wrong to be happy when a legitimate scumbag gets shot or killed by police?  Or to treat all rioters the same and speak of them the same.  Notice I point out things like Victor White being shot in the chest while handcuffed all the time, and it disgusts me.  As it would for anyone of any race shot while handcuffed in police custody.  <em>I criticize the black rioters in Baltimore as I do any rioter.  They&#39;re giving the peaceful protestors who aren&#39;t rioting a bad name, and undermining any effort to get a proper investigation and have the persons responsible held accountable for their actions.</em>  Put that in your pipe and smoke it.  You can&#39;t compare Occupy to Baltimore by the way.  The Occupiers weren&#39;t rioting.  Anarchists, Communists, and Socialists came in, who had nothing to do with the movement, and the people rioting, were the Anarchists.  Just like I won&#39;t blame the black protestors in Baltimore for the black rioters, you have to make this distinction for the Occupy Movement as well.</p>

<p>By the way, you&#39;re obviously not well versed in what happened in the Occupy Movement, but police were caught telling people released from holding, known criminals, to go down to the Occupy camps to get free food.  They were even dropping off people released from Jail and Psychiatric Institutions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it is a modern and western interpretation of our nature, since I believe we are commenting on a modern western definition of society. Which if you want to argue is a &#39;system&#39; then I agree. It is a self-imposed system, built to take advantage of efficiency, specialization and enhance the lives of all members of that system. </p>

<p>People can be generous, forgiving and compassionate but overall it tends to be limited to other members of their perceived &#39;tribe&#39;, where they are comfortable. Be it a tribe of republicans, a tribe of wall street bankers or a tribe of conspiracy advocates, outsiders are suspect. What we fail to realize is that we, in this modern age, get to define our tribe, and all too often exclusivity is the ideal, and we will fight to the death to maintain it rather than admit our own similarity to others.</p>

<p>Everyone wants all these tribes to coexist, similarities help people belong, we like labels, but each one will seemingly only accept coexistence on their own terms. Media and government reflect this, as do religion, race and OWS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mmm, Can&#39;t say I agree with you interpretation of it being a self imposed system.  I think it&#39;s a system that been imposed upon the general population. I think it&#39;s safe to say that our modern way of life began with the industrial revolution. If the system had been self imposed, then there would not have been any civil unrest from the industrial revolution, until now. It&#39;s pretty clear that this has not been the case, especially when you look at the the massive wave of civil unrest that occurred after the invention and distribution of the the telegraph.  Once people were able to communicate injustices put on the by system, revolutions, and violent state reactions against the people, massive waves of protest occurred.  They were inturrupted by the world wars and depression of the 20th century, but as europe came out of recovery from the second world war, waves of protest began again, and we really haven&#39;t seen a stop from them.  If the system had been self imposed, wouldn&#39;t the revolutions not have existed?</p>

<p>I understand what you mean about people having monkey spheres.  It&#39;s pretty much scientific fact that people generally tend to only be able to see members of our &quot;tribe&quot; as people, but just because it&#39;s in our nature doesn&#39;t mean that it cant be over come. In fact, you see people overcoming this bit of nature all the time.  We have your famous humanitarians like Ghandi, Mother Theresa, Dr. Martin Luther King jr, Mary Seacole, George Orwell, Helen Keller, etc.  They were able to over come that inherent problem in our species.  And those are just the famous one, everyday there there are people that are able to include more people into their monkey sphere than what nature programmed to do, it&#39;s not easy, but it is possible.  The problem now is that we have mass media that is constrained by the need to make profit, so all they do is pander to our baser instincts, because it&#39;s more profitable.</p>

<p>Now, i&#39;m not trying to say that human nature is horrible and base, it&#39;s who we are, and in general, humans are not horrible. It&#39;s just that we have these big ol&#39; brains that allow us the ability to be more than our nature, you know? So why not try to break the limits that nature imposed on our &quot;nature&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of what you have said. I agree we have to reach outside our tribes (break the limits that nature imposes) and find common ground. But both sides have to see their own tribe&#39;s ideals and beliefs as limiting rather than an all encompassing reality. </p>

<p>Communication allows an isolated population to come to the conclusion, some times rightfully so, that they are not on equal terms with another isolated population, they become greedy. As you stated, civil unrest after the telegraph ... and as methods of communication have improved, someone has always interpreted them as problematic ... motion pictures, TV and the internet have all had their tribes of detractors, because they exposed a particular tribe to other tribes that had different beliefs. And you could argue that they have all come with their fair share of problems - but in general we enjoy the overall results, if we didn&#39;t none would exists, so you can also say they are self imposed. </p>

<p>And at each stage of modernization, governments have been slow to adapt, the tribes that reap the most rewards have no incentive to change their behavior, but yet in time those changes take place. And the faster our society progresses, the more behind our governments fall.</p>

<p>The industrial revolution was self imposed, in that we liked the benefits that automation, electric power and a steady income provided. Was it ripe for corruption, yes. And laws were passed to contain the corruption, while maintaining a template for modernization to occur. </p>

<p>We are again at the same cross road, the internet has exposed tribes that would have preferred to not be exposed. Some of these tribes are deeply entrenched in our governments, there has been no incentive for them to change. But they are not &quot;the&quot; government. </p>

<p>Each time we throw up our hands and say its not worth voting for, nothing is going to happen, I don&#39;t have a job because it is some overarching scheme to control me, we self-impose their tribe&#39;s ideal, because at some level we are too comfortable with the benefits. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also agree with most of what you said. I just can not agree with the idea that the current system we live in is self-imposed.  I will concede that we&#39;ve compromised with the groups of people that imposed their will on us (because, c&#39;mon, in a lot of different instances, compliance with the system was forced on people through violence) with varying measures of success.  And, the democracies that arose in the 20th century was a response to the system that had been imposed upon the people.  I just don&#39;t see the pull and ebb of the power in the hand of a few as something that we agreed to, but rather a result of our struggle to live in a more equitable world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but what you&#39;re advocating gives them more of an excuse to continue militarizing the police. The idea of federalizing local police is even being discussed more now since the violence and rioting has broken out.

<p>Nope. I very pointedly said: </p>

</blockquote>

<p>In fact, I&#39;m of the mind that this riot is another Black Bloc production to ferment the kind of response most favorable to further militarization. We&#39;ve precedent that this is a tactic favored by the forces in play, so that tells me the militarization will march forward whether the riots are organic or not. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Which is why the next logical step, if you are of a mind to generate social change through demonstration, is mass work stoppages. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I agree, a lot of the times these &quot;protests&quot; are funded by special interests groups to further their own personal agendas as well. Work stoppages and union strikes are definitely good alternatives as well. People are usually black or white on the ideas of unions, because of internal corruption, but in the end they&#39;re very effective bargaining tools and offer great protection for individual employees.</p>
