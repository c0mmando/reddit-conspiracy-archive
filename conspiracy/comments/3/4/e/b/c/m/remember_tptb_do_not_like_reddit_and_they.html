        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>TLDR</p>

<p>1) vote in new queue, comment if you can</p>

<p>2) xpost content from here to the major subs. they can&#39;t censor it if you don&#39;t submit it. r/technology is probably the easiest to get into because you can flair stuff as politics</p>

<p>3) research</p>

<p>Recognize</p>

<p>Organize</p>

<p>Mobilize</p>

<p>Want change in the world? It starts locally. </p>

<p>1) <em>You</em> must recognize injustice/corruption</p>

<p>2) <em>You</em> must organize those closest to you. Part of this is educating them, or <em>unplugging</em> them so that they can recognize themselves, and are eventually capable at doing the same to others. It is possible. Humans can reason, some find it harder then others.</p>

<p>3) <em>You</em> must organize your network. This of course is the hard part. How hard did Indians find it to convince the British to leave? How hard will it be for American&#39;s to change their government? Very hard. Will it happen? Maybe. Will it really? Probably not, but its <strong>worth a shot</strong>. </p>

<p>Starts with your family and friends. If you cannot <em>open</em> your SO or best friends eyes, how could I possibly open yours?</p>

<p>Goals:</p>

<p>a) Change through existing government</p>

<p>b) Change through a new government</p>

<p>Do we abolish our current government ?  (strictly speaking of American&#39;s <strong>constitutional right</strong> to do so, when they feel the need)</p>

<p>Unrealistic, but possible. Not sure how a modern Constitutional Convention would go.</p>

<p>So, Change through our existing representative government</p>

<p>Local Government- not <em>too</em> corrupt</p>

<p>State Government- not <em>very</em> corrupt</p>

<p>Federal Government- <em>lacks legitimacy</em> (corrupt?)</p>

<ul>
<li><em>what, the federal government is corrupt?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Depends on who you ask. But it certainly lacks legitimacy. </p>

<p>How? Source?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/180113/2014-approval-congress-remains-near-time-low.aspx"><strong>Americans&#39; job approval rating for Congress averaged 15% in 2014</strong>, close to the record-low yearly average of 14% found last year. The highest yearly average was measured in 2001, at 56%. Yearly averages haven&#39;t exceeded 20% in the past five years, as well as in six of the past seven years.</a></p>

<p>15% of American citizens view their Congress as their legitimate representative body? </p>

<p>Well, <em>next</em> election they&#39;ll VOTE THEM OUT. Right?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/11/facebook-posts/congress-has-11-approval-ratings-96-incumbent-re-e/"><strong>Congress has 11% approval ratings but 96% incumbent reelection rate</strong>,</a></p>

<p><em>Oh</em></p>

<p>That&#39;s the problem.</p>

<p>Solution(s) ?</p>

<p>Simple</p>

<p><strong>End Gerrymandering</strong> in order to ensure accountability of representatives towards their constituencies. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gerrymandering &quot;is not new ... but technology has brought the practice to new levels of absurdity. As gerrymandering has grown more sophisticated, elections have become less competitive and partisan differences more entrenched.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, the left/right and democrat/republican is a false paradigm. Yes that&#39;s how <em>they</em> divide <em>us</em>, and they perpetuate their rule.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I guess I&#39;ll just say it every time this topic comes up.</p>

<p>Reddit is a media company, owned by Conde Nast.  Conde Nast owns multiple other media companies including Wired.  The headquarters for Conde Nast are found in One World Trade.  The head is a Jewish man named Newhouse who is worth about $9billion.</p>

<p>Reddit is part of &quot;TPTB&quot;</p>

<p>Reddit is a marketing platform.  It is designed to generate an audience which is then sold to advertisers.  Much of this advertising seems to be what is known as Native Advertising, meaning the ads blend perfectly into the rest of the site and it&#39;s hard to tell what is an ad and what is content.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if people on this sub, for example, don&#39;t participate in advertising subs like <a href="/r/netflix">/r/netflix</a> because Reddit uses the total user numbers, as well as statistics for user engagement and activity to sell you, me, and everyone else to an advertiser.  The more active you are, the more usernames you have, the more threads you start and comments you make, the easier it is to sell advertising.</p>

<p>Welcome to the 21st century internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair it was never originally owned by advanced publications. Reddit was started independently was then bought by Wired. Conde Nast owned Wired and advance publications owns Conde Nast.</p>

<p>The simple fact if this website wasn&#39;t bought out it would still exist. It wasn&#39;t created by TPTB they just own it owning other companies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but it will never get the major exposure it really needs unless it plays into the marketing and supports the image of the site as a useful marketing platform.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the CIA torture report got around and made absolutely no difference while half of the responses I heard or read were in support of the actions because they were against &quot;terrists&quot;</p>
