        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;how the moon was formed&quot; (typed into google):</p>

<p>Google&#39;s Answer: </p>

<p>The Moon condensed from this debris. The Ejected Ring Theory: A planetesimal the size of Mars struck the earth, ejecting large volumes of matter. A disk of orbiting material was formed, and this matter eventually condensed to form the Moon in orbit around the Earth.</p>

<p>..................</p>

<p>&quot;moon the size of the sun&quot; (typed into google):</p>

<p>Google&#39;s Answer:</p>

<p>Bottom line: The sun&#39;s diameter is about 400 times larger than that of the moon â€“ and the sun is also about 400 times farther from Earth. So the sun and moon appear nearly the same size as seen from Earth.</p>

<p>....................</p>

<p><strong>These are the apparent &quot;answers&quot; that 1000&#39;s of years of science can provide at this point. And yet, somehow people have been trained to mock anyone who dares to imply that science&#39;s answers are not good enough and more questions need to be asked.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>One should not feel like they are going to be attacked for simply pointing out that &quot;its a coincidence guys&quot; is a pretty weak answer.</strong></p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might want to try a source other than Google Answers if you&#39;re looking for a deeper understanding of science. MIT even offers free courses online.</p>

<p>If you do some actual research, you&#39;ll learn that it seems most likely that the moon formed from a collision between Earth and something else, and that over the billions of years since the moon formed, it has been gradually moving away from the planet.</p>

<p>This means that when it first formed, it was much closer. This would have produced:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Higher high tides and lower low tides</p></li>
<li><p>Eclipses that more than completely blocked out the sun</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Millions of years into the future, the moon will still be there, but it will be farther away. Lower high tides and higher low tides, and an inability to completely block out the sun will be the order of the day, then.</p>

<p>In any event, what is the conspiracy you are suggesting?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am suggesting that the moon could be man-made or &quot;being&quot;-made. It could have been built as a monument, in the same sense that we have built numerous monuments on Earth for no other reason than to do it. Like a feat of engineering. </p>

<p>Building an object with that kind of accuracy and precision, to prove to future generations that humans were once smart enough to pull it off.</p>

<p>Also, despite all of science&#39;s claims about what the moon does or how it was formed, a lot of those are just guesses at this point that will surely be built upon over the next thousand years as science evolves and reinvents itself (as it has been doing for centuries).

<p>We actually know and can prove that the moon is, indeed, moving away from the planet.</p>

<p>Also, don&#39;t confuse &quot;guesses&quot; (as in, I have no fucking clue so let&#39;s throw some shit out there, aka &quot;religion&quot;) with scientific theories, which have a very substantial grounding in fact, evidence, and repeatable experiments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>science evolves</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It certainly does that. It is the only manner of explaining nature that is willing to look deeply into itself, to challenge itself, to admit that it was inaccurate, and to modify itself to be more accurate.</p>

<p>Compare those behaviors to any other belief system. The only one I&#39;ve seen that is remotely capable of and willing to do the same sort of self-evaluation is Buddhism.</p>

<p>But don&#39;t discount the inaccuracy as a failure of the Scientific Method. The Scientific Method is reasonable and sound. It is humanity&#39;s understanding of nature that is flawed. Science, the Scientific Method, helps us figure nature out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is arrogant to believe that we have all the answers right now</p>

<p>No shit. Find one scientist who says we have all the answers right now.</p>

<p>But I also have the thought that if things weren&#39;t just the way they are we wouldn&#39;t even be here to ask the question in the first place. So maybe it really is a coincidence?</p>

<p>One intersting thing I&#39;ve read that I need to look into more is that the density of the moon is much lower than expected based on its size and gravitational effect. Some think it may be hollow or not a big rock like we think.</p>

<p>And I am aware of the coincidence needed for Earth to even have life, to be at the correct distance from the Sun, etc...</p>

<p>Of billions of planets, it seems mathematically feasible that one of the planets would hit all the right conditions. Now take that planet that hits all the right conditions and ADD that perfectly sculpted, correctly sized moon, to be observed by the beings on said planet.</p>

<p>That is one massive fucking coincidence.</p>

<p>Or... the moon was made. Honestly, the second has severe implications, but makes sense when willing to suspend everything you were ever taught about what &quot;could&quot; or &quot;couldn&#39;t&quot; be possible.</p>

<p>I think you make this out to be more startling than it is, and portray it as a bizarre intersection of four random variables when it seems more likely to be only one random variable which is actually pertinent. Take a star, a planet, and it&#39;s moon, of any size. The planet can be any distance from its star. With these conditions as given, there is always a value for the distance of the moon from it&#39;s planet which will yield the desired condition of the moon and star having the same apparent size from the view of the planet. If the moon were half it&#39;s size, just halve the distance to the planet. I only see one independent variable, and it having a particular value based on the dependent variables is not that odd.</p>

<p>&#39;While this does not prove that Saturn&#39;s hexagon definitely occurs via the same processes as in our experiments, it does demonstrate that it could do so, and suggests other things for scientists to look for that may help to improve our understanding of Saturn&#39;s atmosphere.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are talking about 1 subset of a subset of the false moon theory.</p>

<p>Its not all about reptilians, its not all about saturn, its not all about dimensions.</p>

<p>The base theory is: the moon and its motion is too perfect for chance.  Thats it,other people may add on to this belief, but you can&#39;t say: 
Supposedly, it has to do with the Saturnalian religion/death cult. Something about the planets are a 3rd dimensional representation of a 4th or higher dimensional something. </p>

<p>Thats the problem with skeptics, they only think black or white, this or that, &quot;r/conspiracy&quot; believes in reptilians</p>

<p>Plus judging by your &#39;supposedly&#39;, &#39;something about&#39;, and &#39;something&#39; you have probably conflated several theories.</p>

<p>&quot;Random Chance&quot; is the scientist&#39;s way of saying &quot;God did it&quot;. There are some truths in this world that will always remain a mystery. Is there a God? Life after death? Do we have Free Will? Is there a reason the Moon, Earth, and Sun fit together in perfect geometry? We&#39;ll never know for sure. It&#39;s what the Gnostics call the Divine Mysteries.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>a lot of those are just guesses at this point </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We actually know and can prove that the moon is, indeed, moving away from the planet.</p>

<p>Also, don&#39;t confuse &quot;guesses&quot; (as in, I have no fucking clue so let&#39;s throw some shit out there, aka &quot;religion&quot;) with scientific theories, which have a very substantial grounding in fact, evidence, and repeatable experiments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>science evolves</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It certainly does that. It is the only manner of explaining nature that is willing to look deeply into itself, to challenge itself, to admit that it was inaccurate, and to modify itself to be more accurate.</p>

<p>Compare those behaviors to any other belief system. The only one I&#39;ve seen that is remotely capable of and willing to do the same sort of self-evaluation is Buddhism.</p>

<p>But don&#39;t discount the inaccuracy as a failure of the Scientific Method. The Scientific Method is reasonable and sound. It is humanity&#39;s understanding of nature that is flawed. Science, the Scientific Method, helps us figure nature out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is arrogant to believe that we have all the answers right now</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No shit. Find one scientist who says we have all the answers right now.</p>
