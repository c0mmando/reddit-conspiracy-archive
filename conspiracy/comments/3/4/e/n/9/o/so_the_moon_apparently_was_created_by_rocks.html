       "how the moon was formed" (typed into google):
      </p>
      <p>
       Google's Answer:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Moon condensed from this debris. The Ejected Ring Theory: A planetesimal the size of Mars struck the earth, ejecting large volumes of matter. A disk of orbiting material was formed, and this matter eventually condensed to form the Moon in orbit around the Earth.

       "moon the size of the sun" (typed into google):
      </p>
      <p>
       Google's Answer:
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line: The sun's diameter is about 400 times larger than that of the moon â€“ and the sun is also about 400 times farther from Earth. So the sun and moon appear nearly the same size as seen from Earth.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
       <strong>
        These are the apparent "answers" that 1000's of years of science can provide at this point. And yet, somehow people have been trained to mock anyone who dares to imply that science's answers are not good enough and more questions need to be asked.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        One should not feel like they are going to be attacked for simply pointing out that "its a coincidence guys" is a pretty weak answer.

       The reason they say it's a coincidence is because this wasn't always the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moon is drifting away - In many years to come it no longer will be the same relative size as the sun. The coincidence is that it's the right size now whilst we're around to observe it.

I pray you have a cite for this statement, cause I want to see this. But if you dont then tell me how it's possible that if the earth has an influential gravitational pull on the moon and likewise the moon pulls on the earth, that the two can drift apart?

       You might want to try a source other than Google Answers if you're looking for a deeper understanding of science. MIT even offers free courses online.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do some actual research, you'll learn that it seems most likely that the moon formed from a collision between Earth and something else, and that over the billions of years since the moon formed, it has been gradually moving away from the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means that when it first formed, it was much closer. This would have produced:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Higher high tides and lower low tides
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Eclipses that more than completely blocked out the sun
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Millions of years into the future, the moon will still be there, but it will be farther away. Lower high tides and higher low tides, and an inability to completely block out the sun will be the order of the day, then.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any event, what is the conspiracy you are suggesting?

       I am suggesting that the moon could be man-made or "being"-made. It could have been built as a monument, in the same sense that we have built numerous monuments on Earth for no other reason than to do it. Like a feat of engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Building an object with that kind of accuracy and precision, to prove to future generations that humans were once smart enough to pull it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, despite all of science's claims about what the moon does or how it was formed, a lot of those are just guesses at this point that will surely be built upon over the next thousand years as science evolves and reinvents itself (as it has been doing for centuries). It is arrogant to believe that we have all the answers right now, just because we happen to be at this point in the timeline.

       We actually know and can prove that the moon is, indeed, moving away from the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, don't confuse "guesses" (as in, I have no fucking clue so let's throw some shit out there, aka "religion") with scientific theories, which have a very substantial grounding in fact, evidence, and repeatable experiments.

       It certainly does that. It is the only manner of explaining nature that is willing to look deeply into itself, to challenge itself, to admit that it was inaccurate, and to modify itself to be more accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare those behaviors to any other belief system. The only one I've seen that is remotely capable of and willing to do the same sort of self-evaluation is Buddhism.
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't discount the inaccuracy as a failure of the Scientific Method. The Scientific Method is reasonable and sound. It is humanity's understanding of nature that is flawed. Science, the Scientific Method, helps us figure nature out.

       I've had this thought before, the moon fascinates me a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I also have the thought that if things weren't just the way they are we wouldn't even be here to ask the question in the first place. So maybe it really is a coincidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       One intersting thing I've read that I need to look into more is that the density of the moon is much lower than expected based on its size and gravitational effect. Some think it may be hollow or not a big rock like we think.

       Every other coincidence (literally in the universe) is more feasible than a space rock (the moon) being set at:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         the exact size (through seemingly random collisions)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the exact correct distance from Earth
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the exact correct distance from the Sun
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the relation between the above specs when compared to the exact size of the Sun
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         beings living on the planet able to comprehend and view the overlap (during an eclipse)

       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Besides the "Big Bang" (which is still little more than a working theory), is there any bigger coincidence in the Universe?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I am aware of the coincidence needed for Earth to even have life, to be at the correct distance from the Sun, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Of billions of planets, it seems mathematically feasible that one of the planets would hit all the right conditions. Now take that planet that hits all the right conditions and ADD that perfectly sculpted, correctly sized moon, to be observed by the beings on said planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is one massive fucking coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or... the moon was made. Honestly, the second has severe implications, but makes sense when willing to suspend everything you were ever taught about what "could" or "couldn't" be possible.

       I think you make this out to be more startling than it is, and portray it as a bizarre intersection of four random variables when it seems more likely to be only one random variable which is actually pertinent. Take a star, a planet, and it's moon, of any size. The planet can be any distance from its star. With these conditions as given, there is always a value for the distance of the moon from it's planet which will yield the desired condition of the moon and star having the same apparent size from the view of the planet. If the moon were half it's size, just halve the distance to the planet. I only see one independent variable, and it having a particular value based on the dependent variables is not that odd.

       Four of those are the same thing. The exact size is relative to the exact distance which is relative to the size of the sun which is relative to the distance from the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sympathetic to the idea that there may be more to the moon than it seems but don't overstate your case you fucking nut job.

       They are not the same thing at all.

       The moon almost perfectly blocks out the sun. This has to do with the size of the moon. AND the distance between the sun and moon.

       If the size of the sun were different, the other 3 ratios would need to be adjusted. If the size of the moon were different.... If the distance between the sun and moon were different.... If the distance between the moon and Earth were different.....

       I don't know how anyone would be able to know that or prove that. Is there more behind this theory? Any actual evidence that points to those conclusions?

       I'm not onboard with it, but I do find it fun/interesting to contemplate.  Supposedly, it has to do with the Saturnalian religion/death cult.  Something about the planets are a 3rd dimensional representation of a 4th or higher dimensional something.

       There stuff out there.  Icke (which is a bad word here) talks about it quite a bit.   Fun stuffs.

       You are talking about 1 subset of a subset of the false moon theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not all about reptilians, its not all about saturn, its not all about dimensions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The base theory is: the moon and its motion is too perfect for chance.  Thats it,other people may add on to this belief, but you can't say: 
Supposedly, it has to do with the Saturnalian religion/death cult. Something about the planets are a 3rd dimensional representation of a 4th or higher dimensional something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats the problem with skeptics, they only think black or white, this or that, "r/conspiracy" believes in reptilians
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus judging by your 'supposedly', 'something about', and 'something' you have probably conflated several theories.

       Chill.  He asked what theories are out there and I gave him an example of one that is pretty comprehensive and I never said anything about reptiles.  Why are you getting so defensive?  Why are you putting words into my mouth which is

       You think that's weird? The entire Solar System is almost geometrically perfect. Check out Jason Martineau's work on this, he discusses a lot of the geometric relations between the Moon and Earth:

       "Random Chance" is the scientist's way of saying "God did it". There are some truths in this world that will always remain a mystery. Is there a God? Life after death? Do we have Free Will? Is there a reason the Moon, Earth, and Sun fit together in perfect geometry? We'll never know for sure. It's what the Gnostics call the Divine Mysteries.

       We actually know and can prove that the moon is, indeed, moving away from the planet.

      <p>
       Also, don't confuse "guesses" (as in, I have no fucking clue so let's throw some shit out there, aka "religion") with scientific theories, which have a very substantial grounding in fact, evidence, and repeatable experiments.

       It certainly does that. It is the only manner of explaining nature that is willing to look deeply into itself, to challenge itself, to admit that it was inaccurate, and to modify itself to be more accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare those behaviors to any other belief system. The only one I've seen that is remotely capable of and willing to do the same sort of self-evaluation is Buddhism.
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't discount the inaccuracy as a failure of the Scientific Method. The Scientific Method is reasonable and sound. It is humanity's understanding of nature that is flawed. Science, the Scientific Method, helps us figure nature out.

       No shit. Find one scientist who says we have all the answers right now.
