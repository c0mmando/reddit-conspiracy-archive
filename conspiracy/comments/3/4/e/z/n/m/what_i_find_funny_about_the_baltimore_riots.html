       Everyone is picking a side.  Anyone posting is either all for the police, or all for the protestors.  Both sides are doing fucked up shit.  This is how it is all over reddit.  Everyone who picks a side, is totally under the idea, that all the police are wrong, or all the protestors are wrong.  Think about that for a second.  Who wins, when both sides are completely wrong all the time, and both sides are victimized as criminals.  Both the protestors and the police are reacting the same way, because they're both being generalized at the same time.

       You keep using the word, "Protesters". You should instead use, "Rioters". This isn't a protest. It's a riot.
      </p>
      <p>
       All Rioters are wrong. Some cops are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, it doesn't matter, because too few people understand why the riots are really happening. They keep pointing to the triggering event as the reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rioters don't even understand why they're rioting, nor do they understand who they should be focusing their anger upon (hint: it's not senior centers, bars, random people (burning cars), or even CVS).

       So much is wrong with your comment and the way you think, I don't know where to start.

       People are pissed. No one takes anyone seriously. They protest, they get made fun of and discredited for "not having jobs." So they riot, now we are actually talking about police reform. Looks like they're not as "wrong" as the media tells you they are...

       Where did you hear that? Some newscaster makes this offhanded comment, and you use it as a fact to base your argument on? Sounds like you are just regurgitating the same catch phrases you heard at OWS.

       Blah blah blah.

       It doesn't give people the right to take to the streets, destroy businesses, destroy property, harm others,
       <strong>
        within groups that are not causing the harm to them
       </strong>
       .

      <p>
       Rioting is animalistic, self-defeating, destructive behavior. It is always wrong.
       <strong>
        Always
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody ever takes rioters seriously because of the above. I mean, they take them seriously enough to beat and/or arrest them... but not to make the required, fundamental changes to the socio-economic rules of this nation in a manner that would eliminate the occurrences of riots like this.

       Why do you think they have the first clue why they're rioting? If they knew the real reason they were rioting... if they were cognizant enough to really understand it... why would they destroy local businesses, senior centers, cars of random people, etc.?

       The real violent rioters were school children provoked by a social media campaign. Social media accounts behind the campaign were linked to the Ferguson stuff according to CBS. The violent part was obviously orchestrated.

       Again, another person one-sided.  All you're looking at is the rioters, not the protestors, which is the majority of people out there, who aren't looting, and are protesting peacefully.  I actually find it funny that you replied to my point as, "IT'S THE RIOTERS FAULT!!!".  My point exactly.  Paid shill?

       Or you could learn to read and understand that all rioters are, indeed, wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rioting is a behavior.

       If you're talking about people just standing on the street holding signs, holding hands, and singing kumbaya, those aren't rioters.

       No one in the media paid any attention to the protesters. Protests didn't do anything to address the underlying reasons, which as you correctly state, were overlooked in favor of the trigger to the riots. I'm not saying the riots were effective or targeted at the right people, but from the point of view of someone in generational poverty within Baltimore, what other recourse do they have? The political system has failed them, peaceful protest has failed to solve the underlying reasons; how would you suggest they react?

       I don't think they have any real choice but to react the way they did and are.

       Unfortunately, it's self-defeating.

       It would be more beneficial to them if they could understand why they are in the position they are in and how to correct it, but, again, because the system is rigged against them, few if any even have the opportunity to figure that out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, it's up to those of us who do have the opportunity and ability to see it to help them.

       I agree the rioting is self-defeating to an extent, but it seems wrong to suggest their only hope is some outside white saviors (I'm white at least) to somehow come in from without and help them. I don't know what the solution is, but I do feel compelled to express solidarity with their plight, if not their actions.

       So do I. I can sympathize with their plight but abhor their actions at the same time.

       I can also do something about their plight, even if it's just a little thing, and I will and do, do those things even though it's going to mean sacrificing a bit of what I have to do it.

       If so, can you explain why they're burning down senior centers, Joe's Bar, and the average person's car instead of grabbing their pitchforks and torches and heading to the Koch Brothers' homes or businesses?

       OK so let's make it more personal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say every time you walked down the street, Steve came up behind you and gave you a swift kick in the ass. What's your reaction:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Punch a random stranger in the face
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Punch Steve in the face
      </p>
      <p>
       If your answer is #1, why the fuck would you answer like that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if you knew you were being forced down into poverty by the very wealthiest of Americans, would your reaction be to throw a rock through the window of Joe's bar, set some random stranger's car on fire, or figure out how to stand up to the specific people that are oppressing you?
