<p>People are pissed. No one takes anyone seriously. They protest, they get made fun of and discredited for &quot;not having jobs.&quot; So they riot, now we are actually talking about police reform. Looks like they&#39;re not as &quot;wrong&quot; as the media tells you they are...</p>

<p>Blah blah blah.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t give people the right to take to the streets, destroy businesses, destroy property, harm others, <strong>within groups that are not causing the harm to them</strong>.</p>

<p>Rioting is animalistic, self-defeating, destructive behavior. It is always wrong. <strong>Always</strong>.</p>

<p>Nobody ever takes rioters seriously because of the above. I mean, they take them seriously enough to beat and/or arrest them... but not to make the required, fundamental changes to the socio-economic rules of this nation in a manner that would eliminate the occurrences of riots like this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where did you hear that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do you think they have the first clue why they&#39;re rioting? If they knew the real reason they were rioting... if they were cognizant enough to really understand it... why would they destroy local businesses, senior centers, cars of random people, etc.?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they have any real choice but to react the way they did and are.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it&#39;s self-defeating.</p>

<p>It would be more beneficial to them if they could understand why they are in the position they are in and how to correct it, but, again, because the system is rigged against them, few if any even have the opportunity to figure that out.</p>

<p>Therefore, it&#39;s up to those of us who do have the opportunity and ability to see it to help them.</p>
