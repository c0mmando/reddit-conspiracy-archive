       First of all, good job with everything guys. The level of "awareness" in this sub is amazing; stimulating, philosophical discussion and insightful comments are highly valuable. This sub is a red pill gateway for many of those still locked in the mental prison of the global fascist corporate oligarchy. This will be brief since I am in transit, but I had a few ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since we are more or less approaching the socioeconomic singularity/SHTF event horizon (the posts here just keep getting juicier), I have a feeling that our internet freedoms are going to quickly sour. Reddit is a mess right now, and I feel that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is in its prime at the moment. It will quickly decline from here.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need a seamless way to migrate all of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       's userbase in the event that it becomes absolutely necessary. Is it possible for all links in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , including links to posts, comments, and external websites, to redirect to another site? I know that may constitute "breaking Reddit," but
       <em>
        fuck
       </em>
       Reddit. We do
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       need to comply with unjust conditions (near site-wide admin/mod corruption, rampant censorship, manipulated discussion, advertising and propaganda).
      </p>
      <p>
       If that isn't possible, perhaps a permanent greenpost or something in the sidebar could link to the future "new home" of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to encourage early migration. It could remain long after
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has been abandoned (unless the sub gets banned or something).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mods, please consider something like this to guarantee the survival of the freethinking community that thrives here.

       That's a fantastic analogy. I have a thing for analogies. They're efficient, yet poetic.

       Decentralized means there is no one server. I've been trying to think of a way to actually build a site like this (I'm a programmer). The only problem is how the hell to actually do it. Some say use the bitcoin block chain, but idk.

       obvious choice seems to be torrents. Decentralised by it's very nature, rough implementation:
      </p>
      <p>
       accounts = combo of name(handle)+ hashsignature with rsa key ,
every post would be it's own torrent, the file format could be something like handle:time:topic:replyToX:message + signature for the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       with posts = torrents you can use the established p2p network system. A topic would be just a list of message torrents you load, a program to automatically sort by date, verify signatures and format them into one thread visually wouldn't be hard to write.
      </p>
      <p>
       Older topics could be archieved in packages and signed again by people to keep the tracker list small. Others could be used to automatically download and verify those archieves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Private messages would be just a matter of using someones public key to encrypt the message for him.

       It's not that easy. You throw out a lot of mumbo jumbo, being a dev, it's hard. There is no good solution because the conspiracy community is paranoid (so should they). I've fucked around with webRTC, and some other techs. None of them fit, or people choose not to do it. I've fucked around with JS but the conspiracy folks disable it. There is really no good solution. Yeah, we can dev software with an internal DB but will people adopt it? This is a tough cookie. I'm open to suggestions......

       What we need is a community site whose content is stored on a blockchain. Its operation can be decentralized and uncontrollable by any one force. The site will be as strong as those running the verification nodes. The nodes can be modified to remove the "currency" aspect of the ledger, leaving a write only data structure that represents a sub like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       with links, votes, and comments. Each user account would be a "wallet", and the "block chain reader" could be the web UI much like blockchain.info.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once its booted, like Bitcoin it can only be monitored, but never modified, never censored, etc.

       Instead of building the site itself on a blockchain, we could set it up to be a Namecoin website since that would be more simple.  However, I still greatly approve of your idea, especially if you're able to work out how to do it :)

       The block chain would be the data store. Because of this, no one would "own" the frontend. It's of course... just a protocol. You could easily set up a name coin site and access the conspiracy "threadchain".

       or something, copy all the freely-available reddit code to clone reddit, then make a bot that clones all material including comments on

       I feel you and I think if it came down to it that all the links could be move and someone could just make a
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       Yeah it will. It's inevitable. Be it days, months, or years, it's coming. The reddit admins still own reddit, and eventually they will pull the plug on this subreddit in some way or another because it conflicts with corporate and governmental narratives, and reddit is more and more bought-and-sold by the day.

       300k subscribed isn't exactly small. And sometimes the quality of material declines if too many people join, so I'm fine with it where it is. The word will spread naturally among those who are interested.

       If the event horizon happens, I don't think the internet will be a viable option for vast groups of people (ISP's will probably cut anything that isn't 100% controlled if the backbones and/or power aren't shut off also). Ham radio will become the meeting place that cannot be controlled and much harder to jam. Those with the information will become de facto leaders.

       I don't think we'll be going back to HAM radio. Even in China they have ways to access the real internet.

       The internet sees censorship as damage, and routes around it. That isn't going to change anytime soon.

       I'm sure everyone here can see the approaching event on the horizon and the effects that will come with it. 
By then the Internet will be compromised. We need a place to go in order to keep the this going.

       I can't decided what I am more disgusted by, the evil conspirators of the world, or the masses of people who ignorantly refute any evidence of the unlawful acts committed by said conspirators.

       Yeah it will. It's inevitable. Be it days, months, or years, it's coming. The reddit admins still own reddit, and eventually they will pull the plug on this subreddit in some way or another because it conflicts with corporate and governmental narratives, and reddit is more and more bought-and-sold by the day.
