<p>The son of two NYPD cops, Crystal was put in charge of his police academy cadet class on day one.</p>

<p>He was promoted to detective before he reached his second year on the force.</p>

<p>And he went on to lead his violent crime unit in gun arrests, racking up high-profile collars that made the evening news.</p>

<p>For Crystal, rooting out crime in one of the most violent cities in the nation didn’t even feel like work.</p>

<p>“Being a cop was all I ever wanted to do,” he says. “A dream come true.”</p>

<p>But that dream turned into a nightmare four years ago when his brothers in blue turned on him – bombarding him with taunts and threats, refusing to come to his aid during drug busts and even leaving a dead rat on his windshield&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My brother and I know a guy who left the police force after working in both rural and non rural parts of Wisconsin.  He did this after 10+ years on the force.  When asked why, he said he couldn&#39;t deal with the crime and corruption.  My brother and I assumed he was talking about paper trails leading to politicians and prominent members of society.  Nope, he went into detail on describing how virtually every police department in the country, including his own, is on the take in some shape or form.  He said after awhile, he felt more like a thief than a cop, always looking for situations and people to exploit.  He said other cops won&#39;t even ride with you if they know you won&#39;t be a part of their ideology to steal cash, drugs, or jewelry.  This is the state of our law enforcement today. </p>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s why there is so much police fantasy in television today, where 99% of the episodes in CSI and Law and Order never even hint or touch upon the subject of police corruption.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right about the TV portrayal of cops. </p>

<p>Usually when there&#39;s an episode or movie about a bad cop, they make him out to be some monster the audience can&#39;t stomach. Pedo, head of drug cartel, etc..</p>
