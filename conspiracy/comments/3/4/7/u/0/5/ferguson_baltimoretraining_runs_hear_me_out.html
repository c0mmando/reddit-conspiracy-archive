<p>Sure police brutality is an issue, but the police are low level soldiers. They&#39;re literally trained to take shit from the public, so the governing class doesn&#39;t have to. It&#39;s always been like this and seemingly always will be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing with Baltimore is that people are being beaten and killed all the time. I thought there were going to be riots in 2013 after the police killed an unarmed Tyrone West in his own neighborhood with everyone watching. Or at least bigger protests. There were protests, but smaller than you&#39;d think...especially given how shocking that whole situation was.</p>

<p>I really believe the powder keg was lit by trapping all those kids at Mondawmin Mall yesterday.</p>

<p>It was just a matter of time, though. BPD corruption is untenable and everyone knows it. I&#39;m hoping that officers stand up, too. (Kind of think and hope that may be what&#39;s going on with the Freddie Gray story; 5 out of 6 of the officers provided statements, one of the officers--the supervisor--was apparently messed up in the head if the restraining orders against him are to be believed.) Also, just the day before Freddie Gray was murdered, another guy was shot 6 times in the back for running away from police. Seriously, knowing other people who have dealt with the brutality, who wouldn&#39;t run? Running from someone who scares the shit out of you isn&#39;t a crime punishable by extrajudiciary execution, if it&#39;s a crime at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I considered this point.  </p>

<p>Who the fuck would let those students out early from school while knowing the cities mass transit system was shut down.  There are no dedicated school buses and all school age children rely on that mass transit system to get to / from school. So this high school, and city officials knew... they knew that letting those kids loose 1-2hours prior to their stated rally time to meet at the mall would give them plenty of time get there.  </p>

<p>They had the police there waiting with orders to simply take whatever the kids threw at them.  Those kids got away with everything and the police simply stood, watched, and were limited to simple self defense.</p>

<p>Instead of keeping the students in school, or asking their parents to pick them up to prevent their attendance to &quot;the purge&quot;... they turned them loose upon the streets with no way to get home.</p>
