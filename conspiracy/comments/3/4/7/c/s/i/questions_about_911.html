        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>According to most truthers, when exactly did the planes get captured and when did they hit the towers? Do most truthers have a rough idea of when they think the controlled demolition went off? </p>

<p>Also a question i have been burning to ask truthers. Did the US gain anything on attacking Iraq? I mean even according to cynical totalitarian books like &quot;the prince&quot; and &quot;Art of war&quot; it goes into detail about how prolonged war is bad for everyone including the leaders. </p>

<p>Im not really an anti-conspiracy guy. Im just asking for some clarification as im not yet convinced at least. I don&#39;t believe disney is an evil organization or that FBI is giving me cancer from vaccines, but i do find some conspiracy theories plausible, just that i have yet to see evidence for it. If you could answer some questions or provide link (that is not just a link to a front page but an article about something) that would be sweet.  </p>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<p>Is nice and all that you give me detailed information and your idea around it. But to be honest i would like it if you answered the questions at the top first. I gotta take a few baby steps before i fly. Then if you could provide link to where you got the idea from. That would make m life easier then reading up on every theory that ever existed. </p>

<p>EDIT2: </p>

<p>And when did the towers fall? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Went into Afghanistan first to get a foothold and nab Opium production, which went up in the hundreds of percent since its takeover.  We put a CIA friendly idiot in power there, Hamid Karzai.  The 9/11 terrorists were from Saudi-Arabia (Some are still alive, one was a student who lost his passport here before getting home) but we still wanted &quot;boots on the ground&quot; there anyway.  Then needed justification for war with Iraq, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_A77N5WKWM">even though Bush admitted to zero connection.</a> Iraq wasn&#39;t playing ball with Western powers <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=saddam+hung&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=-wJAVdrjKsvksAT8qYGABQ&amp;amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;amp;biw=1056&amp;amp;bih=505#tbm=isch&amp;amp;q=saddam+with+rumsfeld">even though they put him in control and supported him back in the day.</a>  They later made him the boogieman and <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=saddam+hung&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=-wJAVdrjKsvksAT8qYGABQ&amp;amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;amp;biw=1056&amp;amp;bih=505">had him hung.</a> </p>

<p>Oil in the mid-east and control over the region and pipelines was a good goal for them to achieve.  They also get a shot at surrounding Iran and getting a good foothold into the region to take out Libya as well.  They finally got Gaddaffi out, after supporting Al-queda in Libya&#39;s region.  Gaddaffi himself said that he had imprisoned thousands of Al-queda members and they were somehow busted out of prison and used to fight the so called uprising against him.  They had zero resources and Gaddaffi had them quelled until they one day donned American camo and had weapons to fight against him.  <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=fake+green+square+produced&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=HQRAVd-9MufbsATZ_ICQAQ&amp;amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;amp;biw=1056&amp;amp;bih=505#imgrc=_">They even FAKED the historic Green Square in order to make it look like a civil war was actually supported by the people when it was not.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXS3vW47mOE">Syria was also one of these &quot;axis of evil&quot; countries that just HAD to be taken out</a> so they worked on them with the FSA, but that didn&#39;t work....so now the new boogiemen are beheading people and that has worked to cause an uproar, even though they have the money and the production value of HOLLYWOOD.  The so called rebels all have American camo and in some cases, new Multicam which is clearly American.  They somehow have the money for this huge force but all of their equipment was conveniently left in Iraq by the US!  They &quot;left&quot; it there never thinking it would ever be used again/against them.  Strange....even with Al-queda running around, they couldn&#39;t have seen it coming.  Very strange.</p>

<p>Iran is one of the last holdouts.....and obviously everyone believes the propaganda that they&#39;re out to get us.....even though they would be squashed like a bug if they tried.  <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=syrian+rebels+hold+American+arms&amp;amp;biw=1056&amp;amp;bih=505&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=HgVAVaqVKJCRsQTl6IDQCQ&amp;amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAw">They&#39;re looking for a reason to get in there in a bad way.</a></p>

<p>Ahh, so much to it.....but you and I pay for these wars and more money flows to a certain foreign country for THEIR safety than the people in our own.  People here are on food stamps but we almost entirely fund their military and help continue an <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=peace+not+apartheid&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;amp;ei=cQZAVaTEFPC1sASJ94EI">apartheid</a> against <a href="https://fasttimesinpalestine.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/four-panel-map.jpg">Palestine.</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s my sparse review.  All for control, oil, power and continued suppression of the regular Joe like you and I.  We must always believe there s a reason to go to war and advocate for their destruction on the rich man&#39;s terms.   Politics is power.</p>

<p>The US didn&#39;t gain anything by invading Iraq, but it wasn&#39;t &quot;The US&quot; who committed 9/11 or &quot;The US&quot; who told the lies that started the Iraq war. The U.S. government isn&#39;t an entity, it is more like a tool, which can be bought and controlled or blackmailed for whatever purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. I do admit that maybe, just maybe it suggests some connection. But you are sort of saying it is proof because it suggest they are working together. I understand that a lot of the time you have little to work on and must leave some things to speculation or hunch, but i would rather prefer to say &quot;i don&#39;t know if that means they are in on a conspiracy&quot;. </p>

<p>From what i understand Bush administration has ties with Saddam family, so there might be more to it that we can look up. But for now its just a suggestion leading to speculation. </p>

<p>What i would like from you is to try and prove a connection, rather then seeing something and thinking it must be a conspiracy because it fits in with your narrative of what is going on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cognitive dissonance is used when you make a rationalization when something does not fit your view. For example Lisa thinks she is good at math, her teacher gives her bad grades in math therefor her teacher sucks/unfair etc. </p>

<p>It is not however cognitive dissonance to rationalize something when someone is actively asking for clarification or giving you something to consider. If you for example say &quot;If humans came from monkies, why are there still monkeys&quot; A rationalization and answer to that question does not mean its cognitive dissonance just because the evolution denier is trying to change your world view. </p>

<p>Same thing with George Bush. He said he was afraid it was a conspiracy, does not mean shit. He did not say it was an inside job. A conspiracy does not mean elaborate plan to damage your own country for your own means. It can just as well be a terrorist attack. </p>

<p>While you committing the &quot;confirmation bias&quot; fallacy. You find things with an open interpretation and make it fit with your narrative. You didn&#39;t think for a second that Bush might have actually been talking about terrorists because what you wanted to hear was that it was an inside job. So you will interpret anything you find as that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The burden of proof is upon the person making the claim. Your claim is that 9/11 is an elaborate conspiracy by Bush&amp;Co and several people in the middle east. My claim is that its not that. Its a negative claim.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>They did? I would like to see this. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are dozens of whistleblowers, melted steel, buildings that weren&#39;t hit falling in free fall, and planes flying impossibly fast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In obscure websites that get credibility for not being &quot;mainstream&quot;. So let me sum this up: </p>

<p>Melted steel was found because it wasn&#39;t only the jetfuel that caught on fire. </p>

<p>Whistleblowers? Again this is just obscure accounts. Snowden is a real whistleblower, he gave information out and is clearly seen as a traitor. If someone gives sensitive information you can be damn sure they would not only be more credible then vague suggestions, but they would go into hiding. 9/11 is way bigger and more elaborate with more factors. I have not seen anyone like Snowden give out such information. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whereas all you have to say is &quot;that&#39;s not enough&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. I understand that conspiracy theorists have to go on limited information and leave things up to speculation. But that is honestly what separates true conspiracies from fake ones. Enron was taken to court. Operation Snow White had files to back it up for them government etc. </p>

<p>Conspiracy theories consist of people on 4chan and obscure boards. And the few oddballs(for example is biologists that don&#39;t think evolution is real). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What exactly are you looking for? What would prove it to you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be honest the credibility and nature of conspiracy theories means that i would require more evidence then from anyone else to be honest. Its difficult to take it at face value. The most convincing would actually be the government coming out about it in 10 years or more. But even if it was true that probably would not happen. </p>

<p>Outside of that you just have to give me a bit more time. There is a lot of stuff and i have not read all of the stuff people send me. </p>

<p>As I said, the official story is that this was a conspiracy between KSA and the Bush family, as admitted by Bush himself, the 9/11 commission report, and dozens of whistleblowers. </p>

<p>Your claim that it was a conspiracy by some guys in caves in Afghanistan who somehow were able to prevent NORAD from intercepting planes for 45 minutes is much more incredulous.</p>

<p>On the day of 9/11 multiple eye witnesses stated live on television that the buildings fell in a controlled collapse.</p>

<p>Every positive claim can be turned into a negative - for example you are trying to get me to prove that this WASN&#39;T done by bin Laden.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t get to decide that your speculation which is based in nothing (as I&#39;ve repeatedly said, by claiming that 9/11 wasn&#39;t an inside job you are denying the official but redacted story).</p>

<p>Saying that you don&#39;t know something just because the government says it&#39;s classified is not good citizenship.</p>

<p>Hes seriously not that stupid. He might seem that way but you cant become President without being an image conscious person. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>So? An average person would only think buildings fall to one side and not straight down. They would not know that skyscrapers are designed to fall that way to prevent further destruction. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again i have never said i can prove a negative. I can only ask for evidence and say if i think its credible or not. The burden of proof is upon the person making a claim(positive on obviously) because of this. </p>

<p>Me and another youtuber discussed this on a video which was disinfo and had fake potshots of explosives, but also included a flying saucer. So i pointed out the saucer and he said &quot;Well there is still a video out there proving the potshots are not fake. </p>

<p>I asked for this link of course and he told me to fuck off and google it instead. Then i realized that even if i looked up 20 videos showing that not happening he could still point to that i did not look long enough for that one video. There could be hundreds of videos out there claiming this and that. Which i cant 100 percent refute, but i can point to the lack of evidence if a source is provided and dismiss it if i don&#39;t think its legit proof. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bush administration was run by the group of political thinkers we call &quot;neoconservatives.&quot; They have been around for a long time and they are the cause of a lot of trouble.</p>

<p>Think of them as &quot;the Nixon administration minus Nixon&quot; because Nixon was one of their early leaders before his &#39;early retirement.&#39; They were pro-war, pro-empire, pro-Wall Street Republicans. But they were willing to lie about being &quot;compassionate&quot; or &quot;Christians&quot; to get votes. </p>

<p>Under Nixon, this group famously signed deals with Iran, Saudi Arabia, China and Russia that set up the world economy as it exists today, centered around oil instead of gold as intended.</p>

<p>After Nixon&#39;s fall, their leader was George H.W. Bush. He was Nixon&#39;s U.N. Ambassador and then President Ford&#39;s CIA commander. Bush oversaw the &quot;reforms&quot; of the CIA after the Church Committee exposed their most horrible crimes. Since Bush took over in the 70s, very few leaks have come out of the CIA about what they are doing.</p>

<p>A little later, Bush found a Real Life Hollywood Actor named Ronald Reagan to pretend to be a cowboy and run for president. Bush became his vice President. A few months after they were sworn in Ronald Reagan was almost assassinated-- but he survived! So Bush remained behind the scenes until 1988 when he ran for president. </p>

<p>As President, HW Bush declared the dawning of a New World Order in Congress and on exactly the same day signed the order to start the &quot;Hammer Fund&quot; or &quot;Project hammer,&quot; a $2.3 trillion government bond intended to &quot;alter the deal&quot; that he himself had signed with Russia and China. </p>

<p>(Or maybe implementing parts of the deal with them that he didn&#39;t tell the public about)</p>

<p>Anyway, the $2.3 trillion bond expired exactly 20 years later on Sept. 11, 2001. the H.A.M.M.E.R. fund is portrayed allegorically in pop culture by Marvel&#39;s S.H.I.E.L.D.</p>

<p>Before 1991, scandals like Watergate and Iran contra had come close to exposing the criminal network secretly controlling the government. Reporters had done this by FOLLOWING THE MONEY. So all their activities after 1991 we paid for by the H.A.M.M.E.R. fund. </p>

<p>The mission of the H.A.M.M.E.R. fund was to fund terrorists and radicals in and around the Soviet Union to destabilize and eventually collapse the country. Essentially a continuation of what had successfully driven the Soviets out of Afghanistan in the 1980s.</p>

<p>(BTW that effort was led by Osama bin Laden &amp; Ronald Reagan had the Taliban leaders as guests at the White House)</p>

<p>The effort to destabilize the Soviet union was well under way by 1991, but the H.A.M.M.E.R. fund was also intended to shape policy for the next 20 years, it was used to buy up Russia&#39;s assets as the communist regime sold off its infrastructure. It set up a group of Oligarchs in Russia that eventually dominated the transportation and energy sectors. They kept Russia corrupt and broken for the entire 1990s and no one challenged the U.S. as the World Police.</p>

<p>Then in 2000, George HW Bush&#39;s son was running for President. </p>

<p>The H.A.M.M.E.R. fund was tracked by the Pentagon budget office, and when the bonds came due on 9/11, I&#39;m sure they were quite perplexed, but then an airplane crashed directly into the budget analysts office, killing almost everyone who worked there. </p>

I just want to know what time truthers think the plane got hijacked, when it hit the buildings and when the towers fell. I did invite people to share, but that was not the most important thing.</p>

<p>As for The H.A.M.M.E.R.S its ok to bring attention to it, i just though that since he took the time to post it he would also take the time to give some sources that i could check out. There are a lot of conspiracy theories and variations, but for obvious reasons. As much as i would like to be a pro at this i have to do the best with what i have the time and energy to figure some stuff out. </p>

<p>If you give a suggestion for someone to google it you are inviting them to look for hours until they reach a conclusion.

<p>You can literally look this up on wikipedia. No one is disputing the fact the planes were hijacked or when the towers fell. The more important questions are the physics related to the planes impacting the buildings, and the physics of how the buildings fell. And building 7. Those are the important questions.</p>

<p>I agree with this, but if you ask someone questions about the nature of the universe for example, thats not something that is going to be summed up in one paragraph. Same concept with 9/11.</p>

<p>We can give you specific answers, but when you ask more specific questions we are going to point you to websites or ask you to google it yourself. I personally will point you to websites, the other commentator told you to google it.</p>

<p>I guess my point is, we can give you specific websites, but something of this nature requires a lot more than just looking at one website. Because one website can make claims, then &quot;debunking sites&quot; make counter claims, and then &quot;debunking debunker&quot; sites debunk the supposed debunk...</p>

<p>Here is a good resource to start with, as I linked in another comment. </p>

<p>You might think going to school, taking tests and getting good grades makes you educated. Hell I did, I also read the Economist! I could talk to anybody at pretty much any event about anything from ancient civilizations to current events to how to existentially contemplate my navel. </p>

<p>Then, because I was so smart of course, I started listening to people like Chomsky and Gatto. Respected men in academia with lots of initials and book credits after their names. But not just passively listening, really listening. To their words. That lead me to the realization that many words did not mean what I thought they meant. The horror!!! Then I started to realize that many events, events I was watching in real time, were not happening like I was told they were. </p>

<p>Trust me on this, the more mainstream the site, the less you are getting to the core. Everything is biased, including what I am writing, but some things are planned out in advance with an agenda, the thing you are watching is a carefully contrived step in a long process to make you perceive or behave in a certain way. </p>

<p>I will not engage in a debate with you. If you are looking for a mentor to start your journey I am not that person. A wise man once said we come into this world alone and we leave it alone. </p>

<p>If you want to learn this is a great place to do it. If you want to show is all how you can repeat what you current events teacher or CNN is reporting let me save you the trouble, we have all heard it. </p>

<p>Good luck. </p>

<p>I genuinely believe that skepticism(belief for that which there is evidence) comes from being vigilant and trying to understand things. From what i have gathered its mostly just people poking holes in the original story, then having ideas of whole organizations instead of trying to first try to put together the possibility of it happening. Also you have to admit there is a legit appeal to being a conspiracy theorist. And it can also be a fad and attractive to those who believe they know better then others. </p>

<p>There are legit people who claim to be a conspiracy theorist who are not like you and me. They watch the building fall, think to themselves that the tower could not fall that way and then their opinion is formed for the rest of their lives. </p>

<p>Now obviously due to blind spots people have we cant be right about every subject. But to be correct more times then not i think actually the general media, majority of scientist etc. are the safer options. </p>

<p>The most ridiculous conspiracy theories has to be anti-vax, global warming conspiracy theories and denial of evolution as some sort of &quot;naturalist propaganda&quot;. Just because the majority of scientist, from all over the world, with a universal understanding, who write peer reviewed papers, facts, scientific theories, can test it etc. </p>

<p>And there is a wonderful amount of evidence in science, and a lot of people who still doubt it. Because it conflicts with their views or because they don&#39;t genuinely take the time to study it. How many flat earthers have tried to read about it or taken the time to understand that its round. How many evolution deniers have you known that asked for transitional fossils then never take the time to look it up when people say there is.  </p>

<p>So you might be saying. Well you FuJuM8 have not done enough googling and you obviously also have yet to believe in it. And to this i can say yes, i am a skeptic. Which means i have an open mind. But i try my best to not get into fads, and not change opinions too quick or without scrutiny. </p>

<p>Im saying a lot of people do take it as a fad. You cant deny that some people make the same conclusions you do without the same info you have. That is why my friend believes 9/11 is an inside job while thinking that &quot;the fires could not have spread over 20 minutes&quot;. Not knowing it was North tower at 102 minutes and south at a bit less then an hour. This doesn&#39;t mean you are a typical fad guy. </p>

<p>People who deny evolution would think they are informed, but so much talent, intelligence and critical thinking can truly be lost if you lack the proper perspective. </p>

<p>Im not saying im not open to the idea, im saying even if it turns out there is evidence for it im not there yet. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>when exactly did the planes get captured and when did they hit the towers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see how this is relevant to the more pressing points, but I&#39;l play along.</p>

<p>Planes were captured either by actual hijackers, or were gassed and diverted from their original fight plan, and replaced (more likely). There have been numerous documentaries by pilots for 9/11 truth about the fact that the supposed planes rammed into the towers could not have moved as fast as they did, thus suggesting the planes were switched. The fact that the planes flew through radar blind spots supports this theory.</p>

<p>Obviously the planes hit the towers...when you see them hit the towers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do most truthers have a rough idea of when they think the controlled demolition went off?</p>

<p>You&#39;re really new to this aren&#39;t you? The &quot;controlled demolition&quot; went off when the buildings came down...</p>

<p>Your average US citizen lost out on a lot, which of course doesn&#39;t matter. The rich gained a TON of money from contracts, and of course Israel gained a lot from having saddam out of the way.</p>

<p>Well, if you have yet to see evidence for 9/11 being a coverup, you haven&#39;t been looking. </p>

<p>Here is a great place to start on the key points of why the official story is impossible, basic physics:</p>

<p>I have a friend who claims the buildings fell after 25 minutes after being hit. So i went into conspiratard and actualconspiracies. Checked wikipedia. Now im checking here. I like to know what people think so i can get perspective, but in this case im trying to investigate the fall of the towers first. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I assume that since yo did not specify a certain time that you agree with what wikipedia says about the time it hit and time towers fell down? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re really new to this aren&#39;t you? The &quot;controlled demolition&quot; went off when the buildings came down...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Im asking for the time m8. 14:00? 8:00? You must have some rough idea. In this case im also assuming you are on page with wiki.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re obviously just making things up, I&#39;ve heard a lot of crazy stuff but I&#39;ve never heard that one.</p>

<p>Obviously this is just a hyperbolic joke. In short this just means im obviously not going to believe CIA made a laser that actually took down the twin towers.</p>
