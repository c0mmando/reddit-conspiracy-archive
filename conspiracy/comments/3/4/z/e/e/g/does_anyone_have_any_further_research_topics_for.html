       I've been interested in mkultra for a while now but am stuck for where to go next. Would anyone be able to link me to any interesting blogs on the subject? Or else provide some starting points for me to delve into?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm particularly interested in the idea of a 'monarch' program and have read much on the idea of celebrity mkultra victims. The laurel canyon stories are also very interesting to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any help would be much appreciated!

       Well I have read the books of all the major whistleblowers. I've read bits and bobs about super soldiers and psychic spies etc. I feel I've read so many things which link in to the subject but I don't have a good overall perspective. It's hard to say how far I've gone when I don't know how far it goes.

       Great point. I only ask because this question comes up once in awhile and it's a filter question to allow me to figure out whose serious and who's just fucking around (this is by far the most, if not one of the grossest things America was involved with).
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's just take a step back and gather some perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did it start?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who was involved? (doesn't have to be exhaustive)
      </p>
      <p>
       How do we know what we know? (I only ask because it's fun to compare these kindsof disclosures to the Snowden silliness).
      </p>
      <p>
       What was Naomi? Monarch? What were the differences?
      </p>
      <p>
       Were drugs used? If so, which ones? Where did they come from?
      </p>
      <p>
       Was there any oversight? Was the American medical establishment involved or complicit?
      </p>
      <p>
       When did it stop? (allegedly, of course).
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any evidence that it could still be going, or information gathered from the experiments still being used today?
      </p>
      <p>
       Answering these will give us both some perspective and see where we need to go next (and hopefully pique some lurker eyebrows, of course).

       OK, I'll try and answer these off the top of my head
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        How did it start?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       With project paperclip - the secret bringing of Nazi German scientists to America at the end of WW2 - they were mostly placed in high-ranking medical and educational institutions under new identities where they continued their experiments.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Who was involved?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There is a wide variety of people who we know were involved. The CIA, special operations branches of the army, the doctors and scientists in the institutions. We know they conducted experiments on the public, mostly unknowingly, and we also have information about certain 'volunteers', for instance Leonard Cohen was a willing mkultra volunteer.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        How do we know what we know?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There were some FOIA requests which got certain documents released in the late 70's, and later Clinton publicly apologized for the mkultra experiments.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What was Naomi? Monarch? What were the differences?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I remember reading about mknaomi when I first got into all of this, was is a biological warfare program? And I was always under the impression that not a lot of concrete info was out about project monarch?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Were drugs used? If so, which ones? Where did they come from?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I mostly hear about LSD being used, I assume acquired from government labs. I also assume many other drugs were used.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       Yes. Medical institutions, pharmaceutical companies.

      <blockquote>
       <p>

       Early to mid 70's, allegedly!

      <p>
       Absolutely. The behavior of James Holmes, perhaps Adam Lanza, celebrities such as Britney Spears and her breakdown, Anna Nicole Smith... Then there's the wider mass mind control that seem to be so rampant right now. The Boston bombings to me is an example of mass mind control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry this was really rushed and now in much depth, I'm just heading off to work this morning! Any tips on where to go next would help me greatly!

       I really don't know where you need to go next, the last thing I usually tell people is to consider the implications of this stuff 40 years after they said it was done... And how it could possible be still going on/affecting our lives today.

       Thanks for the response anyways. Yeah I find myself seeing things in the media that could be explained by modern day mkultra. Did you ever see that bbc documentary about these two swedish twins who were jumping under lorries on a UK motorway? They have footage of these girls getting run over by cars and using brute strength to escape the policemen/women and bystanders to chuck themselves into the road again. Its very interesting if you know anything about super soldiers.

       Hiya. Thanks for the response, Vigilant Citizen is one of my favourite sites, I've read everything on there. I guess I'm wondering what the next step from there is. I also frequently read theilluminatiwather blog - its got a lot of info on occult symbolism and celebrity. The occult/esoteric is also something I'd like to know more on.

       I frequently follow VC too, ever since the website launched in 2009 (?). I'll also check out the website you mentioned. There's quite a few tumblr blogs out there who discuss these topics so maybe you should search around there a bit?

       It's pretty much all the public government documents pertaining to the program.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember after reading it, I became convinced that the woman who shot Andy Warhol was in an MK Ultra experiment. She was completely sane, snapped the same year she started going to graduate school. That graduate school was oriented around psychology if I remember right. That's all I could glean from the Internet. Not really proof, but suggestive. I don't think anyone else made the connection yet, so you can have it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other MK Ultra subjects? Unabomber, Ken Kesey for certain. I haven't found any evidence but Charles Manson seems to fit the MK Ultra mold. Sirhan Sirhan too, but I haven't researched it. Oswald, I don't think so, but then he was relatively sane in comparison to the others.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend you read through the documents and take notes on the timeline. It's basically MK Ultra experiments at various colleges throughout the country. The experimenter is usually just one guy. Once you've got all the timelines and schools and programs down, you might want to call up the colleges and try to talk to people or get records from them. Don't mention MK Ultra. The researchers probably wrote up their results and got them published somewhere. You can check out the Science Journals of the era. Any decent college research libraries should have them. You might want to get a PubMed membership. If all the results from the experiments are on PubMed, man you're in luck. That would be easy. Researching the shit out of the researchers might get you some interesting new information. Maybe call up their families.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you start working on this, I'd be very interested. Laurel Canyon and MK Ultra are right up my alley.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll tell you right now about Laurel Canyon, however, that I think it's a dead end. I've read so much on it and got basically nothing. I think there was a lot of activity around that area during the 60s/70s just because it was so popular during that time. The area gentrified and today is rather well-to-do, and thusly boring. I doubt there's any modern day equivalent because the baby boom was just that crazy in terms of sheer numbers. Today, Laurel Canyon is like Beverly Hills light. Back then it was probably like hippie paradise.

       From what I can gather, this base was built to next to Hollywood, and in a rather remote, private location, in order to make propaganda films. Proximity to Hollywood allowed them to use Hollywood talent.  Walt Disney was very right wing and so is rumored to have contributed to many projects.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the other studios are down in the flat part of Hollywood. If you wanted a more private location, Laurel Canyon is it. No other place to put it. Is there more to the Laurel Canyon base than they made propaganda films? I haven't run across anything. The rehab thing, well, it's one of the most lucrative cons going. There's rehab facilities everywhere. The base has gone through private hands for many decades I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to pull together some sort of conspiracy theory about Laurel Canyon, this would be the best you could do, IMO:
      </p>
      <p>
       During the LSD test era, there was a dream to control the population with mass doping. The dream probably originated with the Nazis brought over from Operation Paperclip.
      </p>
      <p>
       MK Ultra was more concerned with finding military uses for drugs and creating Manchurian Candidates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Laurel Canyon was the center of the mass doping test. Children of military personnel were recruited for the tests. Why them? I really can't figure out a reason. Maybe the parents were complicit? But what parent would allow that? Maybe the parents were lied to?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also recruited were Hollywood celebrities who would later go on to make drug cinema.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only problem with all this is that there is absolutely no evidence. It's all fantasy. It wouldn't be MK Ultra type experimentation either. It would have to be some other program. I doubt it would be air force. It would be CIA or something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main reason I doubt anything really weird happened in LC is because no one has said anything strange. No odd behavior. No strange stories. If they were doing some sort of mass experimentation, you'd think one person would've come forward by now and spilled the beans. I suppose you could argue they were brainwashed somehow, but it seems really unlikely to me that so many people were perfectly brainwashed. If you read about MK Ultra, for instance, there were many failed experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
       It might be helpful to find out what happened to all the Operation Paperclip people and account for them.

       Yes, I've read all that stuff. I still don't find anything unusual. Wish I did. I like a good (true) conspiracy or government secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       About the mass doping. This is the only theory I've been able to come up with as concerns a lot of these 60s drugs conspiracies. I have looked high and low for some proof that anyone during that era even floated the idea. I have found zilch. You don't even find anything in the MK Ultra documents. (If you look through them and find something, I'd be interested.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't even found any talk of mass doping with the Nazis or the Soviets.

      <p>
       Lots of people in LA work in the industry. If Crosby grew up here, it's not unusual. Again, if there was some sort of experiment going on with the children of military and/or civilians who were attached to the base, I don't see the logic of it. Would you willingly subject your kids to some weird government experiment? If you were bamboozled, wouldn't you mention it years later? Even in passing? "Oh yeah, when I was a kid I had these treatments for my condition at the base. It made me feel lots better." There's nothing like that anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's helpful to mention LSD was a major fad at the time. It was legal and you could get it through the mail from ads at the back of comic books.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sunset Strip was also a fad. It was akin to Haight Ashbury in San Francisco. Kids flocked there from all over the world. Laurel Canyon at the time was cheap and a dump and in the woods. Perfect for LSD dropping hippies. If you know the area, LC is practically the woods and it's right next door to the strip.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone in the Nazi government or US government had seriously considered mass doping the population for some reason, I have never encountered the literature. I wish I had found some shred of evidence because it doesn't even seem that far fetched. Look at fluoride. There's a lot of mass doping, mass mind control conspiracies around fluoride. Problem is, there's absolutely no evidence. As far as I can tell, fluoride is dumped into drinking water because it's a problematic waste of aluminum manufacturing. It's so toxic, that dumping it into a large body of water is the only way to get rid of it without destroying the ecosystem. The fluoride industry was pivotal in finding research for benefits to people's consumption. The research isn't even compelling, but it was enough. I guess they save lots of money by dumping it into drinking water.

       Another problem with the LSD mass doping theory is why would the government make LSD illegal if they wanted to dope everyone with it? You could say there were competing factions, but I'm more of the opinion that no one ever even considered mass doping with LSD.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all a long-winded way of saying that I don't see anything suspicious about LC. People die. It's a large area. It was a hippie hangout in the 60s. Some have even said hippies were invented there, which I believe, frankly.

       Ok I wrote all that and then googled mass doping.

       So yeah, there is at least one mass doping that the US government/Sandoz labs did.
      </p>

       Then I read this stuff:

       So the mass doping was part of experiments to weaponize LSD and possibly other drugs. Sandoz would make big bucks if they could find a way to weaponize LSD. The US spooks were always looking for better weapons. The air force was interested because they could drop the drug out of planes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, so here's a possible LC narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people consider this group to be the first real hippies:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freak_scene">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freak_scene
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       A youth scene started to develop around the early 60s on the strip. The Freaks and the music drew alienated boomer kids to the area. Is it possible that some spooks, Sandoz people, thought the scene was the perfect place for mass-doping experiments? The Laurel Canyon Air Force base is right there. Easy access to the strip.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible that some spooks pumped LSD into nightclubs during concerts? Was the Air Force getting LSD into those kids in that scene?
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see why an LSD weapon would be popular with the Air Force. You spray a city with LSD from planes and then the military simply walks in and captures everyone with no fighting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, so here's something weird. It's an interview with Szou.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://gnosticmedia.podomatic.com/entry/2013-10-28T00_13_44-07_00">
        http://gnosticmedia.podomatic.com/entry/2013-10-28T00_13_44-07_00
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       She claims to have never done LSD. I think that this supports my hypothesis. The Air Force did LSD experiments on hippie kids because they probably thought they were expendable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, this guy takes all this pretty far:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.gnosticmedia.com/manufacturing-the-deadhead-a-product-of-social-engineering-by-joe-atwill-and-jan-irvin/">
        http://www.gnosticmedia.com/manufacturing-the-deadhead-a-product-of-social-engineering-by-joe-atwill-and-jan-irvin/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       My opinion is that it's seeing stuff that's just not there. All the military connections are just coincidences because at that time, lots of people were in the military. WWII and Vietnam created huge demand for personnel.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the interview with Szou puts all the crazy ideas to rest. The culture was going to go where it was going to go. The spooks got on that train and rode it. There is absolutely no evidence that anyone was trying any kind of mass mind control. Not even Bernays. If you read Propaganda, Bernays isn't trying to brainwash, he's trying to inform and guide the masses to the correct conclusions. Bernays' philosophy isn't about lying. It's about telling the truth and convincing the masses that the truth is true. It's also about stability. The hypothesis presented in the last post are all about destabilization which makes no sense because why would the spooks want destabilization? It's ridiculous. The spooks are always looking for domestic tranquility and conformity.

       LSD is very powerful, but recently BZ (3-Quinuclidinyl Benzilate) has been showing up in various articles I've encountered on the subject.

       Look into who supplied Charles Manson with psychedelics (Ronald Stark) .

       IMHO - LSD/Psilocybin/Peyote/DMT do not really lend themselves to mind control, as other drugs psychoactive may.

       I think the one's in control seek an altered brain wave state which is conscious, but extremely suggestable.

       Research brain wave states, &amp; how these different states are induced.
