<p>I would imagine so I&#39;ve only read about DMT but essentially it&#39;s supposed to be a legitimate out of body experience. (Once again, I&#39;m no expert so don&#39;t take this as the official story)</p>

<p>But the way I understood it, <em>(I got my info from a guy who had the same bus route as me, I never knew his name but he was attempting to get this info published I don&#39;t know what his sources were but it sounded cool)</em> But there are people who believe it was used to separate the soul from the body to transcend our dimension , and then there are others who believed that it was used to implant another soul inside your body or something like that for immortality purposes. It was over a year ago since I finally got a car but it was really interesting stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>honestly, not really.</p>

<p>what sparked my whole interest in the pyramids and spirituality in general was my first read through of the Emerald Tablets.</p>

<p>i know a LOT of people will not take the ETs seriously because the guy who transcribed it was a used as a medium to translate it. maybe, maybe not, but horysheet does it have information to share with you. 
and the thing is, you could read it a dozen times, and each time you could pull a slightly or completely different meaning from it.</p>

<p>i would recommend reading it for yourself, but take a moment beforehand to take a couple deep breaths and, even if just for the time you are reading it, be open to its writings. No need to accept them as fact, but be open to the possibility of it all.</p>

<p>I cannot personally tell you what you might learn, but maybe, itll pique your interest in the ancient and youll consider that at one time Humanity had an actual fall from grace leaving us to attempt the climb back up without the proper (mostly spiritual) tools. ((like love, not the romantic, rather the realization that we are all part of one &#39;thing&#39; and we are in it together))</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion is that the exact usage of the pyramids may be open to discussion but the construction, in no way, involved ancient aliens or lost high technology.  Anyone who subscribes to these theories is selling all of humanity short.</p>

<p>Not to mention the countless bits of evidence that show the Egyptians were brilliant architects and engineers. We have tools, ropes of all sizes, wooden sleds, barges, illustrations of construction techniques and entire worker &quot;cities&quot; full of more evidence.  </p>

<p>Personally, I find the factual reality to be far more impressive and interesting than some intellectually dishonest ancient aliens theory.  Most of those theories are based on either ignorance or outright dishonesty.</p>

<p>For example, Puma Punku (sp?) is not made from diorite and, even if it was, the Egyptians were doing far more impressive things with the same material centuries earlier.</p>

<p>As for the pyramids construction technique? I&#39;m a big fan of Hardin&#39;s theory.</p>

<p>The were certainly used for some symbolic and ceremonial purpose. Egypt has often been described as the most &quot;magical&quot; culture and nearly everything had a symbolic meaning.  Egyptian theology has influenced a variety of subsequent religious beliefs from Christianity to Hermeticism.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to remember that the pyramids were gleaming white with gold tops. I&#39;d assume they had something to do with solar worship, possibly related to Horus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thank you on the selling us short part.</p>

<p>personally i like Khem&#39;s/Egypt&#39;s &#39;origin&#39; story of a highly advanced &#39;race&#39; of humans who needed to flee their home due to some calamity, (maybe a meteor coming down and hitting an glacial ice sheet causing a pretty big melt) setting up shop and bringing on tech that to us seems bs. (fun stuff like: flying ships, levitating shit-ton stones, laser-level levels, the vitrification of <del>shit</del> stuff, and electricity)</p>

<p>the most interesting part in all of this is the power-plant idea people have. it is probable, as there is a limestone aquifer located underneath the great pyramid, [personally i dont fully understand how it all works but its very] similar to Tesla&#39;s design for Wardenclyff tower</p>

<p>as for the ceremonial purpose, absolutely. (just to mention, no mummys or bodies were ever found in the pyramids) If you were to, say, fast for 3 days, meditate and &#39;align&#39; yourself, then go lay down in the coffer (im sure it was at a specific time, or star alignment), and blast off to somewhere ethereal, maybe.</p>

<p>but at the end of the day, we dont really know, but its marvelous that we can have so many truths/falsities and be the ones to judge for ourselves whats what allowing us to question it, and ultimately uncover the actual truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for actually replying instead of just downvoting me!</p>

<p>I personally have a few problems with many of the alternative pyramid theories people put out and they are honestly some pretty simple problems.  You mentioned the power plant idea but the problem I have with that is the fact that only the largest pyramid has that type of interior structure.  The chambers in the smaller pyramids are actually below the pyramid itself so it was not a universal design for every pyramid.  In addition to this, I feel Hardin&#39;s theory gives a much better explanation for the interior structure of the largest pyramid.</p>

<p>The other problems I have with many of the alternative theories are just as simple.  The claim that the Egyptians couldn&#39;t have moved the massive stones is simply a dishonest claim.  We have illustrations, made by the Egyptians, showing how they moved things that were significantly larger using a system of wooden sleds, ropes, and lubricant.  The &quot;wooden rollers&quot; idea sounds hard to believe because it is completely wrong and is used as a dishonest strawman by these alternative theorists.  In addition to this, we have some of the sleds and they contain multiple rigging holes for different sized rope.  We also have samples of the ropes in many different sizes.</p>

<p>The other problem with the &quot;How did they move it?&quot; question is that Rome really took a liking to Egyptian Obelisks and started stealing them.  The Romans had no trouble shipping these massive, solid stone structures half way around the ancient world yet no one is saying that Aliens built Rome.</p>

<p>Other problems I have include the fact that theories such as The Orion Correlation Theory is provably wrong, that most &quot;Alternative Archaeologists&quot; can&#39;t even read hieroglyphs, and the accepted fact that history needs to be looked at in context.  Doing this would show, for example, the evolution of burial structures from mustaba to pyramid or the fact that the sphinx was a fairly common motif in other cultures as well.</p>

<p>The truth about Ancient Egypt, or really all of our ancient history, is that the world was far more dynamic, connected, and inventive than people want to give it credit for.</p>

<p>Now, having said all that and speaking as someone who has studied the occult as seriously as he has studied history, I do believe there was a lot more to the Egyptian magical tradition than even mainstream archeology is willing to admit.  It was extremely influential to any culture that came in contact with it.  The Greeks, for example, fully accepted Egyptian religious beliefs and even began mummifying their dead in similar ways during the Ptolemaic period.  The combination of the Egyptian god Thoth and the Greek god Hermes gave us the foundation for the Hermetic tradition, something which continued on through the medieval Renaissance and gave rise to things such as Alchemy.</p>

<p>There are also undeniable parallels between things such as the statues of Isis and Horus and the statues of Jesus and Mary and these can be seen in person at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>

<p>The blending of different beliefs and cultures was common in the ancient world.  One great example is the fact that there were no physical representations of the Buddha until Alexander made his way to India.  The Indian people really liked Greek sculpture and begin creating their own versions for their own beliefs.  Hercules was actually adopted into this tradition and still exists today as a guardian of many temples, although he has a distinctly different appearance.  All of this is commonly accepted.</p>

<p>My personal belief is that the Egyptians definitely had something that we don&#39;t know about today but I don&#39;t believe it was technological as much as it was spiritual and magical.</p>

<p>I&#39;m fully open to accepting something that is different from what we currently believe but only when there is undeniable and verifiable evidence to support the claim.  Currently most alternative claims come from people who don&#39;t read hieroglyphics, are not educated in the culture of Ancient Egypt, ignore all historical context, and completely avoid the reality that the ancient world was highly connected and that there were many other cultures active at the same time, such as the Hittites who were a major pain in the butt to Egypt.  Sometimes these people are being intentionally dishonest such as referencing the &quot;People of the Sea&quot; as Atlanteans when the sea people were 9 distinctly different cultures that were active against Egypt at different times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is believed the pyramid was built as a tomb for Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu (often Hellenicised as &quot;Cheops&quot;) and was constructed over a 20-year period. Khufu&#39;s vizier, Hemon, or Hemiunu, is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid. It is thought that, at construction, the Great Pyramid was originally 280 Egyptian cubits tall (146.5 metres (480.6 ft)), but with erosion and absence of its pyramidion, its present height is 138.8 metres (455.4 ft). Each base side was 440 cubits, 230.4 metres (755.9 ft) long. The mass of the pyramid is estimated at 5.9 million tonnes. The volume, including an internal hillock, is roughly 2,500,000 cubic metres (88,000,000 cu ft). Based on these estimates, building the pyramid in 20 years would involve installing approximately 800 tonnes of stone every day. Additionally, since it consists of an estimated 2.3 million blocks, completing the building in 20 years would involve moving an average of more than 12 of the blocks into place each hour, day and night. The first precision measurements of the pyramid were made by Egyptologist Sir Flinders Petrie in 1880–82 and published as The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh. Almost all reports are based on his measurements. Many of the casing stones and inner chamber blocks of the Great Pyramid fit together with extremely high precision. Based on measurements taken on the north eastern casing stones, the mean opening of the joints is only 0.5 millimetres wide (1/50th of an inch).</p>

<p>This is simply not true, but it is what&#39;s commonly accepted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That the Egyptians rolled stones on tree&#39;s from across the nile and stacked them on top of each other with slaves. That they used stones to cut other stones and pulley systems to raise up the stones, some infer a big ramp type structure to get the stones up.. but it was all looted and the gold was taken off, and the interior of the &#39;tomb&#39; was emptied of any ornaments over the centuries</p>

<p>Edit. No idea why the downvotes. Op asked for the &#39;common&#39; explanation. That&#39;s it. It&#39;s not my opinion ffs</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the mainstream explanation doesn&#39;t involve slaves. They were generally free and skilled workers. Their camps and tools can be found in the surrounding area.</p>

<p>Wood was very rare and sacred in Egypt but I just would like to add that there is a theory that instead of rollers they used reusable wooden sleds.</p>
