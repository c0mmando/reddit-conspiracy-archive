       I speak Spanish occasionally and when I do I notice a spike of ads that are in Spanish. At first I was thrown off by it, thought it was a fluke, but then realized it was my phone listening to me.

       For a period of time I had an online job doing transcription. Basically people would upload an audio or video file and you'd just type what they were saying.I had to sign agreements to the effect that I can't say a whole lot, but there are a few memories that stand out.
      </p>
      <p>
       One was a company that develops apps. OK? The speaker that day was talking on the topic of "How to use data collection to get users to
       <em>
        do what you want
       </em>
       " To make a long story short, the guy explained how you can divide all the users into archetypal groups, called profiles. On one end of the spectrum you have the "always uses the app all the time exactly as we want them to", and on the other end "used it once, maybe checks in every now and then, but doesn't really participate" profile.
      </p>
      <p>
       His presentation then became about how to manipulate what each profile type sees in order to get all the different types to use the apps as they desired. It makes logical sense to me intellectually, but it's still fucked up. It's like, "Yeah, just because you can do something, doesn't mean you should..."

       Like I said, to do the job, I had to sign papers that prevent me from providing what you're asking for. So no. I tried to say all of that in a way that would hopefully show people I wasn't just pulling it out of my ass, but no, I don't have "proof"

       I also had an interesting time transcribing a recording from the Scotland Yard Juvenile task force. Think about that one for a second.

       Hypothesis is that you'll start getting Spanish ads due to
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       monitoring your microphone. I suspect Facebook, Google, and/or Siri.

       I honestly don't know. Just note any differences. I'm in Costa Rica, so I get Spanish banner ads all the time anyhow -- probably based on my IP address. (I doubt my Spanish is intelligible to Siri &amp; crew.)

       No. My hypothesis is that if you let your phone or tablet's microphone hear a bunch of Spanish (or French or Chinese or whatever), you'll get banner ads in that language.

       My guess it's to check if the apps that have access to the microphone are accessing the microphone and adjusting their ads to what they hear (the language probably won't change, as that it set by the phone language).

       I see a lot of people talking about "someone listening in on the other side". This is virtually impossible. What the algorithm can do, though, is store and prioritize audio snippets based on content-matter. Then, this "high importance" subset can be analyzed for things like terrorism, general plotting of illegal activity, etc. by actual humans.

       That's actually the ideal situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But due to understaffing and underfunding (and general human laziness) We don't actually listen in to most of these audio snippets. Instead we develop software that estimates the "threat level" of individual subjects. This software quantifies subjects in profiles and assign red flags to subjects, that the software percieves to engage in specific behavioral patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
       An almost complete threat analysis of a subject can arrive at a field agent or platoon leaders desk without any human beings being directly involved in said analysis.

       ...or at least that's how I imagine it is going - or will go, very soon. As you said it is incredible amounts of data that has to be analysed.

       EDIT: Other subject that I don't really know anything about. I feel we might over estimate statistics based methods when analyzing individual behavior. There are "good" results when using quantative methods (software) to figure out general human behavior, but I don't know, how good it is when it comes to determining whether or not an individual, or small group, will do something really terrible.

       This seems pretty relevant. I was updating my Google chrome app yesterday and decided to actually read the fine print. This is why they "need" access to your mic.

       Actually, HTML5 has an API for accessing the microphone (and webcam and speakers). Web browsers need a lot of access to your computer to support all these features. Now, if someone is abusing this or not is another story.

       Yeah I can completely understand why they need access to it, but I don't see why they need access "at anytime without your confirmation" unless it's being used for something they don't want to tell me.

       So it doesn't constantly bother users with permissions and break when a website's request for a permission times out. In its self, this idea is not bad, it just happens to have a very unpleasant side-effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some times I think these subtle things - like permissions - should have a 'beginner user level', an 'intermediate user level' and an 'experienced user level', but that would just add more bugs and cause more drama. I personally do side with the way Apple does it on the iPhone, but I don't believe there's anything inherently evil about the way Google does it on Android.

       I'm guessing Google (or whomever) builds an ad profile you on their end. So you're just not giving it additional input when you turn those things off.

       Or it's possible it totally ignores your settings. Hard to know with software switches.

       I was reading something to day it was really interesting and it was talking how the certain data centers around the nation and other small database that deal with ads or a phone company that they have a way that they "might" be able to harmlessly listen in to what we talk about and what we have around us but do not ask for the permission for this audio but the article goes on to more stuff wish I could find it again.

       Fun note. I have noticed my phone has been acting like I held down the button to talk to Siri when I haven't. And this makes it so it listens at random times.

       Keep in mind I have a iPhone 5 that's a couple years old but still. All I think about is if it's trying to do that purposely.

       And Apple products have pretty much been outed as the worst privacy invaders yet people continue to line up for the next Iphone. Snowden isn't that obscure in the MSM, is he? Perhaps they don't know? Maybe they just don't care, reasoning they have nothing to hide (since, obviously, they're not a terrorist...right?)

       Google wrapped up in the same sort of cahoots, what vestige exists outside the two in the smartphone world? With the knowledge that different manufactures have complied with the NSA in installing invasive microchips, not even rooting and discerning use of secure apps is any real promise.

       This is a setting on your phone. My boss has the same phone and it was happening to him. If your phone is plugged in, you can say "Hey Siri", and it responds. But sometimes it will respond for no apparent reason.

       Settings &gt; General &gt; Siri &gt; turn off Hey Siri. It's left on by default if I'm not mistaken.

       It's because it's always listening, waiting to hear that "Hey, Siri."
       <em>
        Ostensibly
       </em>
       , it throws out everything past its buffer...but there are ad networks that use this same sort of listen, grab a keyword, and remember it for future advertising (Nuance I think does this; they're pretty scary). Android does this, Kinect does this, I'd love to know what
       <em>
        doesn't
       </em>
       do this, it's pretty terrifying if you start to catalogue...

       Do you have Raise to Speak enabled? There's a setting where, if the accelerometer detects you've lifted the phone to your mouth, it'll invoke Siri. Might wanna check that one out, too, I think it's in the same spot.

       It's your computer, too, that's listening.  It's bad enough the government and its intelligence agencies are monitoing your speech and activities.  Now it's apparent corporations are doing it so they can target you.  You get emails for products and coupons in stores based upon what you spoke about in the "privacy" of your own home.

Legit as soon as 2 year verizon contract was up I started getting emails telling me to upgrade..new deals ect. I ignore them..start looking at sprint prices.. month goes by..phone apps start mysteriously crashing more often, phone randomly rebooting..slow data speeds ect.

       I find I get hacked the most often when visiting Jewish newspaper websites. They can be very annoying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several years ago I met a young woman in college who was running for a school office. She had terrific political talent, it was great to get to know her. One day she told me about how the police had come to her and showed her on her own computer how somebody had been secretly watching and recording her undressing with her own computer's camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect she was not hacked by hackers like they told her, I suspect the police did it themselves in order to intimidate a new political talent. I think it is what they do, but then I have a very suspicious mind.

       much more controlled than we realize. From the point-of-view of TPTB it probably looks like we're ants in an ant farm or something.

       i use older computers for this reason i have to plug cameras in each time. i used to skype with some guys for a while till one of them noticed on his board how many people were tuned in and it wasnt just the three of us....he has gone so far to say if you have skype or a podcast on blog talk you can not really ever disconnect from it. unless you re-start your system. couldnt verify that one but i wouldnt be surprised

       Thank you for this.  I had something very weird like this happen.  I started seeing ads for something very embarrassing I never googled or told anyone.  But I did say it outloud to myself.  The very next day a related item popped up as a facebook ad.  I was blown away.  It's a very specific weird item.  It should have never been a facebook ad, for sure.

       , page about NASA's Hubble telescope. I hadn't yet typed anything into the search bar either. I know it could be just a coincidence, but I mean it was the exact second after I hit submit that I decided to do the search and hit the I feel lucky button.

       Additional thought. .
      </p>
      <p>
       One idea to combat the spying that I think would be interesting to test would be if someone built an app that periodically sent out google searches, random facebook searches, saved random robot voice data on random subject..ect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially spoofing the marketers with random junk data sets that have a hard time correlating data into usable trends to shell back at you as targeted ads.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine:
      </p>
      <p>
       Bike, hola, 1, random gibberish, male, tampons, quantum,  texas, dance magic dance, ect.

       Interesting hypothesis, and I'm willing to try out your experiment, but I don't think it's going to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       While there MAY be (there very likely are) some popular apps using your microphone to grab content to advertize on, for the most part your language profile is going to be based on your settings and region.

       I just think microphone data is more likely to be used for affinity demographics than things like age/sex/language- which are easy to get in other ways.

       We'll see how it goes, though.  Interesting experiment.

       Yeah maybe. And that's how it "should" be, ethically. But I've read a few other threads that tend to confirm the microphone hypothesis. And this crowd... man if it's true, this crowd needs to know.

       Hold on- I'm not saying your microphone isn't listening to you and gathering data for advertisers.  I'm just saying that there are different segments that go into your marketing profile, and the prime determiner for your language is going to be your settings.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when a Spanish advertiser (especially in a region which primarily speaks english) goes to target their demos, they are going to generally specify spanish as a language setting.
      </p>
      <p>
       SO if I'm right, and microphone data is geared towards content (affinity demographics), you might end up being excluded from ads for the products mentioned in the spanish language commercials simply because your language settings don't indicate spanish as your primary language.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm suggesting is that IF the experiment works, you've proven something- but if it doesn't work, that doesn't mean that advertisers aren't using data picked up by your mic.  It could just an issue with how that demo information is prioritized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another similar experiment might be to pick a channel geared towards interests dissimilar from your own- but clearly the results might be harder to parse that your suggestion.

       Somebody make your phone listen to Oxygen Network 24x7 and see if you start getting ads for feminine hygiene products. Or if you're already an Oxygen Network fan, try using NASCAR TV (that's a thing, right?) and see if you get a bunch of Valvoline ads.

       So it doesn't constantly bother users with permissions and break when a website's request for a permission times out. In its self, this idea is not bad, it just happens to have a very unpleasant side-effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some times I think these subtle things - like permissions - should have a 'beginner user level', an 'intermediate user level' and an 'experienced user level', but that would just add more bugs and cause more drama. I personally do side with the way Apple does it on the iPhone, but I don't believe there's anything inherently evil about the way Google does it on Android.
