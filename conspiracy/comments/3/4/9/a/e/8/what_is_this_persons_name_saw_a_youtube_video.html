    <div class="md"><p>Are you sure this wasn&#39;t talking about <a href="http://www.budsas.org/ebud/whatbudbeliev/303.htm">Buddhism</a>?</p>

<p><em>The fire of hell in this world is hotter than that of the hell in the world-beyond. There is no fire equal to anger, lust or greed and ignorance. According to the Buddha, we are burning from eleven kinds of physical pain and mental agony: lust, hatred, illusion sickness, decay, death, worry, lamentation, pain(physical and mental), melancholy and grief. People can burn the entire world with some of these fires of mental discord. From a Buddhist point of view, the easiest way to define hell and heaven is that where ever there is more suffering, either in this world or any other plane, that place is a hell to those who suffer. And where there is more pleasure or happiness, either in this world or any other worldly existence, that place is a heaven to those who enjoy their worldly life in that particular place. However, as the human realm is a mixture of both pain and happiness, human beings experience both pain and happiness and will be able to realize the real nature of life. But in many other planes of existence inhabitants have less chance for this realization. In certain places there is more suffering than pleasure while in some other places there is more pleasure than suffering.</em> </p>

<p>TIL Earth = hell.  This actually makes the most sense.  The reason the world is so full of anger, violence, and suffering is because it was designed that way on purpose.  You can work your way up in this hell to higher income status, but you still experience suffering and pain.  If you are douche bag in life, you will get reincarnated in Ethiopia.  Why would God care some much about saving fucking <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/04/16/the-only-item-that-survived-the-lady-antebellum-bus-fire-was-hillary-scotts-bible/">Lady Antebellum&#39;s bible</a>, when a week later he does this:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its even deeper than this. Your body is a prison suit that you are trapped in, that eventually starts decaying, pain, suffering for you to experience and the virus is the ego within the body suit which creates a whole bunch of programs that make you believe a variety of illusions because it makes you believe that you are freely constructing these things.</p>

<p>Interesting.  Freely constructing things as in Neo in the matrix or that one&#39;s life is planned out by some divine design?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/gr/public/holo/">Does this follow the Holographic Principle or M-Theory?</a></p>

<p><em>In M-theory we are the shadows on the wall. The room is some larger, five-dimensional spacetime and our four-dimensional world is just the boundary of this larger space. If we try to move away from the wall, we are moving into an extra dimension of space - a fifth dimension. In fact, people have recently been trying to think of ways in which we might actually experimentally `probe&#39; this fifth dimension.</em></p>

<p>Reminds me of when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnURElCzGc0&amp;amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=153">Carl Sagan</a> showed how 2D objects cannot really see 3D objects because they can only perceive a small 2D slice of the an apple, per say.  Maybe this is what &quot;ghosts&quot; are or paranormal activity is.  We are perceiving a small slice of the 5th dimension or 5D is acting on our 3D world by moving objects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was different than just reading the artwork. He had these kind of overlays of the art.. like transparencies.. and it revealed some kind of information. I don&#39;t know if I believe what he was saying but I was curious how his work had progressed. But then again if he&#39;s not that well known maybe it was all bogus. </p>

<p>You know how when you can&#39;t remember something it kind of drives you nuts though? That I can&#39;t remember his name or find the video is doing that. haha </p>

<p>There was something to what he was talking about that intrigued me but I don&#39;t know if I remember exactly what it was because his talk was so long. He seemed to be a well known figure in the esoteric knowledge world though.</p>

<p>Interesting.  Freely constructing things as in Neo in the matrix or that one&#39;s life is planned out by some divine design?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/gr/public/holo/">Does this follow the Holographic Principle or M-Theory?</a></p>

<p><em>In M-theory we are the shadows on the wall. The room is some larger, five-dimensional spacetime and our four-dimensional world is just the boundary of this larger space. If we try to move away from the wall, we are moving into an extra dimension of space - a fifth dimension. In fact, people have recently been trying to think of ways in which we might actually experimentally `probe&#39; this fifth dimension.</em></p>

<p>Reminds me of when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnURElCzGc0&amp;amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=153">Carl Sagan</a> showed how 2D objects cannot really see 3D objects because they can only perceive a small 2D slice of the an apple, per say.  Maybe this is what &quot;ghosts&quot; are or paranormal activity is.  We are perceiving a small slice of the 5th dimension or 5D is acting on our 3D world by moving objects.</p>
