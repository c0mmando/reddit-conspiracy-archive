        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Looking at the recent Baltimore &quot;riots&quot; thread which has since been locked, the top comments are a perfect case study on the power of media narratives to divide and control the general population. It also demonstrates the inability of the general population to think structurally. The same Reddit which frequently types away angrily at the abuses of police power, then immediately does a 180 when those who receive the blunt of those abuses (mainly the Otherized black population of the US) react in a way they don&#39;t like. </p>

<p>The average Redditor simply cannot understand that the legacy of US imperialism, internal police occupation of black communities, the systematic exploitation of those communities by businesses owned by interests who are not theirs, the total erasure of black liberation organizations by COINTELPRO, the ongoing social and economic exclusion of black communities from the rest of society, the constant bombardment of media narratives used to demonize and otherize black people... all of this the average Redditor cannot connect to what is happening in Baltimore and instead the gut knee-jerk reaction is to call for the National Guard. </p>

<p>I was recently looking over the documents leaked from GCHQ on the Intercept about their tactics used to disrupt groups online. One slide highlighted social cleavages as a fracture point that pulls groups apart. It is pathetically easy for controlled media narratives to take advantage of this reality.</p>

<p>They also listed a number of &quot;Gambits for Deception&quot; including: exploit prior beliefs, present story fragments, the big move covers the little, and the target looks where you look. Think of all the ways these gambits can and are being used in the current situation.</p>

<p>Edit: Before anyone gets me confused, no I am not condoning violence, simply pointing out the inability of most people to understand the <em>objective</em> conditions that created this <em>subjective</em> acting-out that we see now in Baltimore and how the power structure will exploit that lack of understanding to their benefit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The son of the Baltimore Orioles owner put out a statement which I believe summarizes the riots in Baltimore pretty well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brett, speaking only for myself, I agree with your point that the principle of peaceful, non-violent protest and the observance of the rule of law is of utmost importance in any society. MLK, Gandhi, Mandela and all great opposition leaders throughout history have always preached this precept. Further, it is critical that in any democracy, investigation must be completed and due process must be honored before any government or police members are judged responsible.</p>

<p>That said, my greater source of personal concern, outrage and sympathy beyond this particular case is focused neither upon one night’s property damage nor upon the acts, but is focused rather upon the past four-decade period during which an American political elite have shipped middle class and working class jobs away from Baltimore and cities and towns around the U.S. to third-world dictatorships like China and others, plunged tens of millions of good, hard-working Americans into economic devastation, and then followed that action around the nation by diminishing every American’s civil rights protections in order to control an unfairly impoverished population living under an ever-declining standard of living and suffering at the butt end of an ever-more militarized and aggressive surveillance state.</p>

<p>The innocent working families of all backgrounds whose lives and dreams have been cut short by excessive violence, surveillance, and other abuses of the Bill of Rights by government pay the true price, and ultimate price, and one that far exceeds the importances of any kids’ game played tonight, or ever, at Camden Yards. We need to keep in mind people are suffering and dying around the U.S., and while we are thankful no one was injured at Camden Yards, there is a far bigger picture for poor Americans in Baltimore and everywhere who don’t have jobs and are losing economic civil and legal rights, and this makes inconvenience at a ballgame irrelevant in light of the needless suffering government is inflicting upon ordinary Americans. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s incredible how quickly Reddit can swing when aggressive emotions are involved...especially when that pertains to race.  The hivemind would have been all over threads calling out police abuses in this case (as they have been for others) but because black people have lashed out and fought back...the only waty they really can...it&#39;s all aggression towards the rioters.</p>

<p>I agree that there should be a peaceful movement toward ending police brutality and militarization but I feel like this lashing out of violence is a stage that&#39;s inevitable.  It&#39;s undesirable and doesn&#39;t solve problems but it&#39;s an absolutely inevitable part of the outcry that has to happen to solve this problem in the long term.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think when people&#39;s emotional buttons get pushed, especially those that have been there since childhood, they can turn on a dime.</p>

<p>My grandmother, for example, is a very sweet 80 year old Christian with osteoporosis and a bad heart.  If I told that woman I was an atheist she&#39;d go into a mad screaming fit, call me satan, and demand that I get out of her house. That idea of christianity beign good and the denial of that being evil is engrained in her and there is no logic to it.  There&#39;s no reasoning with that.</p>

<p>I think that a reasonable person, for the most part, can look at what&#39;s been happening with the police (especially concerning black people) and say...&quot;That&#39;s really fucked up.&quot; However, when black people lash out and point their anger in the wrong direction...as I think is inevitable in cases like this... then it&#39;s not just innocent people any more.  It&#39;s black people fitting a stereotype that many people still believe deep down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me too. Because those locally owned and operated businesses do carry their same interests.</p>

<p>You want to retaliate against those who your anger is directed at? Go right the fuck ahead. In this case, it would be the police. But these business owners, <em>who are a part of your community and have done absolutely nothing to you</em>? That&#39;s incredibly fucked up. Same in Ferguson- those business owners were what was keeping the area alive. An area without commerce becomes a ghost town, in essence. And many of the business owners in both places belonged to the &quot;black community&quot;. If you&#39;re going to pull some shit like that, at least do some research and don&#39;t fuck up the very people keeping your community alive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>After reading so many blatantly racist, pro - authoritarian comments, I honestly can&#39;t barely even handle this shit right now.  Reddit once again proves itself to consist as a majority of scared suburban white men, computer chair activists who have apparently never been in a crowd of larger than 50 people. </p>

<p>How brazen will the police have to be before the poor scared mam children on reddit can tolerate an actual riot? At this point I believe most of reddit would just love for police to shoot and kill all these protesters because they robbed a 7-11 or cut a fire hose.</p>

<p>I really think at a time like this that the slide towards fascism may honestly be too far gone to reverse. If people can&#39;t handle a little violence in a city wide protest against decades of systemic police racism and corruption, then I really can&#39;t see how we would ember throw of the shackles of totalitarianism in this nation. </p>
