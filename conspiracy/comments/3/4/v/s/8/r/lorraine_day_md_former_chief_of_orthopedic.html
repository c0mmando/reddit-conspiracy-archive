        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>edit:  trying to fix layout. I&#39;ve screwed up the numbering of items, but at least now you can read it.</p>

<p>By Lorraine Day, M.D. </p>

<p>My background:  I am an Orthopedic Trauma Surgeon.  For many years I was Chief of Orthopedic Surgery at San Francisco General Hospital, the only trauma hospital in San Francisco.  For 25 years, I took care of massive injuries from gang wars, explosions, severe motor vehicle crashes, survivors of attempted suicide from jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge, etc. </p>

<p>I am fully qualified to assess the supposed injuries at the total HOAX “bombing” that took place at the Boston Marathon.  And I am not the only one who is writing about this.  There are many others who also understand that it was a HOAX! </p>

<p>The documentation for what I have written below is contained in the links given at the end of this article.  Please read those articles and view those videos so you will have some facts – evidence – before you make up your own mind.  </p>

<p>Consider these facts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the pictures taken immediately after the blast, there is NO BLOOD on the ground.  That could never be.  The bomb blast instantaneously would have spread blood from the injured victims everywhere. </p></li>
<li><p>There were only about 10 “victims” at ground zero of the blast – and all of them are alive and do not appear to be even close to death.  Where are these other “200” people who were supposedly injured? </p></li>
<li><p>When “blood” does eventually appear on the sidewalk at ground zero – it clearly is some kind of paint – NOT blood.  The paint is bright orangish-red, obviously for the maximum frightening effect on the populace.  REAL BLOOD is dark maroon. </p></li>
<li><p>Notice in the initial pictures after the (smoke) bomb exploded, almost all of the “victims” are holding themselves up on one elbow, or they are sitting up.  No one is in severe pain, or really in any pain at all.  Severely injured people are not propping themselves up on one elbow.  They would have their head on the sidewalk.</p></li>
<li><p>Obviously, these crisis actors (See crisisactors.com) don’t want to put their head or the side of their face down on the dirty Boston sidewalk where everyone walks (and spits). </p></li>
<li><p>In one video, a man is seen clapping together two towels or other items, causing the crisis actors “victims” to be covered with soot – so they’ll look more like bombing victims. </p></li>
<li><p>One woman “victim” is seen in early photos (but after the “bombing” has taken place) with no blood at all on her white blouse.  However, later, she is taken off on a gurney with a lot of “blood” on her white blouse. </p></li>
<li><p>There are many “handlers” in the early pictures, positioning “victims” and assisting in the set-up of the HOAX scene.  You might think that they would be concerned about being seen by the by-standers, but when a “bomb” goes off, most people run for their life, allowing the Hoaxsters and Crisis actors to set up their HOAX scenes undisturbed.</p></li>
<li><p>There are no Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) at the scene, no ambulances, and no fire engines (after all, a supposed “bomb” went off – it would be mandatory for the fire department to respond).  Where are they?  The people “helping” the “victims” are also Crisis actors.  No emergency medical personnel are on the scene. </p></li>
<li><p>Certainly, wheel chairs may be available at various places along a Marathon route, and at the end of the race, but wheel chairs are never found on ambulances.  And wheelchairs are never used to transport severely injured victims.  When a victim has lost a lot of blood, whether from internal or external bleeding, he or she is always kept flat and transported on a gurney.  Otherwise the life of that victim is at severe risk.</p></li>
<li><p>The man with the supposedly blown off legs – with about sixteen inches of bone (tibia) sticking out of one leg – is taken away in a WHEELCHAIR!  That would NEVER happen!  If a person has both legs blown off, his blood loss would be so severe that if someone sat him up, he would lose consciousness (his heart could not pump enough blood to supply his brain when he was in the upright position) and he would die.  No ambulance company would ever take on that liability, nor would any bystander.  That man was a crisis actor who lost both of his legs in war some time ago while in the military. You will see in the documentation below.  There are many former military personnel, amputees from war injuries, that are now being used as crisis actors for “drills” as it was repeatedly announced over loudspeakers that this (Boston Bombing) was. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The “gory blown-off” leg was nothing but a prosthesis (made by “central casting”) made to look like an amputation caused by an explosion.  The prosthesis, however, is a very poor replica of a real amputated limb.  I have performed many amputations of both legs and arms and I have seen many hundreds of severely injured limbs from all sorts of horrendous accidents.  None of them ever look like that one.  But apparently it is good enough to fool the population (most of whom have never seen such injuries).  Unfortunately, the average American chooses not to spend any time investigating these events and chooses to believe the mainstream media propagandists.  </p>

<p>The injuries and blood spatter are so badly done, they are almost comical to a trained trauma surgeon such as myself. </p>

<p>Also, that man who supposedly lost both his legs in the “bombing” seemed to be in no pain, nor did he have blood all over him.  And 4 or 5 days later, when photographed in the hospital, he is giving a thumbs-up, happy-faced smile.  This is ludicrous  When a person loses even one limb, there is a “grieving” process that goes on for weeks, similar to the grieving response that would happen if a person lost a close loved one. And it’s usually months before one actually can face the situation and get on with his life. </p>

<p>One more thing: in the links below, there is proof that this man who supposedly lost both of his legs in the “bombing” was wheeled through the crowd TWICE – in his wheel chair – clearly for the media’s benefit: a photo opportunity!  During one of those episodes, his fake “blown off” leg/prosthesis started to fall off and had to be put back on by one of the men in the yellow jackets, obviously an “insider” – another crisis actor! </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The glass from the “blown-out” windows from the “bombing” is all on the sidewalk.  If the glass had been broken from a real bomb blast – the glass would be inside the apartments or offices, not outside on the sidewalk. </p></li>
<li><p>The “runner” who fell down when the “bomb” exploded as though he had been “blown down” by the bomb, was an actor.  There were many men much closer to the “bomb” that were not affected by its force at all. </p></li>
<li><p>The supposed “Principal” of the Sandy Hook school who was “killed” in that false flag attack, showed up – alive and well – at the Boston Bombing. </p></li>
<li><p>There are Craft International employees (operatives) on the scene.  One is carrying 2 bags.  The other operatives quickly leave ground zero – BEFORE the bombs explode.  Who is Craft International?  A private contractor that provides security, defense and combat weapons training to military, police, corporate and civilian clients. </p></li>
<li><p>The U.S. and Israel desperately want to bomb Iran and need some event to polarize Americans so they’ll be willing to send their sons and daughters to die – not for freedom – but for the One World Government that is now gobbling up all the countries and resources in the world.  This particular False Flag Attack allows them to blame it on two young, innocent supposed “Muslim Terrorists” in order to incite the American people into agreeing to go to war against Iran and Syria. </p></li>
<li><p>These 2 boys whose parents are from Chechnya had been interviewed by the FBI many times.  They had even been sent to Chechnya by the FBI to attend a clandestine meeting, the purpose of which was to undermine the government of Chechnya. </p></li>
<li><p>The boys’ uncle, Ruslan Tsarni, had been married to Samantha, the daughter of Graham Fuller, a high level CIA agent. </p></li>
<li><p>The American wife of the older Tsarnaev brother is the granddaughter of a Skull and Bones member – an organization that is part of the New World Order Illuminati. </p></li>
<li><p>Both boys were arrested alive and well.  The older brother, according to an eye witness, was deliberately run over by a police car, then was shot multiple times and mutilated by the police. (See the picture of his corpse.)  Witnesses say he was unarmed at the time of his arrest. </p></li>
<li><p>The younger brother was arrested without a struggle, but ended up almost dead, having been shot through the throat and possibly will never be able to speak again.  How convenient!  He was taken to a Jewish hospital and “cared for” by Israeli doctors before being transported to prison!</p></li>
<li><p>Many witnesses saw bomb-sniffing dogs both at the beginning and end of the race.  Why didn’t the dogs find the bombs?  Unless, of course, agents of the government contractor, Craft International, planted them.  The backpacks they (Craft employees) were wearing (all black) are the same as the ones carrying the bombs, whereas the backpacks of the Tsarnaev brothers, who were Photoshopped into the crowd pictures, were not the same as the one seen surrounding the “bomb” after it exploded. </p></li>
<li><p>Numerous witnesses, including runners in the race, have stated that it was announced repeatedly over the loudspeaker that “This is a drill.”  Indeed it WAS a “drill” with no one hurt or injured, except of course, the Tsarnaev brothers who were set up as patsies – just like Lee Harvey Oswald in the JFK assassination.  But the government has taken this False Flag “live” – to deceive the American public into giving up their freedom for “safety.” </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Little does the blind American public realize that those who are promising “safety” in exchange for the loss of the rights of the public, are the very ones who are setting up the “terror” incidents! </p>

<ol>
<li><p>In 2012, the head of the Boston Emergency Services Department said, “A PLANNED Mass Casualty Event at a Marathon” is coming!  Well folks, this was it! </p></li>
<li><p>And now, less than a month after the “Bombing,” the FBI agents who arrested – and murdered - at least one of the Tsarnaev brothers have conveniently died in a “fall from a helicopter” during a “training drill.”  Obviously, they have been silenced from telling what they know. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here is the link so you can check it yourself.  </p>

<p>How can anyone be proud of a government that plans this kind of heinous event, including the murder and severe maiming of two young innocent men and the deliberate deceiving of the population of America – and the world – for MONEY, POWER and CONTROL! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, I guess if you squint, it kinda sorta sounds like someone might be saying that.</p>

<p>But here&#39;s something I cant figure out. If the plan was to deceive people, why announce that it was a drill over the PA? </p>

<p>And why enlist all these &quot;actors&quot; to make things believable?</p>

<p>If the government wanted to create a false flag, wouldnt they just go and kill a bunch of innocent civilians? &quot;casualties of war&quot; sot of speak. </p>

 This poor gal was clearly very close to the blast, ran around the scene, doing laps over the distance of several hundred meters, appearing to be on the phone periodically, and getting awkwardly directed around like a child in a third grade drama performance.  She is not visibly injured, and the &#39;shrapnel bomb&#39; doesn&#39;t seem to have affected even her clothing.  Of course several months later she shows up for the media, on crutches, putting virtually all of her considerable weight on her &#39;injured&#39; foot.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;d be surprised what adrenaline can do for your body. If she were an amputee, you could bat eye, but for (what I&#39;ve heard, a broken ankle) the injuries she sustained, it&#39;s completely plausible.</p>

<p>I had a quaterback back in grade school named Sammy (name may sound cliche for a QB, but take this story how you will) who also suffered a broken ankle. He attained the injury mid-practice during a scrimmage and didn&#39;t refuse to leave, but didn&#39;t even consider it. The after practice drills had him running around smoothly. It wasn&#39;t until the next day we recieved word that our main QB would be out for the next several weeks. He was limping around practice the next day without his cast on in his gear. He kept coming to practice by the end of the week, until a week later when he was officially diagnosed with a broken ankle, and was seen around school on crutches with a cast. There were people on the team who didn&#39;t believe he sustained these injuries, claiming he did this to attain social popularity (as if he didn&#39;t have enough). The truth is, when you get that hefty drug known as adrenaline coursing through your veins, there&#39;s no stopping you from doing what you must to achieve what must be done.</p>

<p>Good point, and it is this same line of thinking that keeps people around from trusting the government, right?   I mean, the government has lied in the past and done bad things in the past...so why trust what they are doing/saying now?   </p>

<p>It is funny how when that thinking is used to discredit the govt or &quot;shills&quot;, it&#39;s okay and fully acceptable...but when it is used to question a source on the other side of the line it&#39;s discpicable. </p>

<p>It makes no difference anyway. You are attacking the presenter of the information and anyone who would listen to it. </p>

<p>The simple fact is, you are wrong.

    <div class="md"><p>What you&#39;ve said amounts to a personal attack, one that detracts from the arguments she is making without actually attacking the argument. To be fair, she states on her site &quot;Holocaust Revisionists agree that Jews, Gypsies, some Christians, and some others were detained in German-run internment camps in European countries, including Poland and Germany, during World War II, the reason being that International Jewry had declared publicly, including in headlines of European newspapers, that if Germany went to war against England, the Jews living in Germany would sabotage the German war effort.  This automatically made the Jews “enemies of the State” by any nation’s laws.  However, Holocaust Revisionists do not agree that there was any German plan to exterminate Jews, nor were there any homicidal gas chambers in any concentration camps. &quot; Do some research, they had soccer teams at Auschwitz, and an infirmary. Jews have been harassed endlessly for exposing the gas chamber lies. I don&#39;t think this is reason to reject her years of experience amputating limbs and her sound arguments. For some reason, you felt you needed to knock her credibility down. kinda lame</p>

<p>I simply implore the onlooker to take a look at your regular (and I do mean very fucking regular) contrarian opinions that you feel so inclined to broadcast in this subreddit on a daily basis. </p>

<p>If anything I am asking the onlooker to consider the undeniable facts about your presence in a subreddit dedicated to anti-statist commentary. </p>

<p>You idiots don&#39;t even understand the definition of argumentative fallacy. </p>

<p>If anything, you could accuse me of Ad Hominem, but in reality, I&#39;ve just been around the block with you morons often enough to know what motivates you. (hint: it isn&#39;t the truth)</p>
