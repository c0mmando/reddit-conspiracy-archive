At that point the pen was away and we were actually just smoking cigarettes. The cop then began to ask to search my friend&#39;s bag. After asking what their probable cause was and stating that we do not consent to a search, three more cops came and surrounded us. They shined all their lights on us and began interrogating us. As we stayed silent and tried pleading the fifth, they began mocking us, saying shit like &quot;ohhh we got a bunch of fucking lawyers over here&quot;. Then they began questioning what fraternity we were in and threatened to turn ours into a parking lot. They ended up &quot;making a deal&quot; with one of my friends. If he didn&#39;t make them get a warrant, they would just give him a ticket. My friend took the deal. Would they have been able to get a warrant on us? Also, I despise how they mocked us for knowing our constitutional right. They said it was a red flag...</p>

People always say that there are just a few bad eggs spoiling it for everyone, but I&#39;ve had probably 10 encounters with cops in my life, and they have all been SHIT. Super disrespectful bullies itching for a reason to fuck you up, and I&#39;m a very normal looking, well-presented and peaceful person. I was never impolite to them and never even gave any trouble, simply seeking to end the interaction peacefully, without anger or incident.</p>

<p>The &quot;most cops are good&quot; idea is so cognitively dissonant for me it sounds like a piano falling onto the sidewalk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It attracts sociopaths and psychopaths. I mean think about it. If you enjoy: seeing people in pain, hurting people, blood etc. then you would either join the military or police. And a lot of officers are vets. Which I think is a HORRIBLE idea. Police officers should be hired from social services type people. People who want to HELP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but each individual is a part of the whole. So the change starts with the individual. Similar to &quot;Be the change you want to see in the world&quot;. But this isn&#39;t happening. So we need to MAKE change. That&#39;s why those &quot;constitutional audits
 are so important during traffic stops. It reminds these officers of the duty they have whether they like it or not. If they want no holds barred policing, where they can be as corrupt as they want, we&#39;ve got a beautiful third world country to the south of us. Where bribes are common and no one complains about this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been lucky and haven&#39;t had a bad encounter with cops. About 3 years ago I got pulled over one night around 3am because I had out of state plates, assholes, I had been drinking and stupidly decided to get out of my car and walk over to the cop. At that point if I would have been anything other than a white woman that cop probably would&#39;ve pulled out his gun. He told me about my plates and I just played stupid and told him I&#39;d take care of it and he let me go, no sobriety test. I wouldn&#39;t try that shit now, I&#39;d probably get shot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had a bad experience with a cop. I&#39;ve seen cops turn on their lights just to get thru an intersection, or park on the sidewalk in front of an office supply store - right where people are walking - but I&#39;ve always had pleasant interactions with cops. In fact, when I lived in Washington, a cop pulled me over for a sticker I had on my car from a ski resort he&#39;d been to, and wanted to give shouts out. Another time recently, I got a warning for not having a plate on the front of my car, and having an eighth in my car. And  when I got pulled over for no plate (just recently) it was in a town that supposedly has no tolerance for weed. </p>

<p>There are a lot of shitty fucking cops out there, and they&#39;re trained more aggressively now, but they are still human. It almost seems like the many ruin it for the few [cops who are actually good]. But there are good cops out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a similar situation happen with me and a couple friends who were smoking weed on a beach in RI. A cop came along, at this point everything was in my backpack, and he told me that he was going to search my bag under probable cause of possession of marijuana. Since RI had decriminalized marijuana, I told the cop that he had no probable cause of a crime being committed rather a probable cause of a civil offense which does not constitute a search, only a ticket if he had evidence to support it. He seemed really annoyed when I said this, and he tried to work me into allowing him to search my bag. At this point I told him to call his Sergeant and confirm with him what I had told him, he did, and came back over to us and told us to have a good night and left. I turned around to my friends, whose jaws were collectively on the floor at this point, and said one thing &quot;Know your rights&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Next time ask, &quot;Am I being detained?&quot; Answer all of their questions with the same phrase or simply &quot;I don&#39;t answer questions.&quot; Do not chit chat with them. If they say your detained they must be able to articulate the crime they suspect you committed and the readily apparent evidence which they are basing the suspicion on. If they say your free to go, GO.</p>

<p>By giving them permission, you relinquished your rights. They were bluffing about the warrant and you failed to call them on it. They were fishing for consent and they&#39;ll use any lure to get it. If they search you without consent or &quot;reasonable articulable suspicion&quot; of a crime, even if they found your paraphernalia, you could have had the charges dismissed. </p>
