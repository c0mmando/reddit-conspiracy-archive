       Because all the other headlines suck.  This propaganda brought to you by SITE Intelligence group and Rita Katz, producers of such well known hits as the ISIS "beheading" videos ( fake ass shit ), and before that, Bin Laden videos.

       So they have millions and millions of dollars worth of military equipment, some of it theirs and some of it ours, they're basically a small army now. They line up and murder hundreds of hostages at a time, but this is their big attack on the US. I'm so not looking forward to the stupid shit people are gunna try and say to me about how I was wrong and how they are a threat to our national security.

       Hey man I don't know about you but if I was a cop and I had to pull someone over I'd feel a tank would be a necessity. There's gunna be that one day, that someone I pull over is carrying around a military grade arsenal. Now who's the corrupt criminal with a badge in a police state. Not me that's for sure.

       If an organization is really interested in hurting a country this is what they should do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Random killings at random locations. Doesn't take any sort of organization or equipment, just the ability to give the order to a grouyp of dedicated people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be absolutely terrifying to the population. No one would feel safe.

       Ditto, individual action means nothing, and the police aren't the enemy, they're tools and I feel will gladly do the work of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine they join to do good for the most part, and stay to do what little they can. I bet they relish the opportunity to catch a violent criminal and loathe fucking with people because of stupid laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course there are sadists and bad cops. But proper legal reform and the bad cops will get replaced by people who always wanted to be cops but couldn't on principle.
      </p>
      <p>
       A strong, honest police force is one the best things a modern society can have. But police can't be honest when compelled to enforce unjust and immoral laws and policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       We reform the the unjust judicial and legal system, and the cops will change with it.

       This is the theory I posted months back, potentially on a different account. Random beheadings/attackings will be the next big event, something like 2-3 random attacks in 3-5 cities across the country would be all it takes to roll out national gaurd in all the cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the backdrop in place, and troops moving on the ground, all it takes is a "continuance" to make martial law full blown.

       It would honestly have to be economic for an "acute" event to take place. As we've seen over the last 15 years the roll out has been slow and progressive. The only reason that would change is because of an acute issue, planned or otherwise. I honestly do not believe if the US was thrown into chaos that the US authorities "robbing us of our liberties" would be able to respond to control our rage. Each town and suburb would be its own baghdad that would have to be cleared and controlled individually. If we can't do this in one country we've invaded previously, how can we do it across a significantly larger area with more natural resources for the populace to hide in and use for a counter-revolution?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if they attempt  to control a national outbreak to an acute issue, I'm not certain it would be centrally planned by our own government, and I have plenty of doubt we would be able to respond effectively. Foreign invasion or usurpation would be only inevitable at the point.
