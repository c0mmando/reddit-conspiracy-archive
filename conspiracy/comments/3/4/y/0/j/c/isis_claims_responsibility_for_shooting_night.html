They line up and murder hundreds of hostages at a time, but this is their big attack on the US. I&#39;m so not looking forward to the stupid shit people are gunna try and say to me about how I was wrong and how they are a threat to our national security. </p>

<p>Random killings at random locations. Doesn&#39;t take any sort of organization or equipment, just the ability to give the order to a grouyp of dedicated people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ditto, individual action means nothing, and the police aren&#39;t the enemy, they&#39;re tools and I feel will gladly do the work of the people.</p>

<p>I imagine they join to do good for the most part, and stay to do what little they can. I bet they relish the opportunity to catch a violent criminal and loathe fucking with people because of stupid laws. </p>

<p>Of course there are sadists and bad cops. But proper legal reform and the bad cops will get replaced by people who always wanted to be cops but couldn&#39;t on principle.</p>

<p>A strong, honest police force is one the best things a modern society can have. But police can&#39;t be honest when compelled to enforce unjust and immoral laws and policies.</p>

<p>We reform the the unjust judicial and legal system, and the cops will change with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the theory I posted months back, potentially on a different account. Random beheadings/attackings will be the next big event, something like 2-3 random attacks in 3-5 cities across the country would be all it takes to roll out national gaurd in all the cities.</p>

<p>With the backdrop in place, and troops moving on the ground, all it takes is a &quot;continuance&quot; to make martial law full blown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would honestly have to be economic for an &quot;acute&quot; event to take place. As we&#39;ve seen over the last 15 years the roll out has been slow and progressive. The only reason that would change is because of an acute issue, planned or otherwise. I honestly do not believe if the US was thrown into chaos that the US authorities &quot;robbing us of our liberties&quot; would be able to respond to control our rage. Each town and suburb would be its own baghdad that would have to be cleared and controlled individually. If we can&#39;t do this in one country we&#39;ve invaded previously, how can we do it across a significantly larger area with more natural resources for the populace to hide in and use for a counter-revolution? </p>

<p>Even if they attempt  to control a national outbreak to an acute issue, I&#39;m not certain it would be centrally planned by our own government, and I have plenty of doubt we would be able to respond effectively. Foreign invasion or usurpation would be only inevitable at the point.</p>
