       The whole thing seemed off to me. How it was wrongly reported and the back and forth of "someone shot"/"no one shot". To me it seems like a psy-ops. I think the man could've been a plant/under cover agent wearing a bullet proof vest and was shot to see if this could incite riots. If he was wearing body armor it would explain the hole in his shirt but no visible blood. At the end of the day, I have no idea, but, this all seems sketchy. Time will tell.

       I used to have an ex-military roommate who wore a bullet-proof vest every time he left the building. Perhaps the guy was wearing one and the police/news media deemed that to be something they shouldn't mention for fear that the concept would go viral.

       What a hilarious way to protest police shootings.

       I thought the same thing yesterday actually.  That would really be the only explanation that makes any sense with a complete lack of blood anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would raise a lot more questions IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a mainstream news reporter was actually at the exact spot at the exact time shit went down raises even more red flags to me,  especially because it was Fox News, who are equally vested in stirring up race tensions as MSNBC and CNN.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pysop indeed,  but a failed pysop at best.  Nobody died thank God,  but it's time to let the story, or lack of story die so the people of Baltimore can get back to normal.

       Shouldn't there be a resignation letter (or a firing) of the Fox News producer Mike Tobin--who called in Live On-Air to announce he witnessed ONE GUN SHOT???

       I just want ANSWERS...someone was lying--who was it?

       The reporters and witnesses who were there said the suspect was shot, while the BPD spokesman (who wasn't there) said it never happened.

       Trust your eyes, not the BPD. He wasn't shot, and he wasn't severely injured,  let it rest.

       Guns dont shoot by themselves even if they hit the ground if you know how any type of modern (post 1934) gun is built they have safety pins that stop them from firing unless the trigger is pulled

       Even if it did drop-fire... he was hit straight in the back (from the photos). I can't imagine a plausible angle where that would happen from a drop-fire. I know ricochet is possible... but that's a pretty magic bullet to end up straight in the center of his back.

       Now center mass is exactly where most shooters (including police) are trained to hit.
