    <div class="md"><p>Their desperation should be your delight! The more that people everywhere are starting to speak the truth, the more the sorcerors have to weave their deceit on overtime.</p>

<p>People aren&#39;t stupid! They&#39;ll at least be able to tell that someone wants them to like GMOs. They&#39;re being offered a false choice between science and anti-science. They need your help, create some magic to light the way.</p>

<p>The first step is to slack a bit: here&#39;s a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=gmo&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on">search for GMO</a> that can help provide you with the reagents you&#39;ll need. It looks like <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> has written and compiled a tome of knowledge on this topic - take advantage of this abundance and don&#39;t reinvent the wheel.</p>

<p>Keep it simple, and focus on just a few spells. Here&#39;s three to help dispel some illusions enough to start a discussion:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>GMOs are currently unlabelled in America, and the companies that sell these GMOs have lobbied to keep them unlabelled, and very much want everyone to not want to know where their food came from. Any attempts to occult knowledge and hide information are easy to point out as evil.</p></li>
<li><p>The promised GMOs, the idols they would have you worship such as golden rice, do not exist. Superfood GMOs have not been created nor distributed worldwide; nor has any increase in the scale of industrial farming due to pesticide resistant crops ultimately ended up feeding the underdeveloped world. Hunger is still one of our greatest problems as a species.</p></li>
<li><p>The current deputy commissioner for foods at the FDA, Michael Taylor, was previously a VP of public policy at Monsanto, a <del>hen</del> fox guarding the henhouse. Even moreso, the very companies that want to sell you these products are the ones that are responsible for the safety testing that would enable them to be sold.</p></li>

The myriad of biocides that glyphosphate replaces in Roundup ready foods makes it less toxic than the traditional crops. Obviously roundup isnt good for your body, but its way better you than the concotion of methyl bromide and other chemicals.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know how ubiquitous copper sulfate is in organic farming?  Are there any studies on copper sulfate residues on organic foods?  The wikipedia article on copper sulfate says copper sulfate starts exhibiting toxicity at concentrations of 11mg/kg of body weight, this seems less toxic than pure glyphosate or concentrated versions of round-up with glyphosate and POEA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s used all the time for organic farming, as it is the only biocide(to my knowledge) that is nearly 100% effective. I went to a conference several years back for Florida Vegetable Growers and they had a university study on organic biocides. All of the biocides other than copper sulfate were only 50-75% effective.   </p>

<p>It seems to be about as toxic as glyphosate or POEA (Wiki search shows that POEA is minimally toxic to the body). I don&#39;t think that there is a definite answer for which is better, but both GMOs and Organic are equally bad for you. </p>

<p>Sorry, I don&#39;t buy that GMOs and organic are on par with eachother, I&#39;ve read dozens of studies comparing them and organic consistently has lower overall pesticide residues, higher nutrition, and is grown in better soil (better fertilizer too).  I don&#39;t doubt that the pesticide they use isn&#39;t good either, but I know of many organic brands that don&#39;t use any pesticide.  It&#39;s literally impossible to say the same for round-up ready crops.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it media manipulation or is it just people who have the nerve to have different opinions than you?</p>

<p>These discussions don&#39;t come from no where, they are reactions to stories that make the news. For example, we see GMO discussions lately because that news article about Argentina made the front page.</p>

<p>No one is denying that shills exist, but the problem is that you are providing any evidence to suggest that the people discussing this are shills. All you&#39;ve really done is found an excuse to discount the opinions of those who have a different perspective.</p>

<p>Using your logic, I could just as easily claim that the article discussing opposition to Glyphosate in Argentina was only upvoted to the front page because it was astroturfed by shills of the organic food industry. Alternative supplements and organic foods are a massive and growing industry, it only makes sense that they hire shills too. </p>

<p>You are not providing evidence because you have none. You are encouraging people to adopt your strategy of emotionally reacting to people whose opinions differ from yours and interpreting their behaviour as some sort of plot against the truth.</p>

<p>Your strategy for closing your mind is very transparent dude.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what? Did I say that there weren&#39;t hit-pieces against these companies? No I didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>What I did say was that there are just as many hit pieces coming from the other side. Have you read NaturalNews or NaturalSociety or Global research.ca. They exist solely to create hit pieces.</p>

<p>So to starting claiming shill for either viewpoint is stupid. People have different opinions. Some people resort to shitty tactics to push these. One example of a shit tactic would be creating a post talking about an invasion of shills who oppose you while providing no evidence to support it.</p>
