<p><strong>Who Killed Congressman Lawrence Patton McDonald?</strong></p>

<p><em>The State Department Cover-Up Of KAL Flight 007</em></p>

<h2>By Todd Brendan Fahey</h2>

<p>It is a story that no one wants to talk about anymore.</p>

<p>Neither by ideological colleagues Congressman Bob Stump (R-AZ) and former Senator Steve Symms (R-ID), nor from any quarter of the State Department: the assassination on September 1, 1983, of a United States Congressman aboard a passenger airliner at the hands of Soviet fighter jets. A southern Democrat lawmaker, who was also jointly Chairman of the John Birch Society and President of Western Goals Foundation, both famously anti-Globalist/anti-communist organizations, and who had announced to his advisors in the weeks prior to his death that he would be seeking the Presidency of the United States--as a conservative Democrat--in 1988. A cousin of WWII hero General George S. Patton, and who had inherited Patton&#39;s mountain of anti-Soviet Intelligence records; who had organized a private Intelligence network which threatened to rival that of the CIA--at once commanding, polished on-the-stump and movie-star handsome: ...the kind of man who could seriously derail the Presidential aspirations of George Herbert Walker Bush, the elder.</p>

<p>Such is the story of the late-Congressman Lawrence Patton &quot;Larry&quot; McDonald--former U.S. Naval Reserves flight-surgeon-turned-lawmaker-turned Presidential hopeful. In death, even, for the Establishment&#39;s purposes, the most dangerous man in America.</p>

<p>Like so many stories approved by &quot;our government,&quot; the &quot;official version&quot; does not jibe with the facts.</p>

<p>George P. Schultz, then-U.S. Secretary of State, ended the probe of the downed Korean Airlines flight 007 in December 1983, barely three months after the event, explaining that the Boeing 747 aboard which was Larry McDonald flew off its scheduled course, strayed into then-Soviet airspace, and that Soviet pilot Major Gennadiy Nikolayevich Osipovich, at the helm of a Soviet Su-15 fighter jet and upon the orders of Col. Gen. Ivan M. Tretyak, commander of the Far Eastern Military District, obliterated the craft in mid-air with two air-to-air missiles and that its passengers and crew were destroyed along with it (ICAO Report, December 1983, Appendix D, page D-3) (Istvestia articles, 1991).</p>

<p>Dan Rather, at CBS, and other Talking Heads, nodded with relief at this explanation, and then-President Ronald Reagan contented himself with the Senate&#39;s non-binding &quot;condemnation&quot; of the U.S.S.R., which was Senate Joint Resolution H.J. Res. 353, in proceedings chaired by then-Senator John Tower (R-TX) (who would, himself, perish in an airline crash in 1991).</p>

<p>But that is not what happened.</p>

<p>In fact, the evidence of a successful landing of KAL 007 on Sakhalin Island or an at-sea ditching, with surviving passengers, Congressman McDonald among them, is so massive--from signed FAA logs, to official statements from Japanese Civil Aviation Bureau, to testimony from Korean lawmakers and Korean CIA (KCIA)--that the only rightful conclusion is one of cover-up.</p>

<ul>
<li>Evidence of a Landing at Sakhalin Island</li>
</ul>

<p>Signed logs of Duty Officer Orville Brockman at Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) headquarters in Washington, DC., of FAA representative Mr. Dennis Wilhelm, Tokyo, and reports from a &quot;Mr. Takano&quot; at the Japanese Civil Aviation Bureau headquarters, Air Traffic Division, all show that KAL 007 was not destroyed, and was, in fact, guided down to Sakhalin Island--a disputed territory held jointly by the former U.S.S.R. and Japan.</p>

<p>Of the many sightings or confirmations of the Sakhalin Island landing, the most salient and verifiable are these:</p>

<p>--C. K. Suh, Manager of the American Regional Office of Korean Air Lines in Los Angeles, contacted by telephone Congressman McDonald&#39;s press aide Tommy Toles, stated that he had &quot;just called Korean Air Lines in Seoul&quot; and that &quot;the information I [Suh] got from them is that [the] U.S. Embassy in Korea informed the Korean Government, Minister of Foreign Affairs...that the plane has landed in Sakhalin.&quot;</p>

<p>--From FAA directly, Mr. Toles received a phone call from one of its officers, who stated:</p>

<p>&quot;This is Duty Officer Orville Brockman at FAA headquarters in Washington, DC. We have just received information from our FAA representative, Mr. Dennis Wilhelm in Tokyo, as follows: He has been advised by the Japanese Civil Aviation Bureau headquarters, Air Traffic Division, Mr. Takano -- T-a-k-a-n-o -- who is his counterpart in Japanese aviation, as follows: Japanese self-defense force confirms that the Hokkaido radar followed Air Korea to a landing in Soviet territory on the island of Sakhalinska -- S-a-k-h-a-l-i-n-s-k-a -- and it is confirmed by the manifest that Congressman McDonald is on board.&quot;</p>

<p>--A month after the incident, South Korean lawmaker Son Se-il, of the opposition Democratic Party, reported having received a classified CIA report which indicated that at least some KAL 007 passengers and crew may have survived. The 57-year-old lawmaker told reporters that he had received the document, marked &quot;Top Secret/codeword,&quot; but would not disclose his source. (Yonhap News Agency)</p>

<p>Reuters news service verifies that it obtained a copy of the 17-page report, some of which was published on October 26, 1983. The Reuters report states that this document indicates the Boeing 747: &quot;...probably successfully ditched, there probably were survivors, the Soviets lied massively and diplomatic efforts need to be made to return the survivors.&quot;</p>

<p>--Columnist Jack Anderson (Deseret News, 04/03/84) confirms that a news associate, Don Van Natta, visited Tokyo in early 1984, and confirmed &quot;from Japanese Intelligence sources and documents stamped &#39;secret&#39; in red Japanese characters&quot; key aspects of the KAL 007 incident, amongst which:</p>

<p>At 3:38 AM on September 1, 1983, &quot;The Japanese radar station at Wakkanai, Hokkaido, which had been tracking the unidentified aircraft&#39;s progress, saw the blip disappear from the screen less than 50 miles away. The trackers thought it was probably a Soviet plane that had gone down.&quot; (Anderson column, Deseret News, 04/03/84)</p>

<p>Robert W. Lee, writing for the John Birch Society&#39;s The New American magazine, finds, of Van Natta&#39;s discovery:</p>

<p>&quot;Since Wakkanai is itself only about 40 miles from Sakhalin&#39;s southern tip, KAL 007 would have had to have been very close to the island if it was `less than 50 miles away&#39; from Wakkanai when it disappeared from radar. Since it had been airborne for 12 minutes at that point, there is no way that it could have been tracked that close to the island unless it had changed direction. And if it changed direction, it was under the control of the crew. (That trackers thought it was a Soviet plane also implies that it was heading toward the Soviet military stronghold, as a Soviet plane would be expected to do. Had it been moving away from the island, there would have been less reason to conclude that it was a Soviet aircraft.)&quot; (Lee, &quot;What Happened to Flight 007?&quot;, The New American, 08/29/88)</p>

<p>Most shockingly, and disputedly, shortly before his death, Israeli Intelligence official Avraham Shifrin, an expert in the Soviet-era gulag prisons system, in a series of American television interviews reported in 1993 the existence of Soviet eye-witnesses to a captive Congressman Larry McDonald, being held at Lubyanka prison, a special KGB stronghold, and that the other survivors were jailed in encampments at Wrangel Island or along the Trans-Siberian border. Shifrin claimed that the Border Guard boats of Soviet (KGB) Gen. Semyon Romanov had been dispatched to an area between the Moneron and Sakhalin Islands, and had stripped the largely intact KAL 007 of luggage and a very-much-alive crew and human cargo.</p>

<p>And most damning of all, the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs reports that agents at Central Intelligence Agency at 10:00pm, September 1, 1983, phoned its office with the announcement that &quot;the plane had landed at Sakhalin. The crew and passengers are safe.&quot; (Michel Brun, Incident at Sakhalin: The True Mission of KAL 007, p. 5, ISBN: 1-56858-054-1; independent confirmation, confidential sources, Seoul Ministry of Foreign Affairs)</p>

<ul>
<li>Evidence of a Successful at-Sea Ditching</li>
</ul>

<p>Those who discount a guided landing at Sakhalin Island, but who believe KAL 007 successfully ditched at-sea, with survivors, point to the following evidence:</p>

<p>Radar tracking of the Boeing craft demonstrate a 12-minute descent (ICAO report), which independent avionics experts have gone on-record as stating would have been impossible were the craft &quot;destroyed&quot; in-flight, as was stated by its pursuer, Soviet pilot Maj. Osipovich (&quot;the target is destroyed&quot; [Osipovich, from the ICAO report]. Studies of radar tracking and black box data reconnaisance of other crafts of similar weight and with decompression at similar altitudes, demonstrate that KAL 007 would have reached the ocean&#39;s surface in a mere 2 1/2 minutes-to-3 minutes.</p>

<p>To wit, just one comparison as reported by Associated Press: &quot;A China Airlines jumbo jet fell 32,000 feet in less than two minutes Tuesday [February 19th] after all four of its engines failed...&quot;. (Deseret News/AP, 02/20/85)</p>

<p>Additionally, no bodies have ever been conclusively recovered from the supposed crash site; and although there have been unconfirmed reports by Japanese fishermen as finding bodies washed ashore in remote island locations of Japan, none have ever been identified by the former Soviet Union, the United States or any international organization as being from KAL 007. And in the first eight days following the supposed air-to-air obliteration of a 747, a craft dubbed by pilots and radar-trackers &quot;heavy,&quot; for its sheer mass, no bodies and no debris were found at the supposed crash site. In all, according to the official ICAO report, only between 500-839 small pieces of debris were ever recovered.</p>

<p>Insight magazine offers a telling comparison to other crash site investigations:</p>

<p>&quot;In 1985, an Air India Boeing 747, carrying 329 passengers, exploded at 31,000 feet over the North Atlantic when a suspected terrorist bomb was detonated. In that tragedy 132 bodies were recovered--123 of them on the same day. All were identified. In 1987, when a South African Airlines 747 exploded at 14,000 feet from a cargo-bay fire, 15 of 159 persons were recovered along with several thousand pieces of debris, some as far away as 2,000 nautical miles.&quot; (&quot;KAL 007 Mystery,&quot; Maier, 04/17/01)</p>

<ul>
<li>The Government Reaction</li>
</ul>

<p>Then-State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, confronted with such testimony, indicating a potential survival of passengers and crew of KAL 007, stated in an October 25, 1992, news conference:</p>

<p>&quot;In our view, the claim is false. We had no information that would indicate that there are survivors of the KAL crash. There are other groups that have asserted as well that there were survivors, but they have never substantiated their allegations... During recent talks with President Yeltsin, in fact, our delegation asked about possible survivors of the crash. President Yeltsin replied that there had been no survivors, and we have no reason to doubt the Russian government&#39;s statement.&quot; (emphasis mine)</p>

<p>But the State Department did have information and every reason to believe that there were survivors, amongst which may well have been Congressman Larry McDonald. Or maybe that is the point. As a sovereigntist and Constitutionalist, a mortal foe of the Council on Foreign Relations and Trilateral Commission, of which so many in Washington are a part--then State Department Secretary George P. Schultz and President George Herbert Walker Bush both prime-movers in the rush to Globalism--it is as if it was decided, by the powers-that-be, that Larry McDonald and the 61 other Americans aboard Korean Airlines flight 007 might better to be put to rest.</p>

<p>Indeed, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Bent, in 1984, declared the investigation of KAL 007 to be &quot;officially closed&quot;--a decision which the State Department has never reversed--despite the fact that the craft&#39;s &quot;black boxes&quot; were not produced until 1991, and not to U.S. officials, but to then-President of South Korea Noh Tae-woo, and still then, which were proven to be utterly bogus.</p>

<p>The State Department, in a pattern of obstruction as to KAL 007, after less than a month following the incident, in September of 1983, ordered aborted an investigation of the crash site by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. (None of these agencies today will comment on the matter.)</p>

<ul>
<li>Those &quot;Black Boxes&quot;...</li>
</ul>

<p>Then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin, on November 19, 1991, gave over to Korea&#39;s President Noh Tae-woo the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) of KAL 007, and was awarded, according to an Agency France Presse dispatch, a commendatory &quot;laurel&quot; by the South Korean government for his making available long-held discovery of the painful international incident.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, upon meticulous review of the contents, Seoul Transportation Ministry officials reported that: one of the flight data recorder boxes was empty and that the other box contained copies of the tapes, and not the original; and that two of the CVR tapes had been recorded backwards, rendering the communications &quot;unintelligible.&quot; (Yonhap News Agency, South Korea)</p>

<p>South Korean ambassador to Moscow, Hong Sun-yong, flew to the Kremlin upon orders of an embarrased President Noh Tae-Woo to demand explanation. According to a December 3, 1991, New York Times report of this meeting, it was acknowledged by Russian officials &quot;that it knew that the FDR tapes had been removed.&quot; The Times states that Ambassador Hong &quot;was told by Yuri Petrov, a senior Yeltsin aide, that the original tapes had been withheld because Russia planned to provide them to an international investigative body.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the goal is to restore the founding principles of the US, what you&#39;re suggesting runs in direct contradiction to that end. You&#39;re advocating &quot;the end justifies the means&quot; which is what <em>they</em> believe. Violent revolution never goes as planned, and would likely only help them clamp down and impose the planned one world totalitarian socialist state. Which, by the way, goes back much farther in history than Larry is letting on. It has been the goal of these people ever since the fall of Babylon.</p>

<p>The founders of this country were incredibly smart men. They called it the Great Experiment because that&#39;s exactly what it was. If the first country to be truly set free could learn to defend those ideals, that would have been the new world order. But they knew deep down, and you can read it in their writings, that human nature would cause us to piss it all away. If we are to ever restore freedom; hatred, fear and violence are not the way to accomplish it, as that plays right into the hands of those who would like control.</p>

I find it strange that people think this is a conspiracy, when clearly, it has been known from time immemorial, that power is one of the most potent drugs. It should shock no one that these big rich cats want to keep their power. This is why the threat of communism and fascism will never go away. We should always stay in a perpetual readiness to defend our freedoms, from generation to generation.
Sometimes I am tricked by a belief that we don&#39;t have to worry about tyranny anymore because we&#39;ve evolved so much. But this is a lie. Power&#39;s potency is like that of heroin, and those who suck on the nipple of power will always want more.
This will go on for thousands of years to come. It is hoped that with AI and robotics, we may come to a time when a central government is not needed. It could be a time when there is plenty for everyone, plenty of shelter, plenty of food. But it is also likely that the wielders of power will not allow our plenty, but will instead, use robotics and AI to control us so that they can rule.</p>

<p>The best way to do that is to drop the borders and become a single united force.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And how do you know this? Has this even been proved in practice? No. It is simply theory.</p>

<p>Personally I think self-sustaining communities is the answer to many problems, self-reliance. We don&#39;t need everyone to be under one government, we need millions of small governments that govern and sustain themselves, and do it well. Dissolving borders won&#39;t immediately solve poverty or world hunger. In fact it&#39;s entirely possible it could make such things worse.</p>

<p>If people found a way to rely on themselves and each other within self-sustaining communities, then we&#39;d be in a far better position to care for the rest of the world. Small communities that handle their own problems, and if too big they go to a bigger community, and if they can&#39;t handle they go to a bigger one, and so on. That is part of my ideal world, one where people work together to help those in trouble.</p>

<p>But most people don&#39;t live like that. They think there&#39;s only one force that&#39;s &#39;in charge&#39; and it can&#39;t be any different, we have to leave everything up to them. I don&#39;t think a one world government would even give a crap about poverty or world hunger, except possibly for show.</p>

<p>No. The <strong>ownership class</strong> (the (bourgeoise) is stripped of their private property rights. The means of production become collectivized; common ownership under communism. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_ownership">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_ownership</a></p>

<p>That is <strong>not</strong> a communist &quot;model&quot;</p>

<p>The means of production are owned by ALL. Any benefits are shared by all. Production &#39;targets&#39; exist only insofar that it supplies the need of the people. Not for profit. Not for the benefit of the few. But benefit for all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chicago Tribune article published September 1964: here is pithily explained the apparently paradoxical, nay strange, relationship between capital and collectivism. Most people understand that the ideologies of capital and communism are inimical and incompatible and are mortal foes. The truth is very different. For, proper study of the phenomenon of communism would show that if it were not for the support of it by powerful financiers it would have been dead in the cradle. In fact, Communism and its supposed leaders have routinely sought financial succor from those they espouse to hate and publicly vow to destroy in their &quot;world proletarian revolution.&quot; The true leaders of Communism are the very international bankers who ordinary communist functionaries and foolish Liberals believe are the enemy. Thus, it is not good fortune or coincidence that first American banks to open in Moscow and Peking were Chase Manhattan ... whose chairman is David Rockefeller and whose shareholders are in the main the Rockefeller clan and their cronies. <a href="http://www.overlordsofchaos.com/html/1965-69.html">source</a></p>

<p>Surely.  But from the books, papers, etc. I&#39;ve read, the docs I&#39;ve seen, the conversations I&#39;ve had with fellow intellectuals , this is the conclusion I come to. And I&#39;m not alone.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if anyone here agrees with me, but that won&#39;t stop me from saying it . </p>

<p>I&#39;m only a &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; (we shouldn&#39;t use that derogatory CIA coined term).. insofar that logic and rationality can back it up.</p>

<p>E.g. The twin towers and building 7 were a controlled demolition. It is obvious. JFK was killed by the CIA.  The Reichstag was burned down by the Nazis.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re right. I would consider myself a conscious thinker.</p>

<p>See, I can talk about (and do) talk about matters of the USSR being state capitalist (by Lenin&#39;s own admission) in other subreddits, yet I run into friction here, but not there.</p>

<p>Others that have spent the amount of time reading and writing on these issues are in complete agreement.</p>

<p>Sure, you&#39;ll find dissonance with Marxist Leninists, or Stalinists on the topic (because they are in denial, IMO) but again, the evidence is unsurmountable.</p>

<p>And its true. No place on earth has ever seen true communism. By the very definition, it&#39;s a fact.</p>

<p>Sure have. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marx credits Hegel with &quot;being the first to present its [dialectic&#39;s] form of working in a comprehensive and conscious manner&quot;. But he then <strong>criticizes Hegel for turning dialectics upside down: &quot;With him it is standing on its head. It must be turned right side up again, if you would discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Guys like [Suskind] were “in what we call the reality-based community,” which he defined as people who “believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.” … “That’s not the way the world really works anymore,” he continued. “We’re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you’re studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we’ll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that’s how things will sort out. We’re history’s actors…and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.”</p>

<p>Its just like the word &#39;libertarian&#39; these days.  They&#39;ve hijacked that word too.</p>

<p>Stolen and perverted from the original French roots of libertarian socialism.</p>

<p>Or anarchism.  And these so called &#39;ancaps&#39; that pervert anarchist philosophy to fit these individual capitalist needs.</p>

<p>It pisses me off to no end. And people go on believing all this bullshit without a clue.</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There isn&#39;t a &quot;monopoly&quot; in communism.  You&#39;re talking about the merger between the state and business enterprise.  That is called corporatism.</p>

<p>NOT communism.</p>

<p>Communism is a classless, stateless, moneyless society. The OPPOSITE of what the elite wants.   In that system of social organization, they have NO POWER. They have NO CONTROL. They have NO PRIVATE PROPERTY.  These are the things that the capitalist requires, and you don&#39;t have them under communism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their slogan is &#39;own nothing control everything&#39;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if they owned nothing they would no longer be elite capitalists. Control is DERIVED from ownership; private property.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The capitalist mode of production is characterized by private ownership of the means of production, extraction of surplus value by the owning class for the purpose of capital accumulation, wage-based labour, etc.</p>

<p>That isn&#39;t a communist model!</p>

<p>Communism is a classless, stateless, moneyless society.  And if there are &quot;cages&quot; as you put it, EVERYONE is in them. Including the <em>former</em> owners.   But again that is not an accurate account of &quot;communism.&quot;</p>

<p>Mao was state capitalist. Same as the USSR was.</p>

<p>Vladimir Lenin notably described the economy of Russia as <strong>state capitalism</strong>.</p>

<p>Sure. Although I agree with the sentiment, I think the word &#39;socialism&#39; here isn&#39;t the most entirely accurate word to use.</p>

<p>As,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Socialism is a social and economic system characterised by social ownership of the means of production.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the basis of socialism, but this is not what guys like Ralph Nader, or the NDP was referencing(Both of which I have great love for, I might add).</p>

<p>Its just rich folks (the corporatocracy) shifting laws and policies to fit their needs. Its a euphimism for those at the top getting handouts, meanwhile those at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder must compete for services and get nothing in ways of social safety nets.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more of a metaphor than it is a direct reference to socialism itself.</p>

<p>I should know.  (I am a Libertarian Socialist.)</p>
