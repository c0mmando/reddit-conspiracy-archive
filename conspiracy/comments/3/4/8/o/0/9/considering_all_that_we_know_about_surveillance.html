       I imagine it working like this, if this data is stored: Suspect X has been identified as a "threat". The NSA (or whomever is storing the data) gets intelligence that Suspect X was at Starbucks at a specific location on February 11, 2015 at such and such time. They then run through the satellite feed for that day/time/location and begin tracking Suspect X through collected/stored satellite footage and follow the suspect until they reach current time/location.

       certainly. There have been second-hand accounts that some of those car bombers had been shang-haied and had no idea their little errand would end up in a "suicide bombing". This is anecdotal and second-hand information of course.

       Ten years ago I read that DoD satellites had the capability to read a the headline of a newspaper held in someone's hands.  The new data centers that go up on federal and private property are designed to store exabytes of data.  The full implications of these items are not yet known.

       Not sure if that is true, or not, but who knows about the "headline visible" part. I was the daughter of someone that actually did satellite mapping for Dept of Defense in the 1980s/1990s (he is deceased) and at that time, it was extremely secretive, even our neighbors all around us were interviewed by the FBI on acct of his job, and at that time, from what I was told, a license plate could be seen in best circumstances but not read. This was in late 80s. To the OPs question, it is not a stupid question at all, in fact it is a fear many have and have spoken about in company. Well, considering that almost every call we make first goes through Amdocs before US even gets a crack at them can make a person nervous. Also, it is not so much the "government" we should fear but NGO we should concentrate on. The US gov has a lot of very good people in it, whose life's work is the search of truth and upholding the law, capture of criminals etc.

       It seems ridiculous, but the idea of them recording all of our communications, and full size remote control aircraft, seemed ridiculous 15 years ago.

       It's plausible. But honestly, the data that runs through our phones is plenty information for tracking someone without needing to reposition satellites.

       Duckieducks- here is an example of a non(US)governmental organized/organization using/stealing for some nefarious purpose:

       I posted this to the sub /privacy. Imagine what sort of shenanigans a group could do with this sort of data on a person. Mentioned in the article a securities expert said "it is highly organized and would take a lot of funding and I am not naming a "nation-state" : ha ha. Gee "nation-state"? who in the world could
