       I've been to America once and I found it unbelievable that such poverty existed in the western world.  The ghetto's all had there windows shut down, roads where destroyed. Whole family's lived in very old and small houses. This in combination with the education system in the USA it's no wonder that the kids grow up to be this way.

       Add on police that target you because of your socio-economic status, cyclical violence and extremely low social mobility and you have ripe ground for rioting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm so sad reddit took the bait and immediately turns to racism. That is exactly what TPTB want, squabble amongst themselves and they can rape the planet without being interrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should all be rioting and stealing. Look at our leaders, they steal trillions upon trillions of dollars meant to improve our lives, they sell our standard of living to contractors and corporations and they have no qualms about using violence to attain their goals. "Lead by example"? They'd be truly terrified if we followed their example.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's time the public start seriously fucking with the Status quo, that's the only way to get their attention. Otherwise, all you'll get are bullshit concessions that need to simmer within our horrible political system for years before they act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want pot legalized? Blockade and boycott any business contributing to the anti-marijuana cause. Same could go for gay rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Political activism is seemingly doing very little these days. Constant cries over police brutality, incarceration, political corruption, revolving door, regulatory capture etc etc... Simply voicing your opinions about it doesn't stop the incredibly powerful people who uphold these traditions. We, the people, United together can only stop it through action that HURTS their bottom line.

       It was more of a hypothetical, to illustrate that if we actually followed the example of our leaders, we'd all be looting and burning! If they are supposed to exemplify ideal behavior, we're all fucked.

       True. Another form of boycott is not showing up to work. You have to have a little more balls of course. It works only if done collectively.

       So quick with the ad hominems! Fuck off with that, unless you're willing to have an intellectual discussion. maybe /pol/ is more your speed if you want to make baseless assumptions about people rather than engage them with real words? You also seem to be the one crying, the fact my comment made you upset enough to type that retarded drivel is pretty sad.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm talking about widespread government corruption as well. Labeling it as just racism would be counterproductive.
      </p>
      <p>
       We live in an extremely unequal society. The fact that people steal when they have the chance shouldn't surprise anybody. And the fact that people burn shit when no one listens to their legitimate concerns? Also not surprising. If you bothered to read my entire comment, you'd realize it wasn't at all focused on racism.

       If you don't feel like you have a future and nothing to live for, why not riot?

       Another way to look at it...ever been having a really bad day and you are way more likely to snap at people? You road rage, you're impolite to the cashier, you don't say sorry to someone you bumped into.... now imagine that every day of your life has been that bad day.

       As someone who grew up in a socioeconomically-disadvantaged, primarily black neighborhood...it's a whirlwind of factors. I think education is an enormous part of it: I've watched as our public schools have steadily had their budgets cut for the past 20 years; it's damn near the ONLY place outside of the home that poor kids have an opportunity to better themselves, and we're stringing it up to die. Further to that negative cultural precedents (like many black kids growing up without fathers....either because those fathers are incarcerated/dead, or because THEIR fathers were never around, and monogamy isn't a value that's encouraged in that community, largely because of extenuating social circumstances), poverty, a lack of any kind of social support (from education to healthcare to childcare to financial aid), and the few opportunities available in the hood (to those that are PRODUCTS of the hood) that do seem like a feasible way to make a living (selling drugs, pimping/prostitution, raising/fighting dogs, gambling, hustling of any kind) are largely criminalized by society and thus enforce the cycle of incarceration &amp; violence. Police are racist as fuck, on top of that, so that doesn't help....but this whole thing is about poverty &amp; wealth disparity, from the top down, and race is just a convenient distraction. You consistently disenfranchise a group of people for consecutive generations, this is what happens.

       I agree 100%. If I was born as a poverish'd kid in the ghetto I would be ignorantly doing what they are doing. Humans are a product of their environments. I am just glad I got the opportunity to get to a point in my life where I can reflect and question myself.

       This is a MAJOR factor. I believe it has everything to do with
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_violence">
        Structural Violence
       </a>
       , which is what Johan Galtung proposed back in 1969 (also shows how long things have not progressed for the better) in his article called
       <a href="http://jpr.sagepub.com/content/6/3/167.full.pdf+html">
        Violence, Peace, and Peace Research
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You have very large numbers of people/families who:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        barely make enough money to meet their basic needs
       </li>
       <li>
        have no chance of getting access to a good education
       </li>
       <li>
        have very little opportunity to be hired into a profession that pays well
       </li>
       <li>
        see their small amounts of income have less and less purchasing power
       </li>
       <li>
        live in a community that is left to deteriorate in all aspects
       </li>
       <li>
        see law enforcement constantly patrol for anything in the slightest of suspicion and come down hard with full force regardless of rights and laws
       </li>
       <li>
        see the militarization of law enforcement
       </li>
       <li>
        watch news story after news story of police brutality
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       You can see why people just start to riot. I am absolutely against it... but it makes sense to me as to why it's happening when you learn about the term structural violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The inequality in the US, and generally throughout the world, is starting to become extremely apparent... thanks to the internet, smartphone cameras, and people willing to expose truths and important information.
      </p>
      <p>
       These kinds of riots will not just go away. There is a brewing power struggle of the elite control and the people... TPTB will not just allow true equality.. they have never allowed that and will fight all the way to hold their position.

       FUCKING A! Finally someone else gets it. You are 100% Right. Its not a black or white problem, those are just shitty labels and excuses to get us to hate each other. This is a socioeconomic problem. Poor education,product of your environment(ghetto culture) coupled with no job. Hell I can't even find a "career" and I have a "great" resume. This system has put them in a spot where they eat tang sandwiches and mac n cheese all day. I do not blame them for they do not know or have the understanding to explain a solution, therefore they be heard in the only way they can get heard . Riot.

       America is a country that ignores their domestic problems and focuses on foreign policy. They do that to keep us distracted from the terrible state our country is in. People in other countries do not realize that America is an illusion, when foreign citizens move here they think it will be great, that money will fall out of their pockets. Their is a lot of freedom here but it isn't as badass as other countries think. The problem we face is that our country focuses on the negative. We never ever talk about progressing towards a better society. We only talk about how we can ignore or red-tape the regression of our society.

       Poor standard of living isn't leading to these riots. These are being incited by our media, to what end is the question. I believe these "rioters" are being used to usher in police reform in the way of a nationalized police force or even martial law. There is no doubt police brutality is a problem, but it always has been. It is only recently, last 10 years or so, that the media has been allowed/directed to attack the police. For many many years the news was always "Black man attacks white people", now suddenly its "white police attacks black man". Why the sudden change of heart media?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Over the past four years, more than 100 people have won court judgments or settlements related to allegations of brutality and civil rights violations. Victims include a 15-year-old boy riding a dirt bike, a 26-year-old pregnant accountant who had witnessed a beating (of another person), a 50-year-old woman selling church raffle tickets, a 65-year-old church deacon rolling a cigarette and an 87-year-old grandmother aiding her wounded grandson.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those cases detail a frightful human toll: broken bones — jaws, noses, arms, legs, ankles — head trauma, organ failure, and even death, coming during questionable arrests. Some residents were beaten while handcuffed; others were thrown to the pavement.

They have nothing to lose and insurgency's and protests will continue as long as large segments of the population live in poverty.

       If you go to Finland and ask them what they dip about poverty, they will say, "Oh, we don't allow poverty here."

       Define "bettering yourself". Working a job that perpetuates this slave wage economy? There are hardly noble jobs that don't expense the planet for a profit or exploit some other humans in a way. If you are not educated you cannot understand the process of even being a "normal citizen". Humans identify in words, your behavior and dopeamine response is predicated on thoughts. If you cannot understand why they way you are "YO WASSUP FOOL YA HEARD ME" You will never understand anything else.

       Been to America once... ok, but from where? I just got back from 2 weeks in India. American poverty is a king's life compared to common people of India. It is utter nonsense that our standard of living for the poor is bad. Try walking around alone in a country where not every person is documented. The people there ask the government for nothing. And the desperately impoverished people... you know what they do? On a micro level, they are business owners. They exchange goods and services for other goods and services. Major difference is people over there take education very seriously.

       I lived in Canada for 10 years and India for the rest. You are stereotyping India. Lots of my fellow Indians care not for the material wealth that you speak of. People are living relatively stress free here. Speaking of material wealth, the upper middle class is living with more luxury than your upper middle class American.

       Yes, you see pockets of poverty. That even a blind person can see. But don't generalize that to everyone else.

       So if poor people can't have nice things they should steal it? Sorry but that's pretty much saying what you did there. Social classes have to exist. We need them to have something to strive for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just cause someone is poor or whatever don't mean they have a reason to help destoy a city. You rise up and make something of yourself. You don't cut fire hoses and burn down buildings. What we need is swift justice on the streets during riots.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't need people to feel sorry for the poor people. I been there like real poverty. Grew up with nothing. I didn't steal or riot. I applied myself and made something with my life. If they can't participate in society they should be exterminated from existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I am talking about people that won't hold a job cause its just better to sit at home and live on the dole. Sorry but I don't pay 10% of my annual income to support someone that won't apply themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are disabled then you can still have a job. Look at jersey they have people pumping fuel. Or they can pick up trash. Mow the grass in public parks. You want asstiance then you show you are willing to work for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Done seeing this shit where people say they are just shit on when the ones throwing trash cans at people are wearing designer jeans and have an iPhone 5 saying we are being oppressed.

        Testosterone has been hypothesized to play a role in the etiology of prostate cancer, because testosterone and its metabolite, dihydrotestosterone, are the principal trophic hormones that regulate growth and function of epithelial prostate tissue.

        Development of agriculture in modern Blacks also seems to have led to high testosterone levels. Groups with the highest testosterone in the world today are primitive agriculturalists.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sub-Saharan Blacks are highly polygynous, and this resulted in intense competition for fewer women and selection for very robust male body types.
       </p>
       <p>
        Blacks have much higher testosterone levels than Whites from age 7-24 (Abdelrahaman et al., 2005; Ross et al., 1986; Winters et al., 2001).

        There is also evidence that high testosterone is linked to lower IQ.

       This is the post you guys should be looking at.  All this 'lovey dovey just fund da schools' ignores the real issue - there are biological differences that contribute to what we are seeing today.  Yes there are other factors involved, but behavioral traits are not these minor things that occasionally pop up - they determine the fate of people.

       This sub is aware of the lies our government tells us, but often still head-in-the-sand on racial differences.  They are real and racial awareness is extremely important.

       Yeah, racial differences stop from the neck up, we are all the same, aborigines would be rocket scientists and build a strong civilization if it weren't for the white man keeping them down...  Blacks all over the world having lower IQ and higher crime rates, normalized for income, is simply due to historical oppression.  Everything is the fault of environment and culture.

       'Racism' as in it's bad to recognize that we, as animals of the animal kingdom, are on different branches of evolution, and thus different, just like breeds of dogs are different.  Way to swallow the narrative of egalitarianism.

       There is poverty at that level in every western country. Idk what perfect place you come from but you obviously haven't seen all of it. The US education system is among the best in the world. You really thought you had it all figured out didn't you.

       Maybe. At least I side with Neuroscience on this one. Giving a  poor environment this people were forced into, terrible diet,massive stress on the mind and body, emotional abuse, physical abuse, lack of education. There is no opting out of our system unless you want to be homeless. Human behavior is created. On the flip side, give a human a good home,diet,low stress,low stress developmental stages and you grow up with a brain without disorder in the frontal cortex. You can maybe say then that person can make responsible decisions. You are getting into philosophy territory though. my 2 cents.

       There are far more poor white families in the U.S. than there are Black families.  It's a combination of poverty, and what's accepted in their culture.

       It's genetics that leads to black people being more aggressive than other breeds of humans. I don't see white people or Asians running around smashing cars and shops on a yearly basis. Their poor living conditions are a result of the welfare state. They have no goals and no ambition and that is also a genetic trait. That's why the thousand that left Sub-Sahara hundreds of thousands of years ago wanted something different and to get away from these inbred savages. They never built a boat, never invented the wheel and were content living in squalor and taxpayers have been helping them maintain this existence in our civilized world with our technology. If you want to end this problem. Segregate and detach. There's no reason to be supporting these people. There's no reason to pay them to breed. There's no reason to breed with them. They are a lower breed of human. They need their own communities so that the responsibility is on them and they can finally take pride in something. They don't build or maintain. They need to learn. They need the government's tit popped out of their mouths.

       I agree. People come in here and downvote or one-line comment how out of touch I am but they are completely ignorant to the fact that science isn't being used properly and that politics has corrupted everything. Black people are just one small cog in the political machine that keeps people ignorant to why things are so bad. It's why there are no answers only enablers and accepters. No one knows what to do or what's wrong because politics is never a solution. It only keeps the money flowing and the ignorant people like above ignorant.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people want answers, they need to be ready to accept that those answers like truth are brutal and hard. People have been raised to be feminine and weak. So they will never accept the answers, only the fluffy bullshit.

       No one here ever mentioned eugenics. I believe my exact words were "segregate". They are dependents of the state like homeless children and need to be put in charge of their own destinies. We have separation of church and state, let's do the same thing for black people.

       Another way to look at it...

      <p>
       When you have free food, free housing and free healthcare... you've got plenty of time to riot without risking losing something that you've worked for.

       This is the post you guys should be looking at.  All this 'lovey dovey just fund da schools' ignores the real issue - there are biological differences that contribute to what we are seeing today.  Yes there are other factors involved, but behavioral traits are not these minor things that occasionally pop up - they determine the fate of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub is aware of the lies our government tells us, but often still head-in-the-sand on racial differences.  They are real and racial awareness is extremely important.
