       In the past 4 months many hintings toward disclosure have kept occurring with which seems to be increasing.

He was also a high level adviser for President Obama and is now working with Hillary Clinton on her way to the White House. This is a tweet from him earlier this year. He is an avid supporter for disclosure.

       3.There are many advocates now that are publicly calling for disclosure.

       5.U.F.O.'s sightings seem to be increasing, could be confirmation bias, but I am optimistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is becoming more and more obvious as time goes by, that disclosure is coming, and soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will public disclosure be a positive or negative gain for humanity? I don't know for certain but the positives seem to outweigh the negatives in my mind.

       Maybe that's what Jade Helm is about.  Controlling a freaking out population because aliens exist now.  The religious ramifications in itself would be huge.  People would probably be jumping off roofs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's all hope the aliens don't care about money as much as humans do.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Aliens:
       </strong>
       Ok humans, congrads!  You made it!  Warp drive!  Welcome to the universe!
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Humans:
       </strong>
       Sweet!
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Aliens:
       </strong>
       First, let's start by giving you all this free technology to let you create free food, water, and energy as much as you want with only one drop of water.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Humans:
       </strong>
       Great!  We will have to release this technology slowly in stages the next 100 years to maximize our profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Aliens:
       </strong>
       But, this is free for everyone to use on earth at no cost.  We can make 7 billion units right now and give them out for free.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Humans:
       </strong>
       Awesome!  But how are we suppose to make money off this though?

       Pretty much.  That's why part of me doesn't think first contact will happen.  Why make friends with a species that does not want your technology for the good of their planet, only for profit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about not only the poor, but the rich too.  All of a sudden you have the 1% having to co-exist with poor people in a world where money does not matter anymore.  No more servants, maids, and chefs to care for the rich because everyone would be equal.  This would not fly with the 1% either.  You would have the 1% and the bible people jumping out of windows.  It would be epic.

       Jade Helm has more to do with 9/11 disclosures and people's pensions being wiped out by FED ponzi, than Aliens. This is complete disinformation. There are real problems caused by humans and there are fake, hypothetical problems like Aliens.

       Not sure if its related to 9/11. There were rumors about document leaks that sounded like they would cause riots. I have not seen them. I have heard it was related to the origins of the Anthrax attack on the US senators opposing the Patriot Act that was used to push through the bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       As soon as I heard those rumors, Obama got authorization for 400,000 military troops on homeland and pushed through CFAA through executive order to allow internet censorship, seizing/censoring websites and threatening journalists with fines and jail for linking to or talking about leaked documents. That was April 1st. Then Jade Helm exercises began.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were people at top level, talking about forcing the top group of neocons to step down gracefully, or people plotting color revolutions and other political maneuvers. Some Washington insiders look like they are panicing. I have no idea what is going on. What public does, does not matter. Its all groups and factions at the top, fighting for power and trying to build consensus to out the other groups and the public just watches on as spectators.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we will see a major power shuffle, politically after next crisis. It will be the same old. I am getting out of country, because it is just too much drama, politics and instability for me. I dont want to be here when the financial crisis starts.

       I have honestly contemplated the same question regarding the impact that a positive identification in the SETI would have on religious people. Were NASA or another scientific body to rapidly disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life forms, particularly those possessing some form of intelligence, it would be such a shock to so many who have been raised to believe that the human species is unique in the universe and that we were somehow chosen by the great hand of some deity in his own image. If ET life was discovered than many of the religious teachings around the world would literally crumble as a result of the contradiction that life, intelligence and most importantly morality are solely relegated to Earth. It is not inconceivable that some measure of chaos could ensue.

       Well stated.  So much of human dogma revolves around the fact that earth is the center of the universe or geocentric.  Imagine the what reaction will be when the aliens tell humans that they have never heard of Jesus, Allah, Buddha, Vishnu, etc.  It will not end well with the masses.  Their whole after-life believe system: poof.

       Unless you've actually read the bible, and interpreted it a certain way... The book of Revelations says that the end will be "as in the days of Noah". In Noah's day, fallen angels came to Earth, and mated with humans, creating giants, or "Nephilim" (there are photographs online that show giant skeletons unearthed on archaeological digs all over the world. Many U.S. digs were sent to the Smithsonian. Good luck finding official documentation, though, as it has been covered up over the years. It does not support the theory of evolution.). I believe CERN is actually attempting to make a "door" to our dimension, which the fallen angels can then use, to materialize on Earth. We can see mirages of them, but no solid physical contact that we're aware of. If that is the case, it's only a matter of time until CERN scientists are successful, and at that point we will see the fallen angels return to Earth. They will claim to be aliens here to save us from ourselves, but will  unleash pain and torment on the populous as they serve their master, Satan.

       In the context of giants, it is interesting to note the Tion and Liger Lion/Tiger hybrids. Depending on which species is the mother, one is excessively huge due to lack of size restriction genes and the other is the size of a small dog due to excessive size control genes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then you have to pick a side -- are the fallen angels humanity's creators that share genetic similarity because we were seeded here a la Prometheus or are they extra dimensional entities that you would need DMT amd CERN portals to communicate with? It could also be that the story was fabricated based on our ancestor's observation of size differences in hybrids between species here on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, this is the real world and we are foolish to believe we know it all because reality really is stranger than fiction. Made up stories are safe in that they are restricted to the artistic vision. Real life is so much more chaotic and unpredictable.

       on that same note, if these "giant" skeletons actually exist, it would still work with evolution quite well.  They could be another species similar to the neanderthals that was simply larger than the winning primates (us) or could be the result of a crossbreed between two early proto human races that resulted in offspring larger than either of the parent races, just like with the liger.

       What if the ETs say that they actually
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       heard of Jesus, Allah, Buddha, Vishnu, etc. and know who they are and how it all fits together (i.e. esoteric model of the Universe with advanced souls, etc.). Thus is a way confirming the beliefs of the people, not contradicting them.

       I used to think the same thing but the past of most religions are chock full of deities, demi-gods, powerful and intelligent beings so far ahead of humanity that they themselves were worshiped as gods. It
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       wouldn't be much of a stretch to use some story of non-intervention to explain their absence and their return if humanity is discovering technologies that could destroy us. Intervention to side-step imminent destruction. I really haven't the slightest clue what lies ahead and how it's going to unfold but in the face of cognitive dissonance, even far out explanations that lead to a more "normalized" perception would be soaked up quite quickly.

       I'm not so sure religious teachings would crumble. The religions might just adapt or even find themselves confirmed by some of the things ETs would say (i.e. with the esoteric model of the Universe).
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people think that the religions are all just fantasy and completely false. I think they have core truths which will be revealed to be true when we meet the ETs and get an advanced understanding of the Universe.

       There is a full court press in effect right now regarding information. There is a smokescreen that is concealing something big. Coverage on anything other than that riot related circle-jerk isn't really getting a lot of play. We know that TPP is happening soon. shits going down w/ saudi arabia, and we aren't really seeing much else.

       Regarding your "Aliens/Humans" dialogue, the "Human" portrayal is not human thinking.  This is the thinking that many humans have been
       <em>
        brainwashed
       </em>
       to have.  It is not the natural way, however.  Don't fall into that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, the "everyone will freak out if aliens exist!" argument is just...I've just
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       found that
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       damn...weird.  Like, I guess maybe I'm projecting, but I really think/feel it's kind of a...a non-thinking person's argument - like, the argument of someone who's not really thinking about the dynamic deeply or clearly and is just really repeating what they've heard and have been told over and over again by the MSM...so they just end up saying it and believing it themselves now without having stopped to realize...that's it's really all bullshit and not true at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean certainly
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       people will probably freak the fuck out...but those are just people that have had their heads in the fucking sand and are stupid fucks anyway - thinking that humans are "number one in the universe!" or whatever the fuck.  I think the civilization would do well to have
       <em>
        those
       </em>
       types jump off a building and kill themselves anyway if they freak out over ET disclosure.  It'd be better for the rest of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most people WOULDN'T freak out.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...well, I guess it also depends on a lot of factors, and I'm sure TPTB on this planet (
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/34hik0/extremely_poignant_quote_from_william_bramley_on/">
        who may VERY well/likely
        <em>
         not
        </em>
        be from it
       </a>
       in the first place) may try to manipulate the disclosure dynamic even more
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       disclosure occurs.  I mean they've manipulated it enough already.  Therefore, maybe people WOULD freak out because TPTB here on this planet would
       <del>
        state
       </del>
       start some sort of ET false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a big cluster fuck, essentially, but I've always found the whole "everyone would freak out!" argument
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       counter to how I feel about this whole situation.  Sure, I might be projecting, but I really don't think that so many people feel all THAT different from me in this area.

       Disclosure has not taken place, yet, although I don't know for certain what type of "cocoon" you are referring to here exactly, I for one do not in the least feel myself to be in any type of cocoon as far as "fearing the existence of ETs in and around the universe".
      </p>
      <p>
       OMG
       <em>
        faaar
       </em>
       from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So..."no matter who you are", you will
       <em>
        fear
       </em>
       leaving the cocoon of human ignorance?  Wat?  I am ignorant still in
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       ways, of course (as are we all, it seems), but, as far as I know and feel, I have exactly ZERO "fear" of leaving the ignorance which plagues our tiny human minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       I strive and make great efforts to clear the darkness of that ignorance from my mind
       <em>
        regardless
       </em>
       of whether the knowledge brought forward brings a light that is overwhelming in its illumination.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this is to say that even if I have fear...I am not
       <em>
        afraid
       </em>
       of it, and I will move forward toward it with arms open nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would rather get annihilated and obliterated by the light of truth and knowledge than to live a long life trapped in the bleakness of dark ignorance.

       Disclosure does not have to happen suddenly. It can happen gradually so that the people who would freak out can stay in denial until they get used to the idea.

       Don't know why you got downvoted, as it's not a bad point.  I thought about that as well.  It's a "slow acclimation" kind of thing that TPTB are trying to implement.  However, there's going to come a time when they WILL have to go "full frontal" and let it be known that YES, intelligent, very technologically advanced beings - a good portion of which are bipedal and some of which look almost indistinguishable from
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       - DO exist in the universe outside of planet Earth, and some of those extraterrestrial beings have visited and are even currently ON planet Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once that happens, then everything I said above absolutely applies.

       If we were to learn aliens existed.  If the president came out and did a press conference saying we had proof of alien life forms, they were currently on the earth and negotiating an exchange of cultural and technological information people would freak right out.

       People see things all the time. Perception is a fragile things and belief is certainly not a justification for something to be real. Psychology has shown us that people easily create false memories and that certain illnesses can cause hallucinations and delusions that would explain those sightings very well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religions arise for a variety of reasons and certainly don't need the concept of extraterrestrials to function.

       A UFO is an "Unidentified Flying Object", meaning that it is
       <strong>
        unidentified
       </strong>
       . Yes, this could be aliens, but it could also be literally anything else that flies and emits light. I couldn't really tell see much in the video, only a flying light and some confused tourists. While I don't believe it's fake, just imagine how easy it would be for someone to have made this in a computer program. The resolution is so poor that you wouldn't have to animate much anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at some of the best arguments against aliens having made contact or having visited us, for example the huge distances in space that make sending a single aircraft to fly around in the atmosphere and blink a little only to disappear afterwards seem ridiculous.

       Definitely not a computer program. There are countless thousands if serious sightings and a lot video footage. I've gotten really into UFO research it's past year. I strongly recommend Richard Dolan's book "UFO's For the Twenty-First Century Mind." Look Ito the Phoenix Lights case, which was seen by around ten thousand people. Look into the UFO's over the White House in 1952. And there have been many, many cases where the Air once sent up fighter jets to go after UFO's- so these obviously weren't military technology, although in many instances that might be an explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it's that likely that we've had a lot of come and go alien visitation- though it's possible. But I think that there's no doubt that there's some other intelligence on Earth. The term that some UFO researchers use is "ultraterrestrials."
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also personally experienced other "dimensions" from using DMT, so I know that there's something else out there.

       I have no idea. It feels like something is happening but people have been saying that forever. It would be foolish to make any specific preditions probably. Best thing is just to be prepared and don't take anythign they tell you at face value. It could be a huge psyop.

       I don't know. The more I think about it the more cynical I get. If they have had contact for 50+ years, why ever tell us? And if they do tell us what are the odds that after 50 years of lies they tell us the whole truth? Probably almost 0.

       Just FYI, the EM drive isn't any kind of 'warp drive'. It's just a propulsion system that doesn't use expendable fuel. It won't go at the speed of light (or likely anything near it), although it sounds very efficient compared to what we have now should it work. This would still not be a particularly viable technology with which to travel to distant stars and meet aliens, and as far as we know it cannot be turned into such a technology either. It's still sublight drive, just better than what we have.

       Yeah, this should really be clarified upon. The EM drive and the warp drive
       <em>
        concept

       are two different things. One bounces radiation around in a cavity to produce thrust, the other uses hyper-dense exotic matter to bend space-time, and is mostly made up.

       The warp drive came from them firing lasers into the EM drive and finding out the lasers travelled faster than light and a theory has emerged that it created a very small warp bubble. Hence the warp drive

       if its an unexhaustable fuel source then it most certainly can and will approach the speed of light .. infinite fuel = infinite thrust = constantly increasing speed.

       If the speed of light is a true barrier then thats fine, but it can still get 99% of the way there.

       The fuel may or may not slowly dwindle, if for no other reason the dispersal of energy. But no, even if the source of power lasted a very long time it doesn't mean 99%C could be achieved, because there is a diminishing return on energy put into an extremely massive system. A physicist would have to answer this with numbers, but there would effectively be an asymptotic maximum the drive could reach in less than infinite years.

       If you can create thrust without the need for extra mass you can increase your speed constantly when not acted upon by any other forces. Given enough time, near light speed would theoretically be possible in the vacuum of space.

       I shared your thought, but then I realized that as power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely. There needs to be a balance, any unipolar system will lead to abuses. Even if a multipolar world might be "less stable" it would be "freer".

       So under a OWG any group that manages to take control over it, will have unfetted power over the planet, meanwhile in a multilateral structure, this same group would need to have control over
       <em>
        all

       states in order to have its power uncontested (not that it would be impossible, just much harder)

       Centralized power won't curb corruption, it will galvanize it. Absolute power corrupts, absolutely. We have arrived at our current state of affairs of constant warfair, cronisism, subversion of the constitution, by being manipulated. That is with the powers that I have been entrusted to the institutions subverted by the  TPTB; do you believe it would end, once there is a one world government?  It would enslave slave humanity.

       My personal opinion? I come from a catholic background &amp; I've been indoctrinated in the teachings of end of days (apocalypse) prophecies. I read up on it in my early twenties but I dismissed it.... But eerily enough, the prochecies seem plausible: one world government, dissolution of sovereign states, one world currency, one state sponcered religion, one language.... All of this is now possible with globalization &amp; technology.

       I have. and future more evolved versions of us would be categorized as posthumans which are non human beings, and having access to time travel is the same thing as hanging out in other dimensions. It wouldnt be hard for them to retroactively install an organic internet system in the past (mushrooms or DMT for example, mushrooms function the same way the internet does) to communicate with us and make sure we are on track to built the time machine technology.

       If this happens I highly doubt it will be what a lot hope it is.  I have a feeling it will be that there were instances of UFOs that cannot be explained but are known to not be man made.  I do not believe contact has been made yet.  Unless there was an actual crash.

       Star Trek forms the basis of many of the space worldviews conjured here; did you know that the Rand Corporation was involved with the creation of Star Trek? At first they were proud of the fact that Star Trek was Rand's "projection of things to come", but soon wisened up and distanced themselves as much as possible.

       If you dig deep and check out whistleblowers (disclosure project is great) you'll understand why the US government cannot and will not be the one to disclose. Therefore other governments and that's largely because US military jumped on this first and took complete control during Eisenhower's administration. Supposedly at least 2/3rds of the people part of the international group that handles this want it done too. It's linked to free energy so if disclosure happened, trillion dollar industries would fall apart and they can't let that happen. The petrodollar would disappear. Among other reasons, the motivation to keep this secret is huge. Unless something big happens and people demand answers, or something else unforeseen, it'll be a while.

       i don't see any benefit for anything intelligent trying to interact with us but if you want some "big guy" giving disclosure there was a canadian minister of defense just 2 years ago giving a speech about aliens.

       It will probably be the discovery of some microbial life form on one the planets (probably Mars) or maybe telltale signs in the light spectrum of an exoplanet.

       That's reasonable then. If your monetary situation does change (or if you want to use a small amount- say $25 dollars worth of bitcoins) feel free to let me know. If at some point in the future you have more money and want to discuss making a similar bet with a slightly longer timeline I'd also be happy to do that.

       I don't know if aliums are real but I think there's something we're not being told. I remember watching this documentary about a cigar shaped UFO that holds tinier UFOs that come out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My dad explained the same thing to me, in the 70's he said he saw a cigar shaped UFO and a bunch of tinier ones came out of it. But he's not even a UFO guy and has never seen any documentaries or anything like that.

       I doubt it.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the CGI we have today as well as our space and flight technology, even if you caught an alien ship on a professional quality camera with perfect light at a close distance, you could never prove it was not CGI or at the least an undisclosed military aircraft.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, TPTB do not have to fear someone else disclosing extraterrestrial contact before them, thus if they were to disclose, its because it has already been planned, will benefit them, and would be done so for reasons that could be quite bad for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S: Side question just because I'm curious. Been reading up alien encounter testimonies the last few weeks but have little prior knowledge but what does this community theorize about aliens?
Are alien abductions not seen currently as being more of an out of body experience rather than a physical abduction today based on the majority of testimonies?

       There are many different opinions on aliens and alien abductions. I don't see this forum as having a single opinion on either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that alien abductions are probably a wide range of things. Some are imaginary, some fake, and some are real.

       I do believe that ETs exist though and have been visiting this planet for thousands of years (perhaps millions even).

       Thanks for the answer. I used to believe in ET's, in fact I always did. The last few years though I have began to have my doubts. I wouldn't be too terribly shocked to find out they were real or false. Just kinda always wanted to find out what theories different believers hold as I find it all fascinating and want it to be true.

       OP, have you read Richard Dolan? You really should. "UFO's For the Twenty-First Century Mind" is his latest. Also, there's a fantastic radio show on paranormal phenomena called "The Paracast." Www.theparacast.com
      </p>
      <p>
       But... Personally, I don't see disclosure coming. Why would the government suddenly decide to do it, when they've so aggressively coved it up from decades. I think disclosure has to come from US, we the people. We have to spread the truth about the "alien" phenomenon, even though most people aren't ready for it.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Periodically a group of prestigious individuals comes forth for a press conference to declare that the alien presence is real, UFOs are real, and the Earth is being visited by intelligent life elsewhere. Astronaut Edgar Mitchell has asserted his personal knowledge of this for years. Country after country is opening their UFO files to the public - France, the UK, Canada, Sweden - and many allow their military to speak freely on the matter. The US has been the most reluctant, in part because they have the most to hide. They have been on the forefront of the cover-up over the alien presence since the days of Roswell. Imminent disclosure is often rumored to occur in the US, or perhaps a landing on the White House lawn, but this is not about to happen for the many reasons we have stated. We will reiterate once more that mass landings, or a public introduction of alien lifeforms by an official, will not occur. Nothing that would increase the anxiety level of the public is to be done.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         We work rather from the bottom up, contacting individuals who indicate they wish this contact. This is why acceptance by the public is increasing, which the polls show. The public is increasingly comfortable with the concept of visitors from elsewhere, and the percentage of the public feeling certain that this is in process keeps rising. The establishment assumes they are in the lead in this, but they are being dragged along in the dust behind a public eager to engage the alien presence, and doing so without permission. In fact, the establishment can do nothing to stop this!
        </strong>
        They don't know who is being contacted, when, or by whom. Nor could they stop the process even if they did. Meanwhile, mass UFO sightings are occurring at an increasing rate, worldwide. Motherships, or fleets of ships forming patterns and blinking in the sky, or holographic pyramids twirling slowly over a city at night.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meanwhile, the public jokes about the cover-up, where sightings are jokingly called swamp gas or weather balloons in reference to the standard Air Force explanations for UFO sightings. Those in charge of the cover-up, who hope not to have to confess their long running lie and their distain for the public's ability to handle the knowledge that they held for themselves, are trembling in fear. The cover-up of course was for their benefit, as knowledge is power, and to admit that the Air Force could not counter UFOs means that they were not as powerful as presumed. Organized religion was another big beneficiary of the cover-up, so they could continue to intimidate the flock with threats of being able to damn an errant member to hell for lack of cooperation with their rules. Politicians, and the very wealthy were yet another beneficiary of the cover-up, so the status quo would not be altered and they could continue to threaten prison or the equivalent of a debtor's prison and thus keep the slave classes in their place.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meanwhile, where is the UN in all of this? Many voices press the issue of the cover-up not only about the alien presence but also the presence of Planet X in the inner solar system. Sooner or later the public will become aware of this, and what then? The alien presence is not the larger worry, as disclosure is already occurring, country by country, bit by bit.
        <strong>
         Even the US is loosening their hold by allowing their Air Force officers to bear witness, as formerly they were under strict orders to tell no one. This is one way for disclosure to happen bit by bit - allowing individuals to testify without punishment. What does the UN have to fear in an open admission that UFOs are real? From a leaked report from a French aviation expert who attended a UN meeting on the issue February 12-14, 2008 it is not UFOs they fear but the ZetaTalk message! Individuals claiming to be in contact with extraterrestrials and thus having knowledge of "future global events" were to be branded as "charlatans". Now who could they be referring to?
        </strong>

       I don't think we are on the cusp of developing warp drive. I think we're on the cusp of NASA disclosing warp drive technology. Subtle, but important, distinction.
      </p>

       But it supports the rest of your theory even better. It does seem like we're being primed for something.

       Europeans had the ships to cross the Atlantic; they then proceeded to treat the natives in the US abominably and virtually wipe them out.

       Since 2012 I have seen UFO's 3 times, 2 times I had 13+ witnesses who also witnessed the same thing those 2 times.  2012 on Long Island, 2015 in Denver.  Don't know what to think of it, aliens?  Eh, who knows.  Could just be us fucking around.

       Even if those Schmaliens were only 1% superior to us on a cognitive level, then communication would be nearly impossible. They clearly can't be more stupid, because it would imply that they're still hurling poop at eachother. Have you ever heard a chimpanzee utter just one meaningful word? Nope and we share 98-99% percent of our DNA with those suckers.

       It ain't gonna happen. Get over it. We're not going to leave this planet before the very last one of us humans dies of thirst, cold, heat, suffocation, evolutionary degeneracy ... Pick your poison. We're going to go extinct, because we weren't made to be anywhere else. Not the moon, not Mars, nor anywhere else in billions upon trillions of kilometers in this solar system alone. Why would aliens be any different to us, unless they're anaerobic bacteria able to withstand extremely low temperatures?

       Sounds like confirmation bias. I don't follow the UFO scene and I've seen 0 increase in UFO talk. Until the mainstream is being pounded with the messages it won't be time for a disclosure.

       I've had a similar feeling with the way the media has been taking the alien subject of lately but I think that is only because I've taken the subject a bit more seriously in the last two years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its all hogwash really. If aliens are real we aren't going to see the results in our life time. The population is still well under control despite how people feel about current events. There is no reason to give up such information yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The damage it would cause to the quality of life to the majority of the population isn't worth it. To do full disclosure in the current state of the world would be crippling for majority of the population. People would stop working if they knew everything they've been taught over the years was a lie.  Would you the reader who is into this stuff/I myself personally be surprised if it happened? Of course not, but the general population? Good god
      </p>
      <p>
       People would respect the world governing bodies even less. Why would you as a world leader make a decision to cripple your own power?
      </p>
      <p>
       Aliens are an easy subject for late night TV shows and great for getting Kimmels show across head lines. Podesta and activist in general benefit personally from pushing "ALIENS ARE REAL GIVE US DISCLOSURE" since it has no negative repercussion. You didn't need NASA to tell you that we may find life eventually, the data is pretty clear on the number of planets out there in universe. People have been claiming UFO sightings daily for decades,  but now its extremely easy to share info.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love disclosure on the "truth" if it really is as deep as some people think it is, but it would upset the balance of the regular population to the point it wouldn't be worse it. It would have to be a slow leak of info over generations to ease people into the idea of aliens actually existing and how we would interact with them.

       Full disclosure is absolutely coming. You're either prepared OR you're one of the mindless zombie sheeple stumbling around in the streets trying to Tweet about it when the entire power grid is offline. When alien disclosure happens, the first thing to go will be communications, ie: The Interweb. Enjoy all of this while you've still got it...

       Not sure if its related to 9/11. There were rumors about document leaks that sounded like they would cause riots. I have not seen them. I have heard it was related to the origins of the Anthrax attack on the US senators opposing the Patriot Act that was used to push through the bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       As soon as I heard those rumors, Obama got authorization for 400,000 military troops on homeland and pushed through CFAA through executive order to allow internet censorship, seizing/censoring websites and threatening journalists with fines and jail for linking to or talking about leaked documents. That was April 1st. Then Jade Helm exercises began.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were people at top level, talking about forcing the top group of neocons to step down gracefully, or people plotting color revolutions and other political maneuvers. Some Washington insiders look like they are panicing. I have no idea what is going on. What public does, does not matter. Its all groups and factions at the top, fighting for power and trying to build consensus to out the other groups and the public just watches on as spectators.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we will see a major power shuffle, politically after next crisis. It will be the same old. I am getting out of country, because it is just too much drama, politics and instability for me. I dont want to be here when the financial crisis starts.
