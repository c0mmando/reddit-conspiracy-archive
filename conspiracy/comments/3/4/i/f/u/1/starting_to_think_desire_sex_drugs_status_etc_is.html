       Growing up I believed that alcohol, weed, casual sex, etc. were (of course!) fine. I had positive experiences with all of the above for awhile and didn't see much of a problem. So this post isn't meant to be puritanical or judgmental of others' lifestyles at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as I've increased my awareness through critical thinking and research, I find I have less tolerance for any type of
       <em>
        desire
       </em>
       . The way sex is sold in advertisements, for example, is beginning to look crude, sometimes even perverted. I'm not a feminist or anything, but having wildly idealized breasts shoved in my face during beer ads is starting to make me a little queasy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also starting to perceive materialism as slavery. Once your identity is tied to physical things, you're kinda screwed in my opinion. You become less 'real' - life loses its freshness, flow, and archetypal patterns. You get (this happened to me big time) put in a box and suddenly have limited perception.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm curious if you guys have experienced similar things on your awakening journeys? It's hard to describe, but I feel like some of my cultural programming/conditioning is short circuiting. It's really cool.

       Once you can recognize your own beliefs as constructed myths, then there is no change you can not make in your life or in the world, with sufficient introspection.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy is to convince you that the "real world" is all there is. The "bad guys" are so successful in this world because they lack empathy, understanding, and emotion (which come from a higher place) which allows them to take advantage of the nature of the innocent.

       Exactly. In some ways this describes my path thus far. The progress you can make and the self-knowledge you can gain from introspection is
       <em>
        amazing
       </em>
       . It's like a whole different world that you're never taught about/purposefully kept ignorant of.

       I think they can enslave us, but these things have also been around in human culture for thousands of years. We've used drugs and had sex all throughout human history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Materialism is a real problem in today's society though for sure. The idea that we constantly need to buy more stuff is implanted in us through pop culture and advertising.

       Didn't mean to suggest that either of these things are inherently bad. Rather, I meant becoming attached/desiring them can produce suffering.

       Buddhism suggest that desire is the root of much suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there is a difference between desire that is elicited through external sources (advertising/society/culture/media) and desire that is sourced from knowing who you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without desire, i find that I don't have much motivation or drive. I found that in order to accomplish things, I had to learn to carefully cultivate desire. I don't think I was particularly materialistic as a teenager. In order to set a goal, I have to first desire that goal. Many goals worth achieving aren't easy. In order to achieve that goal, I have to cultivate and build that desire like a bonfire.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that lust is a form of desire. I love my wife more than life itself; when I see her look at me with lust, I have my own feelings of lust that make my heart skip a beat - I see nothing wrong here, this is pure and part of a healthy relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing inherently wrong with the emotion of desire. However, it can be manipulated and used against you. Know thyself, and desire becomes a tool that can help you to achieve your goals.

       Thanks for your reply; I totally agree. I also want to expand on my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe that money, sex, or alcohol are inherently bad. As you said, it's great (and healthy!) to feel lust for your wife.
      </p>
      <p>
       Desire, for me, is more about a
       <em>
        subtle
       </em>
       craving that you might not even be consciously aware of. An obvious example might be when you come back from a night out and feel sexually frustrated. But desire rears its head in many other ways as well, like when you're sitting there on Tuesday morning and thinking about just how much better the weekend is.
      </p>
      <p>
       This doesn't mean one needs to go puritanical, though. I think it's more a matter of being whole. I mean Bob Marley smoked pot 24/7 and was regarded as a mystic, so there are many paths in my opinion.

       I think you are dead-on. In this post, and in your OP post. Our cravings are used to control us, and often times our corporate-owned culture creates cravings that we didn't otherwise have (or cravings based on other cravings, like a craving for a toy to gain social acceptance among peers) in order to generate profit based on materialism.

       And our own greed gets us suckered in to supporting them. Think of the billions of dollars in credit and loans that were given out, to people who had no means to pay them. They were misled by banks, but they also made a poor decision, often based on greed. So the populace itself bears some of the blame and is far from powerless.

       That's a pretty central idea in most world religions. When Saint John talks about being hated by "the world", the word is "kosmos" and it means, basically, society. The system of the world. The impulse to turn away from the material, from the social and the commercial is fundamentally revolutionary. It isn't just in Christianity. The Buddhism is pretty much all about transcending desire and fear. Sufi Islam has the same basic idea in it.

       I do not entirely agree with this theory, as the physical world must exist for a reason.  Things are possible here that are not in our minds.

       However, if you would like to explore an early codified version of this, it is referred to as

       Agreed. I'm not saying that the physical is bad. I believe you can manifest and enjoy awesome stuff in the physical world without becoming too attached to them. The point of my post was that these attachments/desires are starting to hurt me more/become more apparent.
