        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Growing up I believed that alcohol, weed, casual sex, etc. were (of course!) fine. I had positive experiences with all of the above for awhile and didn&#39;t see much of a problem. So this post isn&#39;t meant to be puritanical or judgmental of others&#39; lifestyles at all. </p>

<p>But as I&#39;ve increased my awareness through critical thinking and research, I find I have less tolerance for any type of <em>desire</em>. The way sex is sold in advertisements, for example, is beginning to look crude, sometimes even perverted. I&#39;m not a feminist or anything, but having wildly idealized breasts shoved in my face during beer ads is starting to make me a little queasy. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also starting to perceive materialism as slavery. Once your identity is tied to physical things, you&#39;re kinda screwed in my opinion. You become less &#39;real&#39; - life loses its freshness, flow, and archetypal patterns. You get (this happened to me big time) put in a box and suddenly have limited perception. </p>

<p>I&#39;m curious if you guys have experienced similar things on your awakening journeys? It&#39;s hard to describe, but I feel like some of my cultural programming/conditioning is short circuiting. It&#39;s really cool. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Buddhism suggest that desire is the root of much suffering. </p>

<p>However, there is a difference between desire that is elicited through external sources (advertising/society/culture/media) and desire that is sourced from knowing who you are.</p>

<p>Without desire, i find that I don&#39;t have much motivation or drive. I found that in order to accomplish things, I had to learn to carefully cultivate desire. I don&#39;t think I was particularly materialistic as a teenager. In order to set a goal, I have to first desire that goal. Many goals worth achieving aren&#39;t easy. In order to achieve that goal, I have to cultivate and build that desire like a bonfire.</p>

<p>I think that lust is a form of desire. I love my wife more than life itself; when I see her look at me with lust, I have my own feelings of lust that make my heart skip a beat - I see nothing wrong here, this is pure and part of a healthy relationship. </p>

<p>There is nothing inherently wrong with the emotion of desire. However, it can be manipulated and used against you. Know thyself, and desire becomes a tool that can help you to achieve your goals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your reply; I totally agree. I also want to expand on my point. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that money, sex, or alcohol are inherently bad. As you said, it&#39;s great (and healthy!) to feel lust for your wife. </p>

<p>Desire, for me, is more about a <em>subtle</em> craving that you might not even be consciously aware of. An obvious example might be when you come back from a night out and feel sexually frustrated. But desire rears its head in many other ways as well, like when you&#39;re sitting there on Tuesday morning and thinking about just how much better the weekend is.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t mean one needs to go puritanical, though. I think it&#39;s more a matter of being whole. I mean Bob Marley smoked pot 24/7 and was regarded as a mystic, so there are many paths in my opinion.</p>

Our cravings are used to control us, and often times our corporate-owned culture creates cravings that we didn&#39;t otherwise have (or cravings based on other cravings, like a craving for a toy to gain social acceptance among peers) in order to generate profit based on materialism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a pretty central idea in most world religions. When Saint John talks about being hated by &quot;the world&quot;, the word is &quot;kosmos&quot; and it means, basically, society. The system of the world. The impulse to turn away from the material, from the social and the commercial is fundamentally revolutionary. It isn&#39;t just in Christianity. The Buddhism is pretty much all about transcending desire and fear. Sufi Islam has the same basic idea in it. </p>
