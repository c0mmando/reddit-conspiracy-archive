        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a rant.  We are working harder than ever before &quot;those lucky enough to even find a job&quot; We have no benefits no retirement no pensions and no savings.  Our cost of living is skyrocketing every year rents going up groceries going up exponentially, utilities going up, insurance going up medical cost skyrocketing.  Yet pay is stagnant and shows no sign of improving.  The only way you can get a raise anymore is to quit your job and find a new one and in most part of the country this is no longer viable.  We are getting fucked left and right our sense of individual security is shattered.  We do because we have to we are all 1 medical event or life event away from financial ruin.  Meanwhile the 1% is making money faster than ever the middle class is dwindling faster than ever and there is nothing on the horizon that makes it appear this trend will stop.</p>

<p>We continue to participate in this system which proves we are all insane.  I am almost ready to say fuck it all I am tired of just barely getting by and each year barely getting by with even less.  Every year I get older more fatigued and a bit slower.  I have no debt and a good job and I still just barely get by.  I am dumbfounded how everyone else gets by with a mountain of student loan debt car debt mortgage debt child support etc.   </p>

<p>The thought of doing this the rest of my life is incredibly depressing.  I am not content anymore with hollywood, with apple, with cable tv, with stupid shiny trinkets to distract my mind.  I am not content with just consuming and slaving to consume.  It is 2015 and everything sucks.  Everything is designed to nickel and dime you to screw you to treat you as nothing but a commodity, a serial number and a product nearing obsolescence. I think most people avoid feeling this way by having children.  I think having children and pushing them into the machine is incredibly cruel and the last thing I ever want to do is make slaves for the machine.   </p>

<p>I feel like I am at a breaking point and I imagine many people feel the same way. We see the machine we see the matrix we see the scams the dreadful future.  So in all honesty what can we do about it?   </p>

<p>And just after I said that blind trust in man-made systems is ignorant and historically proven to be a bad idea. How depressing.</p>

<p>The baby boomers are probably the most brainwashed generation of human history. They have had things so damn good they don&#39;t understand what it means for the system to work against you. (fels a little ironic though considering I&#39;m the product of that generation, so I&#39;m probably guilty of the same thing)</p>

<p>Oh man that is so true. They think &quot;not giving a shit and waiting for it to work itself out&quot; is a legitimate strategy because that&#39;s what they&#39;ve been doing for 50 years and <em>it&#39;s been working just fine</em>. They are hyper-domesticated, and poorly suited to react now that we have actual real problems that must be dealt with. </p>

People are not prepared to live self sufficiently so if the wheels stop it the grocery stores as well as everything else stops.

As long as hauling the food products aren&#39;t too expensive; they will just keep making the food they sell us worse for us. That way they can still keep making money from us and in the process make us easier to be rid of through frailty and disease.

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man,</p>

<p>I agree with every point you made. But you also sound a bit defeated and assume slavery is inevitable, which is nonsense. </p>

<p>You could start a blog, become an entrepreneur, or do whatever it takes to become self employed. You could move into the country and become a farmer. Even traveling around and supporting yourself with odd jobs could be a fruitful experience. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to make excuses, but remember; it&#39;s supposed to be hard! We&#39;re in some Game of Thrones type shit. The struggle is real, archetypal. It connects us to humans of the past - ever watch a movie about the Roman Empire (like <em>Gladiator</em>) and wish stuff was still epic like that today? Well, guess what? It is. But you&#39;re a high class serf and need to find the courage to take the first step on the Hero&#39;s Journey. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not exaggerating. It seems scary at first, but this is the world we live in. And I&#39;m damn happy it&#39;s this way. Even if the system was &#39;good,&#39; who would want to live for consumerism and entertainment? There&#39;s a beautiful, epic struggle going on right now that connects us all. Join in! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I once asked David North (one of the leaders of the Socialist Equality Party) about how the conditions for revolution are created in a society. The SEP has a classically Marxist outlook, so I was expecting some dry answer about the development of productive forces, the dynamics between antagonistic social classes, etc. But he said something that has stayed with me ever since:</p>

<p>&quot;A revolution occurs when the conditions of life become intolerable.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Historical progress can often be frustrating and tragic. Revolutions can be incomplete, allowing rotten power structures to remain in place (as we have seen in Egypt). They can be betrayed and overturned (as was the case with the Stalinist corruption of the Russian Revolution). They can open the door to backwardness and retrograde tendencies (as in the Iranian Revolution).</p>

<p>However, revolutions are still the only real means by which a society can reconstitute itself. For all its contradictions, the society that emerged from the battlegrounds of the American Revolution was freer and more progressive than the one that had preceded it, and it inspired the growth of republicanism all over the Western world (the same can be said of the Civil War, perhaps best understood as a Second American Revolution to overthrow the Southern slave aristocracy). The Russian Revolution, in spite of its eventual degradation, inspired workers and youth all over the world, and forced governments to adopt sweeping liberal reforms to prevent such an uprising from spreading to their own countries.</p>

<p>The traumas of the 20th century are difficult to study without becoming bitter. However, the notion that revolutions are meaningless is a reactionary and anti-historical one, an idea that has been deliberately spread in order to break the confidence of the masses and resign them to perpetual subservience. The day is coming when the people shall determine their own destiny, when society is reorganized to care for human need, rather than fill the pockets of a parasitic financial minority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ruling elite sure hopes so, as evidenced by the obscene amount of resources wasted on military technology every year. But, for all its bluster and delusions of invulnerability, the US military can barely contain the backwards militias that spring up in the Middle East, and often end up <em>strengthening</em> the opposition wherever they go. In addition, historical experience has shown that, in the face of widespread popular revolutions, soldiers abandon their militaries en masse, rightly perceiving that they stand more to gain from supporting progressive change instead of serving a repressive state.</p>

<p>A united, far-seeing, politically conscious movement of the workers will dwarf any country&#39;s military. It will be the single greatest agent for progressive change and human advancement the world has ever seen. And we need it now more than ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright <em>cracks neck/fingers</em>. You want a rant? You want a solution. I have a few ideas. I&#39;m sick of this god damn place. I would already be doing something I probably shouldn&#39;t be doing if I had a decent target and wasn&#39;t acting alone. I&#39;m sick of the corporations that run our sham of a two party system making it easier for themselves to make money of while screwing the little guy. They&#39;re slowly killing us...it&#39;s soft kill on mass scale.</p>

<p>They&#39;re biggest weapon is food I think. It&#39;s actually difficult or really expensive to eat healthy. </p>

<p>Therefore the first thing everyone should do collectively and non violently I might add to change the situation is to simply produce their own food. If everyone could confidently grow enough food to feed themselves and maybe a neighber then we wouldn&#39;t have to rely on the system that&#39;s poisoning our food. In addition we would cost those companies untold sums of money.</p>

<p>We also need to get into small business mind set. Support small local businesses instead of the mega corps that are fucking us so much...maybe we can just kill those corporations by boycotting them. Walmart is a prime example. I will only go to walmart if I literally have no other choice; and there&#39;s almost always a choice.</p>

<p>Feel frustrated because you can&#39;t get the product you want locally very easily? Order it on the internet or better yet. Find someone that&#39;s good a producing that product in your area and then convince them to start a business. </p>

<p>By doing this your not only hurting the company that&#39;s hurting you; but your financially supporting something else that ISN&#39;T fucking you...as long as the company you support isn&#39;t fucking you and it&#39;s providing more jobs of higher quality in your area then it&#39;s helping everyone.</p>

<p>Sure the local hardware store might charge $2 more for that hammer you need than walmart but 30 years from now if the only store we can buy shit from is walmart...then won&#39;t you be so much more upset that you didn&#39;t spend that extra $2?</p>

<p>Especially when the only job available is the same walmart and you can barely afford the food you buy from the place you work even when you&#39;re relying on other peoples taxes to even get by that much? Personally, I&#39;ll pay the $2. Fuck walmart.</p>

<p><strong>TL:DR; Grow your own food and support small local business instead of large corps that support the shit you hate.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know exactly what you mean in the first few sentences. Everything you said is true as well.  Agenda 21 is making it far more difficult as nobody owns land anymore.  I have been all over the country and every town or city I go is all the same.  Got your mcdonalds, lowes, taco bell, giant grocery store, wal-mart and super walmart, sams club. Sadly supporting the local business is a obsolete idea as for the most part they no longer exist.  Every city looks the fucking same...Strip Malls, Outlet Centers, Depot Centers, Mega Malls, Mega Churches. There is no culture anymore just Corp Culture. All of this shit has not made life better for anyone.  Its destroyed any sense of identity communities used to have.  Its a blight and a cancer.  Thanks to cable and satellite tv most people are all the same.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not as true as you probably think it is. The smaller stores just don&#39;t have the money for advertising anymore and barely survive on word of mouth mostly and people who use a phone book...rare I know. Truthfully though. Want to see local business that can do stuff for you. Check a phone book. You&#39;ll be shocked at the number of businesses you&#39;ve never heard of. Or try even google searching the service in google maps. It will show the location of places that might perform that service. Including small shops. Now, not every places is going to have everything and you may not be able to get everything you need from a local shop and then you do have to get the remaining item at Walmart. I get it. Although, to be fair you can still order almost anything on the internet from a small guy somewhere. There are ways around Walmart. They&#39;re just not convenient. Oh, no. Let&#39;s not inconvenience ourselves to better our future.....jeeze. I&#39;m not saying it would be easy or convenient. I have a hard time with it myself; but I&#39;m working on it. It&#39;s doable though. Forethought about what you use/need is a of huge benefit.</p>

<p>Also why not start creating small business then....I&#39;m working on that too...takes time though; slow climb. It will happen though. Innovate. Create a way for consumers to escape walmart. It&#39;s getting to the point they might pay more if they have to just to fuck Walmart because well...fuck Walmart.</p>

<p>You know what I don&#39;t see enough of....Alternative burger joints...There&#39;s lot&#39;s of chains. I don&#39;t see a lot of people try to do it. It would be so easy though i think. Stiil there&#39;s a place around Indianapolis you&#39;ve probably never heard of called Boogie Burger...best burgers in town that I&#39;ve had so far....and I think there are more.</p>

<p>Lafayette has XXX (tripple X). It&#39;s a diner that serves burgers, and honestly. The prices at the fast food chains aren&#39;t really much better anymore from what I&#39;ve seen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought long and hard about your question before I even read it.. I could go on and on about what will not work to break their cycle. I have to put this  in very few words here or everyone will stop reading. There is only one power we still all have. We can reject whatever personality type we want to reject.
 Some of the personality types that we effectively and firmly reject to a point where they can no longer function in open society are , racists, homophobes, child molesters witch burners and cannibals.</p>

<p>No matter how powerful a leader is, he cannot function if he is known to be any of those types of person. He will be forced by our cumulative social pressure to step down.</p>

<p>We can depose, by societal pressure,  quickly and effectively, even the Pope if he is known to personally be any of those.</p>

<p>The problem that&#39;s causing all of your valid complaints is simple.</p>

<p>People  who seek leadership positions or positions that give them the power to punish others   are virtually all interested in the same thing, control of other people.</p>

<p>Their motivation is punishing people they don&#39;t like and rewarding those they do while controlling as many of those around them as completely as possible and accumulating as much wealth as possible while doing it.</p>

<p>Their greed for more and more power and more and more money cause them to have little respect or compassion for their subordinates. They are, or they become sociopaths.</p>

<p>We should reject the most common trait of the sociopath, greed. We should reject the excessively greedy, especially in leadership or law enforcement positions, the way we reject pedophiles from running day care centers and for nearly the same reason.</p>

<p>Greed causes every crime and every war.</p>

<p>Greed should be our target the sociopath in a leadership position should be the bulls eye and we should all do our best to make them unwelcome as leaders. My comment is becoming too long but there is a lot more to be said We CAN change the world to a massively better one. It just takes changing who is allowed to get  any new  leadership position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Greed is exactly the cause of all this and sociopaths are exactly the people running the show.  The amount of misery and suffering they inflict is so fucking cruel. If we could shame the greed that would be fantastic.  I dont think it can happen as everything in the media these people consume is about consuming more to find inner peace happiness and respect and power.  I know its all a lie.  Nothing I have ever bought has made me happy except for maybe a 6 pack and a pizza.  I haven&#39;t watched tv in over 2 years because I reached a point where everything enraged me. Even my favorite channels history and discovery and food network all turned into reality shit.  Constant beat of the drum time ticking down to imminent deadline and then all the propaganda shit on top of the reality shit.  The stars, celebrities, news anchors, politicians, talking heads all sicken me to my core. The people driving status symbols while kids in their own city are hungry sicken me. The churches exploiting the stupid and denying the needy sicken me. It seems there is nothing left that is not corrupted not a shame a scam a lie and absolute fraud.  </p>

<p>I think the solution to the greed is not shame them.  I think the only solution is make them fear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only way to make them fear is by everyone hating what they&#39;ve become. If there was a world culture of strongly opposing any abuse of power, and strongly opposing people who seek positions of more power, strongly people who are greedy for power and money, then we could reject the leaders that deserve to be rejected. We just need everyone to be on the same page, that&#39;s all. The internet makes this idea easier than ever to spread. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you may think you work harder than before. However really when you look back at our colonial days. They were working sun up to sundown behind a plow behind a horse planting by hand. Then having to bust ass on harvest by hand and hoping their crops survived from inclement weather. Else working in a mine digging ore/coal for paltry wage, and no medical as well. Dying in poor work conditions like collapsed mines or black ling disease or radiation or gas poisoning. Else you could be a woman who had a short life, and having to be a prostitute do to job discrimination, and having to feed a bunch of kids she had by all the shitty dads out there. Then died of STD&#39;s, or rape, or went off their rocker. you could be a ten year ld working sun up to sundown in a factory making cloth etc...getting no education or a meal to feed you.</p>

<p>Therefore think of that while you bitch about your shitty pay 40 hour woek week. While sitting at home by hind a computer drinking your beer and eating your chips.</p>

<p>Yeah if you could trade with those guys back then. Would you really? I&#39;m sure they would trade our situation in a heartbeat anytime.</p>

<p>Also if you think finding a job today was hard. it was just as hard back then. you had to forge your own living and dealt with the shitty hand given. If you think it is hard now. Just wait until the robot revolution renders everyone without work.</p>

I have no car payment no student loan debt no child support.  I pay rent and utilities.  Having a good job is not enough anymore.  And since the vast majority of jobs now are shit we are approaching a breaking point.  They cannot tax us anymore raise our rents anymore steal from us anymore because there is nothing left. I drive a 20 year old beater I wear clothes until they have holes in them. I cook 7 days a week.  I dont have a big screen tv or even a couch for that matter.  I am living as barebones as possible and its still not enough.  I have been in the workforce for 20 years now and I have taken 1 vacation. </p>

<p>Did you know around 1/3 of the country is currently unemployed or underemployed aka temp workers?  These people would love to work but there is no work to be had.  The amazing advances in technology will not apply to the poor aka the 99% .  The 1 % may be able to have clones and live to be 500 by harvesting organs.  They have no interest in the rest living any longer then 64 or until they are no longer profitable for the machine. </p>

<p>Your grandkids will likely be brown shirts or the resistance. </p>

<p>Also the 1% will be in for a wake up call. Hence the paradigm shift. They will not have any money in the future to by their organs or clones. Basically there will be no one working and no money to go around due to the lack of those making income. 1% people like The Waltons of Walmart will cease to exist from lack of such income coming in. They are basically shooting themselves in the foot..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll assume OP is a citizen of the United States.  The propaganda is working -- the propaganda that there is no other place to go.  There are other countries on this planet.  You could move to one of them.  People do it all the time.  Was a time people went to the United States because they lived in circumstances similar to yours, or even worse.  Now America is the sort of country one emigrates <em>from</em>.  Don&#39;t despair.  Do some research.  Go elsewhere.  It&#39;s a big world out there.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>When I was a kid, I remember whenever the Olympics came around, American TV shows like <em>20/20</em> and/or <em>60 Minutes</em> would do programs on the host countries.  I particularly remember when Lillehammer, <del>Iceland</del> Norway was the host country.  The American news programs did glossy travelogues of Iceland, but always made a point of hammering home how much people in the country paid in taxes -- far more than American.  The thing that was never pointed out was how the average employee was given 4-6 week paid vacations each year from their jobs, women enjoyed maternity leaves of up to five years with the ability to go back to their jobs, average bank accounts offered interest rates of 10% or more, there was universal health care, very low crime rates, oftentimes free post-secondary education.  All of those things were omitted in place of the mantra: &quot;high taxes!&quot;</p>

<p>Hell, Iceland had a financial meltdown like that in the U.S., but Iceland chose to arrest the bankers responsible and the government took over the respective banks.</p>

<p>There are other options.  Don&#39;t stay in the U.S. if you can find a way out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has always been a machine like this. Only before, the machine was a less painful machine for its cogs, in all the ways you mention. You could get more for doing the same amount of work. People could afford houses, take vacations, pay for their kids&#39; college, and retire.</p>

<p>Now... not so much, unless you&#39;re the 1%, maybe 5%.</p>

<p>What has happened is that big money has taken everything over, and big money got ever more greedy. Instead of getting their money the old-fashioned way (either earning it via good business ideas and sense or swindling people), they now simply use their money to bribe politicians to rig the system ever more in their favor... &quot;trickle down&quot; economics, but the trickling is urine rather than money.</p>

<p>There are few ways to escape the machine, and I don&#39;t think there are any ways to destroy it or change it substantially.</p>

<p>One way to escape the machine is death, but that option sucks so that&#39;s the last I&#39;ll mention it.</p>

<p>Another way is to figure out how to get insanely wealthy yourself. There are still business opportunities out there. There is still stuff to be invented. There are still million and billion dollar ideas to be implemented. They&#39;re few and far between, of course, but new members of the $100 million to $1 billion dollar club are being made every year, so it&#39;s still possible.</p>

<p>Perhaps the final way is to change the way you vote. Yes, the system is rigged. Yes, politicians are owned. And that&#39;s why the machine will never change so substantially that those with significant power could ever lose it.</p>

<p>However, the system can change. It can be brought back to a state in which the cogs can have a pleasantly comfortable life and do all the things they used to be able to do - vacations, home, college, etc. We just have to start voting, and voting our lot in life instead of the position we wish we had or might have someday, &quot;if only&quot;.</p>

<p>But even if we vote a democratic socialist like Bernie Sanders into the Presidency, it&#39;s not going to change overnight. The country didn&#39;t go from relatively painless to &quot;holy fuck this hurts&quot; overnight - it took decades of continually putting &quot;trickle down&quot; idiots into power to get it where it is now. We just might need decades of continually putting &quot;trickle up&quot; proponents into power, even if they refuse to outlaw abortion and will tax the living hell out of you if you ever win the lottery.</p>

<p>Voting still works. It still makes a difference.</p>

<p>If you disagree with that, consider how the nation would be different had McCain won in 2008.</p>

<p>Had McCain won, there would have been no ACA. This means that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>People would still be losing their health insurance when they get sick.</p></li>
<li><p>16.4 million fewer Americans would be insured.</p></li>
<li><p>The per-capita cost of health care would have risen at a much higher rate. It has risen at a much slower rate since the ACA was introduced than in the decade previous to its introduction - it has absolutely slowed the increase of health care costs.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Is the ACA perfect? Nope. It&#39;s still eminently possible to lose everything financially if you get sick enough. But when considering the relative positions of all the people of the nation before and after, it&#39;s a better situation because Obama was voted in than if McCain would have been voted in.</p>

<p>Does voting fundamentally change the structure of the economics of the nation? Nope. Never will.</p>

<p>Can voting make life noticeably better or worse for most Americans? Yep. Still does.</p>

<p>The Electoral College votes are tied exactly to the popular vote, by state, in every state. Some states it goes by percentage, some it&#39;s all to the victor, but it&#39;s no longer the system the Founding Fathers set up to protect the elite from the will (or drunkenness depending on what you read) of the masses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The parties are two sides of the same coin</p>

<p>This is why voting won&#39;t change the core of the system, but it still can change things that are superficial to the elite, but very impactful to us mensch. The elite give zero fucks about the ACA. Doesn&#39;t impact them in the slightest. Have it, don&#39;t have it, don&#39;t care. They&#39;re getting the best medical care either way.</p>
