       This an extremely controversial topic on this subreddit, and highly censored elsewhere on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed the huge push for vaccines across all media
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2umzpl/the_rall_front_page_is_covered_with_vaccine/">
        a couple months ago
       </a>
       , and had no real idea as to the depth of the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since then, I compiled a
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/32p9bz/searching_for_the_truth_about_vaccines/">
        list of research points
       </a>
       that were new to me prior to this, and not covered by the mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to get more advice and information, I asked
       <a href="/r/medicine">
        /r/medicine
       </a>
       for their opinion on my research points, and was
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/32tyjn/the_mods_at_rmedicine_shadowdeleted_my/">
        banned and told I had mental health issues
       </a>
       . I've since written some more on the
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/33jabt/welcome_to_the_twilight_zone_of_medicine_where_a/">
        extreme bias present surrounding this topic
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       For references, I recommend starting with the book
       <strong>
        Dissolving Illusions
       </strong>
       by Suzanne Humphries, MD and Roman Bystrianyk. You can also check out this
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLrqmvjrIjI&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;list=PLgH2vCx5TOgX5upobA1NO--PyE60CLlVa">
        lecture from Suzanne Humphries on her personal experiences with how vaccines interacted with her specialty, nephrology
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       An excellent source I was just shown is this
       <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/guide/health-guide-vaccine-research">
        Health Guide: Vaccine Research
       </a>
       that attempts to compile information for every single disease, vaccine, and problem substance included in vaccines. Along those same lines is this
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqQQFOVUZBLjhPvVhKUsvnpSgetLCcdy3">
        lecture series on vaccines and health
       </a>
       , to help you make your decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck, find as much information as you can, and trust yourself.

       You should do the research into each vaccine for yourself and make a decision about each vaccine individually: Safe and Effective or Potentially Unsafe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you should go to a doctor
       <strong>
        that you trust
       </strong>
       and for the ones you think are safe and effective, get them. And for the ones you think are potentially unsafe, you should show that doctor the information you found, explain why you're troubled by it, and see what s/he says, then refine your decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should trust nobody...
       <strong>
        nobody
       </strong>
       ... to make decisions about your child's health, other than you and his mother, assuming you are both intelligent and diligently inform yourselves. (Part of that informing yourself is necessarily speaking with experts you trust.)

       The problem is that the legislation being put forth (e.g., SB277 in California) require all vaccination -- even for non communicable diseases -- before education. Being vaxed at age 5 for a sexually transmitted disease (hep b) is more important than learning how to read. It just doesn't make sense. But if you say that, you're called a nut, a kook, or compared to Jenny McCarthy in an unfavorable light. It's a freaking witch hunt funded by the pharmaceutical companies. As such, even asking the question or thinking alternatively than the mainstream story is avoided by doctors.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP: I highly recommend looking at the Japanese vax schedule. Vaccination as a practice is great. Vaccination as it is practiced at the moment is seriously suspect.

       Not before education. Before going into the school.
      </p>
      <p>
       The California legislation you referenced does not require vaccination to take advantage of the at-home education offered by the schools. This is teacher-led and covers the same materials as the usual classes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing the California bill requires vaccination for is the daytime babysitting benefit of sending your kid to the school building.

       I agree with this. Most anti-vaxxers just don't want the vaccines to be forced on us. But it would be stupid to deny the benefit that some vaccines have.
      </p>
      <p>
       But make sure the vaccines are spread out, that is the most important part.

       After years of research I've found conclusively that the risk of vaccines in the First World is greater than any theoretical benefit.  However, in the malnourished Third World there is an exception.

       My fiance made the decision to vaccinate and not a day goes by that her bad decision doesn't bring her to uncontrollable crying and tears. She thinks  that she damaged him for life.

       We'll have to see how severe the autism is (God forbid) once he's old enough. I'm pretty sure that he has it because he woke up the next day as a
       <strong>
        totally different child
       </strong>
       ; distant, not continuously happy, etc. I'm documenting every day that goes by since he was damaged by the shots.

       Parents, why take the chance to have what happened to my boy happen to yours to prevent some basically non-existent 19th century diseases that are readily cured with conventional medicine? It's asinine...nothing more than Russian Roulette with your kids' mind.

       If anything at least go for the compromise and spread the vaccinations out a bit and wait until the kid actually requires them.
      </p>

       I've heard doctors express concern over giving infants things like a hep b shot. It's just not necessary. And these schedules that involve multiple immunizations at once are not necessary either.

       This is kind of how I feel about it also.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no reason to stack so many vaccines at once, they aren't tested like that and shouldn't be used like that.  Spread them out, japan has a much more reasonable vaccine schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also distrust a lot of the multivacs.  You can get vaccinated for measles mumps and rubella without taking the MMR vaccine.  You probably even end up with a higher chance of actually developing an immunity to these when done separately.

       The dangers of the vaccines far outweigh any minor risks of mild illnesses such as Measles, Mumps and Rubella.  Unless we had a safe way of protecting against them it's not worth thinking about.  Whereas Cancer, Lifelong Vaccine Damage and Car Crashes are all serious dangers which destroy people's lives.

       My child is now an adult. I wasn't aware of the dangers of vax until the last few years. I feel I am responsible of hurting my child because of my poor informed decisions. He suffers bad allergies yearly, started to stutter 2 weeks after given the the first round of HPV vax, and has suffered on/off depression and brain cloudiness. I do believe the vax, flouride, and gmos are to blame.

       Why do you believe those things affected your child specifically, but they do not affect a massive percentage of the population that is about the same age, in the same manner?

       Why do you think everything would affect everyone the same or similar ways?

      <p>
       Look at SSRIs, the range of side effects is huge. From ED to suicide and just about everything in between. Do you think that just because it happens to one person then it has to happen to all or even many?

       Absolutely, I agree with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure it changes the argument at all though. I figured that was just obvious or else the side effects would be far more common. It applies the same to SSRIs where no one disagrees about the severity of the side effects.

       You know I bet you're right. Next time you break your arm just don't bother going to the doctor. Just set that bitch yourself and splint it as best as you can. No need to get things like x-rays to see if there's any other damage. Big Pharma would probably fake the x-ray anyway.
