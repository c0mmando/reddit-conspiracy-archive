    <div class="md"><p>I feel it&#39;s dangerous to presume that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> knows what is really going on in this world. </p>

<p>Good thing about <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is that it keeps questioning the official narrative on everything. If that would be the lesson that people would pick up - to be skeptical of everything - that would be a great thing.</p>

<p>Where <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> fails is that it keeps offering unprovable, irrational, untestable alternative narratives to the official ones. Those alternatives are often darker and more pessimistic. Believing that those unproven alternative narratives are the reality is even much more dangerous to individuals and the society.</p>

<p>But where <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> fails the most is that it rejects skepticism and questioning of alternative narratives. As long as the theory disagrees with the official narrative, it becomes beyond reproach and anybody questioning it is a shill or a sheep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those of us who think, do not believe in reptilians but can see it&#39;s a metaphor for a esoteric belief of Cain and Abel. There is a lot of dumb shit here, but from the people I&#39;ve talk to, they get this. We, the regular contributors get it. The outsiders and trolls like fill the sub with retardedness. If you do not know esoteric history and cannot read between the lines, you probably shouldn&#39;t be here. I know, it makes it hard for newcomers, but, you need a platform, you need to rise through awareness before you can set out. This is something I encourage all. You cannot just lurk here and think you are awake, you need to dig deep yourself and dive down as many rabbit holes you can. Personal experience, not some reatrded youtube video about the end of times and reptiles in gov. Shit is much deeper and if you know esoteric history, you&#39;d get it. That&#39;s my beef. </p>

<p>There are many alternative histories offered. Most of them based on lots of anecdotes connected by some tenuous logic. They sound ok on the surface but fall apart under any more serious scrutiny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read the books the Free Mason&#39;s read. My grand father was a Free Mason and passed a book down to me (not sure why). He left it to me and it talked of what I&#39;m talking about. They actually believe and pass around this knowledge. I&#39;d copy it and post it online, but I don&#39;t want to be sued. They teach something so drastically different than what the &quot;commons&quot; know. People believe in the church, they teach how the church was infiltrated based on the knights Templar who raided Salomon&#39;s temple and blackmailed the church. Take what I have to say with a grain of salt, but I was passed a book. Maybe, I will annon upload it to uTorrent, idk. </p>

<p>Edit: I think he passed it down to me because I was his favorite grand son and was a scholar of history, I was in college at the time to be an archaeologist. He broke a brotherhood law though, idk. He wanted me to have this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a great example! Every bloody religion, current and past; every sect, cult, secret society, and dictator; every conspiratard who is trying to sell books and seminars; they all have their own version of some historical events.</p>

<p>Why would the freemason&#39;s one be the right one? It&#39;s the same bullshit as every other. Anecdotes, tenuous connections, and claims of insider knowledge without any hard evidence.</p>

<p>I am  a member of a secret society. As in really secret society. Not a &quot;secret&quot; society like freemasons. My society came from the 19th century American strongmen and Russian bear tamers. They are the real leaders of the world. You can trace genealogy of most powerful people to at least one strongmen or a bear tamer. German iron industry in late 19th early 20th century stated influencing the price of iron which was used for strongmen&#39;s weight&#39;s and bear shackles. Russians and Americans then orchestrated WWI and WWII in order to reduce Germany&#39;s influence over cast iron prices. After that in order to prevent each other encroaching on other&#39;s market, they started the Cold War. Once you know the history of the strongmen, every other world event becomes clear and you can see the real truth. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t share more. Exposing our secrets might lead to me ending up twisted like a pretzel.</p>

<p>Because they have access to occult knowledge that has been passed down over hundreds of years. There is a reason most of the powerful people on the planet are freemasons. </p>

<p>Strongmen is the second oldest profession. When first Australophitecus came down from trees 4 million years ago, their alpha-males had strongmen supporting them.

<p>&quot;Powerful&quot; freemasons are controlled by Jews. Everybody knows that. Some suspicions are coming out that Jews are being controlled by the lizard people. But what nobody knows is that lizards are being controlled by us. Freemasons are nothing but a middle management for us.</p>

<p>So say you. There are many mysteries to the pyramids, and if their predecessors were the builders that&#39;s definitely something relevant...</p>

<p>You&#39;re insinuating that freemasons are basically just the current alpha males in society, while conveniently sidestepping their connection to ancient knowledge...It&#39;s not a simple might makes right.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Actually the highest level freemasons graduate to knights templar. Which has nothing to do with jews, at all. Jews are definitely the current strongmen in the world, but freemasonry is not &quot;controlled&quot; by jews so much as works closely with them.</p>

<p>Only Alex and I survived. There was no economy in our war-torn country after the war finished, so Alex and I continued fighting. We ended up working undercover in drug gangs, fighting around the world as mercenaries, rescuing kidnapped people from Mexico to Philippines... For 20 years we risked our lives. We were shot at more times than a target at a Texas gun range. And we survived it all.
We retired. Alex started getting involved in conspiracies. Started researching it on the Internet. Started &quot;investigating&quot; things... At first he started skipping our daily ocean sunset beers. Our catch ups started getting less and less frequent. Until he stopped showing up and answering his phone all together. Few weeks later he blew his brains out.

    <div class="md"><p>Your statements are examples of dangerous thinking that permeates <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

<p>Rothschilds are a very rich old family. They did finance wars and likely try to manipulate country-level financial systems at some time. However, the current conspiratard bullshit of them owning almost all of the central banks etc. are easy to check. </p>

<p>Problem is, people like you don&#39;t bother to check. You hear something that sounds interesting. You get excited about suddenly being one of the small group of people &quot;in the know&quot;. You start following sources from one to another not realizing that all of those sources only keep reinforcing the same set of beliefs. At no point in time did you try and escape that confirmation bias and look for evidence that you might be wrong.</p>

<p>You get emotionally invested in that story and keep seeking other similar stories. You get a bit of a rush every time you &quot;uncover&quot; something new. You keep seeking only information the confirms your newly found beliefs. If new information confirms your beliefs, you uncritically accept is as a fact. If suddenly someone offers you information that goes against your belief, you start asking for an impossible level of evidence (like asking me to give you some kind of proof for all the crap here). Even if the evidence would slap you in the face, you would still reject it proud in your ability to resist mind control/shills.</p>

<p>The problem for you starts once you get so deep in those stories that you start seeing shadows everywhere; you start living in fear from martial law/mass murder/alien invasion/enslavement by illuminati; you get depressed; you start explaining everything negative that happens to you or people around you through conspiracy... End result is that you and people that care about you become increasingly unhappy. Sometimes to the point of serious mental problems and even suicide.</p>

<p>By all means, keep questioning official narratives, but be careful about uncritically accepting alternative narratives that sounds good but are not supported by strong, testable evidence. Critically evaluate everything. Not just the official narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a very good point. Conspiracy skeptics can also go overboard in their conviction that they are right without being able to evidence it.</p>

<p>On all sides it&#39;s ideal to have a healthy dose of skepticism combined with mental maturity and self confidence to be able to constantly question your opinion and change it if better evidence comes along.</p>

<p>However, the current conspiratard bullshit of them owning almost all of the central banks etc. are easy to check.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep, it is easy to check, and checks out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Problem is, people like you don&#39;t bother to check. You hear something that sounds interesting. You get excited about suddenly being one of the small group of people &quot;in the know&quot;. You start following sources from one to another not realizing that all of those sources only keep reinforcing the same set of beliefs. At no point in time did you try and escape that confirmation bias and look for evidence that you might be wrong.
You get emotionally invested in that story and keep seeking other similar stories. You get a bit of a rush every time you &quot;uncover&quot; something new. You keep seeking only information the confirms your newly found beliefs. If new information confirms your beliefs, you uncritically accept is as a fact. If suddenly someone offers you information that goes against your belief, you start asking for an impossible level of evidence (like asking me to give you some kind of proof for all the crap here). Even if the evidence would slap you in the face, you would still reject it proud in your ability to resist mind control/shills.
The problem for you starts once you get so deep in those stories that you start seeing shadows everywhere; you start living in fear from martial law/mass murder/alien invasion/enslavement by illuminati; you get depressed; you start explaining everything negative that happens to you or people around you through conspiracy... End result is that you and people that care about you become increasingly unhappy. Sometimes to the point of serious mental problems and even suicide.
By all means, keep questioning official narratives, but be careful about uncritically accepting alternative narratives that sounds good but are not supported by strong, testable evidence. Critically evaluate everything. Not just the official narrative.</p>

<p>The problem with the above text is that you make MASSIVE assumptions about who I am based on how you <strong>assume</strong> most &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; work. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Totally incorrect, every sentence.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again, every sentence is totally incorrect, at least for myself.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve honestly never been happier, I consistently critically evaluate everything, and will only connect dots together if they truly deserve to be connected. You don&#39;t know who I am any more than I know who you are, so take a rest on the assumptions pal. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>By all means, keep questioning official narratives, but be careful about uncritically accepting alternative narratives that sounds good but are not supported by strong, testable evidence. Critically evaluate everything. Not just the official narrative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You SAY this, but honestly it seems you need to apply this logic to yourself.</p>

<p>Tell me, what are your thoughts on the official conspiracy theory of 9/11 i.e. the government&#39;s story?</p>

<p>I bet you believe it, which just goes to show the hypocrite you are if you want to &quot;critically evaluate everything&quot;. </p>

<p>EDIT: Ahahahahahah you got gilded twice in this thread, while holding views totally inconsistent with what the general population of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> holds.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so blatantly obvious you and the boys at &quot;topmindsofreddit&quot; are gaming this thread. So blatant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, people are inherently afraid of the truth. If you understand the truth of things, it&#39;s a heavy burden, which is why people do not seek it. Which, sadly is why there are classes (hierarchy) in society. The majority do not wanna know, they just want peace of mind, food in their bellies, entertainment and sex. Those at the top, truly know what is going down. It&#39;s human nature and has always been this way. There are always leaders and followers. You cannot change this in human nature, sadly. I wish people could change, but, I&#39;ve been down too many rabbit holes which leads me to my opinion. It wont change because people simply cannot handle the change, it goes against their nature. It would take one huge event or a miracle to change this.... sigh.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying conspiracy theorist are superior, we just are critical and commentate on society.  The majority don&#39;t listen or care and the upper class continue on.

    <div class="md"><p>There are many different ways to approach this question. </p>

<p>A kid living in the ghetto, for instance, may not have researched conspiracies throughout history and may be less familiar with some of the academic topics that get thrown around here, but he also <em>lives</em> the conspiracy day-to-day and sees how power corrupts, how capitalism exploits, etc. </p>

<p>Another example is southerners in the US who were born into families that emphasize gun rights, state&#39;s rights, land ownership, etc. When I was younger I used to laugh at these people, but realistically they are red-pill from the get go and are naturally mistrustful of government.</p>

<p>Then you have people in the upper class (whom I was around as an undergraduate). Some are spoiled and generally out of it, but surprisingly many of them know how shit works. I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re awake in that they believe in conspiracies, etc., but rather their mindset is to watch out for themselves and perpetuate their power, etc. </p>

<p>So basically, I think it&#39;s possible to take the red pill without necessarily being a conspiracy theorist. There are large segments of the population who actually think this way (maybe not about specific conspiracies, but everything else) from birth. </p>

<p>So say you. There are many mysteries to the pyramids, and if their predecessors were the builders that&#39;s definitely something relevant...</p>

<p>You&#39;re insinuating that freemasons are basically just the current alpha males in society, while conveniently sidestepping their connection to ancient knowledge...It&#39;s not a simple might makes right.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Actually the highest level freemasons graduate to knights templar. Which has nothing to do with jews, at all. Jews are definitely the current strongmen in the world, but freemasonry is not &quot;controlled&quot; by jews so much as works closely with them.</p>

<p>Now I know you&#39;re trolling. Gotta love RES tagging. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a very good point. Conspiracy skeptics can also go overboard in their conviction that they are right without being able to evidence it.</p>

<p>On all sides it&#39;s ideal to have a healthy dose of skepticism combined with mental maturity and self confidence to be able to constantly question your opinion and change it if better evidence comes along.</p>
