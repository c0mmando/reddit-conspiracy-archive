        QUESTION: Given that, according to the Pentagon Building Performance Report, "
        <a href="http://www.twf.org/News/Y2003/01-PBPR.pdf">
         the aircraft frame most certainly was destroyed before it had traveled a distance that approximately equaled the length of the aircraft (p. 40)
        </a>
        ", and that "it is highly unlikely that any significant portion of the fuselage could have retained structural integrity at this point in its travel (p. 40)", can you explain what caused the most perfectly round exit hole in the outer wall of the C-Ring?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        QUESTION: Given that the maximum fluctuation between the two cameras would translate in a difference of 25 feet in the position of the plane, can you provide a valid explanation for the large discrepancy between the two corresponding frames (23:19)? Absent a valid explanation for this discrepancy, we must conclude that at least one of the two frames is the result of intentional manipulation, or "photoshopping".

        The "Sagging Trusses" Theory: Problem - 1. No proof of insulation "widely dislodged". 2. No proof of temperatures above 250ºC (480ºF) (1:10:58)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        QUESTION: Can you provide any evidence that the fireproofing from the steel trusses was "widely dislodged" by the impact of the planes, which NIST has made a necessary condition for the collapses to be caused by fire? (1:14:48)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        QUESTION: Can you provide any evidence that the temperatures in the Twin Towers were high enough, and lasted long enough, to seriously weaken steel in the areas where the initial collapses occurred? (1:14:51)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        QUESTION: Can explain how a sagging truss weakened by heat could pull and eventually break apart the structure it is attached to with no external force being applied to it? (1:15:00)

        QUESTION: Given that "the building section above came down essentially in freefall" (Source:
        <a href="http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=909017">
         NIST NCSTAR1 - p. 146
        </a>
        ); given that for freefall to occur no supporting structure must be present; and given that the falling sections did not have any extra energy to destroy the structure below, can you suggest anything different from some kind of demolition for the removal of the supporting structure which was necessary for near freefall speed to be achieved?

        QUESTION: Given that after the initial explosion and the ensuing fires there wouldn't have been enough jet fuel left to pour down the elevator shafts in substantial quantities, can you explain the at least three separate explosions reported by multiple witnesses at the time of the first impact in the North Tower?

       I recommend this film highly to anyone why runs into debunkers and skeptics on a regular basis. It outlines all the problems with the NIST report and formalizes a vocabulary for talking about the discrepancies between historical reality and the official story. It's fact and evidence based and doesn't get all into speculating about who orchestrated the attacks. This is the best film I've found for clarifying the problems with the government's version of 9-11.

       Some people have issues with that, thinking the info should be free, i get that point of view, but the interview gives you enough insight to what the books about, and she seems to know her stuff.

       Thats the thing. What makes you think he hasn't. The guy is the founder of sceptic.com and has dedicated his career to learning how to tell fact from fiction. Anyway, it doesn't matter how many bullshit conspiracy theories are debunked. You guys will just point to some other crap because you's can't take no conspiracy for an answer.

       Honestly, I don't think I need to. If you notice, a lot of what Shermer suggests is basic common sense. People can't keep their mouth shut. It's human nature. People want to be in the limelight and something like this... If this was was an inside job, one of those people would have come out with the truth. At least anonymously. It's too massive of a job to pull off. That's why it would never be attempted. Also, you take things like hindsight bias into account and its easy to say this plane should have been shot down or that should have been done but it's not that easy to make the perfect snap decisions in the heat of the moment. Especially one like taking a plane down.

       People absolutely can keep their mouth shut.

      <p>
       You have to understand that these people are a different class. We are like ants to them. They don't want to be in our 'limelight' any more than I want to sacrifice myself to save a colony of ants.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want the respect of their fellow elite, and they don't want to die. Because death is ultimately what awaits anyone who speaks up. Do it anonymously you say? And who would believe it. It would just be a 'crazy conspiracy'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, there has been whistle blowers. Look up former FBI translator Sibel Edmunds, who has exposed the Gladio/ Gladio B operations, in which intelligence agencies organised terrorist attacks across the globe. She was translating messages from the CIA to Ayman Al-Zawahiri right up to 9/11 for Christ's sake. Yet nobody pays any attention to her, except 'crazy conspiracy theorists'.

       You are quoting Shermer?  Why not quote Popular Mechanics also?  You know the article, the one penned by Benjamin Chertoff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is related to the Secretary of Homeland Security at the time Michael Chertoff.  Of course Benjamin denied relation at first, but later said, if you look, you will find there is a relation there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conflict of interest would be an understatement.   But every member of the 9/11 commission had that issue to deal with also, the whole conflict of interest thing, so whats the big deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not like they appointed Henry Kissinger to run the commission or something.  That would just have the baloney detection radar going off the chart .........
      </p>
      <p>
       The Manhattan project employed how many people, and they kept it secret from at least the American people,  not so much the Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Operation Northwoods wasn't made public until......  and the Gulf of Tonken was ..........
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for setting me straight.  Shermer is the man of ultimate truth, a stud, and will never be a good politician because he is too honest.  And common sensical.  Post his explainations to the questions posed by the OP and watch the conspiracy people shake and cower in fear.  You are quoting the all mighty Shermer.
      </p>
      <p>
       And he has a good reason why the Pentagon tapes have never been released.  13.5 years later.  Because the national security excuse aint cutting it.  The building was already hit, and  there are so many simulations on you tube, there is nothing anyone will learn, except what actually happened.

       Mate... Ill be frank with you. I haven't delvd deep into the nitty gritty of it all so I can't comment on specifics and one of the reason's why is because there's just so many different stories and little conspiracies that just keep getting piled on which honestly makes it all seem like people are just grasping at straws. I mean, just look at this post. I don't know, maybe this is something that you can only be sure about if you really get into all the pieces of information like it seem's you have so I'm sorry if it seem's I'm making rash decisions but my reasoning has me leaning in favour of what Shermer has to say because for example... conspiracy theorists claim explosives right, but every building that has come down through the use of explosives crumbled from the bottom and instead of accepting that, they will cling to it and point to little puffs of smoke at different levels while its crumbling as proof of explosives which is just bullshit to even suggest.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, unless I go calculating and sifting through photo's and video's myself, isn't that how most people come to their conclusions... By considering what brighter minds have to say on issue's. So in this case, It's the conspiracy theorists... Who make bullshit claims all the time that are constantly debunked and are constantly changing their stories or someone who is known to make logical rational sense on different topics.

       The NIST account and the 9/11 Commission Report are the definitive accounts of the events on September 11 2001, and are well supported by science. Just because there are two thousand "engineers" who disagree doesn't mean that the accepted narrative of 9/11 is completely incorrect. Many of those "engineers" dispute the NIST account based on complete fabrications, misunderstandings, strawmen, or other imagined descriptions.

       And what did he claim that light was prior to impact from four different camera angles?  Its not a  reflection if its coming from four different angles.  It does actually reflect on the airplane though.  And oddly enough, looks like it is coming out of that darn pod thing that shouldn't be there.  Surely there has to be a Shermer excuse for that.  Lay it on us.

       You do know this is the conspiracy sub.  Oh wait you do, you are bringing a bigger conspiracy theory with Shermer than the ones actually investagating it independantely.

       It takes a much bigger leap of faith and stretch of the imagination to believe what he is slinging than what the independant researcher is using scientific data to make their claims.  Nice comment.

       I didn't agree with it at first either, and was out to disprove it the first time I heard anything about it back in 02.  I couldn't.  And it pissed me off, so I dug harder.  Keeping an open mind about things, and not just accepting things because someone was asserting knowledge of it.  When looked at just as far as an evidence standpoint, I cant tell you what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can tell you the investagation was a sham, and we need a new one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shermer is an obvious hack, but is effective on the surface.  Until you dig into what he is actually saying and realize it doesn't hold up under scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 911 inside job thing is craziness, but whats even crazier is the official theory relies on computer simulations that no one can see the software on, and law of physics taking a leave of abscence that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will be the first to admit that I dont agree with all the "truther" sites out there, but the fact of the matter is, there are so many holes in the story, all unrelated, so its not like solving one would solve them all.  It takes a bigger leap of faith to believe the official story and the lack of science they have, than to believe what your eyes see.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is easy to see a stupid theory like no planes, and dismiss the other things, than to accept an ugly truth, I dont blame the people that do.  But for the official theory to be correct, all of the other theorys have to wrong, and just one of the other theorys have to right to disprove the official theory.
