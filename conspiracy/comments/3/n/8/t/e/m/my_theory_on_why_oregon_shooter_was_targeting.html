       It's common knowledge that all of these mass school shootings are either fake or carried out by mentally ill people coached and activated by military psyops groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is why in this specific narrative was the gunman targeting Christians only? The goal here was to demonize guns in the eyes of Christians so that the largest politically active group in America, Christians, demand stricter gun laws. Christian groups control most of U.S. domestic and foreign policy, see their undying support for Israel/Zionism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now these Christians are going to be feeling persecuted, and they'll be begging congress to pass strict gun laws to protect them.

       My theory is that the shooter was a atheist prick, not just any atheist but the kind you run into from time to time that seem to get offended and butthurt that other people out there don't agree with their edgy 19 year old logic.

       I'm sorry your mommy made you go to church pepe! She probably wanted you to grow up and be a moral and productive member of society instead the kind of entitled prick that shoots people to death because being good at video games doesn't earn you a girlfriend.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't view all atheist this way folks, but I've definitely had some run ins with atheists who aren't happy with just making a personal choice to denounce god, there is always that one guy who wants to make it personal and actively hate people who do believe in god.

       Eric Harris was raised Presbyterian, Klebold in a Jewish household. It doesn't take much research to see that they eventually grew into agnostic/atheist/nihilist leanings.
      </p>
      <p>
       They did not attack a "bible study group" first. They shot Rachel Scott and Richard Castaldo, who were eating lunch together.
      </p>
      <p>
       That wasn't even premeditated. They had placed giant propane bombs in the cafeteria adjacent to load-bearing columns. They were waiting for the bombs to explode, after which they would pick off people running out of the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Entering the school at all was plan B, made up on the spot after the bombs were duds.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're all just lucky that Harris was completely ineffective at constructing the propane bombs, or the death toll would have been in the hundreds.

       You said "began their killing spree by shooting up a bible study group"
      </p>
      <p>
       All I did was point out that this is not how the shooting began, nor would it have been their intention.
      </p>
      <p>
       While they did hate religion, jocks, and occasionally minorities (Klebold didn't seem to express racist sentiment to his journals and transcripts of their tapes IIRC, Harris contradictorily railed against racism while at other times using epithets), what Eric Harris really hated was humanity as a whole. He was a massive psychopath, Klebold a suicidal depressive.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't give two shits about "the occult" as posited in your bullshit article.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "Do you believe in God" interaction never took place with Cassie Bernall. Klebold asked this of Valeen Schnurr.
      </p>
      <p>
       Schnurr replied "Yes, I believe in God"
      </p>
      <p>
       Klebold asked "Why?" while reloading a gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Schnurr told him that was how she was raised.

       I recommend you read the most comprehensive, journalistic coverage of Columbine ever written by Dave Cullen:
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_(book)">
        https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_(book)
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It debunks most of the myths and media mistakes during the early aftermath of the tragedy.

       I think its important that we recognize as conspiracy theorists, we have been staring into the abyss for a very long time.  Its plausible that the abyss has stared back into us already and we just haven't noticed as of yet.

       I would relate it more to the lack of evidence I've seen that it was fake.

       Sandy hook had some major fuckery going on with the phantom suspect they chased through the woods, the CCTV surveillance of lanza and 2 unknowns going into dicks sporting goods to buy ammo/guns.  So while I DO think that real kids were really killed at sandy hook elementary school, there is enough evidence that it was more complex than Adam lanza having a bad day for me to continue looking into it.

       Fair enough, thank you. I think it's still a little naive to automatically trust the mainstream media's portrayal of anything, until proven otherwise, but that's ok.

       Is there an event that you have seen enough evidence to conclude it to be a complete fake you can share?

       The active drill is suspect.  The proximity of the FBI and tsarnev brothers before the event is suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I feel like the crisis actor theories are too extreme, even if true, to motivate an appropriate reaction from people looking into the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said I think people were really injured at the bombing.

      <p>
       I think its very possible that
      </p>
      <p>
       A) the FBI knew about the plot beforehand and did nothing to stop it for whatever twisted reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) the brothers were CIs for the FBI or were a part of what they were lead to believe was a drill.  In other words they thought they had a fake bomb and were just a part of a drill.
      </p>
      <p>
       C) some other agency either foreign or domestic radicalized the brothers and assisted them in carrying out the attack.

My guns are legal and I carry, the only way to end this is to open medical records to gun  purchase backgrounds. And we all know that ain't gonna happen. Fight that fight, it's the only way..
