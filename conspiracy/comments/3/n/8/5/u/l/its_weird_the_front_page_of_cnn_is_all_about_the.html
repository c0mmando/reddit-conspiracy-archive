    <div class="md"><p>I am so embarrassed by my participation in this sub after any major news event. I guess today is going to be a downvote day for me. I&#39;ll be sending prayers to the victims, but I need to rant too. </p>

<hr/>

<p>You guys think anyone in America who isn&#39;t &#39;one of us&#39; here in the Conspiracy world is paying attention <em>at all</em> to what Putin says - shooting or not? </p>

<p><strong><em>No.</em></strong></p>

<p>No one cares about Putin in the States, or at the very least, such a wide majority doesn&#39;t that &quot;no one&quot; is accurate enough.</p>

<p>The government doesn&#39;t need an event to distract people from Russia or Putin: People don&#39;t <em>care</em> about them already. As if the government needs our approval to go to war. Or to exercise global policy. Hardly. You guys know this: The citizens don&#39;t get a say in any of it anyway. It&#39;s mind-boggling that you&#39;ll hold that view on one hand, but on the other the government <em>has to</em> pull these little &#39;false flag shootings&#39; all the time to <em>convince us</em> of... something. </p>

<p><strong>Even though the only thing that ever happens as a result of these tragedies is people are dead, a suspect might get arrested, and – oh right – gun laws don&#39;t change.</strong></p>

<p>They don&#39;t <em>need</em> these events to distract anyone.</p>

<p>At least no one&#39;s calling it a &#39;hoax shooting&#39; – <em>yet</em>. It&#39;s only a matter of time before that bit of mockery becomes the new &quot;Sandy Hook&quot;. </p>

<p>And once more &quot;we&quot; (those of you guilty) will engage in a round of &#39;look at that shadow - must be a set&#39; or &#39;look at that jacket - it&#39;s a different color in this frame&#39; and pat yourselves on the back for a job well done exposing some &#39;false flag&#39;, ostensibly for the purposes of &#39;taking the guns&#39; - <em>which, despite mass shootings once-a-month for the past few <del>years</del> decades, hasn&#39;t even come close to happening, and in fact, gun laws have been relaxed steadily over time</em>. </p>

<p>You people who do this (and you all bloody-well know who you are) - you push this nonsense immediately, <strong>as if nothing bad ever happened because of mental instability or simple malice.</strong> That&#39;s the common thread among all these shooting events and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>: None of them could <em>possibly</em> be just &#39;a bad thing&#39;. It <em>has</em> to be some agenda. <strong>Must</strong> be some agenda at play. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a bit of a psychological fuckery going on in that: You&#39;re actually convincing yourselves that evil and wrongdoing <em>don&#39;t rightly exist</em>, unless the wrongdoers are &quot;one of them&quot;. I cannot begin to fathom the amount of paranoia one must be suffering from to actually, honestly accept that notion with every, single, tragic event.</p>

<p>Edit: <em>Upvotes?!</em> Guys, you&#39;re making me tear up here. I&#39;m proud of you. </p>

<p>Edit again: There we go. That&#39;s more inline with what I expected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you talk as if the media is blameless and covering this mass shooting is more important than any other geopolitical issues. This is a sensationalized event, and there is a problem with it dominating the news to the exclusion of anything else. How many people were killed in Chicago last weekend? Is this shooting really more important than anything else happening out there? No. Therefore there is a reason to converse on the idea that this event, real or not, is being used to increase ratings on one end of the conspiracy scale, up to covering something else up on the higher end of the scale. Trying to blame people in a conspiracy sub for discussing possible conspiracies, media or otherwise is at least useless and more likely is simply a way to try to shut down relevant conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Note that you&#39;re bringing up issues <em>wholly unrelated</em> to OP&#39;s post. OP didn&#39;t bring up the media, he brought up Putin and the Middle East. </p>

<p>If you want to talk about the media sensationalizing shooters and how that&#39;s a bad thing, I&#39;ll likely agree with everything you say. </p>

<p>If you want to discuss the event and the circumstances, I&#39;ll participate. </p>

<p>But if you come in here and assert that this event was meant to distract from a speech a Russian president said <em>over a year ago</em>, then you can read everything I wrote and direct it right at you. Of course the front page of CNN is discussing the major news of America <em>today</em>, and not <em>a year ago</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what? Honestly - so what? </p>

<p>The American populace, by and large, doesn&#39;t care about what happens abroad. They never have, so long as it doesn&#39;t happen here. This has been evidenced time and time again since we left Vietnam. So long as we&#39;re not <em>drafting men</em> for the war effort, no one cares. That&#39;s a fact.</p>

<p>They&#39;re not trying to &#39;distract&#39;. There is no &quot;they&quot;. This is just a tragic event that happened to occur during an ongoing conflict - wholly unrelated events. </p>

<p>There have been 45 school shootings this year <em>alone</em>: Are they all meant to distract from the ISIS issue? Surely ISIS has been at play longer than just 2015?</p>

<p>No. Just no. Stop trying to leverage a tragedy to fit your narrative. </p>

<p>You are no better than the politicians when you do that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um I never said it was a planned distraction, just that the media coverage is remarkable and enough to comment on. Some will say it is pre-planned, some won&#39;t. Doesn&#39;t mean we should not discuss it. You seem awfully worried about what people discuss here, and I don&#39;t think you are the arbiter of what is proper or not to think about. I agree people don&#39;t care, why is that? I assume you would say it is because people are stupid or some other reason, I might think it has been engineered to be so. There is no &quot;they&quot;? That is where you lose me entirely. Of course there is, there are multiple &quot;theys&quot;. They may not be working in concert, but they are working, and they do affect the population and the world at large. The media is one of &quot;them&quot;, I am sure you could name a few others if you wanted to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re really just waffling here without making a point one way or the other. </p>

<p>When I said &quot;There is no &#39;they&#39;&quot;, I was referring to <em>this specific event</em>. It wasn&#39;t a planned event, ergo, there is no &#39;they&#39; who planned it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t care what people think, though I encourage people to think reasonably and rationally, not just attribute every tragedy to some greater evil we can&#39;t rightly see. </p>

<p>Yes, the media coverage is remarkable. Ten or more people were shot on a college campus. It&#39;s a remarkable event. So? Is your point really that &#39;media coverage == distraction&#39;? </p>

<p>I think people don&#39;t care because they&#39;re distracted. I think I&#39;ve been clear on this elsewhere. Nothing to do with being stupid: Smart people get distracted easily too. But you can assume I just think they&#39;re stupid. Assume what you like: gotta make those strawman arguments. </p>

<p>Yes, I can name many &quot;theys&quot;. SJWs, Conspiracy Theorists, Republicans, Catholics, Islamists, Australians, Sorority Girls... They&#39;re all &#39;they&#39;. Doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re all important or have equal influence. When you dwindle it down to that (again, vague waffling without really making a point), you remove all the connotation of the term. At that point, it&#39;s just a pronoun used to indicate a single person or group of an unspecified gender, which may have been previously mentioned or is otherwise apparent. That&#39;s literally the definition of &#39;they&#39;. And sure, &#39;they&#39; all have an effect on the population, as much as you or I. Because you or I are &#39;they&#39; too at this level. Everyone is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I&#39;ll condemn as I see fit, thanks. My &#39;fake hand-wringing&#39; isn&#39;t fake. It&#39;s just hand-wringing. And I&#39;m glad you realize they <em>are</em> irresponsible. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right, I have &#39;no idea&#39; if it was planned.. just a <em>really really good notion</em> that it wasn&#39;t, and further, a <em>really really</em> good notion that people here will think it was. Really, is that such a wild notion? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have more information, but then, many here will use completely irrelevant information to make their points seem more valid. Case in point: OP&#39;s post refers to a video made a year ago as if were &#39;news&#39;. Again: Irresponsible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, many people ARE calling this a hoax shooting. We have some witnesses who were nearby who heard no gunshots, and others who are laughing as they are interviewed about people dying in the classroom next door. But I&#39;m not going to get into these, because you&#39;re clearly not someone who is buying in.</p>

<p>&quot;Gun laws haven&#39;t changed&quot; is not a completely true statement. There are many states who have begun implementing measures regarding background checks, and others that have limited ammunition sizes. This shit doesn&#39;t happen overnight. Watch CNN and compare their coverage of this shooting to shootings from several years ago. Note HOW MUCH of the rhetoric is now shifted to gun control laws. Change takes time, and the longer list of past shootings they can reference, the easier it will be to get the ball rolling on more widespread laws.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Not surprised; I&#39;ve already established the level of paranoia that exists in these people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Gun laws haven&#39;t changed&quot; is not a completely true statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While it may be true that there are those in government who wish to &#39;take all the guns&#39;, do you honestly believe that these mass shootings – a fairly regular occurrence – are all staged events to push those policies? <em>Really?</em> With all the shooting violence in America, you <em>really think</em> &quot;they&quot; are causing more of these shootings <em>just to change policy slowly over the course of decades</em>?  </p>

<p>The narrative that tragedies are staged to change laws has been pushed since the Oklahoma City bombing. And yet, it&#39;s never worked out that way. Ever. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a gun owner: I totally support background checks. And limiting clip sizes does literally nothing. Anyone who&#39;s ever been on a range for longer than an hour can attest to this. In many cases, that &#39;limit&#39; is in the form of a rivet preventing further cartridges being loaded. It can be removed with a screwdriver. </p>

<p>Nevermind that though, you could just carry more clips. These are laws passed by politicians who are trying to appease their constituents by &#39;doing something about it&#39;, even though the politicians themselves <em>can&#39;t</em> because of the Second Amendment. They&#39;re stop-gaps. They don&#39;t &#39;do&#39; anything, at all. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the longer list of past shootings they can reference</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I could make a list of shootings in this country that stretched on for pages, and it&#39;d consist of shootings <em>you&#39;ve never heard of</em>. That&#39;s how many shootings happen in America. In fact, the Oregon shooting marks the <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/45th-mass-shooting-america-2015-378803"><strong>45th school shooting in America in 2015</strong></a>. Can you name even five of the others without clicking that link?</p>

<p>Big ones get media attention because they&#39;re <em>newsworthy events</em>. Not every shooting is a newsworthy event (not national anyway). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve made many posts about false flags before, and how they are related to Department of Homeland Security / FEMA drills, but I hope you understand why I don&#39;t want to go too deeply into that right now. Point is, it&#39;s not just my suspicion that these are manufactured events. I&#39;ve come to my conclusions based on things I&#39;ve learned, as I was originally of your belief and thought this stuff was ridiculous.</p>

<p>Of course, there are far, far more shootings that DO occur, most of which we never hear about. It&#39;s the mass casualty incidents...5, 10, 15, 20 or more people being shot that are widely publicized. Incidents in which the shooter, again, has an incredibly conspicuous past, makes incoherent writings, and uses past shooters from false flags as inspiration. These are the ones that are the false flags. Because they can concoct these situations without any real deaths, they are able to control the gun control narrative (Andy Parker) and play their good-cop bad-cop game to a script. Andy Parker, by the way, was the actor involved in the Virginia live TV shooting, which was also fake.</p>

<p>I respect you though, and I won&#39;t attempt to push my conclusions on you. My respect is based on your unwillingness to give up your rights and your decision to not be affected by these events. Honestly, as long as that attitude prevails, then we are in good shape. I personally don&#39;t support universal background checks (not enforceable) or mental health screenings, but this is because I don&#39;t believe these aren&#39;t manufactured events, and not because I disagree with your opinion.</p>

<p>I do actually think that this is an intentionally long, drawn-out process. After 9/11, it took us 12 years to find out what the NSA was up to with powers enacted to them by the Patriot Act. It&#39;s not inconceivable that 12 years after Sandy Hook and Aurora, the public opinion of guns will be far less favorable than it is now. Especially if they keep this up. You can&#39;t just turn the heat all the way up and expect the public to go along with it. It requires them to go inch-by-inch.</p>

<p>The government doesn&#39;t need an event to distract people from Russia or Putin: People don&#39;t <em>care</em> about them already. As if the government needs our approval to go to war. Or to exercise global policy. Hardly. You guys know this: The citizens don&#39;t get a say in any of it anyway. It&#39;s mind-boggling that you&#39;ll hold that view on one hand, but on the other the government <em>has to</em> pull these little &#39;false flag shootings&#39; all the time to <em>convince us</em> of... something. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The point isn&#39;t to give us a say, but to convince us to not question or revolt when they do something we don&#39;t want.  If the government just came after guns, sans shootings, they&#39;d have a revolution on their hands.  After years of fear mongering and shootings at least half of the population is okay with the concept.  It&#39;s called inverse totalitarianism.  To us and the outside world, it looks like democracy, but that&#39;s the stage, and in order to maintain the illusion, you have to convince people that they want what the elites want.  </p>

<p>Please brother.  You are making some crazy claims...  What makes you the authority to determine no one cares, or that distractions for the populace are not necessary?</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>I&#39;m</em> making crazy claims. Me? </p>

<p>You think a video filmed a year ago is a distraction for an event happening yesterday. But <em>I&#39;m</em> &#39;crazy&#39;. Note that despite my disagreeing with you, I didn&#39;t once call you crazy sir; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56qUENYYjxE">I find the word offensive.</a> </p>

<p>No one makes me an authority: I&#39;m simply <em>observant of the society in which I live</em>, and I&#39;ve studied enough history to have a pretty solid grasp on our own. I&#39;ll let my words stand on their own, thanks, I don&#39;t need to provide some credentials or &#39;proof&#39; that I&#39;m educated enough to see fearmongery for what it is: no more than you need to provide proof for your wild assertion in the title. </p>

<p>Did people care that Afghanistan and Iraq had literally nothing to do with 9/11? Nope. </p>

<p>Did people care that we were in the Balkans? Nope.</p>

<p>Did people care that we overthrew basically any South American government that didn&#39;t play ball with our drug trade? Nope. </p>

<p>Yes: <em>some people</em> care. Obviously. We&#39;re all here discussing that, so obviously some people care. But that &#39;some&#39; is so small a minority in this country that it <em>doesn&#39;t matter at all to a politician looking to be elected</em>. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t deny that the politicians and NGOs use distractions. They&#39;re just not the ones you think they are.</p>

<p>You want to talk distractions? It&#39;s not single-serving events like this. It&#39;s ongoing shit. US Weekly. Kardashians. The VMAs. NFL. Star Wars. Avengers. Walking Dead. Game of Thrones. </p>

<p>Talk about distraction: Look at the worship of celebrity in this culture. <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> is no less guilty of it: Look at how everyone reacted to Rhonda Rousey outing herself as a 9/11 truther. As if the political opinion of some fighter means fuckall. Hell, I&#39;ll reference Chappelle again: <em>&quot;What does Ja-Rule have to say about all this?! Someone please, tell me what Ja has to say!&quot;</em> This sub is absolutely just as guilty of that behavior as the &#39;normies&#39; out there. Look at how Joe Rogan is praised here. He&#39;s just a <em>dude</em>. He&#39;s not a researcher, he&#39;s not a student: he&#39;s just <em>some fucking guy</em> who happens to talk to other <em>fucking people</em>, the only reason being is that he sucked as a fighter but obviously could talk his way into being a commentator. Yet people listen to him like <em>he&#39;s</em> an authority.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just celebrities either. You have a constant supply of entertainment funneled at you from all angles. iPhones. Androids. Free games. Steam deals. Netflix. Hulu. The list goes on and on and on. You take it all for granted, being in America, but it&#39;s a tidal wave of distraction. As long as we in America have our cars, our iPhones, our big-screen TVs, and Playstations, <em>we don&#39;t care about the rest of the world</em>. We&#39;ll be fine. <em>&quot;They&quot;</em> won&#39;t. But we don&#39;t care about &quot;them&quot;. </p>

<p>When you see death tolls in Afghanistan, what are the numbers in the headlines? &quot;3000 Marines&quot;. Not &quot;250,000 civilians&quot;. It&#39;s not that the media is trying to hide it: they report on it.. on page 8. It&#39;s that the readership <em>doesn&#39;t want to see it</em>: They care about <em>their boys</em>, not &quot;the enemy&quot;. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not because these people have been sold on that idea; It&#39;s because <em>that&#39;s how they honestly feel</em>. &quot;As long as it isn&#39;t on my doorstep, as long as I remain as comfortable as I&#39;ve come to be used to: I don&#39;t care&quot;. That&#39;s the typical American mindset. Yes, some of the blame for that lies on the NGOs and the politicians.. but <em>most of it</em> lies on <em>us</em>: the populace. If none of us read US Weekly, it wouldn&#39;t exist any more. If none of us cared about the Kardashians, they&#39;d fade from memory within a week. </p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna end this little rant with a note from Neil DeGrasse Tyson: What does it say about us that most of us know the name of mass murderers, but have never heard of Jan Oort? </p>

<p>Seriously though, I read your thoughts, and can empathize with your position.  </p>

<hr/>

<p>The reason I had initially replied to your comment is because I DO believe the media is controlled.  Further, I believe there are a lot of &#39;distractions for the people&#39; - call them triumphs for the populace (i.e. DID YOU SEE THE GAME LAST NIGHT?!)</p>

<p>So, I think those in power are very interested in what the population thinks.  In fact, I think measures are taken to subvert that thinking through media.  </p>

<p>Thanks for your contribution!</p>

<p>Dude, don&#39;t be a troll. </p>

<p>There&#39;s absolutely <em>nothing wrong</em> with being a bit wordy, unless you have a problem with reading itself. I fucking hate how people react to &#39;walls of text&#39;, as if reading a single page of a book (about what it equates to) is a fucking chore. </p>

<p>I used punctuation, I used proper grammar and sentence structure; there&#39;s paragraphs there to make it easy on your eyes and comprehension. And I&#39;ve left little to no question of my honest opinions: I don&#39;t use vague imagery and demagoguery to conceal the fact that I don&#39;t <em>really</em> have an idea of what&#39;s going on, like many people here are wont to do. If I don&#39;t know something I&#39;ll fucking say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;, because ignorance isn&#39;t a sin. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t talk down to people for being fucking <em>literate</em>. You&#39;re just as much a part of the distraction when you do that. This is a text-based internet forum: If you don&#39;t like reading, go to YouTube.</p>

<p>I think the nature of the internet actually makes people&#39;s attention spans worse. If they can&#39;t digest it in a sound bite, they move on.

We simply don&#39;t have enough information currently as to why his legs took the brunt of the damage.

We simply don&#39;t currently know the actual kinetics of the confrontation at this time.</p>

<p>WRT &quot;crisis actor&quot; video:</p>

<p>There is no &quot;psychologically appropriate&quot; reaction to the stress of having witnessed, survived, or even been near a mass casualty event like this. Some people freeze in shock, some cry, some laugh nervously or share &quot;gallows humor&quot;, some exhibit classic stages of grief. Some seem perfectly fine, only to manifest symptoms of PTSD later as ramifications of trauma sink in psychologically. It&#39;s hard to predict, and nobody should be declaring someone &quot;dishonest&quot; based on such limited criteria.</p>

Thing is - you have to schedule these drills ahead of time.

    <div class="md"><p>The world&#39;s only remaining superpower has a hundred year plan of destruction and reorganization for the wider Middle East and Eurasia, comparable to the historical European Hundred Years War, with al Qaeda, Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi, and now ISIS as the ever-mutating pretext which the West&#39;s intelligence agencies-controlled media must use to fashion a virtual reality geopolitics for Western public consumption. Remarkably, Russia, under Putin, has called the American empire&#39;s bluff and is kinetically proceeding to destroy the U.S.&#39;s threadbare pretext for a century of war profiteering, natural resource exclusionism, and neoliberal gangsterism in the Middle East and beyond by destroying the specter of ISIS itself, the phantasmatic force against which the empire fights itself and terrorizes the world. The phantom menace of terroristic Jihad, which was awakened by the U.S. during its proxy war against the USSR in Afghanistan, must be called out by its true name and then denied its secret raison d&#39;etre by having the independent nations of the world through the United Nations decide as a body what is the globally legal procedure for combatting terrorism of such a supposedly global scale.</p>
