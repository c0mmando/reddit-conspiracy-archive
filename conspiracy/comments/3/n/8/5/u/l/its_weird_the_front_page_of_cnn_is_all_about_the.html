       I am so embarrassed by my participation in this sub after any major news event. I guess today is going to be a downvote day for me. I'll be sending prayers to the victims, but I need to rant too.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       You guys think anyone in America who isn't 'one of us' here in the Conspiracy world is paying attention
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       to what Putin says - shooting or not?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         No.
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       No one cares about Putin in the States, or at the very least, such a wide majority doesn't that "no one" is accurate enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government doesn't need an event to distract people from Russia or Putin: People don't
       <em>
        care
       </em>
       about them already. As if the government needs our approval to go to war. Or to exercise global policy. Hardly. You guys know this: The citizens don't get a say in any of it anyway. It's mind-boggling that you'll hold that view on one hand, but on the other the government
       <em>
        has to
       </em>
       pull these little 'false flag shootings' all the time to
       <em>
        convince us
       </em>
       of... something.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Even though the only thing that ever happens as a result of these tragedies is people are dead, a suspect might get arrested, and – oh right – gun laws don't change.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       these events to distract anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least no one's calling it a 'hoax shooting' –
       <em>
        yet
       </em>
       . It's only a matter of time before that bit of mockery becomes the new "Sandy Hook".
      </p>
      <p>
       And once more "we" (those of you guilty) will engage in a round of 'look at that shadow - must be a set' or 'look at that jacket - it's a different color in this frame' and pat yourselves on the back for a job well done exposing some 'false flag', ostensibly for the purposes of 'taking the guns' -
       <em>
        which, despite mass shootings once-a-month for the past few
        <del>
         years
        </del>
        decades, hasn't even come close to happening, and in fact, gun laws have been relaxed steadily over time
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You people who do this (and you all bloody-well know who you are) - you push this nonsense immediately,
       <strong>
        as if nothing bad ever happened because of mental instability or simple malice.
       </strong>
       That's the common thread among all these shooting events and
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       : None of them could
       <em>
        possibly
       </em>
       be just 'a bad thing'. It
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       to be some agenda.
       <strong>
        Must
       </strong>
       be some agenda at play.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a bit of a psychological fuckery going on in that: You're actually convincing yourselves that evil and wrongdoing
       <em>
        don't rightly exist
       </em>
       , unless the wrongdoers are "one of them". I cannot begin to fathom the amount of paranoia one must be suffering from to actually, honestly accept that notion with every, single, tragic event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:
       <em>
        Upvotes?!
       </em>
       Guys, you're making me tear up here. I'm proud of you.
      </p>

       Edit again: There we go. That's more inline with what I expected.

       you talk as if the media is blameless and covering this mass shooting is more important than any other geopolitical issues. This is a sensationalized event, and there is a problem with it dominating the news to the exclusion of anything else. How many people were killed in Chicago last weekend? Is this shooting really more important than anything else happening out there? No. Therefore there is a reason to converse on the idea that this event, real or not, is being used to increase ratings on one end of the conspiracy scale, up to covering something else up on the higher end of the scale. Trying to blame people in a conspiracy sub for discussing possible conspiracies, media or otherwise is at least useless and more likely is simply a way to try to shut down relevant conversation.

       Note that you're bringing up issues
       <em>
        wholly unrelated
       </em>
       to OP's post. OP didn't bring up the media, he brought up Putin and the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to talk about the media sensationalizing shooters and how that's a bad thing, I'll likely agree with everything you say.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to discuss the event and the circumstances, I'll participate.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you come in here and assert that this event was meant to distract from a speech a Russian president said
       <em>
        over a year ago
       </em>
       , then you can read everything I wrote and direct it right at you. Of course the front page of CNN is discussing the major news of America
       <em>
        today
       </em>
       , and not
       <em>

       So what? Honestly - so what?
      </p>
      <p>
       The American populace, by and large, doesn't care about what happens abroad. They never have, so long as it doesn't happen here. This has been evidenced time and time again since we left Vietnam. So long as we're not
       <em>
        drafting men
       </em>
       for the war effort, no one cares. That's a fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're not trying to 'distract'. There is no "they". This is just a tragic event that happened to occur during an ongoing conflict - wholly unrelated events.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been 45 school shootings this year
       <em>
        alone
       </em>
       : Are they all meant to distract from the ISIS issue? Surely ISIS has been at play longer than just 2015?
      </p>
      <p>
       No. Just no. Stop trying to leverage a tragedy to fit your narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are no better than the politicians when you do that.

       Um I never said it was a planned distraction, just that the media coverage is remarkable and enough to comment on. Some will say it is pre-planned, some won't. Doesn't mean we should not discuss it. You seem awfully worried about what people discuss here, and I don't think you are the arbiter of what is proper or not to think about. I agree people don't care, why is that? I assume you would say it is because people are stupid or some other reason, I might think it has been engineered to be so. There is no "they"? That is where you lose me entirely. Of course there is, there are multiple "theys". They may not be working in concert, but they are working, and they do affect the population and the world at large. The media is one of "them", I am sure you could name a few others if you wanted to.

       You're really just waffling here without making a point one way or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I said "There is no 'they'", I was referring to
       <em>
        this specific event
       </em>
       . It wasn't a planned event, ergo, there is no 'they' who planned it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care what people think, though I encourage people to think reasonably and rationally, not just attribute every tragedy to some greater evil we can't rightly see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the media coverage is remarkable. Ten or more people were shot on a college campus. It's a remarkable event. So? Is your point really that 'media coverage == distraction'?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people don't care because they're distracted. I think I've been clear on this elsewhere. Nothing to do with being stupid: Smart people get distracted easily too. But you can assume I just think they're stupid. Assume what you like: gotta make those strawman arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I can name many "theys". SJWs, Conspiracy Theorists, Republicans, Catholics, Islamists, Australians, Sorority Girls... They're all 'they'. Doesn't mean they're all important or have equal influence. When you dwindle it down to that (again, vague waffling without really making a point), you remove all the connotation of the term. At that point, it's just a pronoun used to indicate a single person or group of an unspecified gender, which may have been previously mentioned or is otherwise apparent. That's literally the definition of 'they'. And sure, 'they' all have an effect on the population, as much as you or I. Because you or I are 'they' too at this level. Everyone is.

       that it wasn't, and further, a

       But those shootings do play a real role in the NWO agenda. They want to spread fear and to make it a constant variable so they can manipulate people into accepting radical control measures.

       I'll admit the
       <em>
        media
       </em>
       might be being used to that effect, but I draw the line at the idea where the "NWO agenda" involves "false flag shootings". That's just absurd, given the number of

       I'm not saying it was a false flag, not every shooting is a false flag. It is obvious that the U.S. has a very sick society that tends to produce psychopaths. There are many variables defining these kind of behaviors, I can't go deeper because I'm not a sociologist. Also, I believe that the causes are not random, they are purposely enforced.

       Because I've read William Cooper's investigation, and I firmly believe in what he wrote and said, since his worked is always tied to sources you can confirm for yourself. I have also read Brave New World, and Brave New World Revisited, Huxley's work; he belonged to the Fabian Society and he described what the secret alliances planned for us. Another author I find worth mentioning is George Orwell for his work 1984, he also was part of the Fabian Society.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally, but not least, Bertrand Russell and his many books and theories about scientific societies; he also was a member of the Fabian Society.

       There many other authors: Gustave Le Bon, Edward Bernays, Noam Chomsky, etc.

       Actually, many people ARE calling this a hoax shooting. We have some witnesses who were nearby who heard no gunshots, and others who are laughing as they are interviewed about people dying in the classroom next door. But I'm not going to get into these, because you're clearly not someone who is buying in.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Gun laws haven't changed" is not a completely true statement. There are many states who have begun implementing measures regarding background checks, and others that have limited ammunition sizes. This shit doesn't happen overnight. Watch CNN and compare their coverage of this shooting to shootings from several years ago. Note HOW MUCH of the rhetoric is now shifted to gun control laws. Change takes time, and the longer list of past shootings they can reference, the easier it will be to get the ball rolling on more widespread laws.

       While it may be true that there are those in government who wish to 'take all the guns', do you honestly believe that these mass shootings – a fairly regular occurrence – are all staged events to push those policies?
       <em>
        Really?
       </em>
       With all the shooting violence in America, you
       <em>
        really think
       </em>
       "they" are causing more of these shootings
       <em>
        just to change policy slowly over the course of decades
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       The narrative that tragedies are staged to change laws has been pushed since the Oklahoma City bombing. And yet, it's never worked out that way. Ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a gun owner: I totally support background checks. And limiting clip sizes does literally nothing. Anyone who's ever been on a range for longer than an hour can attest to this. In many cases, that 'limit' is in the form of a rivet preventing further cartridges being loaded. It can be removed with a screwdriver.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevermind that though, you could just carry more clips. These are laws passed by politicians who are trying to appease their constituents by 'doing something about it', even though the politicians themselves
       <em>
        can't
       </em>
       because of the Second Amendment. They're stop-gaps. They don't 'do' anything, at all.

      <p>
       Again, I could make a list of shootings in this country that stretched on for pages, and it'd consist of shootings
       <em>
        you've never heard of
       </em>
       . That's how many shootings happen in America. In fact, the Oregon shooting marks the

      </p>
      <p>
       Big ones get media attention because they're
       <em>
        newsworthy events

       I've made many posts about false flags before, and how they are related to Department of Homeland Security / FEMA drills, but I hope you understand why I don't want to go too deeply into that right now. Point is, it's not just my suspicion that these are manufactured events. I've come to my conclusions based on things I've learned, as I was originally of your belief and thought this stuff was ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, there are far, far more shootings that DO occur, most of which we never hear about. It's the mass casualty incidents...5, 10, 15, 20 or more people being shot that are widely publicized. Incidents in which the shooter, again, has an incredibly conspicuous past, makes incoherent writings, and uses past shooters from false flags as inspiration. These are the ones that are the false flags. Because they can concoct these situations without any real deaths, they are able to control the gun control narrative (Andy Parker) and play their good-cop bad-cop game to a script. Andy Parker, by the way, was the actor involved in the Virginia live TV shooting, which was also fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       I respect you though, and I won't attempt to push my conclusions on you. My respect is based on your unwillingness to give up your rights and your decision to not be affected by these events. Honestly, as long as that attitude prevails, then we are in good shape. I personally don't support universal background checks (not enforceable) or mental health screenings, but this is because I don't believe these aren't manufactured events, and not because I disagree with your opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do actually think that this is an intentionally long, drawn-out process. After 9/11, it took us 12 years to find out what the NSA was up to with powers enacted to them by the Patriot Act. It's not inconceivable that 12 years after Sandy Hook and Aurora, the public opinion of guns will be far less favorable than it is now. Especially if they keep this up. You can't just turn the heat all the way up and expect the public to go along with it. It requires them to go inch-by-inch.

       Yes i can say that i honestly believe most of these mass shootings are false flag type distractions.  You live in a dream world if you seriously cannot connect the dots on alot of the mass shootings.  I am not saying every single one is staged but the ones that get all mass media coverage are probaly staged.

       Editors at news agencies make decisions. NYT will do articles about "zomg WW3 in Syria tots possible u guyz" but it's never front page until the war drums need to beat. Any shooting is going to make front page automatically. People looove to talk about guns. If it serves a long term police state agenda, even better.  You don't have to create news to make psychographics that boost the empire; picking what items go where is more than enough.

      <p>
       The point isn't to give us a say, but to convince us to not question or revolt when they do something we don't want.  If the government just came after guns, sans shootings, they'd have a revolution on their hands.  After years of fear mongering and shootings at least half of the population is okay with the concept.  It's called inverse totalitarianism.  To us and the outside world, it looks like democracy, but that's the stage, and in order to maintain the illusion, you have to convince people that they want what the elites want.

       here is my hypothesis: russia starts shit in syria and says america is lying and blah blah blah and suddenly, as if a deus ex machina, a school shooting happens.  odds were one would happen anyway given the frequency.  so they take this time to regroup and reconsider their strategy on syria, all the while saying the same lines "were praying for the families etc ect."
      </p>
      <p>
       its not a cover up per se, its more of a semi-accident that they are capitalizing on.  the shooting was most likely real, but that does NOT mean nefarious shit is going on.

       Sorry, but a claim that dozens, potentially hundreds or even thousands of people in authority conspire to create hoax shootings requires much more extraordinary evidence than a lone gunman in the midst of a national mental health and gun control crisis.

       Having said that, there are many possibilities. I don't care to speculate about "their" motives as the submitter did, but you cannot dispute that many strange, contradictory, and exceedingly improbable facts surround the killings at Aurora, Sandy Hook, Boston, Navy Yard, Isla Vista (Elliot Rogers), and others.

      <p>
       You think a video filmed a year ago is a distraction for an event happening yesterday. But
       <em>
        I'm
       </em>
       'crazy'. Note that despite my disagreeing with you, I didn't once call you crazy sir;

        I find the word offensive.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       No one makes me an authority: I'm simply
       <em>
        observant of the society in which I live
       </em>
       , and I've studied enough history to have a pretty solid grasp on our own. I'll let my words stand on their own, thanks, I don't need to provide some credentials or 'proof' that I'm educated enough to see fearmongery for what it is: no more than you need to provide proof for your wild assertion in the title.

      <p>
       Did people care that Afghanistan and Iraq had literally nothing to do with 9/11? Nope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did people care that we were in the Balkans? Nope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did people care that we overthrew basically any South American government that didn't play ball with our drug trade? Nope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes:
       <em>
        some people
       </em>
       care. Obviously. We're all here discussing that, so obviously some people care. But that 'some' is so small a minority in this country that it
       <em>
        doesn't matter at all to a politician looking to be elected
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't deny that the politicians and NGOs use distractions. They're just not the ones you think they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to talk distractions? It's not single-serving events like this. It's ongoing shit. US Weekly. Kardashians. The VMAs. NFL. Star Wars. Avengers. Walking Dead. Game of Thrones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talk about distraction: Look at the worship of celebrity in this culture.
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       is no less guilty of it: Look at how everyone reacted to Rhonda Rousey outing herself as a 9/11 truther. As if the political opinion of some fighter means fuckall. Hell, I'll reference Chappelle again:
       <em>
        "What does Ja-Rule have to say about all this?! Someone please, tell me what Ja has to say!"
       </em>
       This sub is absolutely just as guilty of that behavior as the 'normies' out there. Look at how Joe Rogan is praised here. He's just a
       <em>
        dude
       </em>
       . He's not a researcher, he's not a student: he's just
       <em>
        some fucking guy
       </em>
       who happens to talk to other
       <em>
        fucking people
       </em>
       , the only reason being is that he sucked as a fighter but obviously could talk his way into being a commentator. Yet people listen to him like
       <em>
        he's
       </em>
       an authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just celebrities either. You have a constant supply of entertainment funneled at you from all angles. iPhones. Androids. Free games. Steam deals. Netflix. Hulu. The list goes on and on and on. You take it all for granted, being in America, but it's a tidal wave of distraction. As long as we in America have our cars, our iPhones, our big-screen TVs, and Playstations,
       <em>
        we don't care about the rest of the world
       </em>
       . We'll be fine.
       <em>
        "They"
       </em>
       won't. But we don't care about "them".
      </p>
      <p>
       When you see death tolls in Afghanistan, what are the numbers in the headlines? "3000 Marines". Not "250,000 civilians". It's not that the media is trying to hide it: they report on it.. on page 8. It's that the readership
       <em>
        doesn't want to see it
       </em>
       : They care about
       <em>
        their boys
       </em>
       , not "the enemy".
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not because these people have been sold on that idea; It's because
       <em>
        that's how they honestly feel
       </em>
       . "As long as it isn't on my doorstep, as long as I remain as comfortable as I've come to be used to: I don't care". That's the typical American mindset. Yes, some of the blame for that lies on the NGOs and the politicians.. but
       <em>
        most of it
       </em>
       lies on
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       : the populace. If none of us read US Weekly, it wouldn't exist any more. If none of us cared about the Kardashians, they'd fade from memory within a week.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm gonna end this little rant with a note from Neil DeGrasse Tyson: What does it say about us that most of us know the name of mass murderers, but have never heard of Jan Oort?

      <p>
       The reason I had initially replied to your comment is because I DO believe the media is controlled.  Further, I believe there are a lot of 'distractions for the people' - call them triumphs for the populace (i.e. DID YOU SEE THE GAME LAST NIGHT?!)
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I think those in power are very interested in what the population thinks.  In fact, I think measures are taken to subvert that thinking through media.

       There's absolutely
       <em>
        nothing wrong
       </em>
       with being a bit wordy, unless you have a problem with reading itself. I fucking hate how people react to 'walls of text', as if reading a single page of a book (about what it equates to) is a fucking chore.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used punctuation, I used proper grammar and sentence structure; there's paragraphs there to make it easy on your eyes and comprehension. And I've left little to no question of my honest opinions: I don't use vague imagery and demagoguery to conceal the fact that I don't
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       have an idea of what's going on, like many people here are wont to do. If I don't know something I'll fucking say "I don't know", because ignorance isn't a sin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't talk down to people for being fucking
       <em>
        literate
       </em>
       . You're just as much a part of the distraction when you do that. This is a text-based internet forum: If you don't like reading, go to YouTube.

       I think the nature of the internet actually makes people's attention spans worse. If they can't digest it in a sound bite, they move on. Unfortunately, you and I know that not everything worth while can be delivered in a sound bite. Regrettably if you want to be heard by the masses, you have to deliver your word in an easily digestible way.

       My original point was the media subverts the populace through varying stories.

       Throwaway4censorship took issue with that, saying no one cares anyway about Putin and Russia, so the media isn't distracting the public with the current popular stories.

       It's not weird at all.  Every time the US is up to shady shit that they don't want people reading or thinking about, surprise surprise there is another shooting and suddenly everyone is scared and traumatized and perversely obsessed with it for a little while.  Then instead of us thinking about and acting upon all these really serious issues, our officials get to hem and haw and act as if Americans owning guns is the biggest threat to our safety instead pinpointing the real threat, which of course is them.  I'd say "convenient" is probably a better word to describe it.

       I mean, if it was a manufactured event, wouldn't the perpetrators try to make the event conform to the public's understanding of shootings as to not arouse suspicion?

       Skepticism is always warranted. But it goes both ways. Only questioning the "official story" isn't skepticism. Not questioning insane claims and assumptions that exist in this thread is not skepticism. Pretending that an assertion based on a situation with no knowledge of context, etc. Is somehow evidence of a government conspiracy is insane.

       Mintz was shot in the legs, upper back, and abdomen. It's been reported and you can see the bandages in released photos. We simply don't have enough information currently as to why his legs took the brunt of the damage. He's a vet, it's possible he closed the distance and forced the gunman's weapon downward while it was firing. We simply don't currently know the actual kinetics of the confrontation at this time.

       There is no "psychologically appropriate" reaction to the stress of having witnessed, survived, or even been near a mass casualty event like this. Some people freeze in shock, some cry, some laugh nervously or share "gallows humor", some exhibit classic stages of grief. Some seem perfectly fine, only to manifest symptoms of PTSD later as ramifications of trauma sink in psychologically. It's hard to predict, and nobody should be declaring someone "dishonest" based on such limited criteria.

       I'm talking about recent geopolitical news, specifically Russia's actions and words in Syria.

       I have a question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does the us media hunger for distraction stories in times like these and get lucky finding them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are the shootings SOMEHOW caused by the "establishment"?
Yes it sounds ridiculous and no I don't necessarily buy into it.

       While I won't buy the idea that these shootings are used as a distraction, I do believe most of them are some sort of hoax, including this one. Thing is - you have to schedule these drills ahead of time. You can't have Putin give an anti-U.S. speech and suddenly schedule a mass shooting exercise involving DHS/ATF staff from all over the nation within a couple days. The timing, however, is quite fortunate indeed.

       I recently read Putin's speech regarding the U.S., but didn't know when it was actually said. I would think if this were intended to cover any other news up, it would be Russia's bombing of ISIS and not a speech he made that nobody here probably paid much attention to anyway.

       The world's only remaining superpower has a hundred year plan of destruction and reorganization for the wider Middle East and Eurasia, comparable to the historical European Hundred Years War, with al Qaeda, Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi, and now ISIS as the ever-mutating pretext which the West's intelligence agencies-controlled media must use to fashion a virtual reality geopolitics for Western public consumption. Remarkably, Russia, under Putin, has called the American empire's bluff and is kinetically proceeding to destroy the U.S.'s threadbare pretext for a century of war profiteering, natural resource exclusionism, and neoliberal gangsterism in the Middle East and beyond by destroying the specter of ISIS itself, the phantasmatic force against which the empire fights itself and terrorizes the world. The phantom menace of terroristic Jihad, which was awakened by the U.S. during its proxy war against the USSR in Afghanistan, must be called out by its true name and then denied its secret raison d'etre by having the independent nations of the world through the United Nations decide as a body what is the globally legal procedure for combatting terrorism of such a supposedly global scale.

       Honestly who cares about conspiracies anymore the sheep will never wake up.  Conspiracies have done nothing but make me depressed.  The people are too brainwashed to ever believe anything that may sound crazy but truth is stranger than fiction. And so many people in this sub are self righteous arrogant assholes who can only agree with things that fit their perception.  Do your own research and forget about this sub, it's a cancer to factual conspiracy theorists. Sorry for the rant im depressed

       Not really from birth were taught to go to school to get an education so you can make a lot of money.  And if you don't do that you're a loser.  In a way you can be whatever you want but how many people do that nowadays.  We're all debt slaves and it just sucks

       Yaaaay. More fear mongering. A very close relative of mine just lost his mother and had his wife seriously injured in a maniacal shooting. The very next day a man killed his entire family  of three and then himself in the town over. Wheres the national news vans??? Where the fuck was CNN? Oh thats right the target audience now is college students in this years election, wait for a murder more suited for that agenda I suppose. Fuck all mainstream media. and those who follow it!

       If so, that video is a year old. Why would Americans focus on comments made a year ago instead of a shooting that happened yesterday?

       Yes I have. Were you referring to recent comments in your post, or to the thread I linked to? If you were talking about recent comments then you need to specify - there is no way anyone can tell that from your post. If you were referring to the thread I linked, then you still haven't answered my question.

       I know I don't care. They happen so often and there's never anything amusing or particularly horrifying about them. It's just another natural disaster that occasionally happens, no big whoop.

       The US doesn't control it's media. Ergo the news is focused on the juicy story and not speculations of the crap putin is spitting out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that Alqueda and ISIS are rearing up like hissing cats at eachother bout to turn into a cartoony cloud fight is pretty hard to point to it all being fake.  If it was fake you would theoretically want Alqueda and ISIS to join forces. Not do the job for us. right?

       Everybody I know is FAR more interested in the shootings than the Mideast.  The Mideast is old news, they're sick of it, they don't want to hear about it.  The shooting is fresh and somewhat close to home (a phenomenon that's been happening all over the USA).

       Sorry, but a claim that dozens, potentially hundreds or even thousands of people in authority conspire to create hoax shootings requires much more extraordinary evidence than a lone gunman in the midst of a national mental health and gun control crisis.
