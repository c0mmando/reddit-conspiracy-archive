<p>If you&#39;re a fence builder, someone may pay you to put up a fence around a building that nobody is allowed to go inside, yet here you are helping to keep people out of a building that you know nothing about. The same could be said of those running the factory that makes fences who sold it to you without asking which building you&#39;ll put it up around.</p>

<p>Money is a system designed to separate motivation from thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s an interesting thought experiment, although doesn’t really work under scrutiny. Let’s say instead of money, we were just using a bartering system? You were offered ten bags of rice to build a fence around a building. You still build the fence and not know what’s inside, but there was no money involved.</p>

<p>The important thing is that you don’t need to know what’s inside the fence, and money has nothing to do with it. It could just be a simple matter of privacy. You have chosen to build fences as your job, and unless you want to get nosey and invade people’s private affairs, you don’t really need to know specifically what the fence is being built to protect.</p>

<p>To put it simply, you probably don’t really care what’s behind the fence, and if they’re getting a fence built around it, they probably don’t care much to tell everyone who asks. Nothing to do with money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Money is a conspiracy, but not for the reasons you mention.  It&#39;s an obvious tool for trade, but most modern monetary systems have built a built in feature.  As a commodity, you pay, constantly, to own it.  Much of the wealth you will hold in your life is borrowed and you will pay interest on that debt directly.  However, even if you&#39;re careful and avoid debt, all of the money you will ever hold has been lent at inception, and you will pay interest, usually in the form of taxes, back to the central bank that issued it.  While this happens, it will be carefully, intentionally devalued so that you must always seek more.  I know why I work, I know where my money goes, and I know I&#39;m being duped.</p>

<p>What if I tell you that the fence is needed for a very positive thing - to protect my 3-year old. Following your logic, you will now be ready to build it for free. Let me know when you can drop by.</p>
