<p>And I&#39;m not debating whether or not GMOs are good or bad, but people need to understand that the unnatural process involved could result badly. So let&#39;s stop allowing manipulation of the literal or connotative meanings of &quot;Genetically Modified Organism&quot;. The word GMO is propagandized anyways, so don&#39;t let its contextual use fool you.</p>

<p>Life has been evolving for billions of years, and in my opinion, the idea of improving upon 2 and a half billion years in several decades of research is silly. But forget opinions, let&#39;s get to the facts: Modern artificial GMO methods are not like anything that nature has seen before.</p>

<p>And some thing, some agent, some shill commenter on this recent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3nlyy4/monsanto_has_been_working_with_conde_nast_to_push/">post</a> thinks that laboratory genetic modification is just as natural as someone planting their favorite apple.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Laboratory genetic modification does not take into account the natural constrains and requirements of the environment. Basically, long term evolution and how the habitat and environment responds. You would need quantum super computer simulations to completely determine how safe and effective GMO food is. I&#39;m not saying GMOs are unhealthy, but anyone who thinks that selective breeding and (let me be careful about using the word GMO), &quot;modern methods&quot;, are the same are out of touch with reality.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;ve been genetically modifying our food forever.&quot;, it said, with generously disproportionate upvotes to reinforce their certainty. That statement relies on certain contextual and literal manipulation intended to mislead and fool people. Propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad someone has a similar perspective. And I think there is absolutely potential for laboratory GMOs to beat traditional foods. For that to happen, we need to be completely omniscient to the environment. Obviously, we are not there yet. Chemicals are introduced all the time that cause problems. Look at endocrine disruptors. There are probably millions of molecular combinations that can be used to make hormone mimickers.</p>

<p>With the way we are treating genetic modification at this point in time, it is possible that, due to a combination of human error and entropy, people will end up refrigerators full of retarded franken-fruit.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t make sense.  Do we know EVERY environmental impact or genetic quality of any crop we grow ?  Even ones unaltered from ancient days ?  Maybe growing them in a new place or at a new scale has impacts that the old situation didn&#39;t have.</p>

<p>No, requiring complete knowledge or &quot;omniscience&quot; is just a biased attempt to prevent the technology.  It&#39;s the same tactic used about climate change: &quot;before doing ANYTHING to fight climate change, we should study it for another 200 years until we know EVERYTHING about it&quot;.  Same used against vaccines: you can always call for &quot;more study&quot;, ad infinitum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would also like to disagree with your statement about, &quot;Regular mutation and stabilization that accommodates its environment will occur like it always has&quot;.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t make sense to me when natural evolution has emerged because of a delicate &quot;pass the torch&quot; manifestation around the environment, including radiation, viruses, etc. Random genetic modification of that system could deteriorate it in ways never before seen. Kinda like how cows, and their artificial livestock raising system involving abnormal feed, steroids, and antibiotics tend to suffer malnourished and diseased lifestyles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But random mutations is how organisms evolve in the first place, and they happen all the time. In humans, the rate is about 60 base pairs changed for each person born. Nature is not a delicate system that if disrupted will collapse, it&#39;s chaotic and random and it has gotten us to this point in time despite billions of years of volcanic eruptions and meteor impacts. I get the worry that humans don&#39;t know what we&#39;re doing, but I don&#39;t think there is a reason to worry about destroying our environment with this kind of a tool (not saying we can&#39;t affect/fuck up the environment, just not with this kind of technology).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s take a GMO strain of fish, for example. It has been created for specific characteristics within a <em>farm</em> environment. Once these fish enter the natural ecosystem, they will compete for survival within that framework, win or lose.

    <div class="md"><p>My thinking was that the GMO mutations are designed to promote resistance to chemicals and/or survivability. That is a good point though that the characteristics chosen for a farm environment wouldn&#39;t likely correlate to survival in the wild. I was thinking more of crops which may be bred to survive droughts or harmful chemicals.</p>

<p>Invasive species is more of a recent phenomenon IMO, sure you might have had the errant seed flown across the world on the wind, but in recent history humans have inadvertently accelerated the collision of biospheres.</p>

<p>Not with GMOs, where you are subjecting humans and animals to modified foods regardless of how it fits into our everyday life. So it is used no matter what. It may take more genetic modification to fix problems, which would gradually decay our habitat.</p>

<p>This about sums up your authority to talk about GMOs.  You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, but more than willing to lambaste genetic modification because... I dunno, Monsanto?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with the basics of genetic lineage.  You&#39;re aware of the central dogma of life?  DNA exists as the base genetic code, which is transcribed into RNA to prepare the code for function, and the RNA is translated into protein, to carry out that function.  This is generally how all life works, with the rare exception being reverse transcriptase retroviruses, but whether or not we consider them life is still up for vigorous debate.</p>

<p>When plants or animals reproduce, they create specialized cells called gametes which carry <em>half</em> of their overall genetic material, which exists in duplicate.  Sometimes plants can screw this up and end up with a whole bunch of extra duplicate genetic material (polyploidy), such as potatoes, but that&#39;s not necessarily important here.  What is important is something in the process of producing gametes (meiosis) something called crossing over happens, in the prophase segment called diakinesis.  Duplicated chromosomes are called sister chromatids, and during diakinesis, non-sister chromatids can overlap and exchange genetic material, frequently across genes and even in between the 3 nucleotide code for amino acids (we&#39;ll talk about this more in a second).  The process is otherwise completely random.  These new modified sister chromatids split when the cell splits to make gametes, and now each new gamete has a <em>different</em> genetic code from the others, and from its parent.  These gametes are released, fertilize their respective counterparts, and a new organism can grow with this new genetic material.</p>

<p>This is a rough detail of how descent with modification works from a genetic standpoint.  Why did I explain all of this?  Because this is the natural process, and it is random and chaotic.  It&#39;s also a form of genetic modification, albeit the accepted &quot;organic&quot; form, which can result in a lot of unintended outcomes.  This is how Penn State made a great potato for frying into chips that also poisons you, but also how Karen Gillan got her sexy red hair.  When crossing over occurs, it can interrupt genes, shift the whole gene down into a new sequence of amino acids, or create non-functional genes.  Since every 3 nucleotides codes for an amino acid in the RNA building protein, throwing in one or two nucleotides into that code <em>drastically</em> changes the protein, frequently making it non-functional.  Splicing half a gene into another would also drastically change the protein output of that gene.  Again, this is random and chaotic.</p>

<p>There is no order to crossing over, and we only see successful organisms reproducing because they have the most stable genetic code that produces the most useful proteins in the most efficient manner.  We don&#39;t see the deleterious mutants because they don&#39;t survive, and we don&#39;t see massive shifts in DNA because it would make the organism unfit.  This is the whole problem with using natural methods of breeding that DNA insertion GMO is trying to solve, and actually <em>has</em> solved, despite concerns.</p>

<p>GMO injects just one gene, or a handful of genes, directly into the DNA of the target organism.  For example, <em>Cry1ab</em> is injected into corn and provides it with resistance to insects.  That&#39;s all that gene does.  It codes for one specific protein, that does one specific job:  kill beetles that would ruin the corn.  Rather than attempting to bombard the corn with radiation, or selectively breed it for hundreds of generations to attempt to get the same effect, researchers took the gene from a bacterium, sequenced it, studied its protein&#39;s effects on beetles, studied its protein&#39;s effects on high order mammals and eventually humans, and then spliced it into the corn to produce just that one specific protein.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all modern laboratory GMO does.  There is no smoke or mirrors, just a steep learning curve of genetics.  This is a very basic glossing over, but essentially that&#39;s how it works.  There&#39;s nothing nefarious going on here - It&#39;s using accepted laboratory techniques refined through research to produce a desired outcome in a more timely and targeted manner.  We can discuss the political implications later, but the science itself is sound, and nobody is out there producing mind control frankencorn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would you mind if I only answered one of your tsn questions for now? I&#39;m awfully tired.</p>

<p>Aluminum oxate improves combustion in jet engines while allowing for higher altitude flights. It goes through the engine just fine as it&#39;s made very fine, er &quot;atomized&quot;, before being mixed into the the jet fuel at the refinery as an approved additive. After the oxygen burns off in the engine the aluminum gets expelled along with water vapor which under relatively common conditions produces persistent contrails. Enough flights and the right conditions and clear days can become entirely overcast. This is a less precise method of cloudseeding, albeit perhaps more cost effective? I haven&#39;t seen the figures. But it has some nifty aide effects.</p>

<p>Firstly, aluminum (note it&#39;s not always aluminum and aluminum is pretty damn common in earht anyway) is conductive So when aloft even if they don&#39;t achieve a cloud they&#39;re more conductive, which creates more lightning. </p>

<p>Secondly, when we shoot a bunch of energy into a conductive atmosphere it heats up significantly and rapidly. This has really awesome weather manipulation abilities, albeit probably imprecise, also probably quite powerful (who need precision when attacking an entire country/region?)</p>

<p>Like I said. Monoculture fields of soy, corn, and almonds are not sustainable nor ecologically healthy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh Billie, Billie, Billie.. Whenever when you learn not to spew a bunch of bullshit every time GMOs are mentioned on Reddit? </p>

<p>I never said GM and polycultures were exclusive. Some folks are doing great work on GM American chestnut trees to implement in food forests. As transgenic techies often point out, most all our cultivated crops have been modified genetically through selective breeding over the millenia.</p>

<p>Trangenics even have some unique opportunities to offer, like the aforementioned blight resistant, transgenic, american chestnut.</p>

<p>And selectively bred crops such as corn and soy and cows, when grown in expansive/exclusive monoculture are way more ecologically devastating than a transgenic chestnuts or potatoes grown in polycultures/small scale monocultures.</p>

<p>The biggest issues we face that we call world hunger are malnutrition and now increasingly obesity.</p>

<p>Diverse farms outperform uniform farms in nearly every ecological way, and barring ridiculous subsidies from petroleum based plutocracies, economically as well.</p>

<p>Diverse farms also combat malnutrition. A exclusively corn based diet will literally kill you from vitamin deficicieny. A diverse farm means diverse produce on the shelf means healthy bodies.</p>

<p>Look through a grocery store shelf and admire human ingenuity at squeezing a dozen cash crops and industrial byproducts into every single processed product from pancake syrup to blueberry muffins.</p>

<p>I know you&#39;ve seen the evidence because I&#39;ve provided it to you before on several occasions. Don&#39;t give me that bullshit.</p>

<p>As for obesity, yeh. Eat a shitton of calories and no vitamins/minerals and you&#39;ll end up a tub of lard. America has three obese adults for every underfed adult. It&#39;s fucked up majorly.</p>

<p>Distribution is the problem and by distribution I mean a lack of variety in the American diet. It&#39;s all grains and grain fed animal products.</p>

<p>It&#39;s unsustainable. It&#39;s environmentally destructive. Literally turns forest to desert (the dust bowl) and drains aquifers (California and Saudi Arabia). </p>

<p>Monoculture works well for certain crops on certain scales. They work really well for caloric output and it complements polycultures well, but polycultures outperform them in nutritional output, and environmental impact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>GMO advocates often purport to solve the problems associated with monoculture and fossil fuels using transgenic technologies. </p>

<p>Some of these issues are desertification, erosion, pollution, famine, malnutrition, and obesity. These issues aren&#39;t extraneous, these issues are central. </p>

<p>The extraneous issues appear to be the ones like, &quot;how can we make a strain of rice that produces high levels of vitamin A?&quot; and &quot;how can we use transgenic technology to solve the problems associated with monoculture such as herbivorous insects(pests), competitive plants (weeds), and nutritional depleted soils(fertilizers)?&quot;</p>

<p>Polycultures can solve all these problems by reconsidering them as integral elements of a healthy ecosystem. Figure out the niche a useless weed fills and replace it with a beneficial or useful croo that fills the same niche. </p>

<p>I appreciate your integrity but you should really consider that GMOs are but the most expensive and least sure solutions for the problems agriculture faces today. To be sure, transgenic technology is absolutely valuable. I just think we should use the tool wisely rather than sinking a bunch of money into snake oil ventures by hawkish capitalists.</p>

<p>Somewhere in this message I want to convey my distaste for the regulations hippies demanded on GMOs that led to a monopolization of the industry by the biggest and baddest corporations on the planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are mischaracterizing the debate to push your own bias.  GMO usually is aimed at solving problems with specific plant diseases/blights, or increasing productivity, or reducing pesticide use.  A few, such as golden rice, are aimed at better nutrition.  There&#39;s sort of no limit to the future potential, which might include reducing fertilizer and fossil fuel use, but that&#39;s pretty far from the focus today.</p>

<p>The fact that Golden Rice exists today, means it&#39;s not &quot;extraneous&quot;.  Someone chose to do it first.</p>

<p>Why is GMO an &quot;expensive&quot; solution ?  Farmers are choosing it because it is cheaper than the alternatives they were using before.  And I assume they&#39;re aware of polyculture, and have chosen not to go that route, probably for economic reasons.</p>

<p>How did &quot;regulations on GMOs&quot; lead to big corps dominating ?  And do you think we should have no regulations on GMOs ?  No testing of new products ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>GMOs take millions of dollars to create and the corporations creating them aren&#39;t just giving them away for free. </p>

<p>You assume wrong. Many farmers don&#39;t know about polycultures or how easy it is to switch over. The whole industry is supersaturated with technological solutions sold at trade shows. You can make a lot more money selling technology to farmers than teaching them how to repurpose the technology they already possess.</p>

<p>Headway is being made on this, but at great resistance from people like you who insist technology is cheaper than ecology. That might have been true in the past but cheap fossil fuels will run out and renewable sources cannot compare in outout to the enormity of solar energy stored over the millenia in the forms of coal, oil, and natural gas.</p>

<p>The regulations point was brought to my attention by a GMO lobbyist who pointed out that excessively costly anti-GMO regulations created an economic climate where only the largest corporations could afford to pursue transgenic research. This cut smaller businesses out of the loop and led to a monopoly on GMOs by a few large multinationals with terrible reputations. </p>

<p>That&#39;s capitalism for ya, only the biggest baddest and most ruthless profit seekers survive.</p>

<p>I think regulations on transgenic technology should be encouraged but we shouldn&#39;t have a centralized system of professional regulators that can be easily bought off. Look how a nonprofit lab exposed the recent emissions fiasco of VW, Toyota, Mitsubishi and others. The regulatory agency either failed through negligence or they were paid off.</p>

<p>Regulation should be done on a volunteer basis and decentralized. Sort of how drug reviews worked back on the silknroad. Consumers can leave reviews, more motivated consumers can test new products, and apathetic consumers can take risks as labrats.</p>

<p>That would be absolutely amazing, especially if done through the processes of democratic confederalism and worker owned enterprises.</p>

<p>Why should shareholders make all the profit and all the decisions. The producers and consumers should have these benefits and rights. Not rich asshat investment firms out to make a profit.</p>

<p>Under capitalism, every profit is accompanied by an externalized deficit.</p>

<p>And yes. Under capitalism there is no incentive besides accruing capital. They say the capital is meant to be distributed to the poorest and hungriest, but we can all see who really recieves those distributes profits- rich multinationals and their shareholders, and who suffers the externalized deficit- the taxpayers and consumers.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a proven failure model.  Capitalism works.  It&#39;s extremely productive, we just need to regulate it properly.  Government control is fine if the decisions are always good, but sooner or later a bad decision runs the whole country over a cliff.  In capitalism, a seriously bad decision just runs one company over a cliff.</p>

<p>Shareholders make the profit because they risked their capital.  Workers profit from their own labor, but they didn&#39;t risk any capital, so they get little or no participation in the overall company profits.</p>

<p>Capitalism doesn&#39;t HAVE to have &quot;externalized deficits&quot;.  If we account for externalities properly, we can bring them into the equation.</p>

<p>Even under pure, unfettered capitalism, the capitalists have motives in addition to profit.  They have to live in the same society and world as everyone else.  That&#39;s why these &quot;Pharma corps suppressing cure for cancer&quot; stories are nonsense, for example.</p>

<p>Who says &quot;the capital is meant to be distributed to the poorest and hungriest&quot; ?  Sure, there should be some fairness and safety nets.</p>

<p>What does that even mean. Nonprofits are remarkably resilient and one of, if not THE, fastest growing sectors of the American economy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aspeninstitute.org/policy-work/nonprofit-philanthropy/archives/nonprofit-philanthropy-55">http://www.aspeninstitute.org/policy-work/nonprofit-philanthropy/archives/nonprofit-philanthropy-55</a></p>

<p>And dare I remind you that the government still supposedly runs things, not the corporations. (And what a dare that would be.)</p>

<p>Corporations and professional governments operate under the same hierarchal system. This hierarchal system is doomed to failurr because eventually an asshat will make their way to the top and take the corporation or state over the cliff.</p>

<p>I defer to Murray Bookchin,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To speak of &#39;limits to growth&#39; under a capitalistic market economy is as meaningless as to speak of limits of warfare under a warrior society. The moral pieties, that are voiced today by many well-meaning environmentalists, are as naive as the moral pieties of multinationals are manipulative. Capitalism can no more be &#39;persuaded&#39; to limit growth than a human being can be &#39;persuaded&#39; to stop breathing. Attempts to &#39;green&#39; capitalism, to make it &#39;ecological&#39;, are doomed by the very nature of the system as a system of endless growth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The accrual of capital moves ever upwards as the current trends show. In a unfettered capitalist society eventually one man or corporation owns everything and risks all the capital while everyone else is a laborer worth less than spit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s as broke a system as can exist.</p>

<p>The ultra rich most certainly do not have to live on the same planet as everyone else. They can move to mars for chrissake, or more realistically, they do as they always do and have walls and cathedrals built to shut out the masses of disenfranchised poor.</p>

<p>And pharma corporations are most certainly supressing cancer treatments. Big pharma outspends alcohol, tobacco, prison unions, police unions, and private prisons on the campaigns of anti-marijuana politicians.</p>

<p>Such stories are no more nonsensical than stories of doctors giving false diagnoses to profit off costly cancer treatments.

<p>You&#39;re just plain wrong on everything. I&#39;m sorry. I don&#39;t know how else to tell you. Why must we settle for some fairness and safety nets. Why can&#39;t we just have fairness from the get go? Remedy the evermore unfair distribution of capital. It&#39;s as easy as going after the richest 300 families. </p>

<p>If an &quot;asshat&quot; takes one corporation over a cliff, that&#39;s a small problem.  If the whole state is taken over the cliff, that&#39;s a total catastrophe.</p>

<p>Marijuana is not a cancer cure.  Perhaps some of the compounds in it may be found to cure some kinds of cancer.  Maybe.  No, pharma companies are not suppressing cancer cures.  It makes no sense.

<p>I agree, which is why hierarchal corporations and states are irresponsible systems. They&#39;re ultimately risky and doomed to fail in the long term.</p>

<p>Cannabis contains compounds that can cure cancer. These compounds can only produce immense profits if they can be patented as intellectual capital, at which point they belong to the capitalist who takes all the risk by investing that capital in ventures where the capitalist profits greatly and the laborers earn pitiful wages. </p>

<p>It&#39;s absolutely horse shitake and a lousy model. Intellectual capital needs more stringent limits. Yes, good job, you invented something good, now make it freely reproducible and invent some more stuff.</p>

<p>Multinational corporations operate in disparate countries all the time. You can&#39;t dismiss the notion that they have largely global influences.</p>

<p>Also you must be aware that other countries allow cures that regulatory agencies in the US refuse to allow due to a revolving door policy between lobbyists, legislators, regulators, and corporate board members/shareholders.</p>

<p>Yes. Some doctors are quacks and scammers. Most doctors are trained in schools funded in part by the industries they are training to go into. Medical textbooks have all kinds of errors and omissions that benefit the status quo.</p>

<p>I think we should deregulate the markets (consumers can regulate the markets themselves, we need to stop allowing professional regulators whose pockets end up lined by the very industries they regulate.) We should expropriate and redistribute the massive capital holdings of the richest 5%, price in externalities and go after the people who break the good laws and write the bad laws.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m utterly unaware of this confidence of which you speak. Who&#39;s confident about what exactly?</p>

<p>The only thing anyone seems confident of is that this era of unchecked consumption is soon to come to an end.</p>

<p>Industrial ag is efficient in producing food, it just has bad side-effects.  If we priced in the externalities, maybe it would be less cost-effective.  But replacing automation with labor doesn&#39;t generally make something more cost-effective in USA.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying GMO&#39;s are inherently bad, nor am I saying they aren&#39;t the savior that may prevent mass famine in the world eventually. I am saying they need constant push for testing and evaluation. Real objective testing! Not backroom FDA deals and corrupt funded testing. </p>

<p>GMO&#39;s aren&#39;t a polarized issue. They aren&#39;t either a always perfectly safe God-send or the evil devil poison. They have a lot of potential, but should be regarded with heavy scrutiny and care. With the current mass corruption within the scientific research, testing, and regulation industries, one should be even more diligent to pressure for transparency and stiff regulation.</p>

<p>Because there is no such thing as well-studied changes. Think of it as your bed room. You know that if you flip the light switch, the light should come on. Propagandized rhetoric wants you to believe that GM modification is simply flipping on and off lights. In reality, we know that flipping on a light switch does turn on the lights, but we know it can and frequently does hundreds of other things. Hopefully one isn&#39;t burn the room, disappear the bed, or make the carpet poisonous. Current GMO testing amounts to a quick visual inspection, &quot;yep, bed&#39;s still here and light is on, good to go!&quot;...lets hope that carpet isn&#39;t poisonous!</p>

<p>This is true for novel GE and non-GE cultivars alike.</p>

<p>No, that&#39;s not the argument. The argument is: conventional methods pose the same risk and are not tested/regulated. Biotech poses the same risk but <em>is</em> tested/regulated. There is no reason to exclusively refer to GE cultivars when discussing safety.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the issue here is the level of understanding on the topic. It does seem disingenuous to associate GM with conventional breeding if you don&#39;t know much about the process or genetics in general. </p>

<p>GM is just a breeding technique, you can take a gene from one strain of corn and chuck it in another, something you could do with conventional breeding except you&#39;d end up with a bunch of other stuff you didn&#39;t want. You can also add in genes from other species, which sounds scarey until you realise we already share a lot of genes with other species. Your fresh organic carrots already have some genes in there that are also watermelons. </p>

<p>The origin of the genetic material doesn&#39;t matter. If we know what it does (what protein it produces and what that protein does/interacts with) it&#39;s hardly black magic to determine what effect it will have in the plant.</p>

<p>GM crops are actually pretty extensively tested, they cost a ton of money so these &#39;greedy&#39; biotech companies aren&#39;t going to waste that on something that will need to get recalled, or something that doesn&#39;t do what it&#39;s supposed to. </p>

<p>If you want to worry about unintended consequences in your food you should look up mutagenesis, it&#39;s a breeding technique that involves blasting seeds with radiation and/or chemicals to encourage random mutations, and then growing the results. Plants produced this way can even be certified organic and there aren&#39;t any safety testing regulations in place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should trust yourself. I imagine there are some people around reddit (on both sides of many topics) who have a financial interest in getting you to think one way or another. So you&#39;re safest just not listening to anyone, spend some time researching any claims you come across, there&#39;s a lot of stuff being misrepresented on both sides of the fence so look at sources, check for rebuttals or crticisms on studies. It takes time but people trying to sell you their point of view hope that you don&#39;t take that time (it&#39;s amazing how often scientific studies are misrepresented in the media in order to make them sound more exciting or revolutionary). You just need to remember that the organics industry is worth billions a year, so they definitely have an interest in convincing people that eating conventional produce is bad for you. At the same time the biotech companies have a financial interest in convincing people their products are safe. IMO the important difference is that if you lie about stuff being dangerous you aren&#39;t putting people at risk (and therefore are less likely to get in trouble for it) where as if you lie about something being safe it could cost your company a lot of money (which would probably act as a deterrent if that&#39;s all they cared about, providing they could still make some money without unsafe products (unlike tobacco companies for instance)). </p>

<p>Long story short it&#39;s good to be skeptical, just be aware that people lieing to you to sell you stuff isn&#39;t limited to biotech companies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As weird/interesting as that is I don&#39;t think that farmer would be too informed on the subject of modern seed contracts. If you find a normal commodity scale farmer they will tell you there are many many seed companies all vying for their business. Monsanto most definitely does not have anyone under the gun.  Monsanto also doesn&#39;t go around suing anyone. Infact the burden of proof is on Monsanto to prove someone willfully cultivated their seeds without paying for them (see the Canadian farmer case). </p>

<p>Also you said it would take a super computer to determine any negative health effects of GMOs. Well this is kind of what&#39;s being done. The first step and a very important step in deterring the toxicology of a molecule/protein is running the protein structures through huge databases and modeling software that will detect any allergy &quot;motif&quot; or shape.  It should also be said all BT based GMO proteins are all variations of the same natural protein from Bacillius thuringiensis. So it&#39;s not some crazy alien protein just a tweaked natural protein that shows no evidence of toxicological effects in silico, in vitro or in vivo. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Modern artificial GMO methods are not like anything that nature has seen before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not true. Transgenesis is taking advantage of something we found in nature. In fact, if you&#39;ve ever eaten a sweet potato, you have eaten a food that is the result of natural transgenesis. We are just taking advantage of a natural process to target the particular genes we want. In that sense, it is exactly like selective/cross breeding, as we target the genes we want, and interfere with nature until we get the desired results.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laboratory genetic modification does not take into account the natural constrains and requirements of the environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neither does cross-breeding nor selective breeding. These things are bred for desirable traits for human cultivation (taste, size, efficiency, etc), and would not have spontaneously evolved in nature. We have been avoiding evolution for a long time and taking matters into our own hands.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but anyone who thinks that selective breeding and (let me be careful about using the word GMO), &quot;modern methods&quot;, are the same are out of touch with reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve never met anyone who thinks they are &quot;the same.&quot; If they were the same, they probably wouldn&#39;t have a different name. What most people argue is that there appears to be no reason to treat them differently. Just like we don&#39;t treat cross-breeding and selective breeding differently, there seems to be no reason to treat GMOs differently.</p>

<p>Sure, I agree that saying &quot;we&#39;ve been genetically modifying our food forever&quot; is an ignorant thing to say. There are definitely uninformed or minimally informed supporters of GMOs. However, saying that transgenesis is &quot;not like anything that nature has seen before&quot; is an equally uninformed statement, which is getting lots of upvotes here. Because of that, can I consider your post to be propaganda?</p>

<p>What you don&#39;t seem to understand is that pretty much nothing you eat has been the result of &quot;an evolving ecosystem.&quot; You are the one &quot;propagandizing&quot; the definition of &quot;evolving ecosystem&quot; by trying to include human led cross breeding and selective breeding into the definition. This is just patently false.</p>

<p>Cross breeding and selective breeding are probably close to GM than they are to nature led evolution.</p>
