<p>As a kid, I had little concept of ‘free time’ versus ‘work’ or ‘labor’ versus ‘leisure.’ I was a fully integrated person, able to maintain a state of presence and detachment in any situation. Sure, I’d sometimes get bored at school and watch the clock until the bell rang, but I’d also occasionally feel bored on the weekends and look forward to seeing my friends on Monday. I experienced life as a continuous flow, with each moment equally important as the last.</p>

<p>By high school, however, certain days and moments emerged as clearly better than others. Hanging out with my friends on Friday night was simply way more fun and meaningful than going to Spanish class on Tuesday mornings. I still did well in school, but like most kids, I resisted it and looked forward to the weekends. Weekdays began to feel more like weak-days; I spent many of them in a low-energy and mildly irritable state. This seemed to be normal - statements like, “I hate Mondays” and “This week is going to be hell” were commonplace amongst my peers. </p>

<p>When you live like this (and I think a lot of Americans can relate to the mental state I described), free time begins to take on a lot more importance in your life. After work and on the weekends you get to relax, blow off steam, and pursue interesting hobbies. As you get older, you also begin to seek out pleasure during these times- you can masturbate (or even have sex!), drink, or smoke pot. Most of your favorite experiences now occur during free time. Indeed, people, especially when they are young, spend most of their time talking and thinking about free time activities. 99% of photos posted on Facebook are taken during free time (look at your newsfeed if you don’t believe me.) Sitcoms are essentially highlight reels of what characters do in their free time, and what’s ‘cool’ (hooking up, being popular, etc.) almost always is completely separate from work (in fact, the kids who really buy into schoolwork are often considered losers.)</p>

<p>By the time kids graduate college, the free time versus work time dichotomy is fully internalized. Indeed, Gallup’s 2013 State of the American Workplace study, which polled over 150,000 Americans, revealed that a full <a href="http://www.ryot.org/gallup-poll-70-americans-disengaged-jobs/376177">70% of Americans</a> are “disengaged” from their work. Of that 70%, “18% are actively disengaged or, as Gallup CEO Jim Clifton put it in the report, ‘roam the halls spreading discontent.’” (1) The masses adopt low-grade multiple personality disorder. They have a work self, accustomed to doing repetitive labor in a mildly irritable state, and a home self accustomed to seeking relief via drugs, food, and television. The self is not integrated. It resists work all week without realizing that, if you resist something you do for 5/7th of your life, you become that resistance. Resistance and irritability are now your baseline state. </p>

<p>This schizoid response to the 9 to 5 lifestyle has not gone unnoticed by psychologists and social commentators. Famed German sociologist Theodor Adorno wrote, “Amusement under late capitalism is the prolongation of work. It is sought after as an escape from the mechanised work process, and to recruit strength in order to be able to cope with it again.” (2)
    As Adorno says, we are kept tired and stressed in the 9 to 5 lifestyle and thus need to consume all sorts of products and entertainment in order to gather the energy to get through the week. In other words, next time you use the word free time, consider the fact that this term also implies you have slave time. ‘Free time’ and ‘work time’ are for slaves. Integrate your personality and live your life NOW. </p>

<p>The second part of this post will discuss the negative impact consumerism and escapism have on us in more detail. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I expected some replies like this. Keep in mind - I am arguing for <em>less</em> free time (i.e. less time spent watching television and screwing around.) </p>

<p>The alternative to the 9 to 5 lifestyle is not sitting on your couch doing nothing. It&#39;s actually taking <em>full</em> responsibility for creating the life you want to live. Once you own your time, you can fully commit to raising your family, volunteering in your community, taking care of your health, finding outlets for your creativity, and becoming truly educated. These are significant responsibilities, but do not happen in a cubicle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Responsibilities can be had under many different other types of working environments than the bleak, depressive cycle the poster points to. There are many strict guidelines in place that guide everyone Moon day to Sun&#39;s day, that seem to place many different people under very similar protocol resulting in much of the populous engaging and disengaging with society in very similar and often diseased ways. </p>

<p>The answer to OP is from the days of the week, to school curriculum and vectoring processes, it&#39;s very guided, specific to the west and to America. Forms of MC have been deeply embedded into daily life for a very long time. How else could societies be led? Look at the rules PLATO laid out even down to what societies should eat en masse in order to deplete certain human expressions. </p>

<p>So figure out what type of work would be your art and persue that in order to survive. </p>
