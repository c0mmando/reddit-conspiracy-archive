      <p>
       The United States occupies a dominant position on the global stage, but most people do not believe this position came about (or is maintained) via violent force. If you ask the average citizen, the age of Imperialism is basically over. We live in more enlightened times, have a democratic system that functions relatively well, and do not openly talk about conquering foreign lands. People assume that the United States basically wants to do good in the world, and see events like the Iraq War as isolated instances of corruption and negligence rather than part of any unified strategy to project U.S. power abroad. I believe this ‘standard’ view of United States foreign policy is incorrect and that we are, in reality, an empire no different than Rome.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Empire
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Before we begin, I think it’s important to get a working definition of ‘empire.’ For me, empires are systems of governance in which states seek to prosper by dominating the people, land, and resources of neighboring territories. Empires expand and contract over time based on how well they do in competition against other empires. A classic example we all studied in Middle School was the Roman Empire. Rome began as a single city on the Italian peninsula and then, after many brutal military campaigns, became immensely wealthy and grew to take over most of modern day Europe and North Africa.
      </p>
      <p>
       We assume the modern day United States would never function like Rome. Dominating foreign lands and people seems old fashioned and morally wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Truth
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Like Rome, the United States began small and expanded outwards via constant warfare. We fought the British in 1776 and 1812, the Mexicans in 1846, and hundreds of independent Native American states along the way. These wars allowed us to expand from a narrow foothold on the Eastern seaboard to the sprawling 3,000 mile wide country we have today.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the early 20th century, the United States had consolidated a large chunk of the North American landmass and thus began looking towards overseas territories for further expansion opportunities. I think this point of history (the early 20th century) is where confusion begins to arise. We are hit with a ton of propaganda that tries to reorient how we think about the recent past. History textbooks characterize pre-World War II U.S. foreign policy as ‘isolationist’ despite the fact that we violently intervened in many countries during this time period. United States Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler, one of the most decorated marines of all time, wrote in 1935:
      </p>
      <p>
       I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents. (1)

       <strong>
        Today
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing has changed to this day; in fact, the empire is bigger than ever before. It is rarely talked about in the mainstream media, but the United States has a network of over 700 military bases around the world. (2) Speaking about the difference between Russia and the Untied States, Vladimir Putin told an interviewer, “I invite you to publish the world map in your newspaper and to mark all the US military bases on it. You will see the difference.” (3) When these bases do come up, Americans seem to assume they are mostly harmless relics from World War II that do not play an important role in global politics. This is completely incorrect. Just like every other empire in history, the U.S. uses bases to dominate resources and nations. Iran is completely

        surrounded
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       We have 38,000 troops in Germany and 49,000 troops in Japan (4), countries we have occupied since we beat them on the battlefield in World War II. These nations are not allowed to have independent militaries. Imagine if a foreign country had thousands of troops in the United States and prevented us from having a military industrial complex that rakes in billions of dollars each year!
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Conclusion
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no country, only an empire. The United States government has divided the world into ten

        command centers
       </a>
       each headed by a 4-star (or above) general. The military works to promote U.S. corporate interests abroad and, when it can get away with it, will invade and occupy weaker nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this post, it was not my intention to take a side and declare if this system is good or bad. Rather, I just want to raise awareness about the true nature of global politics. Many of the points I've mentioned here aren't even brought up during debates or on talk shows and I think that needs to change.

       There is a really great little book called 'Are We Rome?' which examines this issue in detail. Supringly there were over a hundred different reasons why Rome ended the way it did, and not the ones ones commonly listed today (sexual deviance etc). Among the main causes for collapse were: Corrupt governments that sold off public works to private interests, military over-reach, uncontrolled immigration and Apocalyptic Christianity  (followers refused to make any efforts on behalf of Rome and ran up huge debts in anticipation of Christ's immediate return). These sound familiar?

       Yes they did. For the first few centuries of empire, the Roman Legion was the equivalent to a nuclear weapon. The so-called Pax Romana was based on the Legions annihilating your country if you didn't toe the line. Then the filthy barbarians got their hands on similar tech and it all went downhill... until (Eastern) Rome adopted a new nuke in the form of heavily armoured warhorses that would dominate the battlefield for centuries.

       No not really. If any one date could be said to mark Romes fall it would be 410 when Alaric the Visigoth sacked the city. But leading up to that date Rome lost many small battles which weakened it militarily. The USA has been constantly at war somewhere since WW2 ended but has not won a war in 70 years! From Vietnam to Afghanistan American forces went home with nothing to show for their sacrifices. You can't use nukes on scattered tribes or terrorists. The overall impression now is America is weak and can't secure its territories, foreign interests or borders. Like ancient Rome, death by a thousand cuts is a real danger!

       Before Washington, DC was conceptualized the hill where the Capitol now stands was called
       <a href="http://ghostsofdc.org/2014/02/11/washington-originally-called-rome/">
        Rome
       </a>
       and the Potomac was actually called
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiber_Creek">
        Tiber
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A long time ago, way before the city was in the thoughts of our founding fathers, back in the 17th century, there was a large estate in the area of about 400 acres. This farm occupied the land southeast of Georgetown (then, a part of Maryland). The man who owned the land was fond of Italy and decided to name the estate Rome, in honor of the city. The small body of water bordering it to the south was originally called Goose Creek, but then took the new name, Tiber Creek (i.e., after the The Tiber in Rome). Of course, the story wouldn’t be complete without mentioning that the landowner’s name happened to be Francis Pope.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to an article I came across in The Washington Post from October 7th, 1883, the land was laid out and acquired by Pope on June 5th, 1663. Also, legend has it, that Francis was very proud of his ingenious naming scheme, often telling anyone who’d listen that America had its own Rome on the Tiber, and a Pope lived there.

       I think we own the stage, so to speak.  The reason the average Joe doesn't know this is because the rules have changed and we don't know about it unless you look for it . So while we appear not to dominate, all these countries have their sovereignty on paper, yes. However, I think new standards have been created that the citizen doesn't know so it appears we are following our own rules.  I had a hard time coming up with the wording so if it's vague I will work on reworking it

       Caesar was a populist reformer that opposed the oligarchs in the Senate consolidating their power. Cassius, Brutus, and the other assassins were on the side of the oligarchs. They were threatened by Caesar. I'd rather have a Caesar than a Brutus.

       You misunderstand me. Caesar knew the game of politics and played it well. He played it so well, his friends assassinated him.

       I maintain, Caesar was politically, and intellectually, a badass. I especially loved the part where he killed his pirate captors.

       The subject was widely discussed when I was in high school, too. American Cultural Imperialism was a common phrase (used both to differentiate America from Rome and to make connections), as was the Fifty-First State, especially in the aftermath of Iraq. It was pretty obvious to us that George Bush was Caesar and that we had simply exchanged one imperial master for another. I left high school in 1992.

       Nice distraction there. Too bad it leaves out the "nation" that controls nearly every aspect of our foreign policy, and recieves more cash from us than any other nation by far, and gee, I dunno, LOANS us our dollar? Say, WHO really benefits from the chaos in the Middle East? WHO gets away with attacking us, stealing secrets from us, spying on us? WHO owns our media, our banks, most of our industries? WHO has armies of fake cyber warriors that spend all day and night trying to deflect attention away from their influence and actions? WHO is the most powerful lobby in the nation?

       Spent two weeks at a religious retreat in high school on a Hopi reservation in Arizona. The pastor (who was Hopi) gave a sermon to us on our first night echoing how the US was on the path of Rome. This was in 95 and I thought he was crazy. Now that I'm older and more aware of the rest of the world and all that it's worth, he's right and so is this post.

       Since the usurpation of America, Washington has been called
       <em>
        Rome on the Potomac
       </em>
       . The capitol used to be in Philadelphia but was moved by the influence of the Carrol family so that the Jesuits could oversee the capitol from Georgetown University (founded by the Jesuit John Carrol). Every major city has a Jesuit University near its capitol. We see it in Washington, London, Munich, etc.  All of the major intelligence and policy advisers in the US are Jesuit-trained, most from Georgetown. The Jesuits absolutely are planning on destroying this nation and it will be part of the Fourth Reich as part of the Third Thirty Years War. The first Reich was the Holy Roman Empire which was unofficially started by Charlemagne. The Second Reich was the Kaiser Reich. The Third Reich was Nazi Germany which was aligned with the other axis powers. The USA, EU and UN/NATO will be part of the new axis powers analogous to those of the Second World War and they will fail by design. The new world powers will be sought to be established in the Middle East and Far East.

       You see the story of the Roman empire collapse was because of many tribes (like the vandals, goths, etc.) attacking Rome when it was weak. That's true, but no one seems to wanna say why it got weak. Many say overexpansion but that was NOT the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       For most of Rome's existence there was a simple concept. Serve in the military and you get "citizenship" so because of that simple concept many enlisted in the hopes that they live through the service and can live out the rest of their lives as respected Romans. One day a progressive emperor came along (cant remember his name) and he gave everyone citizenship, regardless of military service. This saw a steep drop in enlistments. Why would most risk dying in the army when there was no longer any reward (citizenship). Because of the Roman army being small and undermanned, the barbarian tribes had no problem overcoming them.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are seeing this happen too. The world is volatile and politicians want to strip the US military. They want to strip funding for vital defense spending so lazy fucks can get welfare and free this or free that. Education and healthcare is important yes, but NOT when you have to sacrifice an army to afford it. If we continue to defund the army we will collapse like Rome. Our enemies (Russia, China, Iran, and NK) circle like hawks, waiting for weakness to strike.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: Rome used to give citizenship to those that joined the army, an emperor gave everyone citizenship, few joined the army, Rome got taken over due to tiny army. US defunding army....the cycle repeats?

       Don't we out spend our rivals like 10 to one? Would making it 8to one or 5 to one really make a huge difference? Not saying to gut it but it could be shrunk budget wise and that money could be used to help you country in other ways

       The thing is a lot of that money already goes to paying countries for leasing us land for bases. Our soldiers are already making shit pay and their the ones who are gonna suffer from a smaller budget. You really think the 5 million dollar a year general salary will get shrunk? Hell no, the 30K a year private pay is whats gonna get sliced. We have armies worldwide and it costs money to support such a vast area. Also it creates jobs. Not just for soldiers, but those that make armaments and such. That money that the US spends on war, it gets some of it back through taxes corporations and people who benefit from it pay.

       During battles they did, however they didn't do it due to a small army. They usually sent mercs as cannon fodder, while most of their army was solely guarding borders. I cant imagine too many mercs would join Rome when they knew it was seeing its last days.

       Much of Roman culture was appropriated from the Greeks, whom the Romans greatly admired. Roman culture was generally considered inferior to Greek, even by contemporary writers. In this regard, America is still quite similar, as the Americans have generally borrowed Western European culture, but is considered a poor copy.

       inflicts upon the rest of the world. I don't know what it's like in other countries, but in Australia we will often have the original version almost side-by-side with the US remake. While this will usually happen on different channels (
       <em>
        Homeland
       </em>
       is broadcast on Network 10, but the Israeli original is broadcast on SBS, for example), we occasionally have things like
       <em>
        Cold Case
       </em>
       where the Canadian series was aired straight after the US remake for a couple of seasons. When you see the shows almost side-by-side like that you can really appreciate just how good the good remakes are, at the same time it highlights that the bad remakes are often truly horrific.

       The only thing I hate about this system is that TPTB actually steal $$ from its own citizens (in unaccounted tax money) to buy $50m mansions for themselves or friends.

       Other than that, this is a whole lot better than thousands of countries all trying to destroy each other. There needs to be a United World at this point in our history or we won't go beyond what we are and will eventually fall into ruin.

       Much of Roman culture was appropriated from the Greeks, whom the Romans greatly admired. Roman culture was generally considered inferior to Greek, even by contemporary writers. In this regard, America is still quite similar, as the Americans have generally borrowed Western European culture, but is considered a poor copy.

       Well yes, why wouldn't you want an army. We will never be some fairy tale utopia where dictators don't exist. There will always be enemies hence why armies are necessary. They are there for domestic and foreign threats.
