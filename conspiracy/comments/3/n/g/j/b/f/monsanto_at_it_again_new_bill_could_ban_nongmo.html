        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>DARK Act on the Fast Track to Approval—We Need to Act Now!The industry-sponsored voluntary GMO labeling bill is heading for a floor vote in the House, and could be voted on any day now. URGENT Action Alert!Last week, the “Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015” introduced by Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-KS)—better known by pro-labeling advocates as the “Deny Americans’ Right to Know (DARK) Act”—was approved by the House Agriculture Committee.The next stop for the bill was supposed to be the Energy and Commerce Committee. But hours after the Ag Committee approved it, the announcement came that the bill would go right to the House floor just days later, bypassing Energy and Commerce altogether.</p>

<p>Regular readers will remember that the DARK Act would pre-empt state-level, mandatory GMO labeling efforts with a wholly voluntary federal standard. Companies could elect to apply to the USDA for a “GMO-free” label, and then the FDA would review the product—or they could elect not to label their products at all, leaving consumers in the dark about what’s in their food. The bill is being pushed by the biotech industry and the Grocery Manufacturer’s Association.New additions to the DARK Act also prevent local communities from banning GMO crops!If the DARK Act passes the House, its next stop would be the Senate. We reported in May that Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND) is preparing his own—again, completely voluntary—GMO labeling bill. Whether the Senate will consider the House-approved DARK Act, or Hoeven’s bill when it’s ready, or neither, remains to be seen.</p>

<p>These developments come on the heels of a new study that raises even more concerns about the safety of GMO foods. The study, published in the Agricultural Sciences journal, found evidence that genetic modifications can destroy the equilibrium in cells, in some cases resulting in an accumulation of formaldehyde. The study makes suggestions as to how to improve health and safety testing of GMOs as the White House begins a review of how the government regulates GMOs (see the next article in this week’s Pulse for more details).As we’ve said before, supporters of the DARK Act seem to care more about doing the bidding of the biotech industry than about standing up for consumers. Poll after poll after poll show that consumers consistently and overwhelmingly support mandatory GMO labeling. </p>

<p>That this bill is being put on the fast track by lawmakers kowtowing to powerful special interests with deep pockets is a clear affront to constituents.Besides the fact that consumers have a right to know what’s in their food, the DARK Act also unfairly puts the onus on traditional farmers and food producers to label their food as “GMO-free” when it should be the other way around. Small producers would likely be unable to afford the costs of whatever process USDA develops for the “GMO-free” label, and USDA is so thoroughly pro-GMO that the process might be unfriendly even for big producers.Companies are trying to put what amounts to little more than rogue science experiments on our tables: no long-term safety studies have shown that GMOs are safe, yet there is a tremendous amount of evidence that GMOs are extremely dangerous. Such companies should be the ones alerting the public of their food’s contents. </p>

<p>Under the DARK Act, Americans would need to play a guessing game about what’s in their food.Unfortunately—but unsurprisingly—the mainstream media also seem to be compliant with biotech’s goals. When Chipotle announced they were going GMO-free, mainstream media outlets like Timemagazine, NPR, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, and the Chicago Tribune skewered the company for its decision. Rather than critically presenting ALL of the evidence of the GMO debate, many news outlets chose to present the issue as if the science were completely settled and GMOs are safe. It is noteworthy that these same media outlets depend on industry advertising for their survival.Incidentally, we’ve seen similar trends in the coverage of the vaccine issue: non-scientists in the media attempting to convince the public that the science on an issue is settled when the reverse is actually true, and anyone who disagrees is an unhinged conspiracy theorist. (Note: you can visit our GMO Fact Check page to see biotech’s pro-GMO arguments debunked point-by-point.)</p>

<p>Another good example is a recent editorial in the Washington Post titled, “Why We’re So Scared of GMOs, According to Someone Who Has Studied Them Since the Start.” The “someone” presented in the article is an agricultural researcher at a Midwestern land-grant university—institutions that, starved of federal funds, are increasingly becoming extensions of Monsanto and Dow’s research and development departments. Can we rely on researchers at such institutions to be fair and balanced when it comes to presenting the science on GMOs? You decide.The bottom line is that consumers have spoken loud and clear when it comes to the issue of GMO labeling. We must now work to make that voice heard in the halls of the Capitol ( via healthimpactnews.com ).</p>

<p>Yes, the title is a lie, read the text of the actual bill. H.R.1599 bans states from mandatory GMO labeling. It does not ban non-GMO labeling. If anything, it setups a government sponsored non-GMO label.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For a food to be sold as a product produced without genetic engineering (non-GMO), the food must be subject to supply chain process controls that keep the product separated from GMOs and must be produced and handled in compliance with a non-genetically engineered food plan</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To pick the most important two sections out of that massive text block. </p>

<ol>
<li>Companies could elect to apply to the USDA for a “GMO-free” label, and then the FDA would review the product—or they could elect not to label their products at all, leaving consumers in the dark about what’s in their food.</li>
</ol>

<p>Translation:
Is your food labeled gmo free?
    Yes? Then it is.
Is your food made by a large national chain food producer and not labeled gmo free?
    It&#39;s not leaving anyone in the dark, gmo was cheaper and more profitable, they used it.</p>

<ol>
<li> Small producers would likely be unable to afford the costs of whatever process USDA develops for the “GMO-free” label, and USDA is so thoroughly pro-GMO that the process might be unfriendly even for big producers.</li>
</ol>

<p>Translation?
Bullshit.
The &quot;all natural gluten free no added sugar free range no preservative no corn syrup locally grown (union made?) Fair Trade and whatever else&quot; market is massive and stuffed with buzzwords and high dollar items.</p>

<p>It would take fees and processes large enough to start a court battle over to keep companies from jumping on the non gmo labeling bandwagon.</p>

<p>Sure, mandatory labeling is cheaper and more informative for all but don&#39;t go saying/pretending there won&#39;t be any labeled if it&#39;s voluntary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve tried, it like trying to convince a theist there is no evidence for god. But the arguments are the same. Positives claims require evidence to be accepted. </p>

<p>The claim that GMOs are bad does not have supporting evidence, so that claim can be disregarded. There is no reason for anyone to believe this claim. </p>

<p>The law also does not stop anyone from labeling their foods as GMO-Free just like nothing stops them from labeling them as Gluten free. There is also nothing stopping citizens or organizations from providing collected data to interested consumers about what products contain GMOs. It could be a paid service or even free if someone is willing to do the work, and the interface could be an online searchable directory or even a smartphone app with a barcode scanner. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm059098.htm">The FDA does not regulate or restrict the terms GMO free or non-GMO
</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The industry started this fight</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How so? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Give the consumers what they want. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are. A Food producer can label their products as not containing GMOs, or as containing GMOs if they are. They just are not mandated to. </p>

<p>Why should they be mandated to be labeled? <a href="https://imgur.com/s8IYdTk">They aren&#39;t harmful.</a> No one is stopping anyone from making a database of GM containing products and making it freely available. I could imagine an app for smart phones that scans barcodes and tells you about the product, including if it contains GMOs. </p>

<p>Why not start a kickstarter to  make that? Why does the government have to step in to our lives? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>GMO industry needs to man up and offer GMO free seeds instead</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are already suppliers who offer GMO free seeds. They just can&#39;t out compete the quality production of GM crops. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>but that&#39;s not profitable and cannot be protected by IP law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you understand this. But just because they out compete organic growers doesn&#39;t mean they should be banned or have to come with a warning label that has zero substantiation other than some people are afraid of them but have no evidence to be. </p>

<p>The response I often get to this rationalization is that they are in fact dangerous. Sometimes I get called a shill, or say I haven&#39;t checked the evidence myself, they cite discredited and retracted papers based on unreproducable experiments, some worse name calling and condescending questions as to why I defend some evil company.</p>

<p>Let me shortcut past any of that in the interest of having a discussion with you. I promise you, you can change my mind on this subject. In fact I used to be anti-GMO myself. <strong>When I really looked into the evidence on the issue in the form of peer reviewed published science papers I realized that not only is there zero (literally zero as in not one) scientific research paper published in a peer reviewed science journal that has not be logically discredited, disproven, or retracted that has shown any harm from consuming genetically modified agricultural products in humans or any other animals.</strong> </p>

<p>I made the last sentence bold, not to be some chest thumping exclamation or meant to be taken in an inflammatory context. It is just the justification for my change of mind on this issue. It was an enlightening experience and I really do enjoy when I have a belief that changes. It is what makes science and learning of new evidence a beautiful experience. It&#39;s like hearing a new favorite song for the first time. </p>

<p>So that is the reason I maintain that GM foods are perfectly safe. Corporations like Monsanto should be under the scrutiny of the public. They have had a checkered past that I am not absolving them of. I only posit that on this issue, they is no logical reason to be against GM foods as a technology, as a whole, or as a product regardless of whom it is produced by. </p>

<p>As to why I engage on this topic on the internet, it is because I am chasing that enlightening moment where my mind will change and I have to reevaluate my beliefs. I aim to experience another moment like that or inspire that experience in someone else. </p>

<p>To that end, please, find me evidence that disproves that bolded sentence above and I will be grateful to you because you will have shown something totally new to me, that could very well change my opinion on this subject. </p>

<p>Further, the law proposed actually codifies the FDA&#39;s power to require permission to label products GMO free, which is highly immoral and backward.  To switch up the argument and hid this point is sneaky and sophistical.</p>

<p>It does not matter.  It is clear that the science is hidden and manipulated.  Those papers that do occasionally appear are soon removed, and based on Monsato and Syngenta&#39;s history, we cannot trust any of the science.  People fucking don&#39;t trust the FDA or the GMO&#39;s anymore, even if they do happen to be safe.  I say fuck&#39;em.  Label this shit and let the consumers decide.  No more fucking around.  If GMO&#39;s are good for you, then the GMO makers need to prove it to the consumers and stop pissing around with the democratic process.  The states have spoken that they want labelling, and the GMO makers are interfering because they simply want control and more fucking profits.</p>

<p>So?!?  If &quot;science&quot; is correct, then let those who are &quot;smart&quot; select the GMO&#39;s.  It will be a selling point.  The GMO industry needs to stop whining and give consumers the choice.  They should stop hiding behind &quot;non labels&quot; and voluntarily label their products, but they will not do that.  Screw the GMO industry.  Their motive is only about profit and control, not about serving the consumer demand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Activists and organic food companies want it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So?  GMO makers don&#39;t want organic products and want only to sell their products and garner market share.  Its not an argument for any measure of &quot;fair&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And they spread misinformation and outright lies about GMOs to push consumers into supporting anti-science laws. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP-6Gp5RbjQ">And GMO makers deceive and punish scientists who blow the whistle.</a>.  The &quot;science&quot; argument doesn’t mean shit when it is corrupted by corporate interests.  People don&#39;t believe the science, and they have good reason not to.</p>

<p>This is war.  The GMO industry has launched the first salvo, and people are responding.  The GMO industry has NO moral legs to stand on.  There are no arguments to justify any new laws that favour GMO&#39;s.</p>
