<p>They say that space is basically a huge conspiracy. Except that a conspiracy <em>that</em> large could never, ever exist for more than 2 seconds. They say that the Earth is flat because their senses tell them so, except that if we relied solely on what our 5 senses could tell us, we would have no technology or scientific knowledge.</p>

<p>They also say that gravity doesn&#39;t exist. The reason we stay affixed to the Earth is because the Earth &quot;disk&quot; is moving upward through...some type of medium. But a theory is not just an idea. A theory is a concept that has stood up to at least some scrutiny. Where is their mathematical evidence? The <em>theory</em> of  gravity isn&#39;t just a nifty idea that Newton pulled out of his butt. He invented the calculus to demonstrate his theory. We use that same mathematical model to get to other planets. </p>

<p>It really hurts my brain, and it makes me sad that anyone could buy into this. </p>

<hr/>

<p>The more I think about it, the more I have to conclude that the founders of the movement are perfectly sane, and they know that there is money in pandering to crazies. I&#39;m 99% sure that&#39;s it. It will start with a subscription-based, &quot;super exclusive&quot; podcast and graduate to seminars, books, etc. The movement will never get very big, but the proceeds could support a few people. </p>

<p>Rush Limbaugh basically does the same thing..not saying his audience is as far out as the flat-earthers. I&#39;m <em>not</em> saying that...really..I&#39;m not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes (I&#39;m not a flat earther). </p>

<p>Look, I&#39;m all for questioning everything about anything. We can&#39;t just take things at face value every time it&#39;s presented. I get that.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve given flat earth theory a real shot, seriously. It just doesn&#39;t hold up. At the end of the day, its like saying 4-4 isn&#39;t 0. </p>

<p>Personally, I haven&#39;t been in orbit around earth to <em>really</em> know for a fact based on personal experience. But you wanna know who has? A bunch of people. Why would these people lie? They aren&#39;t even from the same agencies in the same countries.</p>

<p>Look at the ISS. Is that fake? All of the engineering, the people who go, the planning, the science behind it... Why would that be fake? What do people gain by hosting a massive conspiracy that the earth is really flat? </p>

<p>At the end of the day it&#39;s just paranoia and ignorance. I&#39;m all for theories that go against the grain, but flat earth just isn&#39;t one, it&#39;s a waste of time. It&#39;s almost worthy of r/iamverysmart, only it&#39;s just paranoia and not an overblown ego. </p>

<p>That&#39;s my 2 cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. That&#39;s just wrong ultimately...</p>

<p>All it takes is investing a few hours into looking into the ISS alone, there is a huge amount of information to look at, watch some videos in how it was created....I suggest anyone to look up the ISS and what it takes to do what it does, sending materials/astronauts up to it every so often from Kazakhstan. It&#39;s amazing....the calculation, the experiments that they&#39;re doing like the <a href="http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/HDEV/">HDEV</a>...beautiful.

    <div class="md"><p>My question in regards to conspiracies I doubt are &quot;real&quot; is simple. </p>

<p>&quot;What is the motive of the conspiracy?&quot;</p>

<p>All conspiracies I can think of include a motive behind them. JFK, Moon Landing, Aliens all have an ultimate reasoning behind them. But Flat Earth theory? The only motive I see is the discrediting of science. What is the benefit of hiding flat earth? </p>

<p>Surely the revelation that we live on a flat world would shatter the foundations of everything we know. Why would it be hidden from us? So we can use technology that only works with the round earth model? That makes no sense. </p>

<p>Why do we even have economies based upon aerospace? Why are there multi-billion dollar companies creating technology engineered to only work in space? (Japan&#39;s Solar Sail)</p>

<p>The manpower required to keep a flat earth conspiracy under wraps would be incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Key words, <strong>he invented something to prove his theory</strong>. One could say he created something to confirm his bias?</p>

<p>Either way, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll truly ever know, until I can rocket up and see for myself. That&#39;s just the type of person I am. The CGI NASA gives me is not enough. I don&#39;t fully buy it... They are most definitely keeping secrets of space from us.</p>

<p>If the Earth is flat, there should be record of these extra &quot;celestial bodies.&quot; As in, ancient Chinese and Mayan records. Star gazing was one of their major pass times, and they were really good at it. Oh, and the Greeks would have called actual planets something else, because they would have used &quot;wanderer&quot; to describe these incredibly quick moving stars. (satellites)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying <em>he is</em> wrong. Like you said, everything is based on his work and his theory. Everything, on Earth that is. This whole model is based on those things. The point is, was this a conspiracy set in motion a long long time ago. For Earth.</p>

<p>Face it, a very small number of people have been to space. A major percentage of them are military and were/are Free Masons. His work may explain Earth, but I do not think it explains the universe. This is where I think they are lying to us (imo). They use the math to explain that the Sun is x millions of miles away and x large, to explain why it&#39;s so small and the same size as the moon. Same thing with why the constellations never change.

<p>I&#39;m not saying they are lying. They are doing work based off what they have been taught. Heliocentric Newtonian model. Their professors where taught that, and so on and so on. But, years back it had to be established. Hence the conspiracy. Just because you are taught something doesn&#39;t mean it right. Get what I&#39;m getting at? Science/mathmeticians/etc are not lying, their professors weren&#39;t lying, the people who created this <em>were</em> lying (imo).

<p>News flash, buddy: the ancients Greeks new the Earth was round. Why don&#39;t you? </p>

<p>Columbus and all his crew mates new the Earth was round. It is a myth that everyone else thought it was flat. His crewmates were reluctant to go with him not because they thought the Earth was flat, but because they knew that he was underestimating just how big it was. </p>

<p>No, it&#39;s not....at all. Sending people to space is prohibitively expensive. We can only send so many per year. It takes a lot of energy to get into earth orbit. There&#39;s nothing strange at all about this. </p>

<p>Now, it is sad that we have&#39;t been back to the moon...but that has more to do with geo-politics than anything. I will be very happy when we finally go to Mars so all the moon deniers can shut up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The flaw in your thinking is that you find it conceivable that all of those people could keep the secret. It is statistically impossible. People go senile. People have nervous breakdowns. Life happens. This idea that the secret would be kept is unbelievably silly. The only people claiming flat earth are relatively uneducated. Not even the former astronauts who claim to have seen UFOs are claiming flat earth. Not even one. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not weird that so few of us have been to space. It is incredibly expensive to send someone to space. Rocket fuel does not spring forth from the ground like crude oil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I saw a couple of reasons mentioned in some videos.. one was how religious texts apparently refer to the world as being flat or there being a dome or firmament or something, and if this was proven then religion would gain more power/followers etc which some non-religious people wouldn&#39;t want.</p>

<p>Another reason was that there is a conspiracy of there being more land beyond the &quot;ice wall&quot; which &quot;they&quot; don&#39;t want &quot;us&quot; to know about.</p>

<p>Oh and I hold no position on this conspiracy, except to say that I like starwars and startrek.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The problem with any major conspiracy theory is that it requires way too many people to be involved</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is one major mistake in assumption that almost all people make who object to conspiracy--they assume that everyone or nearly everyone contributing to the conspirator&#39;s agenda must know there is a conspiracy and be privy to the entire plan and all its details. This is not true, but conjuring up this assumption allows people to easily dismiss conspiracy with the understanding that too many knowing people would make it impossible to keep the secret. I certainly have never made a case for that all or even a many of the participants know the whole plan or even substantial parts of it. -Quite the contrary. All my writings have concentrated on explaining how and why top level conspirators use masses of predictable leftists, yes-men, ambitious lackeys and partially knowing ladder-climbers to do their bidding--specifically so as to limit the number who have &quot;need to know&quot; access. They cement together the whole conglomerate with subtle and not so subtle threats--and occasionally carry them out. Many are bought off with regular payments--like journalists and judges. Most know only parts of the puzzle.</p>

<p>However, almost everyone in high places does know there is &quot;power structure&quot; above them they dare not challenge, they also know it isn&#39;t good for their job, advancement or health to &quot;ask too many questions.&quot; Read any number of the tales by federal whistleblowers to confirm this general fear. Thus, most participants rationalize it all away as some benevolent control system, or believing that &quot;whoever they are&quot; must control the world in order to have stability. Others, especially in the enforcement ranks, are just too corrupt to care. But the bottom line is: very few know that the Powers That Be (PTB) intend to pull the nuclear trigger via Russia and China. All the little steps leading up to weakening the US and building up Russia and China are covered by liberal notions of &quot;détente,&quot; &quot;easing tensions,&quot; and &quot;peace.&quot; These lesser officials who are tasked to defend these lies tend to believe their own propaganda.

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with compartmentalization is the same, really, just in the opposite direction. People need to see the bigger picture to do their part effectively. Otherwise, far too much can go wrong, and you have all these chaotic elements in play at once. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just sayin... at Burning Man events, there are a lot of conspiracy theorists, and there are groups of conspiracies which are only popular online. The flat earth one... I&#39;ve never, ever heard anyone propose that in ten years and a thousand&#39;ish random conspiracy wonks.</p>

<p>If you throw enough effort into something, you can get a few people to believe anything... but there&#39;s just WAY too high a concentration of flat earthers here to seem even remotely plausible to me.</p>

<p>I met a dude in Seattle who told me the Earth was flat, and that Bill Gates was earning a Trillion dollars a day. That is my experience with &quot;flat earthers&quot;, outside of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. A decent percentage of my friends believe that they are being watched by an omnipotent entity. I&#39;ve got a few friends that believe in the Alien Conspiracy Coverup, and Illuminati fans, and Doomsday Revelations types... but not a single flat earther, ever.</p>

<p>It is almost always included in any list which dismisses &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; as a category, however, by shallow people who wish to seem witty and engage in cheap associative rhetoric.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you believe the Boston Bombing was staged? Did the reptilian illuminati do it as part of a plot to control the flat Earth?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, God. JFK, 9/11, Flat Earth, Illuminati, Aliens... I&#39;m just not into conspiracy theories.&quot;</p>

<p>I review the strength of the evidence every few months, because I see the population of flatters here... but I just don&#39;t find it convincing, at all. It is very hard for me to believe that they are sincere. We are toying with WW3, moving important geopolitical pieces about the board, and it is important that every intelligent individual get involved in the process of informing... so... - [ Wait... What is that?]</p>

<p>--They say-- I&#39;m just interested because I&#39;m trying to keep an open mind, and I&#39;m just so lost and alone and afraid because I just don&#39;t know what is real any more. I&#39;m just trying to find out the truth, just like all of you...</p>

<p>We don&#39;t like to out people specifically because we&#39;re nice and we give people the benefit of the doubt... too often.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the problem with the people in society out there... the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t buy this one. I think this and a group of conspiracy theories I shall call, &quot;Doomsday Memes&quot; are manufactured. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t get it. Just because some news anchors say it &quot;had&quot; to be a demolition, doesn&#39;t make it true. What do they know? If you fly something sufficiently massive into a tree, it will split and fall to the left or right, depending on direction of impact. But a skyscraper is not a tree. Most of the mass is at the foundation. So gravity. Further, the towers were among the first in the world to use modular construction...read, cheap. </p>

<p>When they towers were going up, I can just see the foreman saying, &quot;Geez, I hope no crazies drive a plane into this pile of bolts, or she&#39;s comin&#39; down!&quot; </p>

<p>It just so happens that someone did. </p>

<p>The towers fell like that because the steel supports warped under the intense heat of the fire. It&#39;s infinitely more probable  that the building was just constructed shoddily than that the government toppled the towers themselves. They don&#39;t need a reason to go to war with the middle east if they really want to that bad. That&#39;s what they have a CIA for. They could manufacturer a way to do it that is much simpler and that costs fewer lives. </p>

<p>I site the ISS because it is a huge counter-argument against flat earth theory. The ISS is a collaboration of many space programs not just NASA, but the Japanese, Canadien, European, and Russian space programs.

    <div class="md"><p>I am saying they are insane, yes. Just imo. The earth was proven round centuries ago. It&#39;s as if I said screw germ theory, faeries spread disease. When people thought that maggots formed from rotting material, a simple experiment proved it false. But we can&#39;t prove a negative. If we took one of these guys into space so that they could see the spherical Earth, they would claim that the shuttle&#39;s windows are &quot;fish eye lenses.&quot; If we put them in a space suit, they would claim that the helmet was jerry-rigged. It&#39;s an assault on philosophy, science and common sense. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all good and well to respect ideas..but I won&#39;t respect idiocy. I don&#39;t need to prove it on my own because I don&#39;t think that there are hundreds of thousands (millions?) of people in on the &quot;space&quot; conspiracy, and there is no shortage of photos of space. </p>

<p>The world is surrounded by an ice ring that&#39;s guarded by snipers? I can reject that out of hand with an appeal to logic. I don&#39;t need to go to the north myself to disprove it. The U.S. can&#39;t even keep 2k miles of border secure. 
And how do they explain that in the upper latitudes the sun shines for weeks on end? </p>

<p>I get what you&#39;re saying, though. But some ideas can be rejected out of hand. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The problem with any major conspiracy theory is that it requires way too many people to be involved</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is one major mistake in assumption that almost all people make who object to conspiracy--they assume that everyone or nearly everyone contributing to the conspirator&#39;s agenda must know there is a conspiracy and be privy to the entire plan and all its details. This is not true, but conjuring up this assumption allows people to easily dismiss conspiracy with the understanding that too many knowing people would make it impossible to keep the secret. I certainly have never made a case for that all or even a many of the participants know the whole plan or even substantial parts of it. -Quite the contrary. All my writings have concentrated on explaining how and why top level conspirators use masses of predictable leftists, yes-men, ambitious lackeys and partially knowing ladder-climbers to do their bidding--specifically so as to limit the number who have &quot;need to know&quot; access. They cement together the whole conglomerate with subtle and not so subtle threats--and occasionally carry them out. Many are bought off with regular payments--like journalists and judges. Most know only parts of the puzzle.</p>

<p>However, almost everyone in high places does know there is &quot;power structure&quot; above them they dare not challenge, they also know it isn&#39;t good for their job, advancement or health to &quot;ask too many questions.&quot; Read any number of the tales by federal whistleblowers to confirm this general fear. Thus, most participants rationalize it all away as some benevolent control system, or believing that &quot;whoever they are&quot; must control the world in order to have stability. Others, especially in the enforcement ranks, are just too corrupt to care. But the bottom line is: very few know that the Powers That Be (PTB) intend to pull the nuclear trigger via Russia and China. All the little steps leading up to weakening the US and building up Russia and China are covered by liberal notions of &quot;détente,&quot; &quot;easing tensions,&quot; and &quot;peace.&quot; These lesser officials who are tasked to defend these lies tend to believe their own propaganda.
