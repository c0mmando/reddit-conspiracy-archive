       I just recently saw on the news that there was a semi-truck full of bees that crashed in Oklahoma, U.S., And I swear I've seen multiple stories like this before involving semi-trucks carrying bees crashing. So I did some quick googling and it turns out there have been at least 6 trucks that have crashed so far this year. I have estimated that it's upwards of 100 million bees!

       100 million bees. Each hive houses about 50,000 bees, that's a total of 2,000 hives.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the size of an average honey bee farm. Wouldn't it just be easier, to set a farm ablaze, over taking out multiple trucks?

       Well if you don't want to kill all of them off quickly, so you make it look like an accident. I assume the less bee population there is the harder and more expensive it will be to get your fields pollinated driving up food cost.
Then companies that can create self pollinating GMO's can step in and save the day and sell cheaper products. The consumer drives out the competition by going with the cheaper alternative all while becoming reliant on said products. Next thing you know farms that needed bees to pollinate start taking hits. They either 1- downsize crops so they can afford to pollinate them, 2- go out of business due to too much competition, or 3- give in to big corporations and start using their plants that will self-pollinate all while paying them royalties for their patented plant seeds thus putting a choke hold on the industry to where only the biggest of corporations can afford to stay in the business.

       What are you talking about? Are you serious with this truck-crash-bees-genocide nonsense?
      </p>
      <p>
       We are talking about bees. You can smoke them, spray them, trap them in sugary water... You don't have to crash a truck. You don't have to hide the evidence. Hell, bees have been dying off for over a decade. Check colony collapse disorder (CCD). You could spray 200M bees with the poision today and the worse that would happen would be another bullet point in some CCD statistics

       But you do realize that when a truck full of bees crashes, bees don't really die? They escape. Unless there is huge Michael Bay-esque explosion
      </p>
      <p>
       So rather than a bee elimination conspiracy, this seems to be a conspiracy to release bees from captivity

       Well, that was true for a few of the trucks. Some of the bees were recaptured and taken back. However in one of the stories I think they said they sprayed to kill them off to protect the highway, and in another story (I think an Idaho one) they estimated the bees would most likely be dead within a day or two with the certain climate and without their hives.

       You're probably right. This is my first time posting here so I'm not too sure on the kind environment this sub has. I think the thing that makes a conspiracy is just enough believablity for it to be true, but still kind of crazy enough for "normal" people to say it's illogical.

       Those numbers got me curious as they seemed a little high, but some Googling (and learning
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       too much about the transport of bees) shows numbers like that to be reasonable.

       out of Washington State actually included some interesting facts about the transit of bees. Things such as how they are only transported at night when the bees are less active and how this time of year there are massive amounts of bees being moved around for agriculture use, both of which could be contributing factors in the occurrence of accidents.

       Ok let me try.
      </p>
      <p>
       monsanto wants to own our entire food supply.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have already introduced their poison into farmers fields who do not use their products.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take corn in Mexico for example, shitty monsanto crap and chemicals get blown/bee'ed/etc to other natural fields. Pesticides are killing off bees, and what happens when there's no more bees? No more food?  I don't think so.  I think they, or someone owns a patent for plant growing and fertilization by a bee-less method of some type.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, once bees die off, so do our fields of the past. Now vertical fields can be moved in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those can't have bees, too messy and abnormal of an environment.  Instead, you have to use their bee-machine replacement.  Oh! forgot to mention, vertical farms only support this tech, not the old bee-less fields we now have.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new, expensive-to-get-into vertical farming industry.  The one where all the established are connected to Montsano, Dupont, etc, coincidentally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enjoy your old square land fields you can't farm on with their poison saturated into them, with no bees to carry pollen for you anymore anyway.

       There is a multi-pronged attack on food right now, presumably to drive the prices up, and create a new, more profitable normal for Wall Street, and also to give poor people something to think about besides how and why they have been impoverished.

       Those are some good points. I, of course, don't have much info to compare to car crashes in general. Didn't research that much. I'm purely going off of the fact that I've seen so many stories on semis carrying bees crashed. Either i'm watching more news and am better informed than I have been before, or a small pattern is emerging.
