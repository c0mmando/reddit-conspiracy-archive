       I'm on 4chan and they have a picture up of a guy named Chris Harper Mercer saying he's the shooter. It's up in r9k and it's 4chan so take that info with a grain of salt if it hasn't been reported anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:
       <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/the-umpqua-community-college-shooter-has-reportedly-been-idd/">
        It appears as though 4chan was reporting the correct information.
       </a>
       I have no idea who he is though and the take on this being a FF to get our minds off Russia and Putin's words, I'm 50/50 on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone had said before we have a 6 week cycle of these things, and IIRC, it's been approximately 6 weeks since the TV reporter and cameraman were gunned down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another edit: The picture I saw on 4chan looks like a guy who could be/could've been military, maybe I'm stereotyping because of the ugly birth control glasses he's wearing.

       Thanks for the info.

       It almost seems like the 4chan post is enough to make the person real. Almost like you imagine I'm real, and I imagine you're real, but I have no clue who you are or what you look like. The public seems to accept the anonymous poster as the shooters identity. Just seems odd to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't watch the MSM although I checked CNN before posting so I could see how they're portraying it. Does the MSM have a suspect, ID, name, picture or anything? If not does that seem to bother them?

       - Crazy how 4chan can find it before authorities announce anything even though they have his body.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am also split on it, and actually thought it was legit this time (due to the 4chan post), but then I put my foil hat on and remembered what happened yesterday..

       I was just thinking how it's been a few weeks since the MSM had a mass shooting chew toy to play with.

       Ooh, good insight on the coke bottle glasses...I've been re-running lately in my head John Allen Muhammed, the guy behind the Beltway sniper murders...I can't find any proof anywhere of any specific thing he had been on, just comments in articles about his mental health treatment...just wonder if meds were involved, mostly because incidents I had never thought about at the time, when you go back and look, drugs are implicated - the Unabomber was on Trazadone, the same stuff the Navy Yard Shooter was taking. There are a few case studies out there about low dose long-term usage causing psychotic episodes.

       what you think about this scenario?
      </p>
      <p>
       the shooting is legit, and TPTB exploit the shit out of it. mass murders happen more often than most people think
       <sup>
        1.

       the MSM just cherry picks each instance to fit whatever agenda they want to push

        Here is a

         web app
        </a>
        that tracks all mass murders in the US.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Several mass murders have happened since the Tennessee shootings, none really got national coverage. Probably because they don't fit the narrative.

       Thats an awesome website. One thing I quickly noticed is that the ones that don't get attention are 'family shootings'. The public shootings seem to make the MSM.

       That didn't surprise me too much, mostly bc it was 4chan. I assume most of them aren't serious, and probably thought he wasn't either. But who knows. Let's hope they don't follow his lead

       It's the lesser of two evils to me.  I'd rather that than have them try to take guns away, and just make people defenseless.  I doubt that will happen. There should be a clear line between a joke and a threat, unfortunately with our society there isn't.

       I heard an interesting theory about this from a non-american. He said the reason we (americans) are so content giving up our freedoms and never rebel is because we 'have our guns'. Since we rely on this notion, he said, we allow the powers at be to walk all over us so long as they let us keep our measly little firearms. Therefore convincing the public that if we ever have to revolt against the system we will use our guns, and if issues aren't bad enough to resort to gun-wielding violence then we will simply ignore the problem until it's bad enough that we do.

       I think you have to be 21 to buy a handgun. But, you can buy rifles at 18. But, they never push handgun bans. Even if the shooter was carrying 3 of them. They always go after rifles with cosmetic features that have nothing to do with the function of the firearm (e.g., telescoping stock, hand grips, barrel shroud, etc.). The anti-gun groups feel that if a gun looks scary then it needs to be banned. For example: why would they want to ban
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR-15#United_States">
        this gun
       </a>
       but not
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruger_Mini-14">
        this one
       </a>
       ? Functionally, they are identical.

       I don't pay too much attention to it (I'm all about having guns, but know nothing about them), but it seems like they don't typically discriminate against one type of gun. They tend to say gun regulation as a blanket statement. Maybe rifles just look scarier to the laymen?

       You would think, theoretically, that is true. However I see Americans (probably the most armed country) get forced into a lot of shit we don't want to do, and we typically bend over and take it. So long as we can keep our guns. I'll paste a comment I made to another user in this thread since it's relevant here too. It's just a theory I heard that opened my eyes a little bit.

       I think that Americans are content to go along with the elites' plan because of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_circuses">
        <em>
         bread and circuses
        </em>
       </a>
       . Everyone is well fed, and entertained. Plenty of drugs and alcohol. Lots of shiny toys. TV and movies and music keep everyone entertained (and distracted). Why would you want to revolt if the new season of American Idol is starting? The ONLY thing that prevents the elites from doing a total takeover of America is guns. If they rolled through the countryside and tried to disarm the populous they would experience SEVERE casualties. Compare this to China. There, the government can roll in and pretty much do whatever they want. The people are powerless to stop them. In America they've taken over by making everyone fat and happy. In China they took over by force. (Reminds me of
       <a href="http://www.thecitrusreport.com/2011/headlines/amusing-ourselves-to-death-with-huxley-and-orwell/">
        this cartoon
       </a>
       . China is 1984 and America is Brave New World.) If America ever lost the food-supply chain, drugs and alcohol, and cable TV there'd be riots in the streets.

       question. I completely agree that America is basically brainwashed by constant stimulus and consumption. Also a lack of accurate information and an emphasis on irrelevant 'news' too keep the public distracted while making them think they are aware of the important issues. Like whether gays should marry or a 14 year old getting arrested with a
       <em>

       I think that we expect information too quickly.  This person's body would be part of the crime scene, so it would have to be photographed and otherwise policed where it lay.  Then they would drive it down to the coroner's office where they would do additional processing, maybe up to and including an autopsy.  As this is going on, they would be digging around in his life and making sure there weren't other threats.  If he happened to be part of a plot, they wouldn't want to tip off his theoretical cohorts.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, long story short, I find nothing particularly suspicious about the fact that a bunch of information hasn't been released yet.  I think that is just law enforcement doing their job.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the question is this somehow more than it appears, it is way to soon to say.  It's always a possibility, but the best that can be done at this point is to collect the evidence so it can be analyzed later with the benefit of hindsight.

       I just checked out his FB, as I'm sure you have too. Fucking sketchy man. The first post about "trolling for hookers so they can meet their lord and savior" had 62 shares. One of the last posts about "signs your kid might be a serial killer" he commented to himself almost making a case he's been a sociopath. I agree with the user below, rush job; if not, dudeman really wanted everyone to know he was fucked up

       He kindof had a lot of action on it (from other people) for being such a new, infrequent, facebook. Seriously.. Who makes a facebook in 2015?

       Could be. I almost never go on FB either. But if mine was visible to the public, they would see that it dates back to 2009 or so and was used very heavily up until a year or so ago.

       If i try and paraphrase I'll botch it but he pretty much says this is our reality now. Anyone who questions events like this is a monster.

       I've been seeing these people a lot in this sub recently, no clue why they come here. It's why I posted the italicized disclaimer in the OP.

       10 people (less than a dozen) died today, but wayyy worse shit happens all over the world. (so actually way more than a dozen people died today, but only 10 of them make the front page). I mean look at gaza or syria if people think this is bad..
