    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on 4chan and they have a picture up of a guy named Chris Harper Mercer saying he&#39;s the shooter. It&#39;s up in r9k and it&#39;s 4chan so take that info with a grain of salt if it hasn&#39;t been reported anywhere else. </p>

<p>Edit: <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/the-umpqua-community-college-shooter-has-reportedly-been-idd/">It appears as though 4chan was reporting the correct information.</a> I have no idea who he is though and the take on this being a FF to get our minds off Russia and Putin&#39;s words, I&#39;m 50/50 on that. </p>

<p>Someone had said before we have a 6 week cycle of these things, and IIRC, it&#39;s been approximately 6 weeks since the TV reporter and cameraman were gunned down. </p>

<p>Another edit: The picture I saw on 4chan looks like a guy who could be/could&#39;ve been military, maybe I&#39;m stereotyping because of the ugly birth control glasses he&#39;s wearing. <a href="/u/dejenerate">/u/dejenerate</a> mentioned earlier about the effects of SSRIs and how the VA hands them out like candy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the info. </p>

<p>It almost seems like the 4chan post is enough to make the person real. Almost like you imagine I&#39;m real, and I imagine you&#39;re real, but I have no clue who you are or what you look like. The public seems to accept the anonymous poster as the shooters identity. Just seems odd to me.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t watch the MSM although I checked CNN before posting so I could see how they&#39;re portraying it. Does the MSM have a suspect, ID, name, picture or anything? If not does that seem to bother them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what you think about this scenario?</p>

<p>the shooting is legit, and TPTB exploit the shit out of it. mass murders happen more often than most people think<sup>1.</sup> the MSM just cherry picks each instance to fit whatever agenda they want to push</p>

<p>They can get lucky too right?</p>

<p>edit: </p>

<ol>
<li>Here is a <a href="http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/mass-killings/index.html#frequency">web app</a> that tracks all mass murders in the US.</li>
</ol>

<p>Several mass murders have happened since the Tennessee shootings, none really got national coverage. Probably because they don&#39;t fit the narrative. </p>

<p>That didn&#39;t surprise me too much, mostly bc it was 4chan. I assume most of them aren&#39;t serious, and probably thought he wasn&#39;t either. But who knows. Let&#39;s hope they don&#39;t follow his lead</p>

<p>I heard an interesting theory about this from a non-american. He said the reason we (americans) are so content giving up our freedoms and never rebel is because we &#39;have our guns&#39;. Since we rely on this notion, he said, we allow the powers at be to walk all over us so long as they let us keep our measly little firearms. Therefore convincing the public that if we ever have to revolt against the system we will use our guns, and if issues aren&#39;t bad enough to resort to gun-wielding violence then we will simply ignore the problem until it&#39;s bad enough that we do.</p>

<p>One thing I just heard CNN say is &quot;he&#39;s actually 26, not 20 like the governor said, which makes more sense because the legal age to buy a gun is 21.&quot; </p>

<p>All I hear is - Oh shit he can&#39;t be 20 because then we can push stricter gun laws because a murderer can&#39;t get his hands on an illegal gun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you have to be 21 to buy a handgun. But, you can buy rifles at 18. But, they never push handgun bans. Even if the shooter was carrying 3 of them. They always go after rifles with cosmetic features that have nothing to do with the function of the firearm (e.g., telescoping stock, hand grips, barrel shroud, etc.). The anti-gun groups feel that if a gun looks scary then it needs to be banned. For example: why would they want to ban <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR-15#United_States">this gun</a> but not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruger_Mini-14">this one</a>?

<p>You would think, theoretically, that is true. However I see Americans (probably the most armed country) get forced into a lot of shit we don&#39;t want to do, and we typically bend over and take it. So long as we can keep our guns. I&#39;ll paste a comment I made to another user in this thread since it&#39;s relevant here too. It&#39;s just a theory I heard that opened my eyes a little bit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that Americans are content to go along with the elites&#39; plan because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_circuses"><em>bread and circuses</em></a>. Everyone is well fed, and entertained. Plenty of drugs and alcohol. Lots of shiny toys. TV and movies and music keep everyone entertained (and distracted). Why would you want to revolt if the new season of American Idol is starting? The ONLY thing that prevents the elites from doing a total takeover of America is guns. If they rolled through the countryside and tried to disarm the populous they would experience SEVERE casualties. Compare this to China. There, the government can roll in and pretty much do whatever they want. The people are powerless to stop them. In America they&#39;ve taken over by making everyone fat and happy. In China they took over by force. (Reminds me of <a href="http://www.thecitrusreport.com/2011/headlines/amusing-ourselves-to-death-with-huxley-and-orwell/">this cartoon</a>. China is 1984 and America is Brave New World.) If America ever lost the food-supply chain, drugs and alcohol, and cable TV there&#39;d be riots in the streets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah the old <strong>Brave New World</strong> vs <strong>1984</strong> question. I completely agree that America is basically brainwashed by constant stimulus and consumption. Also a lack of accurate information and an emphasis on irrelevant &#39;news&#39; too keep the public distracted while making them think they are aware of the important issues. Like whether gays should marry or a 14 year old getting arrested with a <em>clock</em>. Very menial shit compared to say our ME occupation, or bullshit economy build to funnel money from the bottom to the top as quickly as possible. It&#39;s quite sad and stressful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that we expect information too quickly.  This person&#39;s body would be part of the crime scene, so it would have to be photographed and otherwise policed where it lay.  Then they would drive it down to the coroner&#39;s office where they would do additional processing, maybe up to and including an autopsy.  As this is going on, they would be digging around in his life and making sure there weren&#39;t other threats.  If he happened to be part of a plot, they wouldn&#39;t want to tip off his theoretical cohorts.</p>

<p>So, long story short, I find nothing particularly suspicious about the fact that a bunch of information hasn&#39;t been released yet.  I think that is just law enforcement doing their job.</p>

<p>As far as the question is this somehow more than it appears, it is way to soon to say.  It&#39;s always a possibility, but the best that can be done at this point is to collect the evidence so it can be analyzed later with the benefit of hindsight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just checked out his FB, as I&#39;m sure you have too. Fucking sketchy man. The first post about &quot;trolling for hookers so they can meet their lord and savior&quot; had 62 shares. One of the last posts about &quot;signs your kid might be a serial killer&quot; he commented to himself almost making a case he&#39;s been a sociopath. I agree with the user below, rush job; if not, dudeman really wanted everyone to know he was fucked up <em>cough</em> I mean mentally ill. </p>

<p>End of the day, who the fuck knows. </p>

<p>Guy at the gym was telling me we don&#39;t need guns. We fucking do for this very reason. He almost scoffed at me when I told him second amendment is to protect against foreign AND domestic threats. &quot;No its to regulate militias..&quot; Just shook my head. </p>

<p>10 people (less than a dozen) died today, but wayyy worse shit happens all over the world. (so actually way more than a dozen people died today, but only 10 of them make the front page). I mean look at gaza or syria if people think this is bad..</p>
