       We can all agree that Stonehenge is without a doubt, one of the most mysterious and beautiful ancient sites on the planet. Its mystery makes it beautiful. No one knows for sure how ancient mankind managed to quarry, transport and construct this ancient site thousands of years ago.Many experts believe that Stonehenge was an astronomical observatory while others firmly believe that the purpose of this ancient site was a burial ground and place of worship for ancient mankind.While researchers know a lot about Stonehenge, there are many more mysteries waiting to be uncovered. Experts firmly believe that the secrets about Stonehenge lie underneath it.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the most incredible discoveries that indirectly has to do with Stonehenge was found under a mile away in Bush Barrow which is a burial mound where William Cunnigton found, in 1808 one of the most enigmatic and mysterious treasures of the King of Stonehenge.Inside the 4000m year old tomb, there were countless pieces of jewelry and relics that have baffled historians and archaeologists alike.Among the items is the diamond-shaped golden plate which was described as ‘the work of the gods’ by David Dawson, the director of the Wiltshire Museum. Many experts believe this enigmatic piece was an astronomical instrument while others suggest its complex geometric pattern is a form of astronomical writing of the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its true purpose is still a mystery.Among the incredible pieces of jewelry a well-adorned dagger is another item that has baffled researchers. Today, only fragment of the item remain, but researchers have determined that this once staggering item was decorated by over 100,000 golden studs, interestingly, each of them was thinner than a human hair.Experts also suggest that each square centimeter of the handle of the dagger had around 1,000 microscopic studs. The remnants of the dagger raise many questions: how was ancient mankind capable of such precision?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where did the ancient obtain the technology to do so and what was the true purpose of these items?This incredible finding proves that ancient mankind had the ability to produce incredible things that challenge our modern-day capabilities. We have to mention that these incredible pieces of jewelry were produced at a time when mankind did not have the knowledge of items such as the magnifying glass, which leaves many questions without logical explanations ( via ewao.com )."

       As soon as you stop regarding everyone in the past as being brutish and unsophisticated and start thinking of them as being as intelligent, creative and inventive as we are, then you've cracked the riddle.
      </p>
      <p>
       For these very delicate tasks it is more than likely that child were employed in very much the same way as they were with watch chain making at the start of the industrial revolution. Their dexterity and eyesight makes them the logical choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The societies that built the stonehenge mausoleum (before it was rebuilt by the Victorians), had several sites of activity - Woodhenge, Durrington Walls, Avebury, Silbury Hill all of which were used at different times of the year. It's also difficult to say that there was just one "King" of Stonehenge as the burials around the complex have a variety of statuses ages and genders. It's more than likely that the tribes of southern England used it communally as a shared centre of worship/activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Tl:dr
       </strong>
       More than likely child workers made it.

       There is a logical explanation. While the craftsmanship is impressive, there is no mystery there. For example:

       This is another one of those things that if you presented it to someone who adamantly believes what they are taught, they'd be most likely to completely ignore it, because it's friggin impossible to explain with mainstream thinking

       People 4000 years ago were just as smart as we are today. How is this a conspiracy? The Egyptian pyramids are centuries older than this artifact.

       It's really just a matter of creating thin gold thread which is pretty easy even with simplest tools. You need a hammer, an anvil, thongs and a bronze plate with holes in it.

       This, in my opinion, is not as incredible as say Puma Punku with 80-800
       <strong>
        ton
       </strong>
       precision cut (in some cases not deviating more than .001" per foot) slabs of diorite.  Gold is soft, can be forged and worked at room temperature, is not super difficult to mine, and requires no alloying.  So the premise here is fine detail work equals advanced technology?
      </p>
      <p>
       I will not deny that this is thoroughly impressive craftsmanship and that the person/persons who made it had a refined knowledge of the craft, but there are better more impressive examples of greater-than-previously-thought tech in ancient cultures.  Why not talk about how the foundations for the pyramids were leveled out (seems simple but try it at 1/1000th the scale with the same accuracy), or Chinese and Indian metallurgy that had working knowledge of iron/steel long before the "iron age", or even to precision cut monuments all over south america?
      </p>
      <p>
       One other factor should be considered; that this artifact (though found close to Stone Henge) was not made
       <em>
        anywhere
       </em>
       near where it was found.  The extent of trade in the ancient world isn't fully understood and it is altogether possible that this artifact was made elsewhere possibly even for persons at Stone Henge.  We shouldn't assume that the people who built SH were the same who made this artifact.
