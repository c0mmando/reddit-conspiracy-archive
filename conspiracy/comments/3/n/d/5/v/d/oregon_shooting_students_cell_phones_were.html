      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sometime after noon, studentsâ€™ cell phones were confiscated, then students were marched out one building at a time, hands up, patted down and lined up to be evacuated on buses.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why did they take the phones? Also, why were there no photos from any of the students or the faculty?
I'd like to see any photos taken by a student during this event, not because I'm a sicko, but because it would help me believe this is real. Aren't kids snapping photos and videos of crap all the time? Yet there are absolutely no photos to be found from inside the school during the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       I scoured the internet for hours looking for some shred of evidence that would prove to me that this event actually took place as described by the news. The result was two photos. These photos were described as being GRAPHIC CONTENT. Um, these is not graphic at all. A few spots of blood on a sheet thrown over a non-bloody body.

       When I was a kid, you had to break the law or the police couldn't take your shit.  Now pretty much everything is illegal unless there's a law saying you're allowed to do it.  Cops exercise absolute power and then justify it legally afterward, if they bother.

       Dang, now a days the game is rigged for the police.  Have you seen the Gieco e-cards?  No need for paper insurance cards anymore.  You can just bring up a digital copy on your cellphone to hand to the police officer as he walks back to his car with said cellphone in hand.  Fuck that.

       Either there were two shooters, or there was no gunfire. You can't have it both ways. There was obviously confusion on the ground, just like any situation where people are getting shot. Rumours abound.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the shooting happened inside a building and there would obviously be places on the campus where it wouldn't be heard as clearly. It's not the hugest place but gunfire also doesn't sound like it does in movies.

       Gunfire doesn't sound like movies in the sense that it's much louder. Literally deafeningly loud, heard for miles. Being inside a building may change that though, just wanted to say it's definitely not quieter than in movies.

      <p>
       Also depending on the acoustics of the building and where they were at the time its not out of the realm of possability that certain people did not hear the gunshots. It's amusing how many of these "conspiracy theories" come from people who thinks everything works like Hollywood. A person shot is going to gush blood all over the place. Gunshots are louder than nuclear bomb detonations so everyone will hear them.

       I would be a lot more inclined to think like you if this didn't happen in
       <em>
        every single shooting
       </em>
       we are deeming a false flag. Watch the interviews with children at Sandy Hook and notice how similar their stories are. If there are really 33 people getting shot, you're going to get at least SOME witnesses who heard this. Either the news is pathetic at finding a real witness, or there simply are none.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flash back to the shooting at Virginia Tech. The link below contains some credible witness testimony along with video in which shooting can be heard. This happened even before the first iPhone came out. 8 years later, virtually everybody has an HD camera on them, and there's
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       similar to this that exists at all? Look up other witness interviews, even the survivors, and see how somber and emotional they are when recalling the tragedy. Not similar to anything we've seen in false flags.
      </p>

      <p>
       Bonus link: The enlightened know that these are routine mass casualty drills/exercises. Staging these shootings is not only a precursor to advancing gun control laws, but it's also a way to keep the DoJ and DHS funded so they can continue planning even more drills, some of which will no doubt be passed to the media as real again. In this link, the interviewee mentions these exercises, but is
       <em>
        immediately
       </em>
       cut off by the anchor due to a very rare, bizarre exchange with the producers. They then switch to another reporter for an update, except, none of the news she gives us is any different than what's been showed on the screen the entire time.

       The kind of citizen that wants to sound like a badass, so they copy words the first responders were using to describe the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus when you're in a class you automatically use the same language as the prof, so you would automatically echo words used by authority figures while still in that "classroom" mindset.

       They didn't take phones.  The buildings at UCC are far apart and all the action took place at one of them.  The buildings are small, with 4-6 classrooms each.  I do my CE for my electrical license there every few years, and I live less than 10 minutes away.
My step daughters friend was there, not searched, nor was his phone taken.

       So you don't believe it happened because you couldn't find gory crime scene photos? Do you think people running for their lives are going to take selfies in front of dead bodies with agunman on the loose? People were terrified and running for their lives OP!

       Many of the interviewed people said they thought it was a drill.  In that case, taking a video might be in order.  Times really have changed a lot where people will video something before they think about their own safety.  Ya gotta admit, people
       <em>

       want to video something cool.  Society has created fame hunters.

       Then that makes even more sense that there are no videos if they thought it was a mundane drill. When was the last time you whipped out your cell phone and started taking videos during a fire drill?

       You get me wrong.  I'm not looking for proof, nor am I trying to persuade anyone else to believe anything.  I'm just finding it VERY strange and suspicious that in a world where the majority of the population is armed with cameras, that no pictures or videos were taken and allegedly these devices were confiscated... for what reason?  Regardless of your judgement, don't you also find that even a

       I do not find it suspicious that there is no footage, if someone started shooting up my school I wouldn't be filming I'd be getting the fuck out. I also do not find it crazy that phones would be confiscated for evidence, but I'm also not sure that was the case. It is being heavily reported in the fringe media though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, if you are claiming that the shooting didn't happen and that the phones were confiscated in case they captured what REALLY happened.... then you've not to worry. Unless the government kill everyone that was there then someone would mention something.

       That's all you bud, not me.  I simply said it is strange and suspicious, but you're taking the ball and running for the goal line with it, and making these claims that it happened/never happened.  Neither one of us were there, so neither one of us knows for sure what really went on.  I'm just giving you rope.

       You wouldn't trust the word of a hundred other people? A thousand? These aren't members of the media, these are just ordinary people who got caught up in a shooting. You wouldn't trust evidence? The guns with fingerprints? The shell casings? The bullets?

       I think this is like the POV aspect of the Virginia shooting. Film it in POV to make it look real, but have him "drop the camera" before anything is actually is shown. Maybe I've watched too much TV, but don't they usually cover the entire body in a sheet at the very least, if not put it in a body bag? I thought it was normal procedure to cover it with a sheet at the scene during the investigation and then put it in a body bag for transport? Here they have a sheet which would cover a small dog or child used to cover an adult leaving the arms and legs exposed. I think this is done to make it look real since it looks like a body, and very well could be, but they still had to cover the face and chest to keep people from seeing their expressions or breathing. You can't tell me nobody could get ahold of 13 sheets or anything big enough to cover the bodies(not to mention BODY BAGS), and had to resort to 3x4 ft towels? Gimme a fucking break

       It all comes down to Chris Mintz. He was the alleged (an)hero that charged the gunman, but was shot 7 times and can't walk. He has a Facebook profile, ask to see his gunshot wounds.

       Being a false flag doesn't mean the whole thing was a hoax, it just means the government (or some other group) was involved as is controlling the narrative.

       Note the guy getting gold on a comment with one upvote in an obscure thread. It's like every new shooting there's always some people who are claiming to be personally involved, going to any thread that mentions it and downvoting and insulting and/or threatening anyone questioning the narrative, and upvoting and even gilding comments that support the narrative. If people who question the narrative are crazy, why is it so important to these people to go online and seek out threads on r/conspiracy to try and convince people it's real?

       Yup. I thought it was real when I first heard, because of the 4chan post, but as soon as I looked into details, the same strange behavior of police and officials as in other false flags made it really obvious that it was another ruse.

       I love this. "Not everyone balls their eyes out on national TV".  Well does anybody cause I haven't seen a single goddamn tear from any of these fakes leading up to the Oregon shooting. So your statement should really be. "People don't cry when they lose family members to "senseless shootings" on national Tv."

       Lame. The random killing spree bullshit is passÃ©. Unless you're doing something like that for political or religious reasons, you wouldn't do it. The "high score" theories (basically that there's crazy people trying to go and pull off a huge killing spree in the hopes they'll be famous in death by killing the most people) don't make any sense anymore because you would expect someone to have pulled off a bigger killing spree by now, using more than just some assault rifles/pistols or these shitty homemade bombs that never seem to work (remember the Times Square Bomber?). It's always some Aspergers or Autistic kid, and they're always obsessed with guns, yada yada yada. But what makes them go from being so unable to understand other people to having the conviction to go and kill others at the cost of their freedom or life? Psychopaths don't do that. Why would someone even more unable to empathize know the pain they are causing? The Columbine story was most believable because they were two outcasts supposedly bullied and made fun of, and were doing it for revenge. Ok. Then you have Virginia Tech, which was this philosophical crazy reightous bullshit manifesto. Ok, kinda flimsy but he had pictures/video he made of himself. Then there's Sandy Hook and Aurora. Holmes claimed to be the fucking Joker but had orange hair not blue, and was practically catatonic during trial, and Adam Lanza's (if he existed) motives are completely unknown (but we know he could play DDR for 10+ hrs straight!). But Lanza and a lot of smaller, less remembered shooters are often claimed to have Aspergers, something that doesn't make sense if your expecting them to care about whether or not the rest of society knows who they are. The recent live news shooting was the result of "racist comments"... It's all bullshit, and it's bad for ya
