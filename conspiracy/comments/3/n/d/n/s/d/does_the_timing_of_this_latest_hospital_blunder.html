       The US is scripted to lose the world war, and so is being cast as the bad guy in the pre-war public mind, exactly as Germany was the last time. The post-war solution, of course, will be NWO's new and improved world government. The kink in that plan is that China still refuses to join the NWO, potentially leaving them without an enforcer when the smoke clears.

       I didn't mean to imply they don't cooperate with NWO when it suits them, and certainly NWO did both enable and bankroll Mao's reign of terror, though I think that's what got them purged along with the Maoists during the blowback. They expected to be back in and calling the shots by now.

       I suspect china did have a falling out with the Zionist mafia. They're not the ones to play second fiddle to anyone. Certainly does not make them any less dangerous, however. Russia has had a wholesale regime change with its generals. A good sign! And I suspect that may not be the original putin. In any case, I like this new and improved Russian leader. Just not enough info to properly connect the dots. Facinating times.

       There were rumours that this is a look alike putin used. Given that there was a wholesale cleansing of his generals, I think it's a possibility. Also, the old putin had Zionist ties and now he's sticking it to them. Whether it's the same guy or not, it appears, something has changed.

       Depending on the command and control of a situation, it can take quite some time for word to get back to the crew of aircraft that they struck against a civilian target.  Hell, back during the first gulf war, there were a number of cases where friendly fire situations happened and it wasn't until the dust really settled and troops came up missing that people realized what had happened.  We're talking several hours had passed.

       , though bombing an MSF hospital for over an hour apparently is. Possibly the rage wouldn't be so loud if it wasn't for the irony of the west pointing fingers at Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now with my tin foil hat on, my personal theory is that Russia (somehow) scrambled the signals, misleading the strikes into the hospital. Of course Washington would never declare this happened, the humiliation, and GPS-integrity are far too greater risks. And besides Moscow would straight face deny it.

       If the targetting systems for US military systems can be spoofed and are actively being spoofed to make them hit civilian targets rather than military targets, that may just be the story of the century.
