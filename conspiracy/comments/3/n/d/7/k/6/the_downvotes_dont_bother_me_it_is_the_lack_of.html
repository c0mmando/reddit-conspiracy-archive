<p>Of course the government and PTB wouldn&#39;t want this because that would give the citizenry WAY too much power and take a lot of threat out of the hands that tptb have over the citizenry.  Instead they talk about &quot;gun control&quot;.  Fuck that.</p>

You say: This is getting boring.  I&#39;ll agree, its quite boring to see the same tired catchphrases and ill thought &quot;solutions&quot; based on pure emotion, with little regard for effect or legality.  You also state: You idiots literaly reverse the facts. Well sir, the &quot;facts&quot; you claim are actually media driven emotional outbursts that are akin ti a child throwing a tantrum. I notice you havent made any posts about the &quot;gun violence&quot; (as if there is a qualifier to violence) in the Chicagoland area that happens every weekend in numbers that double and triple this incident.   Your last statement is incoherent, basically a rehashing of the same stale buzzwords the knee jerk crowd constantly parrots. Dont worry, next week you will have a different issue to be so passionate about. Finally you explode into a capslock perjorative tirade..possibly while filling your screen with spittle and raising your bloodpressure to dangerous levels.  You screamed first, you must think you won.  The simple fact is that crazy fucks will do crazy tragic things. Your vitriol doesnt fix a thing, creates further divide and actually harms your position as a modicum of investigation shows your proposals are untennable and unenforceable. Your solutions involve impacting the law abiding 99 percent to satiate your need for emotional tickling will have no impact on the remaining less than 1 percent that cause the issues.  In short, your plan sucks. </p>

<p>Again, why are you literally reversing the facts? It is only the pro-gun crowd who use &quot;tired catchphrases&quot;, in an attempt to capture emotional belief while bypassing reality. Some examples might be: &quot;Guns don&#39;t kill people, people do&quot;, &quot;banning guns won&#39;t work&quot;, &quot;guns are made for self-defence&quot; etc...</p>

<p>You are lying to the point that you are literally turning the truth upside down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well sir, the &quot;facts&quot; you claim are actually media driven emotional outbursts that are akin ti a child throwing a tantrum</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you&#39;ve just said I&#39;m not claiming any facts, and that I&#39;m simply using tired catchphrases. It appears that you can&#39;t make up your own mind from one sentence to the next.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I notice you havent made any posts about the &quot;gun violence&quot; (as if there is a qualifier to violence) in the Chicagoland area </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you are lying. I pointed out yesterday that if you ban guns in Chicago and I want one, then I will simply drive to Rockford and buy one. Singling out one particular city in a country with a major gun problem is not a viable solution to the problem, and will obviously leave residents of Chicago feeling like they are being randomly targeted for punishment.</p>

<p>Perhaps you should explain why you think banning guns in the middle of a warzone would work in the first place.</p>

<p>I look forward to hearing more of your lies.</p>

<p>Nobody has to physically fight anybody. When people break the law they are arrested and tend to promptly shit their pants. I would be surprised if you are an exception to that.</p>

<p>But I think you should continue to develop your idea that why we should let crime happen because we are scared of the criminals. It has potential.</p>
