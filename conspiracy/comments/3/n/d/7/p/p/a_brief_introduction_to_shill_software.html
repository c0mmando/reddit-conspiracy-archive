<p>Features like most-viewed, most-popular and most-emailed lists [like Reddit and Digg] democratize news and information, advocates say, letting consumers play a role in what&#39;s deemed worthy of others&#39; attention, taking it out of the hands of an unseen editorial elite. Now, though, a diverse group of actors -- ranging from spyware makers to a venture-backed start-up -- is helping push specific videos, articles and photos to the top of those lists. Some of the Web sites targeted now are having to grapple with how to draw the line between user input and unacceptable manipulation.</p>

I&#39;d have to assume that one of them would &quot;infiltrate&quot; our super secret anti-shill network and &quot;expose it.&quot; Then, that will drown out all mentions of PR agencies using the software, and place full blame on us. They did the same thing with Russia. All they do is point out how there&#39;s so many &quot;Putin-bots&quot; after one NYT article claimed there was a measly 400 Russian shills- a drop in the bucket. </p>

<p>Any individual with even average intelligence must admit that shills exist. There are obviously many people who are not shills. There are also very likely hoards of individuals who have read shill rhetoric and have decided to spread it around, basically shilling for free. </p>

<p>Also, there&#39;s probably tons of shills who have alt accounts and use them to lessen the impact of the shill accusation by calling anyone and everyone they see shills so that it becomes an old, tired, and useless word. If I was a PR agency, this would be on the top of my to-do list, so this passes the &quot;what would I do&quot; test. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There may be a way to import &quot;shill&quot; tags from an external file:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/206ecg/is_there_a_way_to_exportimport_or_otherwise_merge/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/206ecg/is_there_a_way_to_exportimport_or_otherwise_merge/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The use would be that users keep a central list of known or suspected or known shills, then sync that list among ourselves, and auto-hide the shills. <em>poof!</em></p>

<p>The downside is that most of the shilling effort is directed not at us, but at the lurker audience, largely made of casual users that probably won&#39;t have RES installed. And by us ignoring the shills, it grants them an uncontested stage before that audience.</p>

<p>Still, it might be worth doing. Or maybe worth considering, in some capacity, as a feature for a future Reddit clone.</p>

<p>And mods they ainnn saynnn shit</p>

<p>The ferocity with which I&#39;m getting brigaded tells us the shills desperately don&#39;t want this information out. But the more they suppress it, the more attention it draws.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true. Take this very subreddit, for example. Hell, I have no way to prove that I&#39;m not a agent, let alone you. And when AI really gets cranking, what hope is there?</p>

<p>The other extreme is that each person should just do their own thing. If we&#39;re all aligned to truth, that will be our overarching marching order.</p>
