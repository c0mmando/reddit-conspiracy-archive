       I know many of you don't participate (with good reason) in politics. I, myself exercise limited interaction. The TPP is not passed as of this second. One thing that can actually help is calling up and complaining, voicing your opinion to your senator. 
I got an email from Organic Consumers Association in reference to the GMO labeling portion of the bill, it reads:
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, as you read this, lobbyists for the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA) are swarming Capitol Hill in a no holds-barred campaign to convince your Senator to vote against your right to know whether or not your food contains GMOs.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your Senator hears only from Monsanto’s lobbyists today, and not from you, you could lose the right to know—permanently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please call your Senator’s office right now and ask him or her to oppose H.R. 1599, or any federal bill that would preempt states’ rights to require labels on GMO foods. Text  "DARK Act" to 97779, or dial 888-897-0174 now.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you call, be sure to point out that you know that proponents of H.R. 1599 are intentionally misrepresenting the facts about this bill. Tell them that you know that the bill’s proponents are telling Congress that this bill provides a “uniform federal labeling standard.” Then tell them that you also know that this is not true—H.R. 1599 only provides a voluntary standard for non-GMO labels. As a consumer, tell your Senator that you believe food companies should be required by law to disclose GMOs, especially now that the World Health Organization has classified Monsanto’s glyphosate as a probable carcinogen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Phone calls work better than emails. Please text "DARK Act" to 97779, or dial 888-897-0174 now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Monsanto and the GMA are desperate to push this bill through the Senate before the end of the year. Because if they don’t win, food companies will have to comply with Vermont’s mandatory GMO labeling law on July 1, 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they do win, Vermont’s law will be dead. So will laws in Connecticut and Maine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even worse? The FDA will never be allowed to require pre-market safety testing of GMO foods, much less require labels on those foods.
      </p>
      <p>
       H.R. 1599 passed the house on July 23, by a vote of 275 – 150. On October 21, the Senate will hold a hearing on biotechnology and labeling.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can be certain that Monsanto’s lobbyists are giving your Senator an earful today—will your Senator also hear from you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Please call your Senator’s office right now and ask him or her to oppose H.R. 1599, or any federal bill that would preempt states’ rights to require labels on GMO foods. Text "DARK Act" to 97779, or dial 888-897-0174 now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yours could be the call that changes your Senator’s mind about the DARK Act. Please don’t miss that opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you!
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't care, that's fine. All I ask is that you don't downvote this, so that it can reach as many people as possible. We are fighting for everyones rights here. Please call. This is huge. 
Thanks yall.

       Not true in the least.

       The current interim commissioner is Steven Ostroff. The previous commissioner is Margret Hamburg, who is being replaced by Dr Robert Califf.

       None of them have worked for Monsanto.

       I think they are talking about Michael Taylor, who is Deputy Commissioner of Food at the FDA, who previously worked for Monsanto.
      </p>
      <p>
       The complaint is still stupid for many reasons. First, because the ethical rules of the job ban him from ever weighing or voting on Monsanto products. Second, because he is keenly aware of how people might view him as having a conflict of interest, he has also voluntarily recused himself from decisions on
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       biotechnology.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       stupid part is that because, get this, he left Monsanto over a disagreement about labeling of biotechnology foods. He encouraged them to
       <em>
        drop
       </em>
       their opposition to the labeling effort and they refused him. So he left the company.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, yes, of course, here, he is in Monsanto's pocket because he worked there for a few years.

       Oh, there's so much left out. We know thew bullshit, it's time to call our congress people- likely they are less informed than we are, and they get no calls from their constituents. All they hear are lobbyists every day, and then they make poor decisions.
