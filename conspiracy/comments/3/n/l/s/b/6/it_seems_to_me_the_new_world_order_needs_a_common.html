    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know of anyone that is aware of the issues at hand that would suddenly revert to being unaware, for the sake of not upsetting the system that they have become aware of. That would be like the entire cast of The Matrix getting pissed at Morpheus and demanding to be put back in the Matrix, right after they learned the truth.</p>

<p>If people are getting upset with you and shutting you out, they might just be at odds with whatever you&#39;re selling. In other words, they might think that your view of the problems at hand is not as developed as it should be, and this makes you a suspicious person in their eyes. If you&#39;re so advanced in your analysis, you should have no problem understanding where the real power comes from, and how much of this illusion is to their benefit. 
I&#39;ll start ya off with a couple of pointers:</p>

<p>It&#39;s not lizards.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the Vatican.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not even the U.S.A.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny you mention the matrix.  Perhaps you should watch it again.  Morpheus specifically states that you cannot free a mind that is not ready to be unplugged.  Also I do not believe in alien lizards taking over the world.  The other two you mentioned are not the root but I do believe are proxies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everybody ends up dead eventually. The majority of people can&#39;t follow their laws because a majority of people aren&#39;t educated on their laws. Wrap your head around it, you are consenting to their control. They need our consent. Withdraw the consent, defend your freedom. Being free isn&#39;t harming anyone so if you&#39;re threatened with violence or imprisoning for exercising your freedom you have two options. Give in and fear them or defend yourself and be free. </p>

Sure, it&#39;s neato... but it&#39;s not perfect, and it&#39;s hyped up to keep the civvies in line. Hell, their bunkers were built by some very disgruntled contractors, every single one of them. The Manhattan project was a tactical blunder. See if you can figure out why?</p>
