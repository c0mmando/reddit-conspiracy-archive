      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Among other interesting informations there were links to claims of certain Dimitri Khalezov,
        <strong>
         who besides believing there were no planes at WTC was confusing Uranium-235 with Depleted Uranium and at the same time asserting he's former soviet nuclear intelligence directorate man.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        His major claim throughout his books, articles and videos is that:
       </p>
       <p>
        The WTC was brought down by 3 (three) 150kt thermonuclear bombs, positioned exactly 77 meters below the three demolished buildings and when exploded they pulverized the steel&amp;concrete most of the way up by shock-wave, so then the buildings fell with only resistance of the mere pile of dust below in exact shape of that buildings at freefall speed into a 100 meters in diameter cavity created by the nuclear blast vaporizing the granite there...and that the buildings were in fact so demolished by the US govt. operatives but not for sinister reasons but by the in seventies prepositioned devices our guy knew about already in 1984, because there were unexploded 500kt nuclear charges in the WTC high floors put there (and to Pentagon too) by the al-Qaeda or whatever and the US govt. intelligence heroes in charge pushed the buton and pulled and saved so the NY from the total destruction using the timely demolition by the almost unharmful underground nukes...and main and seems to me only his direct proof for all this is for him the definition in english dictionaries where the "ground zero" notion is explained as the place where a nuke exploded -so that the Americans though wouldn't call the WTC site after the attacks the "ground zero" if there in fact would not been exploded a nuke...
       </p>
       <p>
        I was asking Daniel Estulin via email then, why he is linking this crazy ideas which could by association seriously undermine his credibility by the (imaginary) 150kt nukes, and he directed me to D. Khalezov's article "11th of September - the third truth".
So I took the article and made a commented version of its text, where I commented on the most scandalously false claims, and sent it then to Daniel Estulin.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now I think the outcome of my effort should be shared with the 9/11 Truth community to help others to refute this disinformations. So I decided to briefly show, that D. Khalezov simply makes many of his figures up, his credibility is so negligible and he is either an utter moron or a paid disinfo guy.

       But it's interesting that the word is getting out to the point that AE911Truth and their proxies (e.g., 911blogger.com) feel the need to fight back.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can't hide the truth forever. Nuclear demolition is
       <strong>
        obvious
       </strong>
       once you see it. Nothing else really even makes sense.

         What about the medical research concludes exclusively that the cancer was caused by excess radiation? Thyroid cancer is not "proof". From where do you pull the "1100% increase" statistic from? And what is being compared in the statistic? The number of people who got thyroid cancer in the wtc event is an increase of 1100% compared to.. everyday occurences? Compared to normal office fires?

         Stop spamming. 
Look at the photos of ground zero and tell me that your statement is true. http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/photos/groundzero.html#ground Like I've said elsewhere. It's consistent with a 'conventional' demolition.
Go spend a week laboring with a demo crew on a concrete job and you'll realize pretty quick what I'm talking about.
Add on top of that the fact that things are harder to distinguish because of everything being covered in cement dust.
You indoorsy people have no fucking idea about this stuff. Seriously. Go and get a tiny bit of work experience in this in the real world.

Your disruptive tactics, your unwillingness or inability to make your case and defend your theory in a civilized manner, your closed-mindedness, and your paranoid insults - which, on reddit, I have so far only witnessed coming from faithers, debunksters, trusters, and scientifically illiterate reality deniers - too obviously are a systemic attempt at sowing discord; even the flat-earthers were more friendly forwarding their theories, but I'm sure you are too well aware of that, so: shame on you for playing the divide et impera game.

       Yeah, I typically disengage with a user when it becomes obvious that they're a shill piece of shit that's only interested in discrediting the truth, promoting the official narrative, spreading confusion, or wasting my time. These users are the cancer that's destroying Reddit, but, well, we have rules against calling them out for some reason, even when they're staring you in the face.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still haven't gotten a satisfactory explanation for any of the following, either within the official narrative or within the controlled opposition AE911Truth narrative:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Nano-thermite alone cannot explain the lack of rubble and total pulverization of steel, office furniture, bathroom fixtures, and human bodies. The buildings turned to dust -- not piles of rubble, but
         <em>
          dust
         </em>
         100 microns in size. How did the nanothermite completely reduce the buildings to microscopic dust? Only a nuclear device is capable of that.

          here's an excellent video example

         . First, notice the detonation causing a ground-based blast wave -- i.e., earthquake. Then about 10 seconds later, the ground collapses. Imagine one of these under each WTC building.

       If anybody would like to research more about the nuclear detonation of WTC1, 2, and 7 on 9/11, there's an excellent new documentary on this, "Thermite Hoax - 9/11 WTC an Act of Nuclear War" (uploaded Sep 11, 2015):

         What about the medical research concludes exclusively that the cancer was caused by excess radiation? Thyroid cancer is not "proof". From where do you pull the "1100% increase" statistic from? And what is being compared in the statistic?

Look at the photos of ground zero and tell me that your statement is true. http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/photos/groundzero.html#ground Like I've said elsewhere. It's consistent with a 'conventional' demolition.
Go spend a week laboring with a demo crew on a concrete job and you'll realize pretty quick what I'm talking about.
Add on top of that the fact that things are harder to distinguish because of everything being covered in cement dust.

       Not so fast disinformation expert.

       When pressed to further explain yourself, your original rebuttal (which can be clicked on above) was:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The buildings and their contents almost entirely turned to dust.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That means you ignored the above user's link @

       </a>
       , which shows a field of steel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you continually lie to push an agenda of disinformation?

       To conflate the entire steel structure and contents of 3 buildings --

       Your disinformation campaign is obvious and disingenuous.
