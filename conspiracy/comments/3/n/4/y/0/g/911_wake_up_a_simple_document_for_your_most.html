       I was 23 and watching live on 911, as live as media claims at least... and I have read and watched almost everything out there and I still don't know where to stand :-(.  On the one hand you have this official story backed by The National Institute for Science and Technology and others; rejected by many including A&amp;E911, which can be argued make up a very small percentage of scholars/engis...many people argue that the official story makes sense.  However when you think about all the details, 4 hijacked planes on the same day?! 3 collapses of very, seemingly, strong buildings?! No video shown of the Pentagon, no plane debris from flight 93.. etc etc... One is left puzzled.  I would very much like to read some independent research from top scholars and engineers that are current and working in their fields, but I feel like this doesn't exist outside of NIST stuff and the researchers just follow their unreleased models, such as the Purdue crash model... What do current builders of high rises have to say?  Or are they all not willing to chime in?  That would be most troubling and appears to be the case.
      </p>

       Edit, meant to say thanks for the post too!  it's very comprehensive.

       Yeah, it's very strange..  I'm a man of science.. So I want to believe NIST, but their models don't even match what we see... how can people go along with this?!

       Thanks man.. if you have time, read it end to end with all the links. I'm sure there's at least one bit of information you didn't know previously.
      </p>
      <p>
       But like you said, you've already read/watched everything out there. All those things you mentioned
       <strong>
        should
       </strong>
       be more than enough to show you the reality. The only thing stopping you now is your mind.. overcoming the notion that  the U.S. would actually be willing to do something like this to its own citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just take comfort in the fact that those who run our government today are imposters, and just because they swear an oath to this country/Constitution, doesn't mean they represent you and I or what it means to be an American.
      </p>
      <p>
       And trust me, as difficult as all this may be, you will eventually be grateful for having gained this perspective on life. Because while everyone else around you is still stuck in this false reality, you are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       That may seem like a lonely place to be, at first.. but you are not alone. You are in fact more connected to the world than you ever have been, and that's a beautiful thing.

       Excellent work.  After a quick read (I plan to explore the document in more detail when I have more time), I would say that the only thing missing is some mention of those dancing fools who were employed by a company called Urban Moving Systems.

       Thanks man. It took me a couple months to write this and trust me, I went back and forth considering what sections to include. I actually did have a whole section on the "dancing israelis" that I removed.

       I understand.  Perhaps include it in v2—if you plan to make a second draft.

       is a fresh account of the episode based on John Masseria's FOIA request on May 29, 2015.

       But I do understand your decision to exclude UMS from this draft.  And like I said, excellent work.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        WTC7 was a 47 story skyscraper that was not hit by a plane and collapsed in perfect symmetry, achieving free fall acceleration for 25 seconds. Free fall acceleration [9.8 m/s/s] means for that 2.25 seconds, the building was met with zero resistance, accelerating towards the Earth as if you were to drop a bowling ball from the sky. The entire building collapsed in only 6.6 seconds, less than 1 second of total free fall acceleration.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How does this make sense ?  25 seconds or 2.25 seconds or 6.6 seconds or 1 second of "free fall" ?

       Huh? I wrote this specifically for people like my father who are very conservative and balk at even the suggestion of 9/11 conspiracy. I was deliberately gentle and simple about my approach. Trying to reach a different crowd than most documentaries.

       "It took me many months and countless hours of persistent research to fully digest all of the known information about 9/11. This is not something you can properly comprehend in one night, especially if your current beliefs are strong. If you come across something that seems incorrect, take note of it and keep going. Remember, no individual piece of information I or anyone else presents is expected to be “proof” of a conspiracy; it’s about the big picture. Click through each of the links I have provided, and follow up with research on your own."

       I think this is a reference to Norman Mineta's testimony.  He seems to be confused, and the short conversation he heard occurred after the Pentagon was hit.

        Many warnings as late as August 2001 were received by the Bush Administration about the threat of a terrorist attack by Bin Laden in the U.S [1]. These warnings were ignored and not taken seriously because of a “failure of imagination” [1]. After-all, who could conceive of airplanes flying into buildings [1][2]?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This stuff seems to be cherry-picking disparate pieces and making them sound more connected and specific than they were at the time.  There were lots of warnings and isolated pieces of info, but nothing that said "Al Qaeda about to hijack planes in USA and ram them into buildings".  In hindsight, you can go back and pick the dozen fragments of 9/11-relevant info out of the sea of thousands of tips and warnings the FBI and CIA etc received, and say "THOSE were the ones they should have paid attention to".  But that's just the benefit of hindsight.

       We can't know what the truth or falsehoods are. John Farmer, senior counsel to the 9/11 Commission, has stated that the government didn't tell the truth about 9/11:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "At some level of the government, at some point in time…there was an agreement not to tell the truth about what happened."

       Please quote John Farmer in context; I'd like to see the paragraph around that statement.  That quote seems to be given in isolation on the 9/11 web sites I find.  And apparently the rest of the book defends the official 9/11 explanation:
      </p>
      <p>
       "A friend of the author of this site read Farmer’s book expecting to find a huge expose. However what she found was mostly a defense of the official conspiracy theory." from

       Even defenders of the official conspiracy theory accuse the government of lying.

       Your point re: evidence is taken. I'd add the caveat that truth and falsehood can also be deduced by what evidence is actively hidden.

       This is quite false.  It's a big country, we don't have standing patrols everywhere, it can take 15-45 minutes to get fighters up and to the location for an intercept.

       , which shows that the air defense system was severely lacking before 9/11 (probably still is).  Asserting that we could or can intercept hijacked planes within minutes is nonsense.

       Yeah, if there happens to be a fighter in the air nearby, interception can happen quickly.  Depends where you are.  How many fighters are airborne over the whole continental USA at any moment ?  Maybe 20 or 50, I'd guess, mostly in training areas.

       I think this refers to the people interviewed by the NYFD.  9/11 Commission analyzed the transcripts from those interviews, but decided not to call the people in again for repeat personal interviews by the Commission.  So "not considered" is false.

       What "suggested" ?  It's well known that much of it was previously requested by intel agencies or proposed in Congress at various times.  See for example

       </a>
       After 9/11, they grabbed up all those old drafts and fashioned them into the Patriot Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       "More specifically, the legal scholars show that it was the Reagan Administration that initially proposed some of the most troubling provisions that eventually became part of the USA Patriot Act. When Reagan proposed those provisions, Congress rejected them on constitutional grounds. The first Bush Administration then made similar proposals, which were again rejected by lawmakers. Congress twice refused to enact the secret evidence provisions proposed by the first Bush administration. Ironically, just prior to 9/11, Congress was about to pass a law repealing the secret evidence provisions of the 1996 Antiterrorism Act." from

       Yes, but it undercuts the suggestion that 9/11 was committed by the govt in order to enact the Patriot Act.  The Act was written so quickly because drafts of the pieces had been written and proposed again and again over the preceding 6 years or more.

       Yes, 9/11 changed things.  But I'm addressing the "isn't it suspicious how QUICKLY they wrote the Patriot Act ?  They must have written it and then committed 9/11 and then passed the Act".

       I think the point you are making is even scarier than them writing it quickly.  They tried so hard to pass clearly unconstitutional legislation for over a decade.  They couldn't get it done, then magically they could pass anything they wanted in the name of "safety".  If at first you don't succeed, start a war.

       Sure, 9/11 let them stampede the public into accepting horrible changes.  No argument there.
      </p>
      <p>
       But none of that proves that the govt did 9/11.  It explains why they were able to cobble together the Patriot Act and other legislation so quickly after 9/11.

       Two problems with this:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         My arguments about 9/11 boil down to: you theorists provide not a single solid piece of evidence that warrants a new investigation.  Everything you give is speculation or innuendo or outright falsehood.  Give one clear, solid piece of evidence of conspiracy, and I'll agree we should have an investigation of at least the part of 9/11 related to that piece.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The 9/11 Commission itself was not a complete investigation.  But MANY other parts of the govt did their own investigations: FBI, CIA, NSA, NTSB, FEMA, EPA, SEC, etc.  Sure, most of them investigated just a part of the picture.  But there was PLENTY of serious investigation.
