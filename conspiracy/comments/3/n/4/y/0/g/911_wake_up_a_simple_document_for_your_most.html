    <div class="md"><p>I was 23 and watching live on 911, as live as media claims at least... and I have read and watched almost everything out there and I still don&#39;t know where to stand :-(.  On the one hand you have this official story backed by The National Institute for Science and Technology and others; rejected by many including A&amp;E911, which can be argued make up a very small percentage of scholars/engis...many people argue that the official story makes sense.  However when you think about all the details, 4 hijacked planes on the same day?! 3 collapses of very, seemingly, strong buildings?! No video shown of the Pentagon, no plane debris from flight 93.. etc etc... One is left puzzled.  I would very much like to read some independent research from top scholars and engineers that are current and working in their fields, but I feel like this doesn&#39;t exist outside of NIST stuff and the researchers just follow their unreleased models, such as the Purdue crash model... What do current builders of high rises have to say?  Or are they all not willing to chime in?  That would be most troubling and appears to be the case.</p>

<p>Edit, meant to say thanks for the post too!  it&#39;s very comprehensive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man.. if you have time, read it end to end with all the links. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s at least one bit of information you didn&#39;t know previously. </p>

<p>But like you said, you&#39;ve already read/watched everything out there. All those things you mentioned <strong>should</strong> be more than enough to show you the reality. The only thing stopping you now is your mind.. overcoming the notion that  the U.S. would actually be willing to do something like this to its own citizens.</p>

<p>Just take comfort in the fact that those who run our government today are imposters, and just because they swear an oath to this country/Constitution, doesn&#39;t mean they represent you and I or what it means to be an American. </p>

<p>And trust me, as difficult as all this may be, you will eventually be grateful for having gained this perspective on life. Because while everyone else around you is still stuck in this false reality, you are not. </p>

<p>That may seem like a lonely place to be, at first.. but you are not alone. You are in fact more connected to the world than you ever have been, and that&#39;s a beautiful thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>WTC7 was a 47 story skyscraper that was not hit by a plane and collapsed in perfect symmetry, achieving free fall acceleration for 25 seconds. Free fall acceleration [9.8 m/s/s] means for that 2.25 seconds, the building was met with zero resistance, accelerating towards the Earth as if you were to drop a bowling ball from the sky. The entire building collapsed in only 6.6 seconds, less than 1 second of total free fall acceleration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh? I wrote this specifically for people like my father who are very conservative and balk at even the suggestion of 9/11 conspiracy. I was deliberately gentle and simple about my approach. Trying to reach a different crowd than most documentaries. </p>

<p>&quot;It took me many months and countless hours of persistent research to fully digest all of the known information about 9/11. This is not something you can properly comprehend in one night, especially if your current beliefs are strong. If you come across something that seems incorrect, take note of it and keep going. Remember, no individual piece of information I or anyone else presents is expected to be “proof” of a conspiracy; it’s about the big picture. Click through each of the links I have provided, and follow up with research on your own.&quot;</p>

<p>Many warnings as late as August 2001 were received by the Bush Administration about the threat of a terrorist attack by Bin Laden in the U.S [1]. These warnings were ignored and not taken seriously because of a “failure of imagination” [1]. After-all, who could conceive of airplanes flying into buildings [1][2]?</p>

<p>This stuff seems to be cherry-picking disparate pieces and making them sound more connected and specific than they were at the time.  There were lots of warnings and isolated pieces of info, but nothing that said &quot;Al Qaeda about to hijack planes in USA and ram them into buildings&quot;.  In hindsight, you can go back and pick the dozen fragments of 9/11-relevant info out of the sea of thousands of tips and warnings the FBI and CIA etc received, and say &quot;THOSE were the ones they should have paid attention to&quot;.  But that&#39;s just the benefit of hindsight.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t know what the truth or falsehoods are. John Farmer, senior counsel to the 9/11 Commission, has stated that the government didn&#39;t tell the truth about 9/11:</p>

<p>&quot;At some level of the government, at some point in time…there was an agreement not to tell the truth about what happened.&quot;</p>

<p>Please quote John Farmer in context; I&#39;d like to see the paragraph around that statement.  That quote seems to be given in isolation on the 9/11 web sites I find.  And apparently the rest of the book defends the official 9/11 explanation:</p>

<p>&quot;A friend of the author of this site read Farmer’s book expecting to find a huge expose. However what she found was mostly a defense of the official conspiracy theory.&quot; from <a href="http://davis911truth.org/john-farmer/">http://davis911truth.org/john-farmer/</a></p>

<p>Also see <a href="https://hcgroups.wordpress.com/2010/01/15/what-john-farmer-does-say-and-what-he-doesn%E2%80%99t/">https://hcgroups.wordpress.com/2010/01/15/what-john-farmer-does-say-and-what-he-doesn%E2%80%99t/</a></p>

<p>Yeah, if there happens to be a fighter in the air nearby, interception can happen quickly.  Depends where you are.  How many fighters are airborne over the whole continental USA at any moment ?  Maybe 20 or 50, I&#39;d guess, mostly in training areas.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that The PATRIOT Act was written well before 9/11</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What &quot;suggested&quot; ?  It&#39;s well known that much of it was previously requested by intel agencies or proposed in Congress at various times.  See for example <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/12/joe-biden-drafted-the-core-of-the-patriot-act-in-1995-before-the-oklahoma-city-bombing.html">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/12/joe-biden-drafted-the-core-of-the-patriot-act-in-1995-before-the-oklahoma-city-bombing.html</a>  After 9/11, they grabbed up all those old drafts and fashioned them into the Patriot Act.</p>

<p>&quot;More specifically, the legal scholars show that it was the Reagan Administration that initially proposed some of the most troubling provisions that eventually became part of the USA Patriot Act. When Reagan proposed those provisions, Congress rejected them on constitutional grounds. The first Bush Administration then made similar proposals, which were again rejected by lawmakers. Congress twice refused to enact the secret evidence provisions proposed by the first Bush administration. Ironically, just prior to 9/11, Congress was about to pass a law repealing the secret evidence provisions of the 1996 Antiterrorism Act.&quot; from <a href="http://usbillofrights.org/patact.html">http://usbillofrights.org/patact.html</a></p>

<p>Every argument I’ve heard about 9/11 eventually comes back to the fact that we’ve already had a thorough investigation. But this investigation was anything but thorough; it was a cover up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two problems with this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>My arguments about 9/11 boil down to: you theorists provide not a single solid piece of evidence that warrants a new investigation.  Everything you give is speculation or innuendo or outright falsehood.  Give one clear, solid piece of evidence of conspiracy, and I&#39;ll agree we should have an investigation of at least the part of 9/11 related to that piece.</p></li>
<li><p>The 9/11 Commission itself was not a complete investigation.  But MANY other parts of the govt did their own investigations: FBI, CIA, NSA, NTSB, FEMA, EPA, SEC, etc.  Sure, most of them investigated just a part of the picture.  But there was PLENTY of serious investigation.</p></li>

<p>I think they analyzed dust collected by civilians somewhere NEAR the WTC site.  Not at all clear that it came from the WTC buildings.</p>
