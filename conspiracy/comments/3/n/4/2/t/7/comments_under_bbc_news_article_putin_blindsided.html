BBC News don&#39;t often allow comments, but when we do it&#39;s clear that the majority of readers aren&#39;t swallowing the rubbish they&#39;re being told.  Here are the &#39;most recent&#39; comments from when I read the article, only an odd shill (you&#39;ll work out who), majority of real posters supporting Russia.</p>

<p>nasa71 &quot;Actually, I am seriously watch this comedy show. Inaddition,Assad is not one culpable .&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>Riggadon &quot;Awww diddums, did the naughty Russian&#39;s take the yankee&#39;s lollipop away from them?.....awwwwww, bless.</p>

<p>We will at last see some real cleaning up done now.&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>Akvaniaga &quot;Yeah, they have trained 5 &quot;rebels &quot; and some 30000 ISIS terrorists. No wonder they are screaming and kicking when Russia attempts to wipe them out and destroy years of preparation and public conditioning.&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>Maria Ashot &quot;Of course, what Russian, Hezbollah, Iranian operatives/chiefs are blind to is the amount ofHatred Genocide will unleash, all against them. Iranians, in particular, have a problem: they never takeArabs seriously. Russians, of course, are officially on theRecord as robot-slaves of infallible BigCheese Putin-Kadyrov. Blowback will be ferocious; vendettas will last1000yrs. Are you sure Assad worth it?&quot;</p>

<p>liesbecometruth &quot;508. Posted by Maria Ashot Anything and anyone is better than the US and vassals genocidal campaign to destroy countries and peoples. For what? To show the world that they can dictate and those who dare disagree get visited with a &quot;democratic&quot; invasion. Educate yourself.

Are you a member of AIPAC as most of the things you write come straight of there propaganda book of fear mongering.&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>thor &quot;496claudiusrex, That&#39;s a very strong statement, I agree with. I distinctly remember P. Wolfowitz&#39;s quote &amp; was appalled by it, as by any Israeli interference in US or other&#39;s politics, with sole purpose to serve their own interests.
US is a bully, yes, but it&#39;s also Israel&#39;s lapdog, not the other way around. No offense to Israeli people, it&#39;s Netanyahu who ticks me off. Thor&quot;</p>

<p>powermeerkat &quot;Post quickly, folks.</p>

<p>&quot;The more we comment on failed US Foreign Policy here, the sooner this HYS will be closed down&quot;</p>

<p>The opposite seems to be true. The longer Russia&#39;s duplicitous policy and military actions in Syria, Ukraine, etc., are exposed, the more remunerated factotums from the Russian Troll Army flood Western portals with pro-Kremlin propaganda.&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>NorCalMojo, &quot;I think what we&#39;re seeing is natural. When Obama pulled out of the region it left a power vacuum. Now it&#39;s being filled. It should have been expected.&quot;</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t bother me. Policing the Middle East is an expensive and thankless job. Russia is welcome to it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At least the Russians gave the US a leg up to move any of its forces it might have in the area. Russia is only protecting/aiding its ally just like the US would do. I&#39;m sure the neocons would have wanted the US to be more involved in Syrian civil war. As if the US haven&#39;t had enough involvement in other countries wars/mess. The US is still trying to clean up Iraq&#39;s and Libya&#39;s wars mess.&quot;</p>

<p><em>&quot;... there was an anticipation that though there might be big policy differences, there would be a degree of co-ordination and openness.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Really? Nobody coordinated with the government of the fucking country they went in to bomb prior to this. Iraq invited them over, not Syria.</p>

<p><em>&quot;... it looks like Russia is not distinguishing between different rebel groups. If these groups are against Assad, they could find themselves in the crosshairs of the Russian Air Force.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Good, yet BBC continues to convince its readers that certain flavors of jihadist would make Russia the bad guy if they bombed them. They&#39;ve been defending cannibals and rapists in the conflict for years and can&#39;t stop now!</p>
