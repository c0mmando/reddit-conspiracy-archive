       No wonder they want to Fluoridate the water supply of the Brits, they are not falling for the official propaganda.  BBC News don't often allow comments, but when we do it's clear that the majority of readers aren't swallowing the rubbish they're being told.  Here are the 'most recent' comments from when I read the article, only an odd shill (you'll work out who), majority of real posters supporting Russia.

Iranians, in particular, have a problem: they never takeArabs seriously. Russians, of course, are officially on theRecord as robot-slaves of infallible BigCheese Putin-Kadyrov. Blowback will be ferocious; vendettas will last1000yrs. Are you sure Assad worth it?"

       thor "496claudiusrex, That's a very strong statement, I agree with. I distinctly remember P. Wolfowitz's quote &amp; was appalled by it, as by any Israeli interference in US or other's politics, with sole purpose to serve their own interests.
US is a bully, yes, but it's also Israel's lapdog, not the other way around. No offense to Israeli people, it's Netanyahu who ticks me off. Thor"

       The opposite seems to be true. The longer Russia's duplicitous policy and military actions in Syria, Ukraine, etc., are exposed, the more remunerated factotums from the Russian Troll Army flood Western portals with pro-Kremlin propaganda."

       "At least the Russians gave the US a leg up to move any of its forces it might have in the area. Russia is only protecting/aiding its ally just like the US would do. I'm sure the neocons would have wanted the US to be more involved in Syrian civil war. As if the US haven't had enough involvement in other countries wars/mess. The US is still trying to clean up Iraq's and Libya's wars mess."

       BBC journalists are shitposters.

        "... there was an anticipation that though there might be big policy differences, there would be a degree of co-ordination and openness."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Really? Nobody coordinated with the government of the fucking country they went in to bomb prior to this. Iraq invited them over, not Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "... it looks like Russia is not distinguishing between different rebel groups. If these groups are against Assad, they could find themselves in the crosshairs of the Russian Air Force."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Good, yet BBC continues to convince its readers that certain flavors of jihadist would make Russia the bad guy if they bombed them. They've been defending cannibals and rapists in the conflict for years and can't stop now!
