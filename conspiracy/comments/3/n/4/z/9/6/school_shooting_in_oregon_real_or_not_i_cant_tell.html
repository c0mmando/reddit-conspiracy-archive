       personally I don't actually doubt what you are saying, btw. I realize of course you could be lying - but even if you are - I believe there are people with cousins in Oregon who are going to sincerely confirm the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       for me I'd be interested to know how much first hand knowledge your witness has - because it's no doubt it would be hard to know if it was real or not unless you were very very close.
      </p>
      <p>
       either way - I do appreciate the info that somebody not on the news is corroborating the story,

       as I think about it - I could be wrong about seeing it meaning that. I don't go on 4chan so I don't really know how to pick up on what indicates what in that context. I guess it could just as much be "planted" as part of fakery. as much as it could be an indication of anything authentic. what's your take on it?

       Listening to interviews on FOX live on YT. Two different students say they heard nothing... one student currently at fairground with 200-300 other students, says no one he spoke to has heard anything- no gunshots heard by anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, they had a former CIA officer on to talk about... school security
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Earlier on they said that at any given time there were ~3000 students on campus. Why is there only a tenth of that evacuated? Some of them have left, but apparently they're not letting students leave without family members to pick them up. Which is strange, plus they said the average age of the students was 30.

      <p>
       2nd UPDATE: They have the CIA dude and a guy from the DEA on and they're discussing why it is that no one heard anything. They've spent the last 5 minutes talking about how and why it is that no one heard gun shots- including a girl in the building next to the one where the shooting occurred.

       interesting you mention this. I was watching the CNN feed soon after this was first reported, and they had a lady on the line. She was a local and has kids at this college. One of them said to her "mom, it sounded an awful lot like a suppressed gun." She said her kid knows a lot about firearms and that he probably knows what hes talking about. The weirdest part was that after she said that, the CNN correspondent got very defensive and was all "How do you know it was a suppressed gun??" and then they cut the call almost immediately after the lady mentioned silenced weapons.

      <p>
       Because the FOX anchor was the one who repeatedly brought up how strange it was that no one heard the shots. Like, he kept bringing it up  and making a point of it. And the CIA and DEA guy got very defensive. But were trying to explain how it must just be that the buildings were designed in such a way to block the noise- and then the FOX guy kept suggesting/asserting that it could have been a suppressor, and the CIA/DEA seemed quite annoyed at the suggestion, but were essentially like "uh, yeah, well that is possible. who knows?"

       I was telling a friend about all the probably fake news and what it might probably mean - he said the safest thing to do is pretend we are still falling for it, so long as they think they are fooling us with fake news they won't pull out the real violence. I think subconsciously a lot of people go through that logic - even if they can kind of catch a glimpse something is wrong they can't see the advantage to really really looking into it. I think it's good to look into it. I think we can overcome.

       they don't waste no time - "EVERYTOWN" just sent out this mass email:
      </p>
      <p>
       This morning, students at Umpqua Community College in Oregon got up like they do every day -- ready for class, ready to learn, to engage.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in an instant, their worlds were turned upside down. According to the Oregon Attorney General, as many as 13 people were killed and 20 were wounded at the Roseburg, Oregon college. [1]
      </p>
      <p>
       My blood is boiling. My frustration is deep. But what I'm feeling doesn't even come close to what the friends and families of the victims and survivors are experiencing right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can help provide a small bit of comfort in this terrible time. Please join me by automatically signing a condolence message to the community affected by this shocking shooting.

       Volunteers from the Moms Demand Action chapter in Oregon will deliver your signature in the coming days.

       "Our hearts are broken over the news of Thursday's shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. Please know that our thoughts and prayers are with you and the entire community affected by this horrific shooting."

       I'm going to be blunt: Our kids go to college to learn. Not to be shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mass shootings are tragic by definition. But when they touch a college community -- a place of learning that's supposed to be safe -- they are that much more devastating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today's tragedy marks the 45th school shooting in our country this year, averaging more than one per week. You and I both know it's time for our lawmakers to stop telling students and teachers to stand up to gunmen -- just so they themselves don't have to stand up to the gun lobby.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this moment, we can help console those who've endured real tragedy today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stand with the Umpqua community now by signing a condolence message. Our volunteers will deliver your signature:

       The article states "five pistols and one rifle" were on him. So far I've read that he only used one of those 6 guns. Why did he even bring the rest? Unless he did use other guns, and I missed it.

       interesting thanks for posting. I do think it's strange they keep focussing on "one female" killed. this doesn't strike me as typical of emergency protocol, to continually focus on one of many victims because of gender, and is the first thing that strikes me as emotionally manipulative. jury still out for me, just observing. thanks.

       Boston Bombing, Sandy Hook, Charleston, virginia tec &amp; Virginia News shooting. are all extremely suspect. as for absolute proof no violence occurred - I don't know about that - but the evidence that the violence did happen is extremely contradictory and lacking and the evidence for major coverup and deception in reporting for all of those events is overwhelming.

       So there has

        never
       </strong>
       been any proven or admitted false flag spree killings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've not looked much at Charleston or the Virginia incidents, but I've seen close to zero credible evidence that even cast legitimate doubt on either Boston or Sandy Hook. The evidence is certainly not "overwhelming" for either: it's mostly mis-interpreted with credible alternative explanations.

       for me personally I went from not even knowing anybody suspected anything about these things - to stumbling on somebody's research - wondering what the hell they were talking about - not being able to reconcile what it seemed like they were saying with what I knew about how the world worked - to doing my own research for months - and finally realizing - yes - I can see these events are staged. for me there is proof. in the court room of my own mind - it has been proven. And I'm not alone by a long shot, but of course - you have your own mind and your own personal courtroom where you decide what is true for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess it comes down to what do you call "proof". For many people who deeply investigate it is proven for them - and they know these events are false flags. but you are not going to find validation of such knowledge on  some "official" source. if you wait around for the liars to admit they are lying and confirm the evidence against them for you - you could be waiting a very long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       the evidence is out there. and much of it is cumulative. one "smoking gun" is not going to do it for any skeptic - and shouldn't - it's a huge leap to see these events as staged and - as it should -  it really takes a huge amount of information to come to the logical conclusion - that they are. that information, all the details that paint the big picture -  is available but it takes time to find it all and go through it and recognize what the big picture is. if you have not yet found enough information, or had the desire to unearth it for yourself - I can understand why you have your viewpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       also - actually I'm pretty sure there are some admitted false flags from history that involve mass killings, but I don't personally remember details of  them. but it's been a war and domestic control tactic pretty much throughout civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       lastly - not insignificantly - Obama signed into law a repeal of the outlawing of domestic propaganda the day before 2013. so for the first time since 1948 domestic propaganda was/is again legal in the US - just before this specific series of suspect events started.

       Appreciate the thoughtful answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my case, I went "down the rabbit hole" and found some things which certainly seemed extremely suspicious. For example, why was there
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/25nsi4/sandy_hook_dna_evidence_found_on_the_22_crime/">
        a felon's DNA on a Christmas card at the Lanza house
       </a>
       ? But it turned out the card wasn't in the house at all, it was
       <a href="http://wtnh.com/2014/10/01/after-long-battle-for-access-sandy-hook-letter-offers-little/">
        actually at the school and had been sent after the event
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem was, every piece of data I looked at, failed to stand up to close scrutiny. They only seemed "evidence" for a conspiracy, if you assumed there was one to begin with. That lack of video footage? The school didn't have any cameras capable of recording. Very limited crime-scene photos? The state has some of the strictest laws against releasing that kind of thing in the nation. Add in entirely fictitious claims like Wolfgang Halbig's false assertion nobody knows who cleaned up the blood, etc. and I ended up coming back out of the rabbit hole again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another problem is the conspiratorial answer actually raises more questions than it answers. For instance, suggestions like the school wasn't actually open immediately jacks up the number of required "crisis actors", basically to be everyone in the town, since as far as I know, not one single Newtown resident has come forward to question the official version of things. That kind of absolute security, involving tens of thousands of people of all ages, in civilian life, seems far more implausible than a mentally disturbed young kid with access to lethal weaponry. The sad truth is we've seen that kind of thing often enough before - and today is likely just another example - the government really does not need to fake it.

       I think if Sandy hook was the first and only one I'd looked into I would still very much be on the fence, for me that is the least conclusive one. And the one I held off on the longest. I can only see that one now because I got far better at picking up on the patterns by looking at the Boston Bombing and Charleston. Which led me to go back and look deeper at Sandy Hook. I think in all these events there is a plethora of "wrong evidence" for example people like to say in the virginia news shooting the shooter was supposed to be black but his hands are white in the video, this is super silly to me. his hands look about the right color in the video to belong to the shooter - given time of day, lack of color timing/ etc. and there are tons of other examples in all of these things of "evidence" that is not evidence at all. I hadn't actually heard of the christmas card thing for sandy hook. but I remember going to a "debunking page" for sandy hook - ready for them to clear it all up for me and the first point they wanted to debunk was that there were 26 christmas trees at the fire house - apparently there was some theory that the 26 trees creepily, predictively represented the 26 victims and that was the proof of conspiracy, -- and I was like -- huh - I guess that's what they call a straw man. pick an incredibly weak argument from the opposition and argue against it - as if that proves your credibility. and meanwhile ignore the strong arguments. the entire debunking page read like that to me - countering all these really pointless points that I mostly had not even heard of - that were irrelevant to the strong, big picture,  arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       i also can't tell for sure if the school had been open or not, or for that matter if some people did fact lose their lives that day or not. But what I can see for sure - is they used footage from a drill to show you kids and people exiting the area. they used footage of cops storming a DIFFERENT school - and no live rushed action at sandy hook was ever aired. and the supposed weapon uses to do all the killing was reportedly found in the trunk of the car - not on the killer. (not that any of that should push you to change your mind in this moment - but those are the things that led me to see there was reason to look further - and then the contradictory details just piled and piled up. like gene rosen's story, and other parents's stories and so much more)
      </p>
      <p>
       but - actually - I really mean it - sandy hook is the hardest to see conclusively. the one that was easiest for me to see, with certainty, once I could finally see it, - though the most shocking - and the one that took me the first several months of -- what am I seeing I can't get my head around this was Boston Bombing. I tell you from the bottom of my heart -- I know - with all my skills of deduction - those were staged injuries we were shown. those people lying on the sidewalk with blown off legs and bleeding were giving us a theatrical performance. and all those assisting were playing their part. I know it sound too -- fill in any word here for not possible - and yet - if you spend enough time with the evidence it is apparent.  it was the most surreal realization for me. and I didn't pick up on it until maybe about a year ago. when the actual event occurred I didn't have a clue. if you hunker down and just watch a bunch of videos explaining why boston bombing is staged you will eventually see why I am saying this. and then the other's may be easier for you to recognize.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you the government does not need to be doing this, but for whatever reason somebody is doing it. i'm not even sure if it's the government specifically, it could be military industrial complex type - something - . I do not know. all logic in terms of - how do they get away with it with the numbers that have to be involved - there must be easier ways to achieve these goals whatever they are without grand conspiracy - I totally agree with you. those are super strong arguments. however --- it appears it's happening all the same. (staged events in the news)
      </p>
      <p>
       I invite you to grab a beer and devote a few hours to humoring the whole thing and just watching all the videos you can find on the boston bombing hoax. just hear it out. thoroughly. it's the way I came to see - sans the beer whatevs. I just mean - take it for a curiosity. see it as entertainment -  if that's possible. and just see if you can see it. a lot of people are seeing it. and they are smart people. of course they were smart before they saw it too - I don't mean only smart people see it - but I mean - it's not crazy or stupid to see it. as a lot of people like to insist. it does defy probability. but ultimately - I suspect that is likely because we don't have all the information necessary to assess what is most probable.
      </p>
      <p>
       also if you watch the virginia "shooting" video (which takes a lot less time) you will see the right color hands (imo) but nobody getting shot.

       I am still prepared to be convinced, but here is a good example of what I mean, in your post.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the supposed weapon uses to do all the killing was found in the trunk of the car - not on the killer.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Except, that isn't actually the case.
       <a href="http://www.ct.gov/csao/lib/csao/Sandy_Hook_Final_Report.pdf">
        Per p.2 of the the official report
       </a>
       , "All of the killings were done with the Bushmaster rifle," which was "found in the same classroom as the shooter’s body. All of the 5.56 mm shell casings from the school that were tested were found to have been fired from this rifle." p.23 then says "Recovered from the car was an Izhmash Saiga-12, 12 gauge shotgun with two magazines containing a total of twenty rounds of ammunition." That's a totally different gun, and wasn't even originally in the trunk: "The shotgun and ammunition were originally seen in the passenger compartment of the car and were moved by police to the car’s trunk for safekeeping."
      </p>
      <p>
       I truly don't mean this in any personal way, but it's this kind of claim - which don't stand up when you examine them in detail - that eventually convinced me there was nothing of merit to the hoax theory. Now, Gene Rosen certainly may well be a douche, with an interest in inflating his own role, but that kind of person can show up at any big news story, and really isn't evidence for it not happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't gone as deeply into the Boston one, but I have tried to get to the bottom of the allegations this was a "drill," and I've found basically nothing credible to support it. One guy says he heard an announcement - apparently unheard by the hundreds of other present. Apart from that, there is a YouTube video of
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       dubious authenticity supposedly showing an announcement, and some mis-understood Tweets which actually refer to a controlled bomb squad demolition after the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       With regard to the injuries, I'm no doctor, but again, for them to be actors requires not only their involvement, but the involvement of
       <em>
        everyone else
       </em>
       involved or even in the area. Because you couldn't take the risk of even one single person "peering behind the curtain" and exposing the fraud. Yet, as in Sandy Hook, pretty much nobody present on the day has expressed any doubts - but it's all so obviously fraudulent to people watching Youtube videos? I think it's the case that, if you stare closely enough at ANY event in which humans are involved, you'll eventually find "inconsistencies", because that's the nature of eye-witnesses, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, the "nobody died" theory just adds an implausible layer of complexity. At Sandy Hook, it would be far simpler and safer to mind-control someone into shooting up a school. For Boston, actually blow something up. If the theory suggested was that the Tsarnaevs and Lanza were patsies, duped into acting a certain way, I'd be a lot more inclined to consider that.

       you may be correct about the gun report. I don't doubt it. and I'll just assume you are right on that specific point.  seems to me that you are seeking out this info with integrity.  however -- you could disprove a lot more than that and I would still "know" it was a hoax. based on all the evidence I've seen. I won't list it all because I think the documentaries on it do a better job. but as for the guns - to me it doesn't matter what gun they say was where - the contradictory info in their reporting got me interested - but as I researched I realized I don't think lanza did any shooting at all that day with any guns. the timing of how many shots had to be fired and how few injuries vs deaths there were and the issue of the bullet proof glass and zero forensic evidence. to me eclipses what type of gun may or may not have been used.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand what you are saying - that when specifics are debunkable - it leads you to logically conclude the whole argument is in error, I respect this as a totally thoughtful way to respond to the info. and I agree with you about gene rosen -- there are a billion werido's out there - he might just be a loner liar who fantasized he was a hero in this scenario and he is lying but it means nothing in terms of true counter evidence. isolated - I think that is he most reasonable take on him. but big picture - I see his type of lying as repeated over and over by other witnesses - while he remains the most super obvious one, the pattern is present. that, to me, is why he remains important.
      </p>
      <p>
       I gotta say I respect your thinking. I say it's totally solid. I just think the unexpected - but true - is still escaping you - as it is escaping a lot of people with sound thinking. I agree when you stare at anything long enough you can start to see stuff you are looking for - but also you are going to keep seeing what's really there as stronger and more clear. I mean I can look at the case of Ted Bundy and wonder if ghosts made him do it - I can maybe eventually think -- see a ghost might have been in his VW that one day - but it's never going to - no- I gotta say I actually just disagree with that, you can't make something true just by wanting it to be true -- and this is not a case of that. however I do agree that anything is going to have inconsistencies. but you allow for a margin of that - and then see if the inconsistencies reach a kind of critical mass and are not just a margin of error.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really do not know if "nobody died" at sandy hook. maybe some kids and adults did, I just  can't tell. but I do not think it went down like they said, I think it was a staged event and if people were killed - a very different story surrounded their deaths. I don't think adam lanza was a shooter - if there was shooting that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       when I was first introduced to this stuff. I had sympathy for "light" conspiracy and a kind of - well I'm not going to go that far - feeling. my first instinct when any doubt came to me about boston was the FBI set those brothers up - it was a real bombing to keep funding for homeland security or something like that and those brothers may not even realize they were manipulated into doing it for the benefit of those they think they were enemies of. that was my "guess" of conspiracy based on the weird stuff that arose that I did catch on to - namely that the FBI had a relationship with the brothers. but then the FBI pretended not to know who they were when they asked for help in the man hunt. to me that was plenty conspiracy, I assume a general level of corruption - not necessarily by the whole of the FBI but maybe pockets of - whatever. I didn't give it deep thought - I just felt - if there is some lying going on there, on our side,  I would not be surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
       so -- I totally get what you are saying. I don't know how to explain - it's like -- yes that sounds reasonable to limit the conspiracy theory - but the more unreasonable sounding theory might be the actual truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have expertise in guns or crime investigation - but I do have expertise in acting/theater/stagecraft and filmmaking.  I know that it's possible to make something appear to be much bigger than it is. to pull off these things - you would need a ~lot of people - but you wouldn't need as many people as you might think. a tight shot of a press conference can give you the impression there are fifty people in the space when there are really five. you see a few people in frame running from an event - you have the impression there are 100 people running from something - but if you really consider what you are seeing it is only a suggestion of a huge crowd not literally a huge crowd. I'd say  - for these events you don't need nearly as many people as it appears are involved. you need well placed people to make sure the story is told as you've packaged it. but it is well documented that media cooperates with the cia/government in this fashion. project mocking bird is an example of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway - I don't want to "insist" to you it's true, I do respect your thinking. the only thing I can offer is to go deeper and come to understand why so many people see it, I think all your points are valid, and yet I think you can go deeper and see - it's happening.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        I know there are so many false paths to seeing it that are clearly filled with debunk able evidence, so I don't know what dumb luck brought  me all the way there. actually I think it was watching loose change 3rd edition and realizing there was more to 9/11. that got me open - to "conspiracy" ideas - however it was a bigger leap to see some events are entirely staged, (unlike 9/11 with all the real death)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       anyway/ I respect your logic  but I say go further into the, for now, seemingly illogical.

       I've got to head out, but something to point out:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The link claims "This tweet is no longer on Chris Hursts twitter or any other from the morning of Wednesday 26th August 2015." But
       <a href="https://twitter.com/chrishurstwdbj/status/636532144966365184?lang=en">
        that clearly isn't the case
       </a>
       , it's still very much there.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Yes, the time-stamp on that Tweet shows as 6:34am for me too. But I'm in the
       <strong>
        Pacific
       </strong>
       time zone - Twitter adjusts all time stamps to the local user's zone. 6.34am Pacific is 9:34am in Virginia, so looks to me that this was actually a couple of hours AFTER the shooting, not before it. It's exactly the same thing I saw with the Boston "controlled explosion" Tweets, where some people
       <a href="https://storify.com/dkiesow/the-controlled-explosion-farce">
        thought they were before the blasts
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck with your journey. As they say, keep an open mind - but never so open, your brains fall out! :)

       you might be right about the time zone - another bad evidence - but just look at the boyfriend speaking about the incident, see if he seems genuine to you. there's the stronger evidence.

       Boston Bombing, Sandy Hook, Charleston, virginia tec &amp; Virginia News shooting. are all extremely suspect. as for absolute proof no violence occurred - I don't know about that - but the evidence that the violence did happen is extremely contradictory and lacking and the evidence for major coverup and deception in reporting for all of those events is overwhelming.

       Appreciate the thoughtful answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my case, I went "down the rabbit hole" and found some things which certainly seemed extremely suspicious. For example, why was there
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/25nsi4/sandy_hook_dna_evidence_found_on_the_22_crime/">
        a felon's DNA on a Christmas card at the Lanza house
       </a>
       ? But it turned out the card wasn't in the house at all, it was
       <a href="http://wtnh.com/2014/10/01/after-long-battle-for-access-sandy-hook-letter-offers-little/">
        actually at the school and had been sent after the event
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem was, every piece of data I looked at, failed to stand up to close scrutiny. They only seemed "evidence" for a conspiracy, if you assumed there was one to begin with. That lack of video footage? The school didn't have any cameras capable of recording. Very limited crime-scene photos? The state has some of the strictest laws against releasing that kind of thing in the nation. Add in entirely fictitious claims like Wolfgang Halbig's false assertion nobody knows who cleaned up the blood, etc. and I ended up coming back out of the rabbit hole again.
      </p>

       Another problem is the conspiratorial answer actually raises more questions than it answers. For instance, suggestions like the school wasn't actually open immediately jacks up the number of required "crisis actors", basically to be everyone in the town, since as far as I know, not one single Newtown resident has come forward to question the official version of things. That kind of absolute security, involving tens of thousands of people of all ages, in civilian life, seems far more implausible than a mentally disturbed young kid with access to lethal weaponry. The sad truth is we've seen that kind of thing often enough before - and today is likely just another example - the government really does not need to fake it.

       I think if Sandy hook was the first and only one I'd looked into I would still very much be on the fence, for me that is the least conclusive one. And the one I held off on the longest. I can only see that one now because I got far better at picking up on the patterns by looking at the Boston Bombing and Charleston. Which led me to go back and look deeper at Sandy Hook. I think in all these events there is a plethora of "wrong evidence" for example people like to say in the virginia news shooting the shooter was supposed to be black but his hands are white in the video, this is super silly to me. his hands look about the right color in the video to belong to the shooter - given time of day, lack of color timing/ etc. and there are tons of other examples in all of these things of "evidence" that is not evidence at all. I hadn't actually heard of the christmas card thing for sandy hook. but I remember going to a "debunking page" for sandy hook - ready for them to clear it all up for me and the first point they wanted to debunk was that there were 26 christmas trees at the fire house - apparently there was some theory that the 26 trees creepily, predictively represented the 26 victims and that was the proof of conspiracy, -- and I was like -- huh - I guess that's what they call a straw man. pick an incredibly weak argument from the opposition and argue against it - as if that proves your credibility. and meanwhile ignore the strong arguments. the entire debunking page read like that to me - countering all these really pointless points that I mostly had not even heard of - that were irrelevant to the strong, big picture,  arguments.

       i also can't tell for sure if the school had been open or not, or for that matter if some people did fact lose their lives that day or not. But what I can see for sure - is they used footage from a drill to show you kids and people exiting the area. they used footage of cops storming a DIFFERENT school - and no live rushed action at sandy hook was ever aired. and the supposed weapon uses to do all the killing was reportedly found in the trunk of the car - not on the killer. (not that any of that should push you to change your mind in this moment - but those are the things that led me to see there was reason to look further - and then the contradictory details just piled and piled up. like gene rosen's story, and other parents's stories and so much more)

       but - actually - I really mean it - sandy hook is the hardest to see conclusively. the one that was easiest for me to see, with certainty, once I could finally see it, - though the most shocking - and the one that took me the first several months of -- what am I seeing I can't get my head around this was Boston Bombing. I tell you from the bottom of my heart -- I know - with all my skills of deduction - those were staged injuries we were shown. those people lying on the sidewalk with blown off legs and bleeding were giving us a theatrical performance. and all those assisting were playing their part. I know it sound too -- fill in any word here for not possible - and yet - if you spend enough time with the evidence it is apparent.  it was the most surreal realization for me. and I didn't pick up on it until maybe about a year ago. when the actual event occurred I didn't have a clue. if you hunker down and just watch a bunch of videos explaining why boston bombing is staged you will eventually see why I am saying this. and then the other's may be easier for you to recognize.

       I agree with you the government does not need to be doing this, but for whatever reason somebody is doing it. i'm not even sure if it's the government specifically, it could be military industrial complex type - something - . I do not know. all logic in terms of - how do they get away with it with the numbers that have to be involved - there must be easier ways to achieve these goals whatever they are without grand conspiracy - I totally agree with you. those are super strong arguments. however --- it appears it's happening all the same. (staged events in the news)

       I invite you to grab a beer and devote a few hours to humoring the whole thing and just watching all the videos you can find on the boston bombing hoax. just hear it out. thoroughly. it's the way I came to see - sans the beer whatevs. I just mean - take it for a curiosity. see it as entertainment -  if that's possible. and just see if you can see it. a lot of people are seeing it. and they are smart people. of course they were smart before they saw it too - I don't mean only smart people see it - but I mean - it's not crazy or stupid to see it. as a lot of people like to insist. it does defy probability. but ultimately - I suspect that is likely because we don't have all the information necessary to assess what is most probable.

       also if you watch the virginia "shooting" video (which takes a lot less time) you will see the right color hands (imo) but nobody getting shot.
