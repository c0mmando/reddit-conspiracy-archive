<p>The article linked is no more than a claim. Neither side has provided proof to their claims.</p>

<p>I simply pointed out that if indeed it was being used in any of the above ways it was certainly a valid target under international law.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bombing was unacceptable.</p>

<p>Only if you blindly take one side&#39;s word over the other, in a situation where neither side wants to be in the wrong.</p>

<p>It most certainly is according to <a href="https://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule25">https://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule25</a> </p>

<p>.A much more trustworthy and notable source then an OPINION PIECE in the Indian Journal Of Medical Ethics, especially when it comes to wars and armed conflicts.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Including housing enemy fighters, being a fighting position, or being a base of operations or command.</p>

<p>In other words it was quite legal to do so as long as one of those was going on, if not then its a totally different story, but with the same ending.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it hard to believe that MSF (aka doctors without borders) would allow their hospital to be used as a taliban base or a taliban anything.  </p>

<p>I suspect that a Taliban official had his phone on him when he was in the hospital and the strike was zeroing in on that and they didn&#39;t care where he was. </p>

<p>They were told the exact location of the hospital by MSF so they can&#39;t plead ignorant.  The US officer who ordered this strike should be brought up to the ICC in Hague on war crimes.  </p>

<p>The duplicity of our government really irks me sometimes. This is one of them. The very same day the talking points in the media are saying that Russia killed civilians in Syria, they go and knowingly bomb the only doctors without borders hospital in that region of Afganistan.  Out leaders are completely morally bankrupt if you ask me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the Taliban did have a base in that hospital, then they would have to operate without the staff knowing it.  As soon as the staff found out they would leave quickly and shut down the hospital.  It wasn&#39;t a huge facility, I think they would have been aware.  </p>

<p>This leads to the next question I have. If the US military were so convinced that there was a Taliban base there, and they also knew it was the only hospital in the region, then why didn&#39;t they go in there with ground troops, or wait to get the targets when they left the hospital?  If they didn&#39;t know that it was a hospital then they are very incompetent because MSF gave them precise geolocated data letting the US know it was a hospital.    I personally suspect the US didn&#39;t want this place treating the Taliban anymore because doctors without borders don&#39;t exclude people who need medical help.  </p>

<p>There are many possible explanations and they all need to be investigated impartially, hopefully by the ICC.   Allowing war crimes to go  unchallenged brings our country down even further in the world&#39;s eyes.   </p>

<p>Firstly, if the Taliban were wanting to use the hospital as a base, the doctors wouldn&#39;t be able to simply shut it down. They could have been forced into operating as normal.</p>

<p>Secondly, from the limited reading I&#39;ve done on the issue, it was Afghans that called in a strike, AFTER TAKING FIRE from the hospital.</p>

<p>As you said though... Investigations need to be done.</p>

<p>You see thats your opinion. We are discussing international law, which says no such thing.</p>

<p>Thats simply not true, even allowing the hospital to be used in a manner to aid the enemy (HQ,hiding place, fortified position, etc) makes it a valid target. Now if they were gunning down the doctors 1 by 1 as they fled the position or something like that then you would be correct, but the strike was targeted at the hospital not specific medical personnel.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same exact way that Israel gets away with bombing hospitals in Gaza and the like.</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t able to unless they have security of their own, or come to an agreement with both (or more) parties not to do so. As we have seen in multiple conflicts it is quite possible, even with factions that are less than conventional.</p>

<p>But yet again we are talking about the LAW here, which clearly states that this was legal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prior to bombing the shit out of anything, you need to gain sufficient intelligence.</p>

<p>That&#39;s an opinion and has 0 effect on the reality of what is or isn&#39;t legal here.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t police other nations on these rules if we can&#39;t even follow them to begin with.</p>

<p>As has been stated multiple times, the US was within its legal rights to bomb that hospital assuming its claims are true. Of course if the claims arent then thats a whole other story.</p>

<p>So he&#39;s allowed to make legal claims, but when I reply pointing out that it was actually legal its somehow my fault? Like holy fuck the ridiculousness is insane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes because replying to an argument based on legality with the legal realities of the situation is terrifying.... if reality terrifies you that much I wish you the best as you&#39;ll need it.</p>

<p>By that logic if you say its illegal to kill people and I show that under some circumstances (self defense) it isn&#39;t that then somehow makes me show a &quot;chilling lack of humanity&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I understand where you are coming from personally, but I did feel you were a bit condescending so I decided to chime in. From MY perspective, which I share not because I&#39;m correct but because we each hold a small sliver of truth within us, I don&#39;t sit around and wait for someone to tell me what is legally right or just, I look at it and think to myself if it is moral and just in my own eyes as a human fighting for other human rights around the world because I&#39;m sorry, governments aren&#39;t going to babysit you your whole life and do what is in your interests. History has proven that it doesn&#39;t work that way. </p>

<p>If the hospital was a hive of &quot;terrorists&quot;, a term made up by a questionable president, used to create incentive to go to war for questionable reasons, based on an event that is highly suspect as being allowed to happen or even made to happen by forces within our own government that do not represent the will of the people in this country, then I would still need to understand what created the terrorists and what they were fighting for. Are they mercenaries? If so who the fuck is paying them? Did we destroy a million of their people? Did we arm them? Is this propaganda as well? There is a labyrinth of questions one must ask before even coming close to being on the right side of history on this. </p>

<p>Bottom line is, I want all governments to stop pretending they are doing the human race any favors by fighting and lying on a day to day basis. It&#39;s all turned into a narrative machine, whoever tells the best lies wins, whoever has the biggest guns wins. All I&#39;m seeing is divide and conquer on a MASSIVE scale. I hold no allegiance to any nation anymore, I have no reason to, only to the people (all living creatures actually) and the earth. </p>

<p>Guess that makes me a terraist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of us like the war on terror.  Most of us are here because of 9/11 and the aftermath.  Most of us want these wars to end.</p>

<p>But I thought most of us recognized that Russia isn&#39;t helping to end these wars.  It&#39;s just funding the other side.  Russia is using the term terrorism to describe the people fighting Assad as well.  So is Assad.  Bush didn&#39;t invent the term and every government in the world is using it to describe any non-government fighters they don&#39;t like.</p>

<p>That said, the Taliban has some some truly terrible things to Afghanis.  Many Afghanis don&#39;t want us to leave.  It was actually the Afghan government, not the US, that said there were Taliban troops firing on US and Afghan troops, and they requested the air strikes.  What occured may then be a war crime.</p>

<p>Does any of that make Putin a good person?  Politicians tell the truth sometimes, that doesn&#39;t mean we suddenly forget all the horrible shit they do.</p>

<p>No one is calling you a terrorist.  But some of us do see this place becoming very anti-US and pro-Russia.  People posting RT as some bastion of truth would be like people posting FoxNews and their unbiased views on Russia and terrorism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought the term terrorist was coined by Bush but you very well could be right... it wasn&#39;t till his shit storm of a presidency that I felt we were moving into dangerous enough times that I had to start paying more attention.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m calling myself a terra-ist. lol Anyone that doesn&#39;t identify with some nation, and only the earth and the well being of all living creatures and protecting her natural resources, is essentially at odds with almost every government and corporate interest on the planet.</p>

<p>So this makes me anti U.S. and Russia or nationalism in any form... It&#39;s just another religion used to divide and conquer as far as I see it with money and government as the new God. </p>

<p>If other people are anti-US it&#39;s more likely that they don&#39;t dislike the land or the people, but they don&#39;t like that people are using our money to expand corporate interests across the globe. They don&#39;t like that the game is rigged and the votes don&#39;t count. They don&#39;t like that all the money is being siphoned into the top 1 percent. It&#39;s economic violence. It is destroying lives. It is preventing so many people from realizing their dreams while on this earth. That is a crime against <em>God and the Universe</em> as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty easy to make a shitload of friends and allies across the world with humanitarian efforts rather than spending 500 plus billion on an out of control war machine that appears to even be honing in on it&#39;s own people, as evidenced by the massive amounts of data collection and profiling of people. I don&#39;t know that we can wait around to see what happens because we are on the verge of technologies that could make armies obsolete, thereby circumventing the inconvenient need of using poor people trying to pay for their families or go to school to carry out the blood shed world wide and at home. If some corporation or military industrial complex develops the tools to make the whole world bow, then who knows, at this rate they might go for it. I literally have no reason to trust someone who simply gets off by watching numbers in a bank account increase. It is common knowledge that war is insanely profitable to it&#39;s financiers... This is how the Rothschilds made the lions share of their wealth and was a major factor in the Bushs coming into to power as well.</p>

<p>No one should be allowed to profit from war period. But these things will continue to persist until certain deeply rooted philosophical ideas are addressed and these issues are far from being discussed anywhere at this point. So if anything, there could be a collapse, and then Matrix 7.0 will be created... but it will just be the same thing in a new disguise. </p>

<p>You know, the typical propaganda that every major world power uses. And that im sure you certainly believe the US uses. Hell Russia&#39;s media is state owned, its not even attempting to hide it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia says they&#39;re destroying ISIS.  A lot of reports on the ground say they&#39;re bombing the FSA.  Some have said they have yet to hit an ISIS target.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s too soon to start congratulating Putin on a job well done.  My issue is that everyone is taking Putin&#39;s word and his media&#39;s word at face value.  Yet everything the Western media says is either dismissed outright or scrutinized to death.</p>

<p>This place should not be used to mindlessly post Russian press releases because they seem to align with our worldview.</p>

I&#39;m not saying their press isn&#39;t controlled, in fact they could be just as controlled but they have an agenda to expose the U.S. for it&#39;s crimes, I understand that, but at the same time, looking at all of these different news sources from different nations which are all trying to expose each other, begins to help build a truer tapestry of the world.

<ol>
<li>Area in which hospital resides is under the control of some local warlord-type who is tied to the Kabul govt and American forces because said warlord is the only thing we have on the ground to fight the Taliban.</li>
<li>This guy sends people to the hospital to demand protection money.</li>
<li>Hospital people refuse, because MSF has a policy against it</li>
<li>Things go fine for a while, until things heat up with the Taliban in some proximity to the hospital</li>
<li>Warlord forwards info about the hospital to the Americans, telling them the Taliban are in there using it to fire on allies etc.</li>
<li>Americans bomb hospital on purpose.</li>
<li>When questioned, Americans admit they did it on purpose, with the stated reason that they were fed: <em>they were told</em> that the Taliban were using it to fire on allied forces.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>What is the difference between a &quot;terrorist&quot; attack and a pretty obvious deliberate attack on a hospital even if in a war zone? The taking responsibility for the attack or the framing it as a foul up down in the chain of command, as &quot;mistake&quot;? This was an atrocious act, whether you pin the bloodcurdling epithet of &quot;terrorist&quot; to it or not. The military&#39;s cynicism is chilling. No wonder the escalating state of things in the world. What kind of credibility can we have going around committing these atrocities and then covering up for them or using double speak? I&#39;m tired, demoralized and disoriented. These are dark times.</p>

<p>Yaron Shmuel and Sivan &amp; Paul Kurzberg, who were arrested in New York on 911 filming the attack in their words to &quot;document the event,&quot; had all been residents of <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/search?q=+TerrorGr%C3%BCppe+Kurzberg+-+Pizza+-+Woodledoodledoo">Brisbane Australia</a> where the entire political process is beholden to Jews.</p>

<p>They are terrorist militants .. there is a large Jew population base in the same city, all members of which are active terrorists or active terrorist infrastructure.</p>

<p>Under the same rules of engagement, genuine Anti Terror forces could declare Brisbane a terrorist city and nuke it to ash!</p>

<p>The other side says bring the Jews to arrest and trial, with the political hierarchies at State and Federal level that granted them free passage, then hang the lot .. innocent Jews as well as innocent Brisbanites should welcome the procedure.</p>

<p>Insofar as they don&#39;t want anyone intent on righting the same wrongs, lumping them in with the Zionist malefactors, or with any of the successive Jew sponsored political dynasties that granted them freedom.</p>

<p><strong>The test for righteousness among Jews, resides with their response to the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/search?q=Steven+Goldsmith&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;t=all">Steven Goldsmith</a> and <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/search?q=Katherine+Schweitzer&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;t=all">Katherine Schweitzer</a> cases.</strong></p>

<p>He disappeared in July 2000, from the same Brisbane suburb that hosts the Mossad cell, that spawned the Kurzbergs and Yaron Shmuel.</p>

<p>His case appears to be ground work for future charges Jews have been &quot;disappeared,&quot; while nobody gave a good G-d damn becuz they were Jews.</p>

<p>She was found murdered Dec. 28, 2006 four weeks after her story went world wide, that her Budapest family of fourteen was sent to Auschwitz in 1944, whence only she survived, by another Jew had moved onto her same street in Sydney.</p>

<p>No Jews thus far have risen to the challenge.</p>
