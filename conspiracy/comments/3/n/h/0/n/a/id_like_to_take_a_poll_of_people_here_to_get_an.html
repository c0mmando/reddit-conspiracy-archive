       The "thermite only" theory doesn't stand up to scrutiny.  The "nukes in the basement" theory may be plausible, but doesn't really fit with what happened.  Though I haven't examined Dr Woods theory in depth, it does seem to be a possibility.

       Regardless, we have enough information to know that the "official" story is a lie, very likely the most horrendous lie ever presented to We The People.

       It's easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled. - Mark Twain
      </p>

       I suspect pride, fluoride, and the relentless brainwashing by the mainstream media.  People no longer know how to think.  They confuse the reception of indoctrination from the tv with using their brains.  They're lazy, and they give their mental capacities to Fox (or CNN or whoever) to do the "analyzing" for them.  Then they just regurgitate what they've been told to believe.

       Could it also be that they don't understand how a conspiracy could be so immense so they assume the conspiracy theorists must be wrong somehow? I think a lot of people believe that the people in control are too stupid to pull this stuff off.

       Yes.  And the owners of the media are complicit in convincing people of this.

       But We The People are guilty too.  Thinking is hard.  It's much easier to watch Duck Dynasty or Dancing With The Stars, and hey look, there's another ballgame/movie-of-the-week/awards show I can watch!  I'll let someone else figure it out!

       Just my humble understanding of physics and chemistry tells me something doesn't add up with the official story of 9/11. I don't hold multiple degrees, but I have studied engineering, physics, and chemistry.  Those buildings collapsed in the fashion of a controlled demolition. Most people don't want to believe, or are afraid to believe, that our leaders would take part in something like that. I know, I was there at one time. Now the whos, whys, and hows are beyond my knowledge base, I would only be speculating.  But, as the saying goes...? Que' bono?...who benefits?

       Because we can take that technology and produce our own power. When it's time to vote we can vote for the people who are asking these same questions and if they aren't then we protest. This is why they are preventing people from knowing about this technology. Also, they want to use fear of dangerous technology to prevent themselves from losing power too. It's all a big mind game though.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if people are educated they can't pull the wool over their eyes. This is why gaining control of the information channels was so important to them. You have that you have the people in your palm.

       What you have to keep in mind is that this is just part of a bigger story. And yes we can understand how to use these technologies on a much smaller scale. We all could. It would take some development but not much. If you watch this video she talks about John Hutchison.

       He has been using this effect for decades. If a few brilliant people took it seriously and worked with him they could come up with the fundamental processes at work. But like I said.. this is just part of the story. There's other stuff too I can't talk about here now.

       But like I said.. all the info is out there.. you just have to put the pieces together. Start with Dr. Judy Wood and Hutchison. Cold fusion and Pons and Fleischmann.

       I'll be honest, I've already studied Judy Wood, Hutchison, cold fusion and Pons and Fleischmann.  I still haven't been able to conceive how a directed energy weapon would work as you claim.  Maybe you should be spending your time at the drawing board, and when you get the fundamental processes to work, let us know.  Until then, you're simply asking us to believe.

       No, I am not asking you to believe.. the evidence is there. How else could the towers have been destroyed the way they were?
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence showed the same characteristics as Hutchison's experiments.. the same evidence Tesla said he saw in similar experiments 100 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cold fusion has been replicated by a respected Japanese scientist and the US government. It's called LENR now low energy nuclear reactions. they are doing the same experiment as Pons and Fleischman.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Wood shows how the WTC evidence showed the same signs as cold fusion experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
       What don't you believe about the evidence being related to the Hutchison effect? How else do you propose that these results could be produced? That's the drawing board we need to see.

       I can agree with that.  It could've been a shitload of "conventional" explosives.  It could've been small amounts of some "new" type of explosives.  WTC7 seemed rather quiet as it fell, in comparison to the many controlled demolitions we've seen in Vegas, old sporting arenas, and such.  I suspect there are on-going improvements in these sorts of things.  That's another reason why I don't rule out Dr Woods.

       I don't think it's absolutely necessary to know all the facts of how it was done before arrests are made, because we know the story presented to us is a God-damned lie.  If certain people were taken in and interrogated (perhaps enhancedly) we may get some answers to the questions.

       How do you know it's molten steel? Dr Wood talks about this.. in her book and in her videos she shows that all over the scene immediately after the towers dustified there was what appeared to be red hot metal.. yet there is paper sitting right on it or near it and it's not burning...
      </p>

       What you see there could be due to some electrical discharge.. look at this..

       Here is an actual vehicle supposedly burning up completely.. you have supposedly metal here being completely destroyed by fire.. Wood shows this all over the place.. engines were supposedly "melted" yet with all this supposed heat look next to the vehicle there's paper all around. How is this possible? Also look at the minivan.. the engine "appears" to be burning the most. What I have seen is that the objects that had the most steel in them reacted to this effect the most. This also explains why there were no toilets, file cabinets or desks found in the rubble whatsoever....
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why I think it was perfect for destroying the buildings.. because the strongest steel parts of the buildings would react the most which would destroy the most important part of the building first. But as Dr. Wood shows this doesn't appear to be fire as we know it. It's actually appears to be some kind of electrical phenomenon.. like st elmos fire that is seen in high voltage electrical experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
       See how the engine areas of these cars are destroyed the most and other areas are not affected.

       Sorry, I can't see anything that I can confirm as paper in or near this obvious molten steel:

       I also don't see evidence of any of these melted engines you speak of.

       Here are eye witnesses recalling molten steel:

       Dr Wood explains how firefighters were in water that covered the rubble pile.. if it was hot molten metal the firefighters should have been cooked in the hot water.. how do you explain that? Even the people who ran from the building said it didn't feel hot...

       No, they would not have been cooked in the hot water.

       That's one of the cool thing about fire hoses.  You can put the water on the fire

       No.. firefighters were walking in the pool of water.. if the rubble was molten hot like people claim then they should have been cooked by superheated water...
      </p>
      <p>
       There were reports that firefighters needed new steel toe boots because they were melting from the heat. Yet their feet weren't burnt. The firefighters weren't thinking it through.. if your oven melts shouldn't the turkey inside be cooked? Yet their feet weren't burnt. Something else was destroying the steel and the boots themselves.

       Water boils at 212 degrees f, so there's no way that's 819 degrees regardless of labeling.

       You could have superheated gas escaping from the water.. but the water should be steaming everywhere. It isn't though. Like I said.. the people running from the buildings said the air wasn't hot. The NASA heat image would be doctored anyway.. this was a conspiracy after all... the astronauts on the space station neglected to mention the hurricane off the coast when they were looking down on New York at the time just like the media underreported it. The hurricane that was heading right for New York all before 9-11 and the media ignored it.

       Don't you think knowing OF technology is vastly different than knowing the technology and how it works?  Are you claiming to understand how this technology would work?
