        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Alex Skarlatos <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3257184/Train-hero-Alek-Skarlatos-student-mass-shooting-college-ran-DWTS-rehearsals-panic-check-friends-OK.html">attends Umpqua Community College</a> where the shooting took place one week ago today.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;Right, I had classes in Snyder Hall. I mean, it’s a fairly small Community College and just the town in general everybody knows each other so with that many deceased I mean everybody’s going to know at least one person,&#39; Skarlatos said. &#39;I mean I would have been there today if I didn’t agree to do this show. I had classes picked out and everything,&#39; he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, various sources are reporting that a second &quot;French Train Hero,&quot; Spencer Stone, was <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/french-train-attack-hero-spencer-stone-stabbed-n440956">stabbed last night in Sacramento</a>.</p>

<p>Edit: Just found this article having to do with Spencer: <a href="http://www.military.com/daily-news/2015/09/19/some-airmen-criticize-decision-to-promote-train-hero-from-e3.html">Some Airmen Criticize Decision to Promote Train Hero from E-3 to E-5</a></p>

<p>And also, as of Monday when <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/10/05/the-france-train-heroes-will-all-head-to-roseburg-in-show-of-support-after-massacre/">this article</a> was published, the third U.S. &quot;Train Hero&quot; said that they were all set to meet up in Roseburg to show their support for the victims of the shooting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the fuck is Stone doing in Sacramento still.  Is he still on leave for months at a time or is he not really in the air-force.  Skarlatos is on DWTS which started airing Sept 14th, so they would have started filming rehersals two weeks before that maybe the last day in August.  That&#39;s only nine days after the supposed french terror train event.  The TV show didn&#39;t have anybody lined up for that spot a 10 days before??  How did DWTS track this guy down on such short notice while still over in Europe, getting awards, meeting the president etc.  Its not like normal people have managers/ agents who know how to get in contact with the talent.  (I&#39;d probably drop whatever I was doing at the time too) The whole thing seems contrived, especially after you see all the flag waving on TV.  Going out of state to attend a community college seems a little weird unless there is some special course they have there or you just like paying for rent and out-of state tuition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first guy wasn&#39;t anywhere near the school shooting. He wasn&#39;t even taking classes there this semester.  How is it that his life was in danger when he hadn&#39;t been in the same city of the community college in months? What a huge fucking stretch. If one of the guys had lived previously in Chicago would we say that he was in danger over the weekend when 20 people were shot in Chicago but he was in New York and hasn&#39;t been in Chicago for over 6 months? This is silly at best. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The local Sacramento news has got the doctor praising Stone, calling him a hero etc. giving updates on his condition and assuring the viewers of a full-recovery.  Anybody familiar with HIPPA?
