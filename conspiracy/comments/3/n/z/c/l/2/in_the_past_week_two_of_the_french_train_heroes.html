        'Right, I had classes in Snyder Hall.

       Now, various sources are reporting that a second "French Train Hero," Spencer Stone, was
       <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/french-train-attack-hero-spencer-stone-stabbed-n440956">
        stabbed last night in Sacramento

       .
      </p>

       Edit: Just found this article having to do with Spencer:

      <p>
       And also, as of Monday when
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/10/05/the-france-train-heroes-will-all-head-to-roseburg-in-show-of-support-after-massacre/">
        this article
       </a>
       was published, the third U.S. "Train Hero" said that they were all set to meet up in Roseburg to show their support for the victims of the shooting.

       Either TPTB wanted to get rid of them because they knew too much, or they actually stopped an attack and this is revenge.

       Wholeheartedly believe the latter. We all know how 'coincidental' deaths are after something like this. Just like the Bin Laden raid and Seal Team Six guys dropping left and right.

       If you had taken part in a false flag operation and suddenly the people you were with are narrowly avoiding death in a short space of time, you'd probably blow the whistle. I think you're right with the latter.

       I'd think if they wanted to get rid of them, they'd be dead by now. This could be to send a message (perhaps to people like us?).

       What the fuck is Stone doing in Sacramento still.  Is he still on leave for months at a time or is he not really in the air-force.  Skarlatos is on DWTS which started airing Sept 14th, so they would have started filming rehersals two weeks before that maybe the last day in August.  That's only nine days after the supposed french terror train event.  The TV show didn't have anybody lined up for that spot a 10 days before??  How did DWTS track this guy down on such short notice while still over in Europe, getting awards, meeting the president etc.  Its not like normal people have managers/ agents who know how to get in contact with the talent.  (I'd probably drop whatever I was doing at the time too) The whole thing seems contrived, especially after you see all the flag waving on TV.  Going out of state to attend a community college seems a little weird unless there is some special course they have there or you just like paying for rent and out-of state tuition.

       There isn't enough money to bribe me to do the TPTB biddings. You are expendable and they will want you dead as soon as your duty is done. Let's not say these individual's lives are threatened including their families and they have no choice. Once the TPTB cross paths with you, you're good as dead. It's a lose lose situation participating in their chess game.

       The first guy wasn't anywhere near the school shooting. He wasn't even taking classes there this semester.  How is it that his life was in danger when he hadn't been in the same city of the community college in months? What a huge fucking stretch. If one of the guys had lived previously in Chicago would we say that he was in danger over the weekend when 20 people were shot in Chicago but he was in New York and hasn't been in Chicago for over 6 months? This is silly at best.

       The local Sacramento news has got the doctor praising Stone, calling him a hero etc. giving updates on his condition and assuring the viewers of a full-recovery.  Anybody familiar with HIPPA?  You can't even use your phone in a doctors office because of patient confidentiality concerns and here is a doctor giving updates of some individual's health status.  Strange, never seen that before.
