    <div class="md"><p>If people want an evolutionary psychology theory (I know you do!) it may very well be a survival technique.  You&#39;re basically telling people, &quot;hey, you know our hierarchy and your position?  yeah... no, you don&#39;t&quot;.  This is information usually acquired over two decades from toddling to the end of adolescence.  The energy expended is enormous and is most of what we consume in those years.  The suggestion of having to do it over again basically sounds impossibly hellish, even if the reality is that it doesn&#39;t take a full lifetime to foster a new sense of one&#39;s already processed experiences.</p>

<p>And as most people have already mentioned, it is incredibly emotionally painful to even entertain that large important parts of one&#39;s life were even slightly not what they seem.  It takes a great deal of energy to mourn and persevere, and many people are struggling just to go to work and maintain a family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it takes more energy and emotion to maintain the illusion in the face of contradictory evidence. And this struggle is usually a matter of popularity. People are willing to change their beliefs but only if most other people changed their beliefs too. 9-11 changed people&#39;s perceptions of Muslim people from harmless to dangerous. It was a smooth transition for these people because they all changed their minds together. So the energy that goes into changing a belief is massive but it dissipates among everyone if we all change our minds at the same time.</p>

I was 22 when Muslims first tried to bomb the Twin Towers, and I remember everyone already hating Muslim before that. I feel your argument that 9/11 changed minds is based on your interpretation on what happened after. While most will tell you that 9/11 only encouraged that fear, as well as pushed that hatred in many to the point of action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re talking about different things. You&#39;re saying that an event like 9-11 moved the people that already mistrusted Muslims into hating Muslims and all the ones who were on the fence about it became haters. And I agree. I&#39;m talking about a 180 degree shift in belief.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But it takes more energy and emotion to maintain the illusion in the face of contradictory evidence. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think of the &quot;God Hates Fags&quot; church or creationists or ISIS or something silly. In the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary it takes a lot of conscious, mental acrobatics and energy for these people to convince themselves that their view is correct and truthful. They go to all sorts of extremes to convince themselves, not other people, that their view is right. The opposition that the Westboro Baptist Church or ISIS gets serves to &quot;justify&quot; their viewpoint to them because they constructed their belief on the fact that they&#39;re oppressed or victimized. It takes more energy and anguish to maintain the illusion in the face of contradictory evidence than to simply face the facts. That&#39;s all I&#39;m trying to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Find any reasonably large flat surface. A big car park, a salt flat, a frozen lake, there are plenty of places that will suffice.</p>

<p>Place a measuring stick in the ground and then walk one mile away, or half a mile, or a quarter of a mile. At that point place another measure. Then aim a laser pointer from a height of 12 inches towards the first measure.</p>

<p>If you are 1 mile away, that laser will hit the other measure at 20 inches high, not 12 inches. The reason it does so is because Earth&#39;s curvature is 8 inches over 1 mile.</p>

<p>Do the experiment at a distance of half a mile and the curvature is 2 inches, so it will hit the measure at 14 inches high.</p>

<p>At quarter of a mile, curvature is half an inch, so it will hit the measure at 12.5 inches high.</p>

<p>This is an experiment anyone can do. Try it yourself and the results will be the same. </p>

<p>You didn&#39;t demonstrate anything, you just laid out what you <strong>should</strong> see but previous experiments have never shown curvature. The burden of proof is on you, you&#39;re the one making claims that there is curvature.</p>

NASA (aka, us military) or something else, but what amazed me about the conversation is how everyone got angry! Why get angry. Cognitive dissonance.

    <div class="md"><p>A number of reasons depending on the &#39;truth&#39; you&#39;re spouting. </p>

<p>Firstly, truth implies something is a fact, 100% correct and certain. Now, I ponder this sub a fair bit but don&#39;t contribute and you cannot refute that there is not a whole lot of fact up in here. I&#39;m not saying that means it&#39;s bullshit/fake/crazy. It is hard to prove things 99.9% correct. </p>

<p>So when you tell some one the truth and say oh well <em>thiiiiiiink about it</em> that will not hold you in good light. </p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t care, don&#39;t want to know or think it&#39;s a waste if effort regardless. And to a point, they are correct. People discover and come up with these &#39;truths&#39; after hours of digging and fact finding, even if correct they mostly lead to nowhere. The only thing I can relate that too is the &quot;how do you know if some ones a jogger&quot; they will tell you... Thing is, no one cares you&#39;re a jogger, what you do in your own time is fine and dandy but people don&#39;t want to hear your marathon times unless they are a runner. Same with gaming, same with diets and all this. </p>

<p>To a lot of people yes it does make you look a bit Cray and that you think you&#39;re smarter than them. </p>

<p>Also, one of the more annoying things I&#39;ve found when relating to theorists is that they are theorists saying it&#39;s truth and pushing their beliefs on other people. Maybe if you&#39;re directly talking about how good the gov is you can counter. But when the local church comes knocking I don&#39;t care because I&#39;m not religious however my catholic neighbour will open the door to talk and debate. </p>

<p>Most truthers, again like joggers etc plaster it over the face book, twitter and ram it down their friends throats and again just like any obsession it makes you uninteresting to people that have no interest in it. </p>

<p>You have to learn to who talk to and not to... Used to live with five house mates 4 didn&#39;t care, one was a theorist who was the jogger type. We shared opinions but he was labeled a nutter because he didn&#39;t know when to shut up. I kept it online and to people that shared views or people that were interested in politics. </p>

<p>You also have to go slow. &quot;Our gov is so great&quot; lay down some financial stuff, something that would catch the attention in a subtle way and if they do research to back it up pick up on that. Don&#39;t go straight for the 9/11 Diana killing &quot;truth&quot; because you will get shot down. </p>

<p>Common sense of social interaction really. </p>

<p>You should be &#39;truthing&#39; &#39;people&#39; yiu should get discussing politics in a slightly cynical manor with interested associates and build up the topic base. Common sense on any hobby 101</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose most people don&#39;t like someone being invasive with their opinion at times when people are occupied with other thoughts.  They become irratable because the person with all their truth they want to share is being force fed to the other without the others consent at that moment.</p>

<p>Also people reconnize other peoples enthusiasm on a topic as that person just coming to a realization within themselfs and their arguments become amateurish in nature.  Many people already made their own journey through the argument (the others truth) and either determined a different outcome based on different personal experiences, views, or they feel they are listening to a babe just learning knowing the other has a long way to go.</p>

<p>What truth is to one is not necessarily truth to another.  Conclusions change even if only in variables.  Having someone tell something to someone is forcing rigid views onto another without acknowledging the other person may have an opinion of their own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion this is not about &#39;their reality crashing&#39; or something like that but it&#39;s because they are not truly honest and open-minded people. These days <em>everybody</em> thinks they are open-minded but they haven&#39;t a true grasp on what that word really implies.
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s truly possible to be 100% open-minded, not for me not for anyone, you will always stop at certain points and not entertain certain ideas in your head.</p>

<p>Another thing that plays part in why those people <em>get angry and lash out</em> is because they are ugly and unpleasant humans in general. You don&#39;t have to instantly believe these conspiracies people tell you but to get angry, lash out and even mock in a very mean way just shows your ugly personality. You can bet your money that the majority of these people are also extreme atheists. 
Of course then there are also a lot of younger people who also show this behaviour like teenagers, but I&#39;m not willing to go hard on them. 
Your environment plays a huge part in how much of an asshole you become and also how much you get enabled in being an asshole.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think these people go around thinking that &quot;the truth hurts&quot;, I don&#39;t think that idea even crosses their minds. They are already past the point of having general empathy and showing basic respect towards other humans.</p>

But if you say that a disproportionate number of that elite class are Jews, you will meet with greater resistance, because we have all been trained never to criticize the Jews in any way.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you say that blacks in America commit a disproportionately large amount of violent crime, you will meet resistance, because the public knows they are not supposed to criticize blacks; but if you tell them that the reason blacks commit more violent crime than whites is genetic and racial, you will really stir up tempers, because the public has been trained to believe the lie that race is an illusion and race makes no difference.</p>

<p>You see, this is exactly the behaviour the OP mentioned. Because someone disagrees with you, you resort to attacking them.</p>

<p>The vaccine issue, for example. I have an opinion which is very likely to be different to yours - but if your first response is to accuse me of being hypnotized or vulnerable, that&#39;s not very mature is it?</p>

<p>If the only argument you can make is that the other person is hypnotized, you aren&#39;t making an argument at all. You are not presenting any evidence to support your position, nor are you presenting any evidence to refute their position.</p>

<p>I never said that, I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re referring to my comment: &quot;previous experiments have never shown curvature&quot;
Which I did not give links for but it is not hard to find experiments about this. However it is hard/impossible to find experiments of this nature that prove curvature.</p>
