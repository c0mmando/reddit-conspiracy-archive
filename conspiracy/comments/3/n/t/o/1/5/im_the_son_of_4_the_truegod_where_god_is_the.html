       Muslims and Christians are as evil as each other. Muslims believe in the False-4 and thus take the false route to the 'promised land'. Christians are ignorant, anti-1 supporters, anti-2 supporters, anti-3 supporters and anti-4 supporters.

       The movement of both religions is leading to hell on Earth, and thus, both religions are of the utmost evil. World, wordless, peace, is the only way to the "promised land" and/or "heaven".

       Why is the movement itself evil? Are there not good people who can come of the religious movement and yet understand the True-God as in the law of one (in which everything exists together), or rather the law of 4?
      </p>
      <p>
       My understanding of what you are saying is that the religious movements of Islam and Christianity seek to create duality rather than unifying all under the 4; however, I would argue that those who follow God through Christ and truly love all of creation in its perfection are redeemed

      </p>
      <p>
       Because you say "I love God's creation" doesn't make it so you are a lover of 4. It must be wordless belief.

       I agree. Many followers of Christianity do not understand God, but saying "I love God's creation" and supporting the True-4 are not mutually exclusive. What of the Christians who preach/pray about the beauty of life while working to try to clean the atmosphere, oceans, and peoples' thoughts and hearts?

       Why must one "unknowingly believe in the True-4" for one to be do good works? Why does God promotion cancel out one's good works? Since you are knowingly believing in the True-4, does your True-God promotion cancel out
       <em>
        your

       Your temperament seemed to have arose in your most recent post. This is anti-4 behaviour, but is it your true-self or word-virus related. Should I forgive you or condemn you? I'm unsure, but I'm sure of 1, 2, 3, 4.

        However, you're referring to academia, and thus, representing academia; meaning I have to give an academic answer to your question---which is impossible if I'm referring to 1, 2, 3, 4.

       Actually I am not referring to academia. How is God the anti-1, anti-2, anti-3, and anti-4? Why does anti-1, anti-2, anti-3, and anti-4 equal the creation of paedophilia, homosexuality, animal cruelty and nihilism? You only assumed that I am referring to academia.

       I simply asked if
       <em>
        you

       would no longer be the chosen 2, not if I would become the chosen 2. In response to my question of how to become the chosen two, you responded with

       Thus, if someone else supports 4, then would you no longer be the chosen 2?

       To 4---the central nerve---anti-1 behaviour, for example, causes 4 {i.e. the central nerve} to lean toward paedophilia, through the word-virus, and the act is paedophilia toward 4, through the wordless.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the becoming of the chosen 2, you would have to be chosen by 4. You would have to know how to be chosen by 4.

       Actual paedophilia; 2 forms of it. A direct manipulation of one's sperm/sexual energies; and the indirect manipulation of one's central nerve into them committing the act of being paedophile themselves.

       I don't want to be rude, but since you asked, after reading everything on that sub it sounds like youre kinda just saying a lot without saying anything at all. Literally the whole thing was gibberish to me. The most I get is that for some reason you imbue these numbers with some deep sacred meaning, 4 being the most important.
      </p>
      <p>
       My original question was more about what led you to that conclusion that these specific numbers are actually some complex abstract with incredible meaning

       This isn't a good thing, it's equal to paedophilia, homosexuality, animal cruelty and nihilism. Which in terms of 1, 2, 3 and 4, is directly infecting the people whom you are anti to, with these problems.

       Yes, I'm illiterate sometimes, but for someone who knows words are an abomination, it's a good thing; yet it's bad thing since I'm qualified in English.

      <p>
       I have recently had trouble with tare and tear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is probably because there are multiple meanings associated with tear.

       You're now ignored due to "Anti-4 behaviour".

       Go ahead and throw a strop and down-vote all my posts in response to you, because it didn't meet your

       Okay then, well go be confused in another thread. I'm not here to help you, at least; I'm here to answer questions to people who're, inter alia, rational, intellectual and whom want to know the truth!
      </p>
      <p>
       The best course of action here, for you, if you're
       <em>
        rational, intellectual and a seeker of truth
       </em>
       , is to not respond.
      </p>

        Why must one "unknowingly believe in the True-4" for one to be do good works?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There is/was a natural wordless harmony on Earth before words were invented. In this case, we unknowingly knew of the True-4, but knew 4.

       <p>
        Why does God promotion cancel out one's good works?

      <p>
       Because God is anti-1, anti-2, anti-3 and anti-4 promotion. It's equal to the creation of, inter alia, paedophilia, homosexuality, animal cruelty and nihilism.

       No, because I am the chosen 2.

        I suffer under the worded social fiends.

       You
       <strong>
        are
       </strong>
       referring to academia. You're asking me to provide a academic-scientific answer to your question.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll go ahead and provide a short but sweet
       <strong>
        4Power
       </strong>
       answer;
      </p>
      <p>
       To 4---the central nerve---anti-1 behaviour, for example, causes 4 {i.e. the central nerve} to lean toward paedophilia, through the word-virus, and the act is paedophilia toward 4, through the wordless.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the becoming of the chosen 2, you would have to be chosen by 4. You would have to know how to be chosen by 4.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, you're the one who is asking the questions, is this not a
       <em>
        sign
       </em>
       that I'm wiser and more understanding than you on the matter?!!!

       Anti-1,2,3,4 behavior is okay because you made this whole thing up. There is your answer.
