<p>There is/was a natural wordless harmony on Earth before words were invented. In this case, we unknowingly knew of the True-4, but knew 4.</p>

<p>Why does God promotion cancel out one&#39;s good works?</p>

<p>Because God is anti-1, anti-2, anti-3 and anti-4 promotion. It&#39;s equal to the creation of, inter alia, paedophilia, homosexuality, animal cruelty and nihilism.</p>

<p>Since you are knowingly believing in the True-4, does your True-God promotion cancel out your good works?</p>

<p>No, because I am the chosen 2.</p>

<p>Actually I am not referring to academia. How is God the anti-1, anti-2, anti-3, and anti-4? Why does anti-1, anti-2, anti-3, and anti-4 equal the creation of paedophilia, homosexuality, animal cruelty and nihilism? You only assumed that I am referring to academia.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll go ahead and provide a short but sweet <strong>4Power</strong> answer; </p>

<p>To 4---the central nerve---anti-1 behaviour, for example, causes 4 {i.e. the central nerve} to lean toward paedophilia, through the word-virus, and the act is paedophilia toward 4, through the wordless.</p>

<p>As for the becoming of the chosen 2, you would have to be chosen by 4. You would have to know how to be chosen by 4. </p>
