        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Revolutions go in circles. Let&#39;s fix what we have. If a convention is denied us, that is treason, and grounds for a revolution.</p>

<p>Until we ask for a Convention and are denied, I can&#39;t tell my friends to revolt in good conscience. I can&#39;t revolt in good conscience. Our Constitution has a last resort... and this is the time.</p>

<p>We&#39;re getting close to having enough states to call for a convention. We can effectively steer a convention. If we plan to have control, we will have control... they are not ready for it. </p>

<p>... but if they refuse to follow the constitution, we have but one redress... and I&#39;ll get behind anyone calling for it.</p>

<p>I just talked my buddy Mike into supporting a convention... I&#39;m at nearly 100%, convincing people... one on one... so DO THAT. Call for it on facebook, on twitter and around your neighborhood if you are in a state that hasn&#39;t called... like me. I&#39;m in Washington, so I&#39;m telling everyone around me to call.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re in a state that has already called, get ready for the convention. Learn about it. Learn how the delegate process works, and we&#39;re going to make sure you are a delegate.</p>

<p>Your only job as a delegate will be to vote to amend the constitution, to allow national, immediate referendum, on the TERMS OF THE PEOPLE, with no limit.</p>

<p>The terms of the people are outlined in the book. Read it.</p>

<p>NOW. Before Texas Secedes.
Here&#39;s the instruction manual to how to call for a convention... how to do a knock-knock revolution if that fails (to preempt a violent revolution). At a convention, it proposes a direct and immediate popular referendum restricted to items where there is concensus (DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP reform... election reform... none of the higher level party stuff)... And it proposes every answer to every problem, except that itch near your left thigh... (you should get that checked out). <a href="http://1drv.ms/1Dc7pD5">http://1drv.ms/1Dc7pD5</a></p>

<p>Good day, my friends in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>See you at the convention. We&#39;re doing this.</p>

<p>This will end just as it always has throughout history... with a lot of violence and death.  The biggest thing that I see is that they are far more prepared than the public gives them credit for.  There is too much evidence that a vast network of underground bases exists to ignore.  If you think about it logically, you must be making plans (and calling it &quot;continuity of government&quot;) to hide out in your underground &quot;elysium&quot; with your friends while you scorch the earth above you.</p>

<p>Scary stuff, but I think we need to face the monster that we have allowed to get too powerful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can rewrite the whole constitution at a convention. A convention has the same power as the original convention... by design... </p>

<p>The convention called by the Senate is the second to last resort... and this has been called several times in the past... to end slavery and to give women the right to vote.</p>

<p>Rough Draft is a guidebook to making sure the Convention doesn&#39;t get coopted by the elites. I fully expect that we will force a convention, as soon as we directly hone in on that goal. Once we do, every attempt will be made to scope it and to control the selection of the delegates... but that seriously won&#39;t work right now. The Fed has pissed off too many states and they will not send paper electors to a convention, or they will never be elected again, themselves.</p>

<p>Then we do an end run around their star defensive line with a referendum... the blitz they don&#39;t expect. This gives us the same power as people in Switzerland, and I&#39;ll point out that Switzerland is Rich, Happy and consistently avoids war.</p>
