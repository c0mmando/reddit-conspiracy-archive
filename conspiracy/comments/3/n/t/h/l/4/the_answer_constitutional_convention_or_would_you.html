       Revolutions go in circles. Let's fix what we have. If a convention is denied us, that is treason, and grounds for a revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until we ask for a Convention and are denied, I can't tell my friends to revolt in good conscience. I can't revolt in good conscience. Our Constitution has a last resort... and this is the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're getting close to having enough states to call for a convention. We can effectively steer a convention. If we plan to have control, we will have control... they are not ready for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       ... but if they refuse to follow the constitution, we have but one redress... and I'll get behind anyone calling for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just talked my buddy Mike into supporting a convention... I'm at nearly 100%, convincing people... one on one... so DO THAT. Call for it on facebook, on twitter and around your neighborhood if you are in a state that hasn't called... like me. I'm in Washington, so I'm telling everyone around me to call.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're in a state that has already called, get ready for the convention. Learn about it. Learn how the delegate process works, and we're going to make sure you are a delegate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your only job as a delegate will be to vote to amend the constitution, to allow national, immediate referendum, on the TERMS OF THE PEOPLE, with no limit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The terms of the people are outlined in the book. Read it.
      </p>
      <p>
       NOW. Before Texas Secedes.
Here's the instruction manual to how to call for a convention... how to do a knock-knock revolution if that fails (to preempt a violent revolution). At a convention, it proposes a direct and immediate popular referendum restricted to items where there is concensus (DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP reform... election reform... none of the higher level party stuff)... And it proposes every answer to every problem, except that itch near your left thigh... (you should get that checked out).

       I'm a rp2016 guy, so I say this impartially. Trump is not part of the system. There's a golden rule in politics. Never talk about trade. Have you noticed when he says we are getting screwed by China that it's never picked up by the msm? Ailles at Fox is even talking about going to war. The bias can be pulled off on someone like ron and rand paul. With a front runner like trump, not so easy.

       I don't think he has ever been asked about it. I rest my case. Like i said, trade is not to be discussed! Were talking trillions upon trillions of dollars. Also, add to this his foreign policy ideas of the u.s. causing chaos in the middle east by toppling sectarian dictators. Other than rand paul, tell me of another republican candidate with this perspective? No, trump is no friend of tptb.

       Oh, so politicans should just stick to the script huh? If you're a trumpbot, you kinda suck at your job. Rand paul is no ron paul either. They're sellouts. So is sanders, despite the 3 of them probably being the best

       I'm sorry, I missed the name. Who has the same ideas of the u.s. causing trouble in the middle east? You can't bring yourself to say the word nobody. It's a psychological condition called cognitive dissonance.

       Trump has zero follow through though. Sanders has a history of trying to help the middle class. Trump doesn't. Do you really want a TV reality show host to be a president?

       Whatever, they're all bullshit candidates anyways, this whole system is bought and sold by corporations and interest groups. The voting is relatively meaningless, they've got it all tacked down. If we're going to be real.

       The best way to shut something down is to portray it as a "tactic" of the left or right... that way you will fight it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the decentralized left... decentralized right... and independents... VS. The centralizing left and right.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is Jefferson vs Hamilton... Jackson vs. The Banks. No matter who calls for it, YOU get to select the Delegates with your state. You get to decide what happens at a convention far more than anything else you decide.

       The only problem is, a constitutional convention is like putting a band-aid on a cancerous mole. I have no idea what the answer is, but I'm a realist. Sucks...

       The realistic answer is that although we all may want to do this peacefully, those who hold the resources and the power will not give that up peacefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       This will end just as it always has throughout history... with a lot of violence and death.  The biggest thing that I see is that they are far more prepared than the public gives them credit for.  There is too much evidence that a vast network of underground bases exists to ignore.  If you think about it logically, you must be making plans (and calling it "continuity of government") to hide out in your underground "elysium" with your friends while you scorch the earth above you.

       Scary stuff, but I think we need to face the monster that we have allowed to get too powerful.

       You can rewrite the whole constitution at a convention. A convention has the same power as the original convention... by design...
      </p>
      <p>
       The convention called by the Senate is the second to last resort... and this has been called several times in the past... to end slavery and to give women the right to vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rough Draft is a guidebook to making sure the Convention doesn't get coopted by the elites. I fully expect that we will force a convention, as soon as we directly hone in on that goal. Once we do, every attempt will be made to scope it and to control the selection of the delegates... but that seriously won't work right now. The Fed has pissed off too many states and they will not send paper electors to a convention, or they will never be elected again, themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we do an end run around their star defensive line with a referendum... the blitz they don't expect. This gives us the same power as people in Switzerland, and I'll point out that Switzerland is Rich, Happy and consistently avoids war.

       I'm sure we can't repeal some laws, because the laws we want to repeal have to be repealed by those they benefit. It is a clear conflict of interest and that is precisely why we were given the opportunity to DIRECTLY modify the constitution. It is time :) Thx for comment.

       We don't just want to repeal or change laws that can just be changed back. We want fundamental changes to the Constitution that clarify it, and forbid such laws explicitly. NO PRIVATE CENTRAL BANKS... etcetera.
