    <div class="md"><p>did you watch the vid and not see what you were looking for? I think it gives a very good visual explanation of what you are looking for, an animated illustration is better than what words can do here. </p>

<p>ill try in words - in flat earth model sun is only about 3000 miles up. it circles over the world - usually directly above the equator but obvs with some variance. . one circle every 24 hours. the north pole is the center of the flat earth and antarctica is the outer rim. you can have all the observable sunlight variance we experience with this model - the video i sent you does good job of illustrating. </p>

<p>(btw - as long as we agree this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUrWIrz6atg&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUrWIrz6atg&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</a> is biggest problem we are facing right now - we are on the same side in big picture ) </p>

<p>Midnight Sun is the phenomenon where the sky is visible for 24 hours, low on the horizon. It happens on both north pole in march - september and in the South Pole from september to march.</p>

<p>All flat earth models make it impossible for this phenomenon to occur at the south pole, as well as permit days longer than 12 hours on southern latitudes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too bad you are done talking to me. It was so fun for me to talk to you!</p>

<p>That&#39;s interesting about the midnight sun, I had never heard of that phenomena before and I don&#39;t readily know the explanation. but maybe finding the explanation is the key to even greater understanding. so many things about the globe model are also impossible in the face of natural phenomena. there is such power in asking every question we can think of - something yet to be fully understood is very different and much more true than conventional wisdom on the matter, </p>

That started me looking into exactly who these powers are that could suppress <em>that</em> much monumental information.  That led to serious research into TPTB, the government, and the MIC apparatus responsible for such an absolutely monolithic coverup.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a &quot;theory&quot; for many.  It&#39;s a reality that&#39;s been directly experienced.  For those that have experienced, you have to ask why it is that there is such an absolutely <em>massive</em> push to ridicule the absolute truth of ET existence that many have experienced and <em>know</em> is real.</p>

<p>While sad and frustrating that so many individuals still don&#39;t understand how real the existence of ETs on and around this planet, solar system, galaxy, and cosmos is, it is also at least understandable.  We are sheep, and are generally so blind and ignorant to the phenomenon because it is being covered up by powers on this planet that are almost unimaginably powerful.</p>

<p>There&#39;s Dr. Steven Greer&#39;s Disclosure Project, amassing dozens of professionals in the civilian and military industrial sector that all came forward giving solid testimony regarding their experiences with ETs and ET craft - some of them also presenting schematics, charts, graphs, and radar reports of what they experienced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, it was JFK. I&#39;d heard crazy ideas about his death all while I was growing up in the 80s, and when I went off to a college-prep thing over the summer, I had to write a paper about a modern historical event. I chose JFK and the topic, which I was completely neutral about, &quot;did the CIA kill JFK?&quot; I started to look into what happened and was shocked by some of the oddities that no one ever talked about (like the shooter being on the FBI payroll after he returned from Russia) and so I ended up doing some original research. I took Ruby&#39;s evaluation to a psychologist who felt that the likelihood of his planning and executing the the shooting of Oswald was unlikely at best. If his evaluation was a matter of public record why did no one talk about this? If Oswald&#39;s payments from the FBI were a matter of public record why did no one talk about that?</p>

<p>The obvious conclusion for me was that we generally don&#39;t want to know. We paint in broad strokes over our history in order to comfort ourselves.</p>

<p>After that, I became a lot more incredulous about what I was told was going on. I assumed that powerful people like to hide what they do, and while I don&#39;t just accept any conspiracy theory because it tickles my confirmation bias, I&#39;m careful about what I believe in both directions.</p>

<p>I think the true conspiracy behind 9/11, for example, is often ignored by both sides. The US fostered an economic relationship with Saudi Arabia and a military relationship with the Mujahadeen that practically guaranteed 9/11. We ignored the first WTC bombing and the Cole bombing and carried on until we were smacked around by the reality, and even today we continue to ignore the ramifications of our actions in the Middle East. That&#39;s the real conspiracy, but it&#39;s not a sexy cloak and dagger conspiracy... it&#39;s just greedy, self-interested idiots blithely ignoring the consequences of their actions.</p>

<p>It was this very desire to question everything that eventually lead me to Freemasonry. Who are these guys and how does a social club last for 300+ years?! Once I began to understand what they really were (which is far from both the pedestrian view and the lizard-satanist conspiracy theories) I couldn&#39;t imagine not joining their ranks. Some of the most intelligent and skeptical conspiracy theorists I know are Freemasons, and the discussions over dinner sometimes range over every imaginable topic that would show up in this very sub. It&#39;s too bad that the conspiracy theory community has latched on to Freemasonry as a boogeyman. The truth is, as it usually is, much  more interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>for me too - after I figured out about 9/11 - I thought well what else is there I should be looking into - and I remembered moon landing talk - and I was like well I&#39;ll just look into it - and it a few hours I had to laugh, we never landed on the moon. blah, I can&#39;t undo that knowledge, all these years I though we did and now I know we didn&#39;t. it was really kind of funny - like - ha - good one generation before me. </p>

<p>but then so much that followed in my research wasn&#39;t as funny. tho every now and then it still is - like really bad crisis actors :) you just have to laugh about this stuff when you can imo. </p>
