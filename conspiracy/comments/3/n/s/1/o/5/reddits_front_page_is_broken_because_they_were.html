    <div class="md"><p>There are bastions here and there. Corbett Report and News Next Week are breaths of fresh air. I&#39;m subscribed to their YouTube channel and I always find myself pleased when new installments pop up.</p>

<p>The wild west is in the internet right now. Until the internet is shut down we still have free flow info. And even if it gets shut down darknet will likely happen. We&#39;ll end up with a combination of local networks and a sort of Johnny Mnemonic style of information distribution. Physical media might happen again if the internet goes.</p>

<p>Fortunately that&#39;s merely speculation as of this moment.</p>

<p>My only complaint is that my lazy ass doesn&#39;t have time to trawl the whole internet monthly to find out things I don&#39;t know that I don&#39;t know. The convenience that reddit was is more or less gone now. I&#39;ll have to find a new trawling site to spoon feed me whatever topical trash is being currently discussed so I can sort of know what the self-appointed rulers are doing lately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a common technique the globalist bankers, and all CEO&#39;s etc use to pass controversial changes.  Bring in someone new, change everything in a bad way, people hate the new boss, so you fire him and make a huge &quot;two minutes of hate&quot; out of it, and bring in someone new.  Make a few token concessions without actually fixing anything, and you placate the dumb masses who actually think the figurehead has any control over the policy.  Look at G W Bush for an example IMO.  So the owners of reddit knew they had to make changes, to make the site more marketable, to control content more, but they knew it would produce a huge backlash.  So they brought in this unstable, in debt and easily controllable ellen pao, and hyped up a bonfire of hate for her.  Seriously, 1984, two minutes of hate shit.  Then they fired her and pretended like that fixed everything, but they didnt actually change anything back, and everyone fell for it.  Youll see this technique everywhere</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit in its early days claimed to be a site for free speech. Well over time it became popular with the yoiger generation. You know the ones that usually don&#39;t vote or say anything cause they were told from a young age you go to school get good grades then go to college and then a good job and make a family die happy.</p>

<p>Well people are realizing now that is all bullshit. Thing is that reddit suppresses all counter arguments like news that goes against the grain. Such as reddit doesn&#39;t make money. </p>

<p>Yeah fucking lie cause someone is making money from reddit. They are making quite a lot too cause they are very very active in deleting content that shows the shitty side of the world. Its supposedly made to look like its more that you are wrong and shouldn&#39;t question your leaders.</p>

<p>The social justice warrior aspect is so damn strong within reddit that its killing it. This subreddit has been labeled by many as fucking retards. Rightfully so after some of the shit that&#39;s been done here. Like the SLC daycare thing.</p>

<p>Or when the guy posted all the info to those that lost a child at sandy hook. Just things that are sins of reddit cause for one when you strip someone of their annonimity online they lose their edge. </p>

<p>Many have alterior motives on reddit in this sub mainly I have noticed. See normal people don&#39;t just call others names and wish their children died in a car crash. Someone fucked with me once. </p>

<p>They said they were going to do what Hitler did to the Jews if I kept being a holocaust denier. Well my son is 6 and my responsibility to protect from harm. So I tracked the name thru reddit and other social media cause admin took 3 days to respond and only banned them. </p>

<p>So I called the local PD where they were gave them the name and forwarded them all the data I used to find them. Was some college kid. I hope I fucked his whole life up too. </p>

<p>This is what reddit promotes because most will just conform and behave. Some will not like myself. </p>

<p>Ellen pao was a scapegoat to usher in change to policy and take the heat. Soon as the rules were in place they brought in this new guy. He said oh new blood that will fix it all. Nothing has been done. Like shadow bans. That still happens. </p>

<p>Those that are in control of reddit don&#39;t want change for users cause we don&#39;t pay them. See we make the content by which they get paid. But we as a user base don&#39;t give them money. Advertisers do or those that wish to control narratives. </p>

<p>Look at all the admin that is gone now. Those were fair people. One of the shadow banned me even. Lost that name forever but she had her reasons I scared her and I shouldn&#39;t have. My bad. </p>

<p>They know what reddit is going to and they kept the core principals that the founders wanted. So they are gone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From article:</p>

<p>So, has something changed? Or is Reddit&#39;s algorithm breaking under the load of an ever-increasing user base?</p>

<p>&quot;Users have been complaining about the front page being stale, and they might be right,&quot; Steve Huffman, Reddit&#39;s CEO, told me in a phone interview. &quot;I&#39;ve noticed it too. We didn&#39;t change anything, but it feels slower.&quot;</p>

<p>...YA OK. Not only are the content creators leaving en masse hence LESS users, but &quot;we didn&#39;t change anything&quot;? Sorry not buying it. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Reddit&#39;s front page is &quot;broken&quot; because they were paid (off) by big news corps. to stop breaking news before them, in a bid to get more views.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just a hollow statement based on a feeling that the front page is still &quot;stale&quot;, and coupled with the sort of theory that arises out of someone&#39;s personal crusade rather than any evidence. If the person&#39;s personal crusade was anti-Zionism, that would be the cause. If it was illuminati stuff, then they&#39;d be the cause.</p>

<p>The theory makes no internal sense -- big news corporations will always be able to break news before reddit...if for no other reason than reddit generally links to MSM sources when posting the kind of breaking news we&#39;re talking about here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit in its early days claimed to be a site for free speech. Well over time it became popular with the yoiger generation. You know the ones that usually don&#39;t vote or say anything cause they were told from a young age you go to school get good grades then go to college and then a good job and make a family die happy.</p>

<p>Well people are realizing now that is all bullshit. Thing is that reddit suppresses all counter arguments like news that goes against the grain. Such as reddit doesn&#39;t make money. </p>

<p>Yeah fucking lie cause someone is making money from reddit. They are making quite a lot too cause they are very very active in deleting content that shows the shitty side of the world. Its supposedly made to look like its more that you are wrong and shouldn&#39;t question your leaders.</p>

<p>The social justice warrior aspect is so damn strong within reddit that its killing it. This subreddit has been labeled by many as fucking retards. Rightfully so after some of the shit that&#39;s been done here. Like the SLC daycare thing.</p>

<p>Or when the guy posted all the info to those that lost a child at sandy hook. Just things that are sins of reddit cause for one when you strip someone of their annonimity online they lose their edge. </p>

<p>Many have alterior motives on reddit in this sub mainly I have noticed. See normal people don&#39;t just call others names and wish their children died in a car crash. Someone fucked with me once. </p>

<p>They said they were going to do what Hitler did to the Jews if I kept being a holocaust denier. Well my son is 6 and my responsibility to protect from harm. So I tracked the name thru reddit and other social media cause admin took 3 days to respond and only banned them. </p>

<p>So I called the local PD where they were gave them the name and forwarded them all the data I used to find them. Was some college kid. I hope I fucked his whole life up too. </p>

<p>This is what reddit promotes because most will just conform and behave. Some will not like myself. </p>

<p>Ellen pao was a scapegoat to usher in change to policy and take the heat. Soon as the rules were in place they brought in this new guy. He said oh new blood that will fix it all. Nothing has been done. Like shadow bans. That still happens. </p>

<p>Those that are in control of reddit don&#39;t want change for users cause we don&#39;t pay them. See we make the content by which they get paid. But we as a user base don&#39;t give them money. Advertisers do or those that wish to control narratives. </p>

<p>Look at all the admin that is gone now. Those were fair people. One of the shadow banned me even. Lost that name forever but she had her reasons I scared her and I shouldn&#39;t have. My bad. </p>

<p>They know what reddit is going to and they kept the core principals that the founders wanted. So they are gone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a common technique the globalist bankers, and all CEO&#39;s etc use to pass controversial changes.  Bring in someone new, change everything in a bad way, people hate the new boss, so you fire him and make a huge &quot;two minutes of hate&quot; out of it, and bring in someone new.  Make a few token concessions without actually fixing anything, and you placate the dumb masses who actually think the figurehead has any control over the policy.  Look at G W Bush for an example IMO.  So the owners of reddit knew they had to make changes, to make the site more marketable, to control content more, but they knew it would produce a huge backlash.  So they brought in this unstable, in debt and easily controllable ellen pao, and hyped up a bonfire of hate for her.  Seriously, 1984, two minutes of hate shit.  Then they fired her and pretended like that fixed everything, but they didnt actually change anything back, and everyone fell for it.  Youll see this technique everywhere</p>
