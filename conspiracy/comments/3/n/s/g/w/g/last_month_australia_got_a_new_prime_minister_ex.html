       its quite comical really.   Usually they just find a puppet to act in their interests and fund them.  But this is the first instance i can recall of them cutting out the middleman and just doing it themselves.   It almost doesn't make sense though... What was wrong with the old system?  It seems like their interests are more protected when they can act through a proxy.  Acting this way out in the open i would think makes them vulnerable.  which leads to my question again: why risk it?  Is there something on the verge of happening where they can no longer fully trust a funded third party? (which would force them out of the woodwork to get shit done themselves?)

       Given Turnbull's history and orientation I'd imagine this is more like a monopolisation of the possibility. i.e. No free-range crypto-currencies allowed. But you are free to use our government endorsed currency.. et voila.. instant white paper and case-study...

       I had no idea that banks were making moves to enter the crypto-currency  market... That's ridiculous lol, as the whole idea of cryptocurrency is to cut central banks out of the equation...I think  there would have to be some sort of major world event to get the public on board with that, as it just seems so counter intuitive to what cryptocurrency stands for In the first place...

       It's not really ridiculous.. Just goes to show the power of building on block chain. Also, they do not need a public on board with it at all.. IMO the most likely scenario (or most imminent) is that they will launch a new pre-mined coin for interbank settlement that the public can't even access.

       Well, my thinking is that South-Western parts of South America will see little fighting, as Southern Andes don't have much in terms of resources (maybe except of the largest reserves of Lithium and some copper), land is quite arid, so it should be actually quite safe to move there.

       Whereas China and Japan would certainly go to war and there would be heavy battles. China holds a grudge over the Nanking massacre and the fact that Japan at one point took an almost total control of China (plus the US bases in Japan).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that south america would either be neutral (except for Brazil) or they would join the BRICS axis.

       Europe? Do you think Russia will ignore Europe, and the hundreds of US bases located here? If there is an all-out war, Baltic states, Germany, Austria Balkans will all get shat on.

       UK will most likely also get hit to some extent. Not sure about scandinavian countries, all but Sweden are part Nato, but they also form their own defense union. Spain, Portugal, France, Italy are all aligned with the US, so they're also endangered.

       I had no idea that banks were making moves to enter the crypto-currency  market... That's ridiculous lol, as the whole idea of cryptocurrency is to cut central banks out of the equation...I think  there would have to be some sort of major world event to get the public on board with that, as it just seems so counter intuitive to what cryptocurrency stands for In the first place...
