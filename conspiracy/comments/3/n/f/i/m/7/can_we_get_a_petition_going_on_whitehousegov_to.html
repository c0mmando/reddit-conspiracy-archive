    <div class="md"><p>The largest part of global terrorism is funded and enacted either directly or indirectly by the 5 permanent nations of the UN security council. The US is but one of these nations, although I agree that they take the lions share of  the blame for global terrorism.</p>

<p>The US is the largest exporter of weapons - and by this I mean the kind of weapons that somehow all these terrorist groups always seem to get their hands on.</p>

<p>The worst thing that could happen globally for these 5 nations is not having an enemy. Just ain&#39;t no money to be made from peace.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s not right to respond to terrorism by terrorizing other people. And furthermore, it&#39;s not going to help. Then you might say, &quot;Yes, it&#39;s terrorizing people, but it&#39;s worth doing because it will end terrorism.&quot; But how much common sense does it take to know that you cannot end terrorism by indiscriminately dropping bombs?&quot; -  Howard Zinn - Terrorism and War</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re kinda jumping the gun, or putting the cart before the horse.  The attack on the hospital in Afghanistan only happened what, a day or two ago?  As it stands there are a number of conflicting reports coming from that area, and it&#39;s going to take some independent investigation before we really know what happened.  Meaning that trying to prosecute the military for the attack would be a bad idea, since we&#39;re still not sure that the US was actually involved. (The Afghans claim it was one of their own helicopters that fired on the hospital.)</p>

<p>That&#39;d be like the movie &quot;Minority Report.&quot;  Prosecuting someone for a crime before you have evidence that they&#39;ve actually committed it.</p>
