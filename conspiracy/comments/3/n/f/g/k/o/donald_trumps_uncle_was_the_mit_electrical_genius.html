       youtube documentary i just happened to stumble on while searching for Trump news after having searched for Tesla previously and not erasing the search box.  Tesla was heavily into some alien quantum communication claims and if Trumps dad knew him then Trump might have had some future knowledge that helped him get rich. Remember in the Back to the Future movies (which have some weird 9/11 references as discussed here
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3nemq8/back_to_the_future_predicted_911/">

       -- Tesla's FBI file confirms on Jan 7th 1943, he had COMPLETED and PERFECTED Wireless Transmission of Electrical Power &amp; Death Ray/Peace Ray. FBI believes the notes, experiments, designs and formula were within Tesla's personal effects. FBI also knew that Tesla has conceived of a revolutionary type of Torpedo that is presently not in use by other nations. FBI confirms that Tesla's personal effects, safe, trunks, deposit box and storage unit had been pillaged by the FBI, John G Trump, Defense Department... The FBI still claims to this day that they don't have any of these documents other than what was given to the Department of Alien Property by 1953.

       By the way trumps uncle worked in the same field of high voltage electrostatics were others like tt brown in california in the 60's had already used to make disks fly witbout combustion motors and ehere he claimed to have been able to distort time.

       There is actually a lot on youtube for people you dont like torrents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the most interesting aee regualr people recresting things like "cold electricity" or "radiant electricity" in their garages. Radiant energy occupied all of teslas research after he discovered it becuase it so fascinated him. He completely dropped his interest in ac power which he had previously invented single handedly.  That tells you something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Radiant energy is whst happens when you send extremely short high voltage pulses into a system. It travels through wires without resistance and heat and travles faster than the speed of light (yeah i know.)  It SEEMS to be tapping into the quantum fikeds or "dark energy" or "simulataneous alternate universes" for pull power. If thst sounds far fetched rememberthat is exactly whst googles new quantum comouter is also supposdely doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is if you can start tapping into the parrallelime linees and universes that supoosedly exist then you can start to time travel within those different universes by jumping between their timelines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell we split the atom which seemed just as fantastic 70 yrs ago. Thsts almost 100 yrs ago.  If we have figured out how to sit space time somehow then it wouldnt surprise me.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just blows my mind that Trumps uncle  ws the guy who saw Teslas secret papers after tesla died. And did you see the top secret defense agency Trumps Uncle was involved with at MIT?  Those woukd have been the guys doing it if anyone was.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way the daughter of another leader in electrical research named thomas townsend browne also claims that she knew people i  he rfathers lab who were doing top secret stuff for the government thst were time traveling. Browne also worked with high voltage electricity. She actually did an ama on lr/conspiracy a while back and she spome of "time zones"

       Just like Tesla and just like Donald Trumps uncle John G. Trump.  Browne used it to make electric flying machines that ... Had saucer shapes..... People recreste a simple but worki g version of his work all the time for school science projects. Look up "high voltage lifters" on youtube to see small simple ones working.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems very high voltag ein very short pulses is the key to penetrating the fabric or space time and parallel universes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very advanced stuff, but, again, remember we split the atom over 70 years ago.

       You know the whple thing sounds so ridicumous but both the "back to the future predicted 9/11" youtube video (i know ot sounds ridiculous but just watch it)  and the fact that trumps friggin uncle just happened to be the one guy who saw teslas top secret papers is just so jaw dropping.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean REALLY if tomorrow Popular Science or Edward Snowden or someone else came out and said the military had been doing time travel would anyone REALLY be surprised for more than a few weeks?

       We have seen some pretty astounding technical achievements in our lifetime.

       Time travel would no longer  surprise me.

       And it would be logical that the first people to have done it were the ones in the family of the guy who got exclusive access to Teslacs papers.

       "Time travel" doesn't work the way you think about it does. Time is a one way street, so even if Tesla DID create a time travel device, it would be more like a real world fast forward device.

       We dont really know how time travel might work of it would work at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       We cant really make prediction aboit how something would work of we cant do it. We all travel in time now in only one direction. We dont know why.

       We have theories we think might be correct but the nature of time and gravity  are some of the less well understood things we pretend to understand :-)

       Plot twist: Trump's uncle gets access to whatever type of time travel technology. Maybe it's some sort of device that allows him to make observations of the future. Let's say it's just overall stuff... nothing too specific.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is tempted to take advantage of the knowledge he gains, but he knows that people are watching him. So he gives his
       <em>
        brother Fred
       </em>
       a few really helpful tips and tells Fred "Play it cool, take your time and don't get carried away with this thing."
      </p>
      <p>
       Fred does just that and becomes extremely wealthy over the following decades without arousing any suspicions. Then, just like the way Old Biff gives Young Biff the Sports Almanac in BTTF 3, he gives his favorite son Donald the benefit of his knowledge of the future. What's more, he gives Donald the same advice he was given by his brother.
      </p>
      <p>
       Play it cool, take your time and don't get carried away. But this time things are different. The younger Trump has played it cool and taken his time. But he's let himself get carried away with the power of his secret knowledge... and he's using it to become President.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would make such an awesome movie!
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd have to change the characters around a bit though, or Trump would sue your ass off.

       I know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its funny but i watch the youtube movie "back to the future predicted 9/11" thinking it would be stupid.
But i was a little freaked by some thing in it. Espdcially the robert zemekis movie the wire coming out exactly 30 yrs later when the star is dresssed exactly like marty mcfly.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the  i started wondering, if it was true, then  who would " the atomic kid " on the theater marque in back to the future be. And then wondered if hey maybe trump hadomething to do with the bomb since he and his parents were from that time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ironically i had just the previous few days earlier stumbled by accident onthe tesla trump weird conspiracy youtube vidoe which i didnt watch, and the  suddenly i DO watch it, and its saying trumps uncle was THE ONE PERSON connectdd to tesla. Now i know form a lot of research into reading his stuff and other stuff about ultra high short pulse voltages that THAT is how you trigger a lot of weird space time energy behaviors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iitz apretty quick leap to thi k that if uncle trump lesrned something about time travel from teslas papers then it would have been spread around to the family and of course trump did getinto casinos and he always says his timing is very very good.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean its kind of funny but it sure fits IF such a thing happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly so if he has a time machine then he would probably be a pretty good guy for the usa to have running the country becuase je wpuld have an advantage over other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds funny but its logical IF tesla actually had something in his last papers about time trav that was discovered by John G. Trump.

       Not so sure about that. Why? For one thing, Donald Trump got a pretty good start when he inherited $40 million from his dad Fred way back in the 1970's.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read an article recently where someone did some calculations. What would happen if you took the same $40 mil and just invested in a fund that performed as well as the stock market average. It turns out that $40 million invested in 1975 would be worth about $3 billion today. Which is the same as Trump is supposed to be worth.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this is guy who likes to toot his own horn, but he hasn't done any better than the stock market average? So what that means is that Fred Trump was the real success story.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is that Donald Trump has spent his adult life trying to outshine his dad. It's hard to say what their relationship was like. But I have no doubt that Donald Trump's relationship with his father was a huge influence on what kind of man he turned out to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, thanks for mentioning the Trump/Tesla connection. I never heard that one before. And I'll have to check out The Wire sometime. Sounds interesting!

       A lot of people got into real estate in the 70 and 80 and went big and the  bankrupt when the tide turned. If you didnt k ow whenthe tax laws were going to be chaged in 86 the  you got into too much debt and co struction nad lost huge fortunes.  Trammel Crow from texas for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump did do well on trump tower.
He did well on the plaza hotel.
He did well over seas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although trump casino kept his name he got out before it had problems in new jersey.
      </p>
      <p>
       He did have good timing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now a lot of it came from simply seeing the obviius. If you look at his old videos on youtube about the economy etc going back to the 80's you can see .
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, there is no denying that being the guy picked to see Teslas papers after his death  was a VERY big deal. And IF theresas something there John G Trump would have been the guy to find out first and his brother would have had the money to do something with the knowledge.

       Although that was at least partly a joke, Bush seemed to me to be a mining-and-oil hand-puppet.  I've wondered for quite a while when engineering-based businesses, e.g. power, gizmos, IT, would step up to the plate as it were, to try to install one of their own.
