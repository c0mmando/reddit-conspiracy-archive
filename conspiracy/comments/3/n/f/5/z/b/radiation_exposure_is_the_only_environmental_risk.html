       Good question, but do understand that these folks are, by definition, part of the propaganda machine. I doubt we're going to get much incriminating information from them.

         A new and terrifying 9/11 conspiracy has hit the news. We are now confronted, not only with startling proof that 9/11 was a “nuclear event,” but that there have been thousands of unreported deaths in New York, radiation cancers and nearly 70,000 being kept alive with experimental stem cell therapy and physically devastating “chemo.”
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Officials would not give a breakdown of cancer victims, but 10,800 downtown workers make up the second-largest group of registered claimants after 39,500 Ground Zero responders. There are another 16,600 in smaller categories such as residents, students, child-care and health-care workers.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       70,000 people have cancer now because they had to keep this information buried. Simple iodide tablets could have prevented much of this.

       Thyroid cancer specifically? Or just cancer? And 70,000 people out of how many that were exposed?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edited, after rereading the "article" (which I don't even want to call it that since it's about as journalistic as some random blogger), it looks like there are that many
       <em>
        claims
       </em>
       not necessarily that many cases of cancer even.

       Yeah, the "article" said that. It was wrong. It's assuming all 70,000 claims were for cancer, which is not the case if you look into the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of those cancers in the pdf you linked
       <em>
        may
       </em>
       be radiologic. They also have other causes. You started off here specifically discussing one type of cancer which you claimed can only be caused by radiation (but can also be caused by one of the components of jet fuel), and now you've switched gears to "all this cancer must be from the radiation."
      </p>
      <p>
       If you could take a look at the matter with an open mind, rather than assuming by default that you're right and radiation caused everything, and you might realize that there are other plausible scenarios. Perhaps even more plausible.

        The cancer is multiple myeloma. Victims are told they got it from breathing “toxic soup” from 9/11, mostly drywall dust. The number of victims who have thus far applied for benefits from the 2.7-billion-dollar 9/11 fund, as reported in the New York Post story, that number is 69,900.

       And your "article" is wrong again, as there are a number of environmental factors that have been linked to multiple myeloma, including
       <a href="http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/intheworkplace/benzene">
        benzene
       </a>
       . Which almost certainly would have been present in the WTC fires. A quick Google search shows other possible environmental factors, and will also show that this is another type of cancer that firefighters are much more prone to than the general public.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... yeah. A Big fire with lots of smoke is bad for you. Who'd have thunk?
      </p>
      <p>
       And once again, you've quoted the "article" conflating the ~70,000 claims number as meaning 70,000 cases of cancer. Only now it's even more wrong, because it means one specific type of cancer, apparently, and is blatantly wrong about what may or may not cause that one particular type of cancer. Congratulations on finding such an amazing source.

       <em>
        for something

       doesn't, by default, mean that said medical claim is
       <em>

       70,000 pieces of fruit were purchased. Some of the fruit were probably apples. Some of the fruit were probably other kinds of fruit, such as oranges and bananas and pears and grapes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you going to try to tell me I don't know the difference between an apple and a banana?

       Furthermore, your whole assertion is beyond ridiculous. People don't go to the doctor all "I think I have leukemia from 9/11." This sort of "argument from the absurd" is another tactic straight out of the forum spies guide, BTW.

       This is how I imagine your thought process must go:

      <blockquote>

        Herpa derp. I'm gonna get all angsty because you won't answer my absurd question (even though you pretty much already did) that's based on something you didn't even say in the first place (because I can't read so good) and I've been ignoring nearly every argument and counterpoint you've made this whole time so I obviously have a high horse to sit on.
       </p>
       <p>
        Oh, and I couldn't even man up and admit fault when I was proven wrong earlier. And apologize for it? Psh. I'm too high and mighty.
       </p>
       <p>
        But maybe if I post this question enough, he'll answer it. Again. Like he already has. Twice.
       </p>
       <p>
        Or maybe if I annoy him enough with absurd shit like this, he'll just go away and I can pretend I won and pat myself on the back like I usually do.

       By "that website" I meant "cancer.org". The same one you just linked. When I linked it earlier you cried "propaganda" about it. Yet it's OK for you to use it?

       Your preconception is that thyroid cancer at WTC must have come from nuclear detonation. Your idiotic ad hoc is that thyroid cancer only comes from radiation if not genetic in nature. You prove that your ad hoc is idiotic through not knowing what exactly an environmental cause is. Therefore, everything you have to say on this topic can be ignored because your scholarship is poor.

       You have the positive claim, good sir. Feel free to give us usable evidence of it. You know, something better than 'thyroid cancer is caused by nukes so it must've been a nuke.' When the reality is, literally thousands of things cause thyroid cancer.

       It's possible that some of these claims are bullshit - maybe some people are sick for some other reasons, maybe they aren't sick at all and are trying to defraud the government.  Who knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       But of those who are legitimately sick due to 9/11 they might be filing health claims because a piece of debris fell on their head.  They might be filing claims because they breathed in a lot of smoke and have a respiratory problem.  They might be filing complaints because they have lung or thyroid cancer.

       Does this make sense to you?

       Dude gasoline will give you hella cancer. Benzene is universally recognized as a carcinogen that causes, among other cancers, multiple myeloma. (which if you haven't forgotten is the type of cancer you were harping about a few posts ago).

       That is the perhaps the dumbest propaganda piece I've seen, other than the "jet fuel causes cancer" book that guy posted a while back. The whole nation is at risk every time they fill up!
      </p>
      <p>
       And is the implication that gasoline and/or jet fuel splashed all over the WTC responders and 70,000 NYC residents? Or that they all climbed up the building and breathed in the fumes for an hour before they burned out?

       Lots of hydrocarbons cause cancer, including many components of jet fuel and gasoline. You're at risk breathing in gasoline fumes, but unless you're huffing it, you're not greatly multiplying your lifetime cancer risk at the pump.
      </p>
      <p>
       PAH's are a class of especially carcinogenic compounds that are found in all kinds of processed fossil fuels.

       So is the implication here that WTC workers and 70,000 NYC residents ran up to the 90th floor and huffed fumes for an hour? Because as I recall, the fires had mostly burned themselves by the time the buildings were demolished.

       Dude. You said that gasoline doesn't cause cancer. My contribution to the discussion was to demonstrate that you were incorrect in that assertion. Don't go moving the goalposts now. Just admit you were wrong about the one thing and we can move forward from there.

       I have a B.S. in math. 1100% absolutely exists. It means 11 times the original. Here's a function I hope you're familiar with:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_change_and_difference#Examples">
        percent difference
       </a>
       . Here, you'll recognize that we can have percentages 1) larger than 100% and 2) less than 0%. These refer to percent changes, rather than "part of something". Using the "%" symbol as a measure of
       <em>
        relative
       </em>
       difference is perfectly acceptable, since you're scaling your reference sample out of 100. Hence, anything that differs by more than a factor of two is captured by percentages outside the bounds of 0% and 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what kinds of statisticians you're communicating with (probably none), but I've never seen one avoid a percentage above 100, and if they do, it's certainly not because it "doesn't exist".

       1100% literally means 1100 per cent...per hundred....divided by 100. 1100% therefore equals 1100/100 = 11

       No worries, it gets it more exposure among the Reddit-savvy. Still, calling it out is part of the game.

       Dude. You said that gasoline doesn't cause cancer. My contribution to the discussion was to demonstrate that you were incorrect in that assertion. Don't go moving the goalposts now. Just admit you were wrong about the one thing and we can move forward from there.
