       Maybe I'm going a bit "tin foil hat" here, but if there's a place to go a bit "tin foil hat" I guess it's here.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I bet a lot of people here had read "1984", a George Orwell dystopian political romance. In the book, The Big Brother represents the government, and there's a "traitor" called Emmanuel Goldstein, that points out the tirany of the surveillance state - the Telescreen hear and sees everything you do and the Thinking Police can read your toughts. He is hated and loved at the same time (double thinking) by the population. The government seems to incentive those feelings on people, so they think there's an actual resistance and fell the need for a savior. But the thing is that the resistence is fabricated so they can arrest people trying to join it somehow. Even the existence of Emmanuel Goldstein and the reach of the surveillence system is a doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other hand, government is fighting a non stop war, and the enemy is aways changing. That's a strategy to, again, raise the fear among the population, and, at the same time, profit and accelerate economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe George Orwell knew something about our time. I was reading the novel again and all I could think about was USA/Israel as Big Brother, Edward Snowden and Julian Assange as Emmanuel Goldstein, the NSA as the surveillence system and Terrorism as the aways changing enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I overthinking the book?

       George Orwell was a student of Aldous Huxley (author of Brave New World). Both men were part of "elite" society and based their masterworks on what they saw on the inside.
       <a href="http://geopolitics.co/2015/04/23/huxleys-letter-to-orwell-regarding-1984/">
        This is a note from Huxley to Eric Blair (George Orwell) about 1984
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Huxley's grandfather was a eugenicist named TH Huxley and a member of the Bilderberg Group of that time, The Rhodes Round Table. Another member of the Rhodes Round table was HG Welles, who was the first person to coin the term
       <a href="https://www.voltairenet.org/IMG/pdf/Wells_New_World_Order.pdf">
        The New World Order
       </a>
       and wrote a book about it. Aldous Huxley recounted staying up late and eavesdropping on conversations between his grandfather and Welles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brave
       <strong>
        New World
       </strong>
       is literally Huxley's idea of what the world would be like if a "New World Order" was established. If you are further interested in this, check out

       . Welles also wrote the

       I've read Brave New World, nice book. But i think the world discribed on it is not as frightening as our actual world today, so I found the Orwell romance more accurate in that matter. And the double thinking concept is another thing 1984 got on point. People know the government is lying, but at the same time there is a second thought, that emerges from fear to be caught by the all seem eye, that is stronger and suppress the first one. 
But ill search about that brand new world revised and that Open conspiracy.thanks for your info!

       Your mistake is in searching for a black or white answer. Orwell is not the answer. Huxley is not the answer. The grey reality is somewhere between them.

       Your right on the ball, but, remember there's no real difference between "Oceania", "Eurasia", and "Eastasia" (NATO, Russia, and China). It's all the same. If you ask me it's a staged cycle; they'll have some measure of World War III, but it will not play out how we're thinking right now. Something prophetic, cyclical, and supernatural is going to occur; possibly the exposure of aliens, or "others" (humans underground) to the public psyche. I have a feeling this will be enough to push the masses into their ritual destruction, once they're ideas of reality have been utterly obliterated. The Party will then clean up the mess and start over.

      <p>
       "Orwell himself wrote in 1946, "Of course I intended it primarily as a satire on the Russian revolution..[and] that kind of revolution (violent conspiratorial revolution, led by unconsciously power hungry people) can only lead to a change of masters [-] revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert."[47] In a preface for a 1947 Ukrainian edition, he stated, "... for the past ten years I have been convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement. On my return from Spain [in 1937] I thought of exposing the Soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages."

      <p>
       'The first edition of the Ukrainian language at the same time the novel was first translated into another language. It  issued 1947 the publishing house "Prometheus" in Munich. Ukrainian version of the dystopian novel was addressed thousands of Ukrainian "displaced persons" that after the Second World War ended in occupied Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
       Orwell write a preface to the Ukrainian edition. Orwell had paid money for the Ukrainian edition. From the correspondence publishers learned that about 1,500 copies of the edition of the novel was confiscated by the American occupation authorities in Munich and in agreement submitted  to Soviet occupation administration.'!!

        It's literally on the U.S. Seal:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         E pluribus unum
        </em>
        —Latin for
        <strong>
         <em>
          "Out of many, one"
         </em>
        </strong>
        (alternatively translated as
        <strong>
         <em>
          "One out of many"
         </em>
        </strong>
        or
        <strong>
         <em>
          "One from many"
         </em>
        </strong>
        )—is a phrase on the Seal of the United States, along with
        <em>
         Annuit cœptis
        </em>
        (Latin for
        <strong>
         <em>
          "He/she/it approves (has approved) of the undertakings"
         </em>
        </strong>
        ) and
        <em>
         Novus ordo seclorum
        </em>
        (Latin for
        <strong>
         <em>
          "New Order of the Ages"
         </em>
        </strong>
        ), and adopted by an Act of Congress in 1782.

       The whole thing is very informative, but I linked the pertinent part for you. Mark Passio's work is very interesting; you might consider watching other pieces of his talks. Anyway, you're not overthinking anything.

       and
       <em>
        A Brave New World
       </em>
       were just teasers for the public of what is to come.
