    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand how anyone can be a conspiracy theorist without realizing that religion was the original conspiracy. Not trying to be condescending at all, but it was divorcing myself from the cult of spirituality/religion that came before i was able to see the cult of government and divorce myself from that. </p>

<p>I guess I just don&#39;t understand how some people figure it out in reverse. Religion is something that they (TPTB) give you to sate people. Opiate of the masses and all. That&#39;s how governments get people to trust them, they pretend to believe in the same things. That&#39;s how they get people to fight in wars- they say that god wants it. That&#39;s how they get people to follow rules when the police aren&#39;t around- they let you think that god is watching. </p>

<p>Never forget the history of government if you want to understand its function. Same with religion. Just trace religion back and it becomes clear that all religions were started by hucksters. </p>

<p>Once upon a time a man went into a cave that no one had ventured into. Came out and told all the people in his tribe that there were magical beings in there. Spirits. Told them that they demanded sacrifice. Told them that only he could speak to the spirits, and that they would kill anyone else who dared enter. </p>

<p>The people didn&#39;t believe him, but were still hesitant to enter.... just in case. As luck would have it, lightning struck their little... enclave that very night. The people did not have science, did not understand what caused such things. Ever the opportunist, the Joker told them that it was the spirits. Not knowing the truth, the more gullible among the tribe started giving the Joker offerings to bring into that cave of spirits, to supplicate for mercy. </p>

<p>And so the Joker began stockpiling his treasure trove. </p>

<p>And so religion was born. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t evangelize, but I don&#39;t hide my Christianity either. It frustrates me that so many so-called &quot;Christians&quot; do not reflect the spirit of Christ, but that&#39;s what religion too often does; make people lose the trees for the forest. </p>

<p>Religion is indeed a conspiracy of sorts, but I doubt it&#39;s the oldest. But spiritual faith is grounded in something much deeper and more profound. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about religion, about all spirituality... it cripples you.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to say something super harsh and then I&#39;m going to drop it because I don&#39;t want to be that asshole and I don&#39;t really care to deconvert anyone.</p>

<p>By their fruits ye shall know them, INDEED. So, what does spirituality/religion teach people to do? To pray for help. To meditate. To have faith that things will in fact get better.</p>

<p>this is the part where I make an ass of myself: All your prayers, all your meditations, and all your faith accomplishes absofuckinglutely NOTHING other than to keep you sedentary, keep you waiting, and most symbolic of all- <strong>keep you on your knees</strong>. And that&#39;s right where they want you.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what makes it so useful to TPTB. </p>

<p>Just consider this- all forms of spirituality, the whole concept is very simply based on one idea- the idea of a higher power than one&#39;s self. A higher power that you should submit to. There is nothing that TPTB want more than to have you believe in submitting to a higher authority. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, yes. Faith without works. And what are those works? They&#39;re outlined for you, it doesn&#39;t refer to doing what <em>you</em> have rationalized as the correct thing, it&#39;s what is dictated to you as correct behavior. It&#39;s taking it entirely out of context to ever think that means come to your own conclusions and act upon them. They&#39;re called &quot;commandments&quot; for a reason. Sure, some of them may <em>seem</em> benign, but do you really need anyone to tell you not to murder? </p>

<p>I know the bible well. I wanted to be a theologian when I was young, I went apeshit on studying religion. Do you know what they say about the devil? (Not in the bible) They say he tells 10 truths and a lie. So sure, they will tell you good things, but they will sneak in poison. Mayhaps you consider the 10 commandments to be wholly virtuous. (I don&#39;t, but that&#39;s a different debate) Okay, accept those as 10 truths but don&#39;t forget that the bible also teaches to render under Caesar. There&#39;s your lie. Everything else may make you feel good, but there&#39;s always that small detail that corrupts it. A.K.A. God is the big picture; the devil is in the details.</p>

<p>Depending on what religion you belong to, those &quot;acts&quot; may include anything from paying a tax (tithing) on all your money to killing all people who don&#39;t believe the same as you. But really, it&#39;s whatever those in charge of your religion say you should do.</p>

<p>And when you&#39;re done with those acts, it&#39;s back to your knees. Bow and prostrate yourself before your god. Have faith that as long as you do what the higher power tells you to do, it will all be okay in the end. And if you feel as though things are not getting better.... well that&#39;s okay, because you&#39;ll get your just due in the next life anyway, amirite?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, no. First, you don&#39;t know <em>what</em> I&#39;ve rationalized. Second, I hear you. But submission is a part of life. Who do you submit to? I submit to the idea of a Creator Spirit, I submit to love as a policy. I submit to my shortcomings. Christ isn&#39;t procedural. He&#39;s empowering. Power over fear, hate, over shame, even.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a believer, but that being said, let&#39;s look at this from an outsider, almost Darwinian perspective.</p>

<p>First, there is strength and even logic in kneeling. When I say that, I don&#39;t mean to sound like I&#39;m pushing flower-power or anything like that, but science has proven time and again that meditation and prayer are excellent for your overall health, personally. People who spend quiet time alone with their thoughts or praying for others/to a higher authority have less stress, and live longer and ultimately happier lives. For me, it&#39;s not an ends to itself, but for many maybe it should be based on evidence alone. Hell, the single demographic on the planet with the longest life expectancy is Catholic nuns (that may also have a scientific explanation in the fact that they don&#39;t procreate so their bodies don&#39;t burn out like the rest of ours, but again, it&#39;s not an ends to itself). </p>

<p>Secondly, the reason why organized religion is spurned, ridiculed and attacked by governments is twofold: faceless organizations like that fear what they cannot understand, and they certainly can&#39;t understand and are afraid of what they see when they look into a church on Sunday - masses of otherwise intelligent people all kneeling and praying before an imaginary friend. Even worse (for them)? It&#39;s an imaginary friend that stands in the way of what they perceive to be progress, and whose adherents will defend with zeal when confronted with opposing views.</p>

<p>Kneeling may seem like a fruitless exercise, especially on an individual level, wasting both our time and privilege. But it&#39;s not even that so many of us kneel; it&#39;s that when so many of us that do stand up, it creates an earthquake to TPTB - forcing them to either play their hand or back down and lose any of the initiative they&#39;ve carefully cultivated in the shadows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely understand where you&#39;re coming from. Lately I&#39;ve been considering that religion killed our spirituality. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been asking myself: If religions wanted to kill other types of spirituality, what was so dangerous about them?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s important to ponder philosophical and spiritual questions. I earnestly believe having a strong sense of both brings about the best questions. If you study and read about the personal lives of many famous scientists, you&#39;ll find that many of them were deeply religious/spiritual even if they defies the Orthodox Church! It&#39;s an idea that runs counter to our modern understanding of what a scientist should be or is...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, spirituality <em>is</em> religion. There is organized religion and there is spirituality- which is just disorganized religion. Whatever the case may be, no one is born believing in spirits. There&#39;s nothing innate about it. We are taught to believe in such things. And the people who teach us to believe in such things do so to control us.</p>

<p>And then some people eschew the organized religion and instead wander off in search of their own spirituality. They think because they&#39;ve designed their own spirits that they&#39;re any less fraudulent than the mainstream ones. Have you (not you personally) forgotten so soon who taught you to believe in spirits, and to what end? </p>

<p>Whatever books of spirituality one may read, did not <em>somebody</em> stand to gain money from that book, however fictitious it may be?</p>

<p>As for historical scientists- yes, many of them did believe in different forms of spirituality. And yes, that runs counter to how we perceive the modern scientist to be.</p>

<p>But uh, that&#39;s because modern science answered a lot of questions that were unanswered back in the day. And, WAY back in the day, we didn&#39;t even have the scientific method. And even after we developed that method, there were a lot of famous scientists who were fucking murdered for <em>heresy</em> or <em>witchcraft</em> so its extremely naive and/or disingenuous to presume that all scientists who claimed to be spiritual were actually spiritual. I&#39;m sure there were plenty who simply did not want to be murdered. Because a lot of scientists and philosophers got killed when their acts ran contrary to the will of the church/state. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s the will of the church/state to keep people believing in the spiritual, in this other-world. It keeps people behaving. </p>

<p>I agree that it&#39;s important to ponder all things philosophical. But to me, spiritual= fictional. There is nothing fictional which is inherently more worthwhile to consider than anything else which is fictional which means that <em>nothing</em> fictional is actually worth considering. Truth is worth considering, and there&#39;s a sea of fiction to wade through to get to truth. </p>

<p>Why waste more time considering lies than you have to? It only holds one back from discovering more truth- our time alive is limited. The amount of true knowledge we can gain is not. </p>

<p>TPTB would definitely prefer you to waste your life away praying, meditating, <em>considering</em> things that are not real, that have no real impact or influence on the world than they would for you to learn truths.</p>

<p>The main point that I think I should address here is that you&#39;re saying all spirituality is dictated. </p>

<p>My personal meditation is not dictated to me. There are methods you can utilize, but ultimately it&#39;s a very personal practice. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want there to be a misunderstanding between us. I don&#39;t wish to argue semantics at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The very danger of the word &quot;spiritual&quot; is that it means a different thing to everyone who uses it, but to 99% of people using it, it represents their own irrational beliefs. </p>

<p>Yes, one could use it in an entirely secular and metaphorical way- ie the spirit of bravery! but at the end of the day, it is a word that is used to deceive the human race. it&#39;s also frequently used in self-deception... much like drugs and sex, spirituality is generally just another form of escapism. And so the problem is that because everyone interprets the meaning differently, for anyone to use the word, to promote the idea of spirituality- is to affirm in all who hear their <em>own</em> interpretation of the word... their own irrational beliefs. </p>

<p>Again, this isn&#39;t to suggest that you using it means you have irrational beliefs, but it will help to reaffirm the beliefs of those who do. And pretty much everyone who believes in spirituality is believing in something unique but irrational. </p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of like using the word God to describe the universe. Well, why use the word God at all? It carries such strong implications and to use God to describe something other than deities is to corrupt the word past its original usage to the point of rendering the word itself useless. </p>

<p>The purpose of language is to convey specific meaning, so when a word no longer means the same thing to everyone who hears it... </p>

<p>To be fair, I&#39;m more concerned with &quot;spiritual&quot; than &quot;spirit&quot;. Spirits can also be drinks. But spiritual conveys a strong theological meaning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither. I&#39;ve always been comfortable not knowing and admitting all religion is as possible as the next. However conspiracy theories don&#39;t really drive me to be religious. Some people just need religion to feel safe and to feel like everything will be alright. I don&#39;t get it, but to each their own. I think organized religion is a tool for manipulation and control. I am spiritual but at the same time there could be nothing spiritual and I may only like being a good person because it makes me feel good and I know it&#39;s right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Raised in liberal family. Went to Christian school(for non-religious subjects) but became a purist Muslim after seeing 9/11 and Iraq war because what I was taught didn&#39;t match to the real world not only in West but also in Islam. </p>

<p>To me the draw to Islam was based on eschatological insights our scriptures it has. The predictions in Islamic scripture I studied in parallel with Western, Oriental and Russian sources. Basically the Islamic scholar would say something, I try to verify it with external sources mostly Western mainly alternative sites. </p>

<p>One thing I have learned only take side with truth no matter where it comes from, not only Muslim source but also Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Atheist, etc.</p>

<p>The best prediction is this verse from Quran:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Oh you who have faith, do not take (such) Jews and (such) Christians as your Awliah (friends and allies) who (themselves) are Awliyah (friends and allies) of each other. And whoever amongst you turn to them for friendship and alliance, would belong to them (and therefore not to us). Surely Allah does not provide guidance to a people who commit Dhulm.&quot; -  <a href="http://www.imranhosein.org/articles/understanding-islam/550-a-commentary-to-maulana-imran-hoseins-interpretation-of-the-verse-.html">http://www.imranhosein.org/articles/understanding-islam/550-a-commentary-to-maulana-imran-hoseins-interpretation-of-the-verse-.html</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is important because Christian and Jews were never friend of each other until last century when Zionist made alliance with Neocon Christians and also since Wahabi Muslims made alliance with them this really sums up the current state of affairs of the world. </p>
