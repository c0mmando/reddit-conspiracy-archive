       As odd as it sounds, I truly feel the pain of all those in the past who have stood up against TPDB and been ostracized and demonized by society. Sometimes when trying to politely convey the knowledge I've gathered to people, it just becomes downright exhausting. This is especially true when dealing with my parents generation (baby boomers). Now I know, many of them have indeed woken up and fought alongside the younger generation against tyranny. However, a lot of them are BEYOND convinced that it's impossible for people in power to be so evil. They believe if someone is in power now, they worked their way there through hard work and perseverance. If you questions the established code, you're just a lazy outcast who is just mad things didn't go there way.
      </p>
      <p>
       As sad as it sounds, I've literally broken down sobbing by myself late at night because I just couldn't say the right words to wake someone up and they lashed out at me. I couldn't be more serious and sincere when I say, I'm just trying to help.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can anyone relate?

       I can totally relate to you on one level.  On another, however, I just say "fuck'em".  Simple as that.  Either they get it or they don't.  If you do get it, then awesome.  Hop on aboard.  Let's collaborate and mix ideas.  If you don't get it, then hop on aboard anyway and lets talk about it.  Maybe you can enlighten me.  Maybe I can enlighten you.  If you don't get it and don't WANT to get it, then that's all good.  You go on your path.  Peace.  If you want to try to be a troll and make fun of me because I think differently than you, then I'll just as soon as say "fuck you, asswipe" and not let you make me doubt what know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just keep educating yourself.  Keep gathering knowledge for yourself.  Keep accruing information.  Change your perspectives and world views as the evidence and information dictates.  Follow the research and evidence, ultimately.  If others don't get it, that's there problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       A big key in all of this is that you have to be
       <em>
        strong
       </em>
       .  You have to know from the jump that we live in a world where people - sometimes your very closest friends and family - may literally alienate you because some of the things you think or feel might scare them or be too much for them.  Be ready for that from the
       <em>
        jump
       </em>
       .  Be good and be kind to people, but stand up for yourself and know that the REASON you're looking into what you're looking into is because you're trying to get to the TRUTH of what the hell's going on on this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other's might not be as interested in investigating what's really going on in their world, and might even be hostile to getting their comfortable world view challenged.  They'd rather remain relaxed and comfortable but deeply ignorant, manipulated by the contrived world they (we) live in, rather than to get out of their comfort zone, but vastly increase their level of knowledge and understanding by getting closer to the
       <em>
        truth
       </em>
       of what's really going on on this planet.  If that's how they are, then so be it.  That's on them.  Again, fuck'em.

       Dear Frustrated OP -
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you considered the idea that You,trying to awaken people, is essentially a Sales job?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you qualified your prospect?  Do you know anything about them, or is it a "cold call"?
      </p>
      <p>
       What's your opening line?  How's your presentation? How are your speaking/social skills? Are you simple, clear and focused in your pitch?  Are your encounters with people merely lectures from you, or are they an open-ended conversation between two adults?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also to be considered is the "1 in 10" sales theory.  For every one person you pitch, one will buy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lower your expectations, and learn to communicate more effectively.  You'll be much happier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck to you, Sir.

       It's definitely a numbers game.  However, as that one person learns the truth, he also becomes a recruit as a "salesman".  The numbers slowly increase exponentially.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also to be considered is the delayed reaction.  I've spoken with people who flat-out refuse to accept the truth, then approach me years later with a solid understanding.  Sometimes it takes a while for the shell to crack.  It may take another person, perhaps another friend, a co-worker, or a complete stranger, to bring it up in conversation, before they are able to grasp it.

       Best advice here. I had similar issue as OP with my parents, specifically my mom. She always goes off on some strawman tangent whenever we talk about anything political. Some people are a lost cause, simple as that. Stay calm, plant an idea in their head, and let them marinate on it. If they're willing to change they will, but sometimes no matter what you say they won't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've thrown cold, hard numbers at my mom countless times but sometimes even facts aren't enough to change peoples minds. In fact, this may make them believe their original ideas even more. People instinctively and unconsciously want to be correct and being proven wrong will set off a backfire effect, like the opposite of a confirmation bias. It's human nature, there's nothing you can do to fix it.

       Had a unique experience growing up. My father 1960's  had his Religion and Politics ensnared in his Business.
      </p>
      <p>
       When my father recognized that his religion didn't mesh with his politics nor his work ethic He Bugged the Fuck Out.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was the mid sixties that it hit and the late sixties that he went Off Grid, sorta!
      </p>
      <p>
       My father was an awesome person. He built the head Quarters of IBM, for S&amp;H Green Stamps, Zales Jewelry Stores all over the  South and we 7 kids traveled and caught water moccasins and learned about frogs, turtles and life.
      </p>
      <p>
       He had his second heart attack after 9/11. Couldn't make it to my moms funeral, ticket in hand.

       It becomes Exhausting to me that the Youth fail see their Elders that were awake and the generation that follows.

       There are some people that will actually think about what you tell them. Those are the people that your effort isn't wasted on. Everyone else has wall put up. No matter what you tell them it wont work. Don't waste your energy and time on them. One day they might see.
      </p>
      <p>
       One tip from me when convincing people the world is a steaming pile of shit: Tell them to entertain the ideas that you preach. If someone is cool with Israel and you have something bad to say about that country you're going to hit one of their mental blocks or walls and the defense is up. Continuing the conversation will likely be a waste of time because they will just shoot it down immediately. 
Ask them specifically to entertain the idea and then continue talking. If they genuinely do what you ask, you've planted seed in their mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Self discovery is key here. You cannot force people to see the big picture. It has to be willful and come from inside them. This idea you've given them might be their catalyst

       Can totally relate. The best advice I've come across is to just say one-liners here and there, and then let it rest. If they're interested, they will take it in and it will make them ask questions. If they don't, they wouldn't care anyway so there's no use in telling them that stuff.
      </p>

       You just have to accept that about 10% of humanity is just convinced it is correct and cannot be told otherwise.

       My analogy is like taking a friend to ski for the first time,  You don't bring them to the top of the mountain first run, you take them on the kiddy hill.  Otherwise, they will shit their pants if you take them to the top of the mountain too quickly.  Baby steps and seed planting. Ask questions.  Get people to think about it on their own.  That's all I got.

       Came to the conclusion that many people don't want anything else to fret about. They care about their bank balance and if the lights keep on as well as shit flows down the toilet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have given up on being the one that wakes people up. Let them sleep. Means one less person I will have to worry about. Easier that way I promise. Pretty sure shit will hit the fan and if it comes down to primal survival then just let them all kill each other and I will use them for fertilizer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly why does the rest of the world matter to you? Do you have any idea how many people there is on this planet? Not the number what that is in a measurement you can visualize?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its fucking crazy. With even 75% that's enough for the species to make it. Quit taking on the worlds problems. Just live your life the best you can. Make a difference if possible. Have a kid teach them. See if you can change something for the better.

       This subreddit will chew you up and shit you out. There are so many people in here or bots that sole reason is to bring misery. Remember this. All of reddit is entertainment. Like TV after dinner. None of this shit means a fuckin thing.

      <p>
       99% of the time the story is presented in a way that does show biased. Much like coontown did. Its worse now with voat. People went straight neo Nazi in there. Oh a new user (female) had sex with a black man and now she don't like them well to hell with her she is unpure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now aside from the racism its much like that here. Stop caring. Its really easy. Find what makes you happy. For me its lego. Recently lego dimensions came out. New video game where you actually get to build the shit you use in the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck yeah! Been playing with my son and on my own cause I like the damn thing. Also got a basement full of lego. Lol so that's my backup. We keep like 1000 sets down there cause never know. Lol.

       Part of the disillusionment is seeing that they have control over the masses.  A movement always starts small.  Now is a time (better than any other in history) where the trickle has the potential to become a flood.  Technology can work for us too.  Keep working at it and learn what works and what doesn't.  Slow is smooth.

       It can be difficult and I have experienced this myself, so I can relate, but ultimately you have to accept people as they are (especially if you care about them), even if they have no idea about the true nature of reality.

       It's hard when you try to talk truth and get ignored because its so "far fetched". Some people just don't understand and never will and that is something we need to learn to accept, most will be lost to the lies. At least we are here and know what reality is

       You can't wake your parents up, generally. I've seen so many people fall on their faces on that one. You need help if you want to wake your parents up, unless they are very strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, anyone older than you by more than 10 years... You either need a LOT of time and skill in some area they respect, or just move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is about 10% of the population that you will be ideal to wake up and another 40% you will never wake up... but someone can.

      <p>
       You are trying to move someone's center of trust. They have to trust you for you to have any effect.

       What you're doing is right, and it's worth a cry or two, now and again. Most of the people on this quest are frustrated a lot... but it's worth it.
