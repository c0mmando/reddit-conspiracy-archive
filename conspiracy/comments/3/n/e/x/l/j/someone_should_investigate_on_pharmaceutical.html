       Adam Lanza, too - but we don't know what he took because it's been suppressed because the Connecticut Assistant Attorney General divulged that if people knew, it might make them

       ...and we all know withdrawal effects can be as bad as overdose.

       At least I hope that's why they suppressed it and not because they invest in pharmaceutical stocks themselves.

       Did you ever hear about the one Sandy Hook parent whose prop manager husband (Scott Getzinger) was killed (she suspected foul play)? Susan McGuinness Getzinger. She and her husband were fighting for better treatment of special needs kids in the school system there. There are cover-ups inside cover-ups within that school system - interesting blog about disappearing witnesses:

      </p>

       I honestly believe all of the "hoax" stuff re:Sandy Hook has been deliberately planted to muddy the waters further and to tar anyone who wants an investigation of any kind as a crazy person.

       I'm starting to agree about the hoax thing.
Because now whenever you mention investigating things,the first thing out of peoples mouths is...OMG!! How can you think it's a hoax!?
The knocking down of the school (with all construction workers made to sign an insane NDA), knocking down and total incineration of the Lanza property and belongings. The sale of that land to Newtown for $1. Peter Lanza.
It's fucking bizzaro world.
Maybe I'm a crazy person. BUT the way AbleChild is being treated....I can't get over that one .

       Thing is, docs give these zombie pills out like candies and 10-15% of population of U.S. is on them, but they're not all killing on massacre sprees. I know all those shooters were on ssri's, but big pharma makes too much profit of these things for anyone to blame the drugs

       I wish there was a more of a focus on screening and studying human beings such that SSRIs are not prescribed if a certain set of physical conditions aren't met (because of potential violent situations). Certainly a part of the public is ultra sensitive to these chemicals (in a bad way) and more research should be done as well as pre-screening before administering them. No pre-test, no drugs.

       Yep. There was actually a study done that showed a certain genetic mutation was common in patients who had homicidal side effects. Why aren't we testing for this? Why aren't we at least chasing this down a little harder, to see if this is really the case? And testing anyway to be doubly sure?
      </p>
      <p>
       And why aren't patients being told in no uncertain detail what might happen if they take too many pills at a time, go cold turkey, or take their meds with grapefruit (if kidney-metabolized) or alcohol (liver-metabolized)?

       The MAOA gene may be involved.  This codes for the production of the enzyme that breaks down catecholamine neurotransmitters.  There's a natural distribution in the population of variants of this gene, which results in some people being able to break down serotonin/dopamine/norep rather quickly, and others quite slowly.  It's on the X chromosome: men have only one copy, which functionally means that they tend to express their variant more profoundly than women, whose two copies can balance each other out in various ways, including mosaicism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Slow metabolizers are more prone to being flooded with neurotransmitters, which roughly translates to loose mood regulation - they can't mop them up as well as most, so, wider deviations from baseline levels, and longer time to return to baseline.
      </p>
      <p>
       Give a slow metabolizer a drug that
       <em>
        further
       </em>
       retards their ability to mop up excess neurotransmitters, and it's easy to see, even for a layperson, that you could get some problems.  It gets even wierder when you consider that many of the drugs
       <em>
        selectively
       </em>
       prevent the breakdown of only
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       catecholamine (e.g. serotonin)... so then what happens is, the patient's innate MAO activity still successfully degrades the other ones (dopamine and norepinephrine).  So lemme see, low dopamine levels (low happiness, anhedonia) combined with high serotonin levels (hallucinations... see psilocybin, mescaline), you get a grumpy person who sees and hears shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Studies correlate low-activity MAOA variants like 2R and possibly 3R,
       <em>
        combined with
       </em>
       childhood abuse/neglect, to a higher propensity for violence.  Now take someone with that profile and prescribe them a psychoactive drug that pushes their neurometabolism in the
       <em>
        wrong
       </em>
       direction...
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course this is oversimplified, there are many genes (not to mention other factors) involved in mood regulation, but still, even a curious layperson can see that our brains do not all function identically, and it might soon be seen as irresponsible to prescribe these drugs willy-nilly without consulting the patient's genome first.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a thorny issue and not discussed enough because:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) if you have to take a genetic test before qualifying for a drug, there are privacy issues, and potential eugenics issues involved;
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Profit motive points in one direction, lawsuits in the other;
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The demographics involved are a PC minefield, another reason the MSM won't touch it

       Thanks for sharing this, I really appreciate it and am saving this comment because I think it'll continue to be useful for my own digging and research.

       I don't understand three, though - the demographics, as far as I can tell, cross racial boundaries in a big way, although many of the people I do know personally and from stories I've tracked are "Caucasian," and others I've tracked via news stories are mixed with a little "Caucasian." (Using quotes 'cause we all know we use Caucasian improperly, just to denote white people.) I'm not sure how discovering it's some weird Neanderthal gene we inherited would be a PC minefield...although we have Seung Hui-Cho, whose parents were both Korean, and I don't know if he has any of that genome, and there have been multiple incidents in China (stabbings mostly, due to gun laws, but still pretty awful, horrifying, and lethal).
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing is that the pharmaceutical companies want to pin it on adolescents, that the medications
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       affect adolescents (but please let's not slow prescribing to kids and teens, because $$!) but there are many, many crimes committed by older people (like the aforementioned Chinese day care murders, the barber shop murders in New York State, the Postal Service murders described by someone upthread, and the murder-suicides recounted in every local newspaper, at least once a week).

       The more I think about it, the more I think that the MAOA connection would only be one among a host of potential factors.  Still worth looking into, especially vis-a-vis SSRIs.  The layperson reasoning I outlined above is perhaps a jumping-off point... but we'll probably never know the genotypes of those who commit these crimes, and that's probably for a good reason.  If
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       cross section of society turned out to have a predictably higher probability of engaging in violence - and I'm sure it could never be isolated to strictly genetic factors - it would still not be fair to lump in with them the vast numbers of people who happen to sport a given sequence but do a great job of living civilly.  People will always surprise you.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater and ruin our free society by trying to make it
       <em>
        obsessively
       </em>
       safe... that's almost an overarching theme of our times.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, we may just want to look into calibrating things more finely.  Forcing people to take a genetic test before prescribing a drug seems like a violation.  On the other hand, if you're about to start taking, for example, warfarin (an blood thinner given to people at risk of heart attacks and strokes), wouldn't you
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to know if you have the genetic variation that makes you hyper-sensitive to it, so you can adjust the dose or try something else?
      </p>
      <p>
       The benefits of self-knowledge, to me, definitely outweigh the privacy risks, and we should be encouraging people to understand their own source code, and embrace a more active role in managing their own health.

       Here's one of the papers re:akathisia-induced homicidal ideation by patients with specific genetic mutations that affected drug metabolization:
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3513220/">

      </p>
      <p>
       This is something that can be tested for and could reduce the number of homicides, suicides, and other akathisiac affects. I doubt it would bring them to zero, though.

        10-15% of population of U.S. is on them, but they're not all killing on massacre sprees

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If there was no relationship between these "zombie pills" and killing sprees, then only 10-15 percent of our mass shooters would be on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is whether the relationship is correlative or causative.  The obvious answer is correlative.  We think of the people who do these things as "mentally ill," and mentally ill people are more likely than others to have interacted with the mental health system and obtained prescriptions for these pills.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest a very simple causative relationship via "
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=intrusive%20thoughts">
        intrusive thoughts
       </a>
       ."  We all have them at some point.  But "zombie pills" blunt your emotions, and therefore blunt your innate revulsion to these thoughts.  Instead of being horrifying, they are fascinating.  Eventually, a whole bunch of people end up dead every once in a while.

       Correlation or causation?

       And you absolutely do see these things in EU countries, albeit less frequently.  Not sure about Russia.  China has a problem with serial stabbings.  And in South America the CIA funds them and puts them in charge of the police and military.
      </p>
      <p>
       (I'm speaking only somewhat in jest.  There is a palpable difference between the type of violence we see here and that in other countries, and I do personally believe our medication regimen may well have something to do with it.)

       What tipped me off to the whole thing was the woman who ate her baby's toes on Celexa. Until then, I just chalked everything up to PCP. An interesting tidbit--the Miami cannibal wasn't on Spice. His autopsy showed partially digested pills that they refuse to identify. I'd put all my money on that guy being part of a clinical trial. :(

       Off-topic from OP, but I'd really like to have data about injection-site carcinomas incidence in the past few years. There's a lot of data related to cats - and this is why most vets now give pets shots in their legs, not in their necks. But it's never discussed re:people...

       Its one of those creepy subreddits where people are obsessed with letting everyone know how excited they are to remain completely ignorant. They likely have absolutely nothing in their lives, so the only thing that makes them less miserable is harassing people online.

       Bullies and ostriches. They enjoy stalking and mocking people on this sub, makes them feel better about themselves somehow. Don't let 'em bring your day down.

       And thank you for posting this - I truly believe that this is the biggest in plain sight conspiracy we're dealing with in the United States right now. Everyone knows a large number of commonly-prescribed medications have suicidal and homicidal ideation side effects when overdosing, withdrawing, and even sometimes due to long-term usage.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we aren't allowed to talk about it, or do anything about it, everyone sits on their hands while other Americans are murdered in the most brutal way, and every few weeks, "A doy, guns?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Because to admit what is actually described on the label of a drug is happening will fuck up some politicians' stock portfolios. And the rest of us know somebody on them or are on them ourselves and don't want to admit something could be wrong. While the bodies keep falling. (And divorces! I can't tell you how many people I know who are divorced after starting on these meds and dealing with the paranoia side effects. But divorces are better than "family annihilation," at least.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, thank you, and don't let the bastids get you down.

       they do not understand the human body well enough to create drugs and vaccines.  they do more harm than good every time.

       Here's one of the papers re:akathisia-induced homicidal ideation by patients with specific genetic mutations that affected drug metabolization:
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3513220/">
        http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3513220/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is something that can be tested for and could reduce the number of homicides, suicides, and other akathisiac affects. I doubt it would bring them to zero, though.
