       I know that I ran across a short little video of him at some Israel/zionist rally or something getting
       <em>
        extremely

       upset at some people that were demonstrating and protesting against Israel.  If you side with Israel to almost

      <p>
       I'm not blaming people for not paying attention.  I'm simply saying that it seems most people
       <em>
        aren't
       </em>
       is all.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        is a lame excuse for not doing what you can to inform others if you are actually right about things.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't pretend to be some "messiah paragon of truth and information!" but I do what I can to help and inform others of the little things that I know here and there.  Sanders in all likelihood being little more than a stooge is one of those things I (occasionally) mention to others.  The fervor of some people still stuck in the ferris wheel rigmarole of politics is so ardent, however, that sometimes many just don't listen or get it even if I do or anyone else does chime in and let it be known that 99.999% of the candidates in and around office are all compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, I wouldn't say that I "don't inform others".  I just realize that I'm not any sort of paragon of data.  I'm a work in progress like pretty much all of us are.  I go with where the evidence I've uncovered points, and although I try to do my due diligence and be intelligent, the fact of the matter is that I can certainly be wrong about some things - so I don't walk around trying to "spout proclamations for everyone to hear!"  Na.  I inform about the little I can, but it's still ultimately a "take it or leave it" kind of thing really.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Also, saying that and then not explaining what my attention is missing is lame as well.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well, it's like this, man.  Bernie Sanders is an Ashkenazi "Zionist first" Jew.  Given this fact, it means he is in all likelihood also a
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14s26x/wtf_did_i_just_stumble_upon_details_inside/">
        sayanim
       </a>
       ...and given
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       fact, that lets you know a lot about where his loyalties lie...and, hint:  It's not with the country that he's running for the presidency of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about that for a moment.  Think about the consequences of that for this country if he were to become president of the United States.  You think Obama is bad?  Well get ready...

       I hope you see now that that wasn't exactly what I was doing, bro.  I wasn't being

       see that video of him totally protecting and siding with Zionism and getting really mad at people demonstrating against Israel.  Also B) understand that, with Zionism and many (not all, but many) Ashkenazi Jews, things aren’t JUST about money…It’s about
       <em>
        power
       </em>
       .  It’s about “conquering the goyim”.  It’s about “ruling the dirty, vile masses and taking our rightful place as the leaders of humanity that we are!” kind of shit.  Sounds insane, I know…but so do The Protocols also sound insane…and yet its tenets are
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what Israel has been moving toward for many years now.  As such, and again, anyone who sides with Israel seems to be an enemy of humanity…and Bernie sides with Israel.  So that’s
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a good thing…at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this is to say that, for Zionists - especially sayanim Zionists as Sanders may very well be - there are certain things a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       more important than just money alone:  Preserving Zionist tenets…even if it means coming across as a “humble, low paid politician that doesn’t except money from donors.  Yeh!  Let’s vote for him in office then!!  Woohoo!”

       For my part, I’m absolutely not jumping to conclusions.  I’m basing my conclusions on valid observations and logic.  If Sanders
       <em>
        isn’t
       </em>
       an “Israel first” Zionist, then great.  However, I wouldn’t bet that he isn’t.  That’s all I’m saying.

       Well, often the truth on this planet very much

       Similarly:  And those who did not understand just how fucked up things on this planet were thought those that brought it to light were insane.

      <p>
       On one level, this would seem to be correct.  On another level, however, when you use critical thinking, you can actually see past the initial derision that many initially come forward with.  Part of the key to getting at the truth is to be a sufficiently critical thinker to be able to sift the wheat from the chaff - the truth from the lies, the signal from all the noise.

       They shouldn't be, or else they are fooling themselves as much as the American Left's very own Donald Trump is fooling them. Truth is, Bernie really isn't that radically different from the central banking status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's moved to block Audit the Fed in the senate. He has had anti-war protesters arrested outside of his office for denouncing his decision to vote for Hillary's husband's 'humanitarian bombing' of Kosovo. He also opposes open borders just as ravenously as Donald Trump does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look into his actual positions. Bernie alone presents little to no threat to central banking or all that much of the status quo. It's his supporters who are.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why his run is really so dangerous to establishment Democrat Hillary Clintonites. It's the people empowered by his run to think for themselves they are afraid of.

       From my perspective, anybody that is focusing on politicians is party to the problem of the corruption in this country. You are investing into a club you dont belong to. This club uses clueless people to maintain power over you, why would you actively allow this election after election? Its a scam of the highest order and the best thing you can do is turn you back on that system and work toward investing your energy in things close to home with people you know you can trust. People in politics are caught in a machine that there is no escape from. They cant, and wont work to make things better for the people. The system was designed to empower foreign interests we are indebted to.

       The system isnt going to change for one man, its built and exactley works as it should its not built for us. Also you are using terms they created and dont benefit the people. This whole system you are looking at, media, government society is a game to trick you into subscribing to a system that has no purpose other than to enrich foreign debtors. There are better ways to handle this by working in your community to bring about change.

       If you understood that we are in debt to a foreign entity you would understand that things cannot change until we divest ourselves from fiat currency and that debt based system. The U.S government is their to extract wealth from the people due to a  debt we made during the civil war. If you need  some references I can provide them to you, but really you have been living under a lie, all of us have.

       Dude its not going to happen, our government is created around this system of banking. The whole system works for it, everything that a politician does is because of it. You can't change a system on the same level it was created, To change something you build a new model that makes the preexisting one obsolete.
That is how change will come, by people divesting from government, redirecting their energy toward creating small groups of individuals who work toward the common good.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't change a system of power who's foundations are designed to dis-empower your every move as you try to go about changing it. The system will force you out every single time. How many years has this been happening? 50? 100? you still do not get it? its like people have been brainwashed and the brainwashing moves from generation to generation. They have you convinced that if you work within their system that some day things will change. Im here to tell you that is a lie, you cannot change a system that was designed to exploit the people because you are playing in their game, not your own. Bernie is playing in a game that is not his own, I dont care how good he is its a waste of time, we are better off working on systems we control not using a frame work we dont control.

       Here I outline strategies that will actual work, but we have to start taking charge of self-government, not trying to represent ourselves by selecting someone to represent us. That is a fools way of doing things, it means we are to stupid or lazy to make our own change, and expect someone else to do it for us. That's just mentally insane. nobody, under the conditions we are living in is going to make that happen. All representation does it centralized power at the top waiting for the right person to get it to fuck it up. Its better if we are making changes as individuals in a decentralized society were power cant be centralized.

       I never said we have to overthrow the government. I just said we need to put our energy where we can make a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is really hard for people who have invested their whole lives into society to understand. But please listen to what I am really saying and not what society tells you I am saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Changing you tactics, doesn't mean you are giving up. It just means that you know where your power lies and you dont try to convince yourself that you can make change with someone elses creation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I run a website where I am trying to change this, but from a place of power, not from a place of weakness.

      </p>
      <p>
       Please remember that you need to stop thinking in terms of what society says and start really thinking for yourself. Propaganda works really well at making people thing some of their ideas are there own when what really happens is it actually convinces you to take on ideas that dont benefit you. To continue a illusion that you are better off with the same system of government that has not change on iota in 100 years or more, eventually you have to stop banging your head against the wall and try something different.

       Im sorry I didn't mean it that way. I just said that I dont think using our current system of government and politics is the answer, and I see a lot of people doing what society tells them works. Am I wrong for questioning that and making a point of it?

      <p>
       I will apologies and feel like an ass :) But like a said it will never happen. The banks control this game, its not in their interest to allow it to change, short of a revolution. But all revolutions do is bring the same thing back in another form. That's the definition of a revolution. Like a revolution on a dial. We have to think about what these words we use mean. To me it just looks like another word created by the control system to empower people to think revolutions brings change when its just an illusion to make people feel that way while it allows more of the same.
