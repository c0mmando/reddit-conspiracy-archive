        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What I believe is going on with the airstrikes targeting IS, is that while Russia is actually hitting targets, the US is instead targeting the surrounding areas and possibly civilians all on purpose, as a way of making this conflict to last longer. If you look at the recent headlines in mostly the west,
 &quot;In a joint statement, a coalition made up of the United States, Britain, Turkey, France, Germany, Qatar and Saudi Arabia accused Russia of attacking the Syrian opposition and civilians, instead of fighting ISIS.&quot;, CNN
&quot;In Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron accused Moscow of not &quot;discriminating between IS and the legitimate Syrian opposition groups&quot;.
&quot;As a result, they are actually backing the butcher Assad and helping him.
&quot;Rightly, they [Russia] have been condemned across the Arab world for what they have done and I think the Arab world is right about that,&quot; Mr Cameron added.&quot; BBC
&quot;Western officials say many of the Russian planes are using unguided ordnance, or “dumb bombs,” making Russian airstrikes less efficient.&quot; The Washington Post</p>

<p>Im seeing a trend in most news articles, that are basically &#39;in my terms&#39; bullying Russia about there terrible airstrikes. What Russia is doing is trying to help defeat IS, and i think that they have a good chance at that.<br/>
I would love to hear what you all think about this!</p>

I can&#39;t be any more happier that Putin is the only person to stand up to what the US is doing to the world. It puts a big grin on my face.</p>

&quot;This is not a smart strategic move on Russia&#39;s part,&quot; he said, referring to Putin&#39;s decision to &quot;double down&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s only strengthening ISIL, and that&#39;s not good for anybody,&quot; Obama contended.  OH REALLY!</p>

<p>&quot;Russia&#39;s airstrikes have forced the Pentagon to grapple with whether the U.S. should use military force to protect American-trained and -equipped Syrian rebels now that they may be the targets of Russian airstrikes.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well ofc US is mad that russians kill the rebels that they have trained and armed themself... This has been the US tactics now for years in the middle east.  After vietnam they didn&#39;t want to fight their wars with their own people because the public would be angry when their soldier die for nothing. And so they equip and train those so called &quot;moderate rebels&quot; </p>

<p>It&#39;s pure geopolitical reasons for US to be in syria. (If they cared about humans rights they could also help the rebels in yemen)</p>

<p>Fact is that the saudis want to build a gas pipeline to europe (through syria) because right now only russians sell their oil in europe. US has big influence on most EU  countries so they have to follow them. And turkey supports ISIS because they kill the kurds for them.</p>

<p>If u want to know a bit more why they fight here are some good videos </p>

<p>Without being there your self it&#39;s hard to tell who&#39;s actually in the &quot;right&quot;</p>

<p>Us claims Russia is attacking civilians, Next day US bombs a hospital.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of events happening progressively faster and faster lately in the middle east, will be interesting to see where it puts us.</p>
