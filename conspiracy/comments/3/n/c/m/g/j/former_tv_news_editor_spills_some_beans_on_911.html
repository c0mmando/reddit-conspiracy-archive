        <strong>
         I used to work in television news as an editor, and was working on the anniversary of 9/11 in 2002. As early as that, we weren't allowed to show actual footage from the day anymore...and we were only allowed to show interviews of "streeters" reacting EMOTIONALLY to the attacks. Our entire news coverage on the anniversary was all just emotional interviews about the attack...no clips AT ALL from the day. There was a very real shift from just covering the event, to documenting the psychological effects the attacks had on people.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Very early on, there was an effort to cause people to forget what actually happened, and replace it with an emotionally-led remembrance of how it made them feel. Also, this was a direct order from network HQ, this was not a decision made at the local level. We were all pissed off, because we'd spent days compiling footage and editing pieces that showed the actual attack...since logic would have dictated that we'd be asked to show it.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Our News Director couldn't see the logic behind focusing solely on emotional response, but said that we had to follow orders. At one point in the rundown meeting, our head editor said "they probably just don't want people to see the demolition explosions", because when you look at it on professional gear, it's almost impossible not to see that it was a demolition. He was quickly dismissed, or was told "well, it's probably hard for people to watch it. People watched in on 9/11...don't see how it would have been any different (unless the difference would be people would actually pay a bit more attention to what they were seeing.)

       This is the only admission from the media I've ever seen and felt it was important enough to share. If in your gut, or by research, you've felt this was going on all along it's good to see some confirmation. What strikes me the most is the length of time this charade has been going on. Others must want to share what they've experienced at the hands of the corporate media. Even after 14 years something made this user edit then delete this comment an hour after submitting. Something also made them write it. The censorship is still thick with much left for us to uncover.

       In other words,   events are managed for emotional response.    What that means,   also,   is that the media experience is degrading to your intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes some other kind of media,   not mainstream media,   to get relevant information,    the kind of information it would take to thoughtfully analyze events in the world.     All of that by definition is "fringe/conspiracy".

       Are there pockets of intellectually functioning communities?    Perhaps,   where there is a particular focus.    Maybe in Silicon Valley.    Elon Musk for example,  and his circle.    But can you imagine what it would be like in Obama's circle.    The guy is fucking up big time in Ukraine and Syria.    Holds a Nobel Peace Prize.   It must be an echo chamber of insanity around him,  24/7.    What part of existence would he be in touch with?    Might as well be living inside of The Truman Show

       That one is easy. The media wants information and the best place to get it is the government. They need to keep their most important sources happy, so if that means burying a story or two then no biggie. How they are controlled by the private sector is advertising -- especially print media. For decades, print media has made very little -- if any -- profit from circulation. It pretty much all comes from advertising. And if they print a story which is going to piss off the advertisers' clients then they're going to lose a lot of money.

       all that makes sense up to a certain point, but when people realize they are enabling the government to get away with the murder and terrorizing of their own people you'd think at least some them would say what they want to say on the news regardless of if they get fired for it, how the powers finesse the control without creating rebels out of the journalists is what I really want to know.

       You're right, and some do, though precious few.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's quite simple. The problem is the system we are using. It both pressurises and seduces people to keep earning money whatever the cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in my opinion the answer to your second question is the selection process. People with political views unappealing to the owners will be rooted out before they even get a job.

       Did you really expect the news stations to repeat footage of the actual attacks only one year after they happened? I'm not going to say "too soon", because I don't really think anything is, but the point of the anniversary is to remember the victims and the heartache of the event, not rewatch the impacts of the planes. The news stations would've been roasted.
      </p>
      <p>
       And frankly I don't put much trust in a single comment from someone who waited 14 years to bring up an extremely incriminating quote from his time at a news station. I like evidence, not wild quotes from random news execs.

       do you think that many reporters know or at least suspect they are reporting fabricated news at times?
      </p>
      <p>
       reporters have so much power - because the populous does trust them - if any reporter ever decided to step out on their own - and talk like you are now - but be a face on screen that people recognized at the same time - even in social media not on the actual news - it would get a lot more people asking questions than any non-pro journalists talking about this stuff does.
      </p>
      <p>
       most people who doubt that news could ever be fake do so because they can't imagine how all the journalists are keeping quiet about it if fakery is happening. if some journalists start talking, and let themselves be recognized for it - the strongest argument that propaganda is not happening would be corroded

       you say it's extremely easy to fake something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to know what you mean - how you imagine it is done? say with Sandy Hook. Naysayers say it would take way too many people and too much coordination. from your perspective how could they fake it easily?

       it's tough. i believe SH was staged, I believe a lot of these events are staged, there is so much evidence - I feel certain. but there is a lot of evidence that isn't strong too and I think sometimes it's good to trim the fat to have the most solid proof. -- in Connecticut people sell houses for a dollar all the time. it's a tax thing. i have a friend who worked in banks there. the $1 house sales are not unique to the time surrounding Sandy Hook. second is the pasted email in the article you sent - all sounds believable until the author describes a high up exec basically confirming in email that corruption is behind Sandy Hook. No exec is going to put those words in email. and if by some chance they did - why was that email not saved and posted as evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       just saying - I am certain SH was a hoax, I just gotta call out weak sounding evidence when i see it - in hopes of it not giving others am excuse to deny the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       as for the lottery - maybe that is quite true, I just watched Black Mass (not that great) but there's talk of FBI paying people off via lottery back them too. made me thing that one is probably really happening

       I sometimes post bad evidence to people because I just grab something - not vetting it - trusting it's true because I know the big argument is true. and then when I get called out I'm like -- agg. uh.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if it was closed or not. but I think it probably was.
      </p>
      <p>
       what did it for me was the lack of forensic evidence, and the incredibly inauthentic parents on camera. all else really could have been just as it should be - but without a real crime - it doesn't matter if the school was open, who won the lottery, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       nobody came close to proving the murder of all those people occurred, that's the real problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       and if people did die or not - I doubt it but how can I know - all i know is all their witnesses are pretending, and nobody is allowed to ask questions.
