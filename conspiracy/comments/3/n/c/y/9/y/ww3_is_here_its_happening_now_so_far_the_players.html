       There are still a few wild cards,  like Germany and India who haven't chosen sides yet,  but I find it hard to believe Germany would actually side with Russia over the West.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you could also easily assume that Japan and South Korea would side with Team America if it comes down to that,  with North Korea obviously siding with Russia / China.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a pretty deep squad for Team America.  I don't see how it's possible that Russia wins this.  Maybe President Obama was right (I never thought I'd say those words) yesterday, when he said Russia is flexing their might from a position of domestic weakness,  rather then strength.  I think they picked the wrong fight.

       I'm sorry, but anyone who calls the proxy wars in the world right now a World War are being disingenuous to the scale, intensity and total wae nature of the previous two world wars. This type of shit happened throughout the Cold War and that's exactly what this is.

       Usually proxy wars only involve a small number of country's, not 16. It's not a regional war when you have so many out of the region country's involved. I think this is literally the definition of world War actually.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        World War 3 will start off with humanity firing all of their nuclear weapons at once
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is a false assumption. I understand that, in many people's minds, WWIII is synonymous with total nuclear war. But it doesn't have to be nuclear, or total to qualify as WWIII.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider WWII as a good model for how the sequence of events for a third world war could progress. Long years of simmering tensions (1930's German rearmament). Isolated regional conflicts (eg. Japanese occupation of China). Things still aren't that bad until one action pushes things past a tipping point (eg. German invasion of Poland, Pearl Harbor).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, many major powers quickly side up with each other and achieve a solution through war. There isn't much motivation to resort to nuclear weapons in the early stages of another global conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia managed to keep a Western backed government in Ukraine from joining NATO and taking Crimea with it. What's more, they did this by supporting the conflict in Eastern Ukraine and keeping it from getting out of control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the Russians have gotten involved in another conflict in Syria. This time they're facing off against yet another Western proxy in the form of the various anti-Assad factions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is regime change in Syria worth escalating all the way to a nuclear standoff between Russia and the US? Is supporting a close ally worth the same to the Russians?
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll see. In any case, I would expect wide scale use of conventional forces for at least a few weeks before anyone went nuclear. You might even see use of nukes limited to just a few dozen weapons before sanity prevails and someone calls it quits.

       One of my neighbors is from Lebanon and he seems to think there's going to be a big war in Syria by 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
       I kind of think there's going to be some serious escalation over the next year as well. That doesn't mean it has to be WWIII but we'll see.

       You realize if a nuke were to hit DC, the mushroom cloud would be seen from New York. This is no where near a nuclear bomb.

       Edit: Tsar Bomba could've been see from Boston.

       Not necessarily true at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many nuclear weapons with variable yields. For example, a US made
       <a href="http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/B61.html">
        B61-3
       </a>
       , intended as a tactical nuke, can be dialed down to .3KT or 300 tons of TNT yield. That's compared to the original "Little Boy" weapon that hit Hiroshima, which had an estimated output of about 16KT.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most modern thermonuclear weapons intended for airburst (to destroy cities) top off at between 100KT to 1MT. Mostly because war planners have determined that it's more effective to hit a city with multiple smaller weapons than a single bomb with very high yield.

       I don't see how you can argue that WW3 hasn't already started.  All of the above country's are already involved, either paying mercs,  training mercs, sending mercs, or actually using troops and military hardware.  Most people it seems are just too afraid to accept reality.

       There's no doubt in my mind you're right,  and these things will eventually happen, and there will only be further escalations from here on out,  but I think when history books look back on it, (if anyone is still around to write them) they'll say Syria, right here and now,  is where it all started.

       The nukes sent so bad as today they are much more tactical and "clean" than what Japan felt at the end of WW2. 
Sadly 90% of the population would perish from a breakdown in food and other supplies in a 6 month period.
The earth itself would actually improve. If you've seen Chernobyl, today it is a natures paradise. Untouched by humans.

       Oh yeah, I was actually pointing out that nukes are less destructive than before, more "clean", and the general populations main concern would be starvation and riots.
There are hundreds of very advanced underground facilities such as " ft mountain" in Washington state for example. There will always be survivors.

       A) The underground bases will be for the

      </p>

        that

      </p>
      <p>
       And you think they'll want to deal with a world where the environment they live in is completely destroyed and they can't even go above ground because they nuked everything?
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone has needs, and while it's unfortunate that TPTB use us as unwitting slaves, the fact of the matter is that they
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       us unwitting slaves in order to maintain their evil, opulent lifestyles.  They know the moment they kill all of us is the moment that opulent lifestyle goes away because they would no longer have any slaves to do all the work for them, be parasites off of, and they will have to fend for themselves.

       <p>
        Oh humanity will survive alright, multiple times in the past too.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, no, bro.  You don't understand.  When I say "humanity won't survive." I mean "This VERSION of humanity won't survive."
      </p>
      <p>
       We get seeded and re-seeded - over and over again - just as you (knowingly or not) intimated in the statement I just quoted above.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humanity
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       survive.  There are powers (in all likelihood
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       from this planet) that make sure that the human form continues...on this planet, and on many, many others.  However, that's not what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about THIS version of humanity - THIS version of the human race.
      </p>
      <p>
       We try to have a nuke war, and THIS version of humanity will be yet another one that will be going "bye bye" - just like all the others came and went.  The human form in general will continue on, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, although you are right that humanity will indeed survive, it is only humanity in the
       <em>
        overall
       </em>
       sense - humanity as it pertains to "the species in general" - that will survive.  THIS particular version of humanity will go
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       much the fuck away if a nuke war goes down.  Believe that.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It's just that you and me and mostly everyone won't survive.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Correct.  You and me and most everyone won't survive.  Matter of fact, pretty much EVERY human on Earth won't survive...and the .001% elite know that.  Therefore, those that are still here and that are not part of that group of super DUPER select elite that already have their "ticket to another planet for when the human race nukes itself" will not want at all to nuke themselves and die.  They won't allow that - and considering that a good deal of them are likely in charge and in control of the governments that would use those nukes on each other, I'm not sure such a thing as a nuke war would be allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to all this, it is said that there are forces and powers FAAAAR above and beyond anything that exists on this planet that have a vested interest in making sure that the stupid humans on this planet don't fuck up the planet
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       some of the other very important species here too much, so some of those very advanced species simply won't let humanity nuke itself...not because they care oh so much for humanity, but because they care for THE PLANET HERSELF and don't want to see
       <em>
        her
       </em>
       get nuked by our dumb actions.
