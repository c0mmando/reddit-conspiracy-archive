        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>How the fuck can anyone actually think there&#39;s a chance that this was an accident? The Afghan forces have already suggested the airstrike was probably done as revenge because the hospital treated any and all combatants, regardless of what side they were on. The hospital had been there for over four years. The GPS location was constantly given to the NATO and Coalition forces, the last time they were updated was only five days prior to the airstrike, and last time I checked, hospitals don&#39;t just get legs and walk around, it&#39;s been in the same damn place for four years, but we&#39;re supposed to believe the US Army bombed it for an hour by accident?? They didn&#39;t stop bombing even when MSF contacted NATO and said &#39;stop bombing us plz&#39; , but that was an <em>accident?!</em> </p>

<p>Also this tweet from MSF:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The hospital was repeatedly &amp; precisely hit during each aerial raid, while the rest of the compound was left mostly untouched #Kunduz</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This wasn&#39;t an oopsie airstrike, it was a precise and successful one, for those who perpetrated it. Also, three months prior the Afghan military stormed the hospital claiming Al-Qaeda had patients there, which wasn&#39;t even true, so MSF was CLEARLY on someone&#39;s shitlist. There aren&#39;t that many western run hospitals everywhere in a war-zone I imagine, they&#39;re pretty hard to confuse with something else. This was an intentional attack to send a clear message to the world: America can do whatever the fuck it wants, and don&#39;t give anyone we decide is a terrorist even half of a band-aide, or we&#39;ll kill you, even if you never did but we think you did. </p>

<p>Sorry, ending my rant here, but this shit just drives me insane. How is the cognitive dissonance THAT powerful in this country?! When you read the comments on reddit it&#39;s people everywhere saying &quot;oh it was just an accident&quot; &quot;how dare they accuse us of a war crime&quot; and it&#39;s just like... are you fucking kidding?! A HOSPITAL. WITH PATIENTS. BURNING TO DEATH IN THEIR BEDS. DOCTORS WHO DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO HELPING OTHERS GETTING MURDERED AS THEY TRY AND HELP EACH OTHER WITH THEIR DYING BREATH. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying this is anything new for the US, but the fact that there&#39;s so much attention on this issue and yet the brainwash machine is STILL this powerful that it can keep people on America&#39;s side, even on THIS?! Also, prob a little too emotional here cuz most of my family are doctors.</p>

If you plan on bombing the shit out of something your to be held responsible for what ever &quot;accidents&quot; you claim you&#39;ve made. Especially innocent lives. Can hitler say he made a boo boo in his aim to promote a superior race? Can a terrorist, bomb a location and say he made a mistake about it? Well no, no he can&#39;t. The fact that it happened is the fact that a war crime was committed. This heartless American government has to be held responsible to the fullest extent of international law.  </p>

<p>The problem in America is that everyone is taught by society not to discuss things that &quot;hurt&quot;. You don&#39;t talk about the murders, you talk about the babies and the children. Try and bring up the truth of &quot;behind the scenes&quot; and everyone will act like you&#39;re a downer or blatantly ignore you.</p>

<p>At home you can talk about these things with people, but they&#39;d rather change the subject or continue staring blankly at the tv. At work you&#39;re busy, so you can&#39;t have a good conversation. Everyone has an excuse, and that&#39;s why I call America the country of excuses. </p>

<p>There are no records of Roosevelt having made such a statement, and this is most likely a misquotation of the widely reported comment he made in a speech at the Citadel (23 October 1935):
&quot;<em>Yes. we are on the way back — not by mere chance, not by a turn of the cycle. We are coming back more soundly than ever before because we planned it that way, and don&#39;t let anybody tell you differently.</em>&quot;</p>

Now military decisionality is no longer hindered by a foreign element reliant upon and representative of ‘international law’, which the U.S. abhors to recognize in circumstances where it may serve as an imposition on it, where it may function as a subtractor of decisionality and control.</p>

<p>MSF (Doctors without Borders)  expresses its dismay that TPP countries have agreed to United States government and multinational drug company demands that will raise the price of medicines for millions by unnecessarily extending monopolies and further delaying price-lowering generic competition. <strong>The big losers in the TPP are patients and treatment providers in developing countries.</strong> Although the text has improved over the initial demands, the TPP will still go down in history as the worst trade agreement for access to medicines in developing countries, which will be forced to change their laws to incorporate abusive intellectual property protections for pharmaceutical companies.</p>

<p>Its not video of them talking, its a recording of comms. I&#39;m not going to engage with you on this, because quite frankly, i feel that you have an opinion already formed, i could sit here and try to explain concepts like &#39;fog of war&#39; &#39;target misidentification&#39; how not logical it is to halt an entire &#39;offensive&#39; on the part of AC-130 Gunship&#39;s dumbass crew. I doubt you even know what an AC-130 Gunship is (its not a helicopter), i&#39;m not saying that no one should be held guilty, because clearly there was a fuck up somewhere on the line. It could have been a FiSTer or a JTAC with the case of the stupids, it could have been terry taliban taking potshots at U.S. Forces from the clinic, while &#39;spooky&#39; was haunting the sky, or hell, the 155 on the &#39;spooky&#39; might have ND&#39;ed. I don&#39;t know i wasn&#39;t there. All i am saying is, don&#39;t build your opinion on some disdain you have for U.S. Troops.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t even mention the video you posted. In this little interaction, you have assumed based on nothing, alot more than i have. I took your apparent lack of knowledge on subjects military, which you demonstrated, and merely said &#39;i don&#39;t think you would be open to a differing point of view,&#39; I never even said U.S. troops weren&#39;t at fault, in fact i gave you scenarios were the blame was laid purely at the feet of U.S. Personnel, i never even said blowing up a hospital was okay. I only said &#39;this was a mistake, here are some possibilities as to what they were&#39; you took that, and painted a picture of me as some sort of monster. You want to hear what i think about that gun cam video? I don&#39;t have an opinion, i wasn&#39;t there, but from what i saw, what the pilots saw, there were several military age males with AKs and what appeared to be an RPG, rocket propelled grenade launcher, and a ground element right up the street. To protect my brothers on the ground, i would have lit them up too. Its a fucking terrible thing, its an awful waste of life. Fuck ups happen though, doesn&#39;t detract from the calamity, they just happen. You took my lack of comment on that video, and my doubtfulness that U.S. troops willing fired on unarmed doctors for no reason, to mean i am a monster. This is exactly what i meant, you built your own narrative, and cast me in the role of the villian, simple because i am in the U.S. Military, and dared to question your narrative of the U.S. Air Force as blood thirsty murder Machines. Not once did i try to excuse this, I simply said i don&#39;t think this was intentional. You&#39;re kind of an asshole, and even worse, a self rightious one. Not once in a decade long military career have i been order to fire on defenseless civilians, thats a movie trope and you know it.</p>

<p>Ah. Ten seconds worth of research, which i should have done early. Looks like it was afghan personnel called in an Airstrike from an orbiting AC-130, and marked thier target wrong, or sent in the wrong grid. Sorry, kiddo. Looks like this one falls in the Afghanni&#39;s lap. I guess U.S. troops aren&#39;t the slaughter-vikings you want them to be.</p>

<p>Honestly, I don&#39;t know how to respond to this person who is dead set on defending the mistake of our military. Heck, he even blames it on the &quot;Afghannis.&quot; So brainwashed, it&#39;s sickening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one wants to believe that they themselves are the &quot;bad guys.&quot; We are tightly bound, in psyche, to our home countries. When our country&#39;s government, which we feel an extension on ourselves, does something heinous and wrong, we cannot reconcile it with our image of self and country and at that point we&#39;ll do any kind of logical gymnastics available to twist the situation into one in which &quot;we&quot; are &quot;good.&quot; Accepting stupid explanations that defy common sense so as not to have to face up to the wrong? Yes, please, I&#39;ll take anything I can get to keep my positive self-image intact.</p>

<p>Simple human psychology.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the US has reached the point of bombing hospitals intentionally. Mistakes DO happen often in the military.</p>
