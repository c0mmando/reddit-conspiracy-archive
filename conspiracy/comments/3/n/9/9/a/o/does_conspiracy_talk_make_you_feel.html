    <div class="md"><p>When you become awake to the real world and you realize what little affect you can have on things (without risking your current status) you become jaded and weak. You have a convenient excuse to not try. Many people get stuck here and it&#39;s a depressing world when you do.  </p>

<p>But the next step of awakening is to look inward. Make the changes within yourself slowly. Then, you can actually go forward to a happier and more successful life because you now have insider knowledge. You have vision into what things will change and how. Asleep people will lack this vision which gives you a great advantage in life.</p>

<p>I think that one of the most destructive ideas we as a society have come up with is the taboo on discussing politics and religion.</p>

<p>That single construct has done more to allow the growth of tyranny than any other.</p>

<p>I also believe that if we can get just a couple of percent more people up to date and informed about conspiracy topics we will have a much better shot at having a more positive future.</p>

<p>If not, well, you know...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reality is depressing. I&#39;m already plenty disinterested in participating in society. Never interested in being part of any herd. I think serious conversations about taboo topics are a crucial part of intellectual development. Sometimes the things I read here add extra stress and despondency I don&#39;t need,  but I overall prefer to be informed than ignorant. Sometimes the price of information acquisition is dealing with bad news. Additionally, sometimes I find comfort in uncovering negative currents because they help explain negative experiences in my life I thought had no explanation (like the myriad reasons American healthcare is fucked).</p>

<p>Get out the house for a minute.  Take a break, then come back and check it out.  It goes back to educational and interesting. At least for me anyway.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t, at least in my experience, it does make you feel negative about the way things in the world are.  Pessimistic to say the least.  </p>
