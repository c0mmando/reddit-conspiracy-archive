       Many people avoid these and taboo topics because they get a negative vibe and demotivates them to be a part of society or the herd. Does this happen to you? How do you overcome it? How do we overcome it as a society?
      </p>
      <p>
       PS: for the record, I love discussing taboo topics, as its the most though provoking things only few people go the extra mile to discuss.

       When you become awake to the real world and you realize what little affect you can have on things (without risking your current status) you become jaded and weak. You have a convenient excuse to not try. Many people get stuck here and it's a depressing world when you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the next step of awakening is to look inward. Make the changes within yourself slowly. Then, you can actually go forward to a happier and more successful life because you now have insider knowledge. You have vision into what things will change and how. Asleep people will lack this vision which gives you a great advantage in life.

       I think that one of the most destructive ideas we as a society have come up with is the taboo on discussing politics and religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       That single construct has done more to allow the growth of tyranny than any other.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe that if we can get just a couple of percent more people up to date and informed about conspiracy topics we will have a much better shot at having a more positive future.

       I belonged to the brighter more rebellious group when they were called hippies. They  were anti war, pro environment and against 'the man'.

       Most of those same people are now  among the  oppressors.

       Sadly, it will be the same with your generations but I'm still here, unchanged and still trying. You do that and hope will be preserved for the future.

       I'm seriously surprised that most people I interact with don't really know what's going on in Syria and don't care. How do you not care about evils in the world? It's very depressing and angering a lot of the time, but I'd still rather search for truth than bury my head in the sand.

       No it emboldens me. We are the few, those few who can realize what is happening in the aggregate and try to change it on the minute scale. Even if it be a comment or a conversation with a stranger, ripples get bigger. Some ripples cancel other ones out, so it is important to be one mind, one goal, one direction. (Not the band)

       Makes me feel sad for people who live so paranoid all the time. I mean really, legitimately sad. Not pathetic sad, rather, melancholy sad.

       On the plus side I've learned a lot about confirmation bias, so there's that!

       Reality is depressing. I'm already plenty disinterested in participating in society. Never interested in being part of any herd. I think serious conversations about taboo topics are a crucial part of intellectual development. Sometimes the things I read here add extra stress and despondency I don't need,  but I overall prefer to be informed than ignorant. Sometimes the price of information acquisition is dealing with bad news. Additionally, sometimes I find comfort in uncovering negative currents because they help explain negative experiences in my life I thought had no explanation (like the myriad reasons American healthcare is fucked).

       I would say if you don't take a break from it every now and then, it will fuck with you a little bit.   Once you realize that the world as most know it is bull shit, it will have that effect on you.

       I break it up,  check out some sports, comedy, shit, go get laid.

       Get out the house for a minute.  Take a break, then come back and check it out.  It goes back to educational and interesting. At least for me anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't, at least in my experience, it does make you feel negative about the way things in the world are.  Pessimistic to say the least.

       I belonged to the brighter more rebellious group when they were called hippies. They  were anti war, pro environment and against 'the man'.

       Most of those same people are now  among the  oppressors.

       Sadly, it will be the same with your generations but I'm still here, unchanged and still trying. You do that and hope will be preserved for the future.

       I'm seriously surprised that most people I interact with don't really know what's going on in Syria and don't care. How do you not care about evils in the world? It's very depressing and angering a lot of the time, but I'd still rather search for truth than bury my head in the sand.
