      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If you look at the start of the collapse of the North Tower, the first thing to move is the antenna. The antenna was supported on the hat truss which capped the 47 core columns. For the antenna to move downward, along with the roofline, from the very outset, tells us that all 47 core columns were cut. Since the roofline descends straight down, remaining nearly level (within a few degrees) the cutting of the columns must have been synchronized. The top block is the first part of the building to be destroyed. It is about half gone by the time the top section, as a whole, starts moving down the building.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dave Thomas asserts that I fail to grasp that a falling block should deliver a "dynamic load" in addition to the static load. I am fully aware of the concept of dynamic load. The problem with that argument is that yes, that's what one would expect, but that is not what is observed. Dynamic load arises from the rate of change of momentum. In order to deliver an excess force the falling block would need to lose some of its momentum, in other words slow down. Since the roofline is experiencing uniform downward acceleration, the top block is not losing momentum at all, so it cannot deliver an excess force. The measurement of the actual motion proves that it is not crushing the underlying structure at all. It is falling into a void as the underlying structure is being pulverized by other forces.

       Well clearly the top ppl of govt and media were involved we can at least name 10 ppl who were clearly invovled, foremost of which being George bush himself. I think history will look at that evil man worse than hitler. America will be known as a fascist state.

       It was contractors not people in the government. The government is like a stage. The people in government are highly visible, can't really do much, and on the stage as a result of the people behind the scenes. There are no privileges from being in office. Undoubtedly certain officials played particular roles, but make no mistake the "planning" portion of the operation took place outside the halls of government.

       That may be but for all practical purposes and legally the president of America is to be held responsible. He should be interrogated thoroughly and hung. Wonder why Americans are not asking for this, maybe watching too much pornography.

       excuse me private but can you please restate your question in clear and logical manner? You sound like a robot who's asking a question with no answer. How could columns be "still standing" if you yourself admit "the floors had collapsed all the way to the ground"? 
I'll give you the benefit of doubt and infer you meant: in the course of the demolition why were the central core columns demolished after the peripheral columns that lined the outer circumference of the core? The answer is given by Gordon Ross

       The original quote from David Chandler says this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For the antenna to move downward, along with the roofline, from the very outset, tells us that all 47 core columns were cut
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But we know for a fact that isn't true. The core columns of both buildings stood for 15 or 20 seconds after the collapsing floors had reached the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       So whatever happened to those floors had nothing at all to do with cutting core columns, since they weren't cut.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore the OP is bullshit. Clear enough?

      <p>
       I agree about half of the core columns stood for 15-20 seconds, but only from about the 60th floor down and only the internal 19 columns not all 47. For why I believe that, watch the presentation.

       The steel wreckage is bent in such a way that indicates the floors were severed from the core by explosives at the hat trusses. These trusses were connected to the outer wall of the building and the outer columns of the core. In order to demolish the floors those two sets of columns had to be demolished. There was a moment during the demolition when all of the floors had been blown, and consequently the outer core columns, but the interior core columns had not been blown yet. That's how some of the core columns were standing for 15-20 after the rest of the floors already hit the ground. At the end of the demo the last charges in the interior of the core were ignited and the core came down.

       What about the medical research concludes exclusively that the cancer was caused by excess radiation? Thyroid cancer is not "proof". From where do you pull the "1100% increase" statistic from? And what is being compared in the statistic? The number of people who got thyroid cancer in the wtc event is an increase of 1100% compared to.. everyday occurrences? Compared to normal office fires?

         Stop spamming. 
Look at the photos of ground zero and tell me that your statement is true. http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/photos/groundzero.html#ground Like I've said elsewhere. It's consistent with a 'conventional' demolition.
Go spend a week laboring with a demo crew on a concrete job and you'll realize pretty quick what I'm talking about.
Add on top of that the fact that things are harder to distinguish because of everything being covered in cement dust.
You indoorsy people have no fucking idea about this stuff. Seriously. Go and get a tiny bit of work experience in this in the real world.

         You know what? I hoped for the best and that you just had a bad day the last time I dared to put your hypothesis to the test. As an amateur scientist, I'll touch the paper clip in the power socket a second time to see if it still zaps me - just to ascertain it was not just a coincidence.
Your disruptive tactics, your unwillingness or inability to make your case and defend your theory in a civilized manner, your closed-mindedness, and your paranoid insults - which, on reddit, I have so far only witnessed coming from faithers, debunksters, trusters, and scientifically illiterate reality deniers - too obviously are a systemic attempt at sowing discord; even the flat-earthers were more friendly forwarding their theories, but I'm sure you are too well aware of that, so: shame on you for playing the divide et impera game.

       Yeah don't listen to this guy, if it even is a person. Obviously they're sent by the pentagon or really dumb, either way not worth our time. You can tell he's a shill from his unnecessary and poor use of memes. I wanted to cringe when he said "come at my brah". It's like how are we brahs? he made a dumbass point that didn't address anything LOCKE said and then made that bombastic claim "come at me brah" . Idk about you but this guy screams 33 y/o sargent who's never smoked weed in his life except that one time in 10th grade.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Can Environmental Toxins Cause Thyroid Cancer?

       <p>
        A.Dr. Tuttle responds:
       </p>
       <p>
        Most of the time we don’t know what causes a specific patient’s thyroid cancer. The only well-accepted risk factor for the common types of thyroid cancer — papillary and follicular thyroid cancers — is exposure to ionizing radiation that occurs after exposure to fallout from nuclear reactors (like that following the Chernobyl accident), atomic bombs or therapeutic uses of radiation during young childhood.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, since the incidence of thyroid cancer has dramatically increased over the last 20 years, both in the United States and abroad, many investigators are re-examining the possibility that some environmental factor may be linked to the rise in thyroid cancer. But as of now, no specific chemical or environmental factor has been demonstrated to commonly cause thyroid cancer in humans.

        Summary

       <p>
        Factors that increase autoimmune thyroid disease risk include radiation exposure, both from nuclear fallout and medical radiation, increased iodine intake,
        <strong>
         as well as several contaminants in the environment that influence the thyroid
        </strong>
        . Although ∼70% of the risk for developing autoimmune thyroid disease is attributable to genetic background, environmental triggers are thought to play a role in the development of autoimmune thyroid disease in susceptible individuals.

       <p>
        Conclusions
       </p>
       <p>
        Understanding the association of environmental agents with thyroid dysfunction can be utilized to reduce the risk to populations. Knowledge of the specific factors that trigger autoimmune thyroid disease and their mode of action, however, may also inform risk reduction in the individual patient. These factors are especially relevant for those at increased risk of autoimmune thyroid disease based on family history.

      <p>
       I'm getting pretty bored of talking in circles with you here guy, so until you can show me evidence that the FRs were exposed to radiation other than a correlation between radiation and thyroid cancer risk vs. increase in thyroid cancer among FRs I'm resting my case, because this proves nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that the bullshit they were exposed to is highly toxic, and I provided more than enough link info to back up the fact that radiation
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       likely environmental chemical/pollutants/toxins/etc. (and genetics) are the likely causes of TC, your argument has nothing to stand on.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have built and burned several strawmen, distorted my argument, attempted to talk down to me as if I don't know the difference between lungs and the thyroid to dissuade anyone reading this from actually internalizing my argument, and have just generally been aggressive and toxic, hell one of your posts got deleted because you went all out and started accusing me of being a shill, which is hilarious frankly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I firmly believe that anyone who has managed to lurk through all this back and forth we have had will come to the same conclusions I did upon reading what you posted and engaging with you.

       So you've discovered a brand new cause for thyroid cancer? And leukemia? And skin cancer? And prostate cancer? And breast cancer?  And all of these dozens of other cancers:

      <ul>
       <li>

       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It's "chemical/pollutants/toxins/etc." (and genetics -- that somehow was changed by working at WTC after 9/11).
      </p>
      <p>
       Well since you know more than oncologists on the subject, please do share what elements of "chemical/pollutants/toxins/etc." are risk factors for each of the above cancers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the radiogenic cause is well-known and well-documented. And the "chemical/pollutants/toxins/etc" cause is completely unknown and presumed nonexistent -- at least, that is,

       Wow buddy, check my post history if you like, I just bounce around and add my thoughts or relevant info to things I find interesting.  I have no allegiance to the AE911 group, I just find their arguments more compelling than your frantic ranting and insults.  Point being I genuinely stumbled upon your convo with whatshisface and pointed out what I thought was obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to think he's asking for evidence radiation causes thyroid cancer, when it's obvious to any passerby (myself included, thanks for thinking I'm part of some brigade though, really helps your case) that he's been asking for evidence of radiation in the first responders from post one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence why you answer of "Medical research" I deemed utter shit. He isn't moving any goalposts in regards to that, he wants to know where you are getting the info that they are suffering from the effects of radiation.  Medical docs on radiation being linked to thyroid cancer are supplemental, but not at all substantial to your argument.

       i suggested there might be a "dirty" element in whatever reactant was used to cut the steel.  If the end particles are small enough I would imagine they can get into the thyroid and cause a lot of problems with even just a little radioactivity.  All the thyroid cancer is very troubling... I just don't see the mini-nuke thing.

       Hmm well do post it up if ever come across it... like... ever. I'm super interested in how thermite can produce Iodine-131, because frankly, no it can't -- a simple
       <a href="https://startpage.com/do/search?query=i-131+thermite">
        Google search
       </a>
       can confirm that the two have nothing to do with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would you lie so openly? Why? When you lie so obviously, it really makes us question AE911Truth -- if it takes open deception to support the thermite-alone theory, it's fairly clear that there's something wrong with the theory... and, by extension, the AE911Truth organization.

       So is your assertion that there is a lot of propaganda on which side of the global warning argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you belivee the propaganda supports the proposition that global is real and man js contributing a lot to it
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is the propaganda on the other side?
      </p>
      <p>
       Please be specific
