    <div class="md"><p>yea it&#39;s not flat.  </p>

<p>i admit: some interesting questions are raised.</p>

<p>HOWEVER.  Nearly any high-school physics teacher would be able to provide an answer that support round earth theory.  these presentations often rely on &quot;God&quot; as their basis for questioning round earth theory.  It&#39; not that the questions are not valid.  It&#39;s that they never really want the answer.  They are happier leaving these tangling questions out there -- as if they have remained unanswered mysteries.</p>

<p>BOTTOM LINE:  the flat earth theory is not strongly supported -- likely even disinfo troll sludge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been looking, and it&#39;s baloney. It&#39;s just some guy saying that the water can&#39;t stay curved and whatnot without even knowing the exact explanation. And the exact explanation I believe is a documentary called the primer fields. Now you check that out and explain to me how that&#39;s not the explanation for how planets orbit, or how the water stays &#39;curved&#39; - i.e. attached to earth - and so on. I don&#39;t even think water even is &#39;curved&#39; with all the waves and such, how could you tell? And what, if the water curves, it would explode or what? It would just have more surface tension I assume. You can basically argue as such against any so called argument in favor of flat earth. It&#39;s just not feasible, for one. There would require too much effort to fake the wobble the earth&#39;s axis has, which gives us the seasons. It couldn&#39;t explain how sometimes we see planrts in other positions on the sky at different times. And so on</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I simply won&#39;t believe that you are pointing me to those &#39;scientific&#39; youtube videos. With the homemade rockets, and the balloon with the ruler in the image? I consider that the horizon is not completely flat. There is no argument there, those things aren&#39;t even high enough to notice the curvature. Next: some random study from 1904 which proves that poles of the same height put at 60 km was it don&#39;t drop in distance? Well, from what I read, it seems some other people did that study a few more times and couldn&#39;t replicate. What other arguments are there?</p>

<p>I believe nasa has been lying, and mainstream science is full of baloney. But that doesn&#39;t mean the earth is flat. Nor concave, a dome, whatever. This is just observable stuff. Some guy, Eratosthenes, did a few experiments to prove this and all he needed were two sticks. And that was in antiquity. Imagine what those other guys, the mayans, the sumerians, knew about the Universe. They did not have a flat earth theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hey - that&#39;s fine. I think Nasa is lying too, and I agree just because they are lying doesn&#39;t mean the earth is flat. however I think the flat earth theory is profound. </p>

<p>there are a lot of people coming out and talking about why they are seeing it - from different expertise, maybe don&#39;t worry about it if it doesn&#39;t peek your interest, </p>

<p>I see no reason for flat earth theory to threaten 9/11 truth. the arguments behind are 9/11 truth are sound. it doesn&#39;t need all other conspiracy theories to be anything to remain sound. each thing is true unto itself (or not true) or somewhat true, etc. the only threat to 9/11 truth is fear of questioning government. flat earth theory has no dog in that fight. </p>

I  can tell you that is not applicable to flat earth theory, jet fuel really can&#39;t melt steel beams.

    <div class="md"><p>actually what&#39;s so interesting is we have been measuring for a flat earth all along. not in terms of the mapping, which people have already recognized as having scale issues. but in terms all mechanics and engineering. there are a lot of experts in various fields now confirming - they never account for curvature. navy guys are confirming they don&#39;t account for curvature shooting missiles in the ocean. guys who build train tracks never account for curvature, city planners / architects and engineeres never do it. all our functional measurement is actually already designed for flat - not curve. </p>

<p>it&#39;s true there are a ton of hurdles to get over, some stuff remains the same, that you didn&#39;t even realize already supports flat earth like engineering, some stuff is turned on it&#39;s head like questioning the existence of satellites. no prob it&#39;s too much for you to believe. personally for me it took me a couple months and my first response was to not even give it as much though as you are. it&#39;s probably the biggest hurdle of all conspiracy theories, </p>

<p>this is a navy guy talking about his reasoning fro his experience out on the ocean. he&#39;s a cool &amp; thoughtful guy - just talking about it. not too freaky, </p>

<p>That&#39;s simply untrue. </p>

<p>Because of the height of the towers (693 ft or 211 m) and their distance apart (4,260 ft or 1,298 m), the curvature of the Earth&#39;s surface had to be taken into account when designing the bridge—the towers are 1 5⁄8 inches (41.275 mm) farther apart at their tops than at their bases; they are not parallel to each other.[3][14]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>basic geometry would always apply. if you are at an elevated vantage of course you should account for your elevation - in relation to another point you are observing - yes. </p>

<p>this is why the ocean is such a great place to test this out, because it&#39;s so flat and why navy guy&#39;s testimony I gave you link to is so meaningful. </p>

<p>8&quot; drop is the average. I think it&#39;s actually 8&quot; square the more distance you cover,  - I don&#39;t want to simply it too much - you can look it up. the drop for one mile is supposed to be 8&quot; given circumference being a bit less than ~25.000. miles. this is all - what globe model says we should experience - but as it turns out it&#39;s not what we experience at all.</p>

<p>what people have been noticing is they never see that drop off no matter how far away they are looking. navy guy uses sate of the art tools to view probably furthest distance - and never sees curvature - and never accounts for any curvature when firing missiles. there are tons of u-tube videos out there demonstrating this lack of drop off on land too, this is the first &quot;hard&quot; evidence that usually gets people saying - ok - well yes - that is observable, what you are saying - now what,...why - because it does not jive with the math of globe earth - at least not at the size we think it is. </p>

<p>we should see a mound of earth covering the bottom of a city sky line when we view it from a distance of many miles, but we do not. it shrinks in our view - but uniformly. because of the vanishing point phenomena in our vision. it doesn&#39;t get obscured from the bottom up. as it would if we were on a ball. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the photo at the bottom - across the water in Spain. yes - what they are saying you see in that photo is essentialy what we should see - but it&#39;s a very weak example, what people are realizing - is we&#39;ve always thought things do &quot;sink&quot; in the distance - like what that photo is trying to show an example of - and ships at a distance in the ocean, etc, but what is now clear is they are actually not. a zoom lens will quickly show you - you can still see the bottom of any object - on water too - simply by zooming in. which should not be the case. </p>

<p>as for that photo specifically - I don&#39;t know what to say, it doesn&#39;t look like a strong example to me, esp in contrast - to the vast amount of images showing that &quot;sinking&quot; does not actually happen. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t watched this particular video - so if it&#39;s awful sorry, hopefully it will be good  - I know they should be vetted as the quality varies drastically, but I think this one will show you a stronger example to the contrary of that page on horizon and that picture of italy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes! and you answered. thank you. </p>

<p>btw when I first heard of the theory I was like - schreech - breaks uturn time - finally found a link I will never click on. I know how stupid it sounds when you don&#39;t know what the research is. then later i was just like wekk maybe it&#39;s a good story - i&#39;m bored I&#39;ll let them try to convince me of something they can never convinc me of - given it a shot. about four weeks of resaearch later - I realized they might very well be right, and now when I hear people scof about it - I&#39;m like yeah, I know. but try it anyway, it can&#39;t hurt you. the basis of it is just math about spheres and angles and straight lines applied to our world around us, it&#39;s fun to test what we think we know with geometry, rather than just know it because we were taught it -  if nothing else. </p>

<p>the only absurd assumption you have to make for concave to be perfect, is that LIGHT BENDS. or does it? </p>

<p>i dunno. But with ANY of the cosmological theories you need to make some sort of assumption. </p>

<p>i haven&#39;t come to any conclusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>for me the problem with concave is that the same proof that it&#39;s not globe applies to concave - the curvature is not there. that&#39;s the big thing people are proving now - whatever it really means there is proof that there is no way to prove curvature.  to me that discredits both convex and concave. </p>

<p>I personally suspect whatever we are shape wise is something organic and we may likely be able to find a similar organic shape in the world around us that is a rough/general/bearing some similarity - to scale model  - of our world/ sky above. when I think flat earth I think - a bubble in a pancake you are cooking on a griddle. ~flat base - heat continually rising from below - gas filled dome around - get it at the right temp for bacteria to grow and not be over cooked - you could create a tiny model of the earth within a bubble like that. --- I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s it - but I like to spit ball now i&#39;ve realized globe model is flawed, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s flat now does it? Look, I get all these clues people seem to find like the horizon is flat when it is obviously slightly curved (because the earth is big, you know, you&#39;d have to be a few hundred kms up to see it clearly), but I do not believe things work like that in the universe. We know planets are round shaped, abd that they orbit stars or whatnot in their respective solar systems. We also know suns revolve around other, bigger suns in the galaxy. Because everything in the universe attracts everything else in the Universe. The thing probably even goes further, where you have clusters orbiting some other, bigger clusters and so on. These are things that ancient civilisations knew. Do yoi really think there was this conspiracy back then? 4000, 6000, 10000 years ago? And those other arguments are ridiculous: that the earth is flat and was created by God for us and everything revolving around our flat ass? There&#39;s just no way that could be true</p>

    <div class="md"><p>personally I don&#39;t think earth was created by a god/ God. and yes - you are right proof they are staging ISIS does not prove flat earth. totally agree with you. </p>

<p>my personal belief is we/ former generations jus made a very good guess that it was round - but didn&#39;t understand how to interpret the data. and nasa has been giving a lot of false confirmation cause they roll like that. and it&#39;s all as much a natural mystery as it has always been - intelligent design need not play any part, imo. </p>

<p>there is a lot of observable information that does not singularly &quot;prove&quot; flat earth. (or globe earth) the proof - really against globe earth and presenting flat earth as next best theory - takes some time and a collection of cumulative evidence. </p>

<p>it&#39;s worth looking into. people have put a lot of work into collecting the evidence, it&#39;s not a trick to discredit conspiracy - or anything beyond what it is - a very strong theory that the earth may in fact be flat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I think it&#39;s a bogus conspiracy theory. It&#39;s one of those which shed a negative light on the whole conspiracy thing, so people would stay away from 9/11 and vaccines, medicine, pesticides, etc. There is no conspiracy, because have you seen those guys with their theories? They believe the earth is FLAT! What a bunch of lunatics! Bahahahaa! </p>

<p>While I agree all possibilities should be entertained, this conspiracy thing is full of trolls and paid posters and misinformation, and definitely has an agenda, if not more. You have to make a distinction, you can&#39;t believe everything you see!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are wrong in thinking flat earth is talked about to discredit 9/11 truth. 9/11 truth is provable via an abundance of strong evidence. I can understand how you would wonder what you are saying about a discrediting agenda - but it&#39;s not the case here. maybe it was with the reptilians, and the fear mongering over Jade helm. but flat earth is quite different. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish I knew, I can only guess,  the theory doesn&#39;t really argue either way - just focussing on what we can prove/disprove about earth. but there are a lot of subsequent questions about how close the sun and moon really are. (maybe they are much closer) and there is also the question if the moon really has a material surface, and might be just an optical phenomena. but one giant inconceivable questioning at a time .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the photo at the bottom - across the water in Spain. yes - what they are saying you see in that photo is essentialy what we should see - but it&#39;s a very weak example, what people are realizing - is we&#39;ve always thought things do &quot;sink&quot; in the distance - like what that photo is trying to show an example of - and ships at a distance in the ocean, etc, but what is now clear is they are actually not. a zoom lens will quickly show you - you can still see the bottom of any object - on water too - simply by zooming in. which should not be the case. </p>

<p>as for that photo specifically - I don&#39;t know what to say, it doesn&#39;t look like a strong example to me, esp in contrast - to the vast amount of images showing that &quot;sinking&quot; does not actually happen. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t watched this particular video - so if it&#39;s awful sorry, hopefully it will be good  - I know they should be vetted as the quality varies drastically, but I think this one will show you a stronger example to the contrary of that page on horizon and that picture of italy</p>
