       I have been working on this for a few months now, and I'm pretty much done with it now with a few flaws which are only noticeable to me.

       I've had this idea where like minded people can get together and tackle as many conspiracies (without using the word conspiracy and replacing it with words like subterfuge) together and write up articles and not just refutable articles, I'm talking about irrefutable articles we can use as proof to stop those annoying ass debates with friends and family. All in one site.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to start contacting popular people like StormCloudsGathering and AMTV and possibly donate to them just to get this site more recognition, the more people we get together the better we can finally put an end to all the bullshit lies corporate media have been feeding us for years, years before our grandparents were even alive, it's a great fucking time to be alive and finally put an end to this tyrannical chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me know if you guys have any suggestions and what not, if any of the r/conspiracy mods are interested in becoming a mod on this site let me know, you guys are on top of my priority list.

       I like the simplicity of the layout, no flashy web 2.0 nonsense or ads bouncing around. HTTPS would be a definite bonus given the subject matter, and a non collection/retention of IP logs policy. Best of luck!

       You posted the link on where you can create articles, that section is for articles you want to write up yourself. The link is better off in the forums section at Wisdom and Intuition&gt;Subterfuge and Propaganda kind of how I did with this video here:

       So out of curiosity, what does your site have that the scores of others that serve the same purpose and the same community don't?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, you've just created a fast food burger joint. Cool. Everyone here likes fast food burgers. So why should we eat your burgers when there are countless other established burger joints already available to us?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another question: You say you're going to have irrefutable articles that will put an end to debates. If dozens and dozens of other sites (not to mention books, videos, etc.) have been unable to do that, how will you manage to get a different result?

       This is new. It will grow, like a child, in its own direction. Different inputs over time will determine what comes of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your question could have been proposed to every new thing, like Reddit, like Amazon, like Facebook. How this evolves cannot be predicted. Good ideas and good creations should be encouraged.

       None of that really answers the question.
      </p>
      <p>
       The examples you give aren't very good ones, either. The sites you mention
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       new things in some ways, providing innovations to things that came before. They succeeded in part because they improved on existing formulas.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my question for OP. What is
       <em>
        his
       </em>
       innovation to what came before? What's different? The answer to why visit Reddit rather than Digg was obvious, or why use Facebook instead of Myspace. It's not so obvious here. You say this is a new thing, but I'm not seeing the "new" part. It's just another conspiracy forum in a veritable sea of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP does point out that his branding is different, however, and that much is true. He's naming himself in a different way than other conspiracy sites have. That's a good place to start.
      </p>

       I agree. That's why I'm asking these questions. So I can see if there is something here worth encouraging.

       These things take time. And right now, right now is the perfect time for you to post something original. Get things started with a bang. The first efforts of members will help steer the future direction of a new-born thing like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is so very new, to me it seems that your question is much like asking a fertilized human embryo what his career achievements will be when he attains adulthood. I endorse all good things until I detect that they are evil. I detect a certain mindset in the site's creator and I approve his effort. Yes, there are a lot of forums and groups out there taking on similar topics, but that only makes sense as they are all human efforts to help expose the evil and to hopeful find a way for individuals to find solutions to mankind's vexing problems.

       The more knowledge in one website the better, other people tend to stick with one subject as opposed to what I've created here.

      <p>
       The dozens of sites, books, videos you speak of have done a great job for people like us who don't have the attention span of a dog, as opposed to your average incompetent human sheep who accepts everything the corporate media feeds them.

       Most websites and books in their eye have controvertional titles like "9/11 was a false flag" and or "TheRealConspiracy.com" as opposed to what I've named this site "Nexidy" which is something new and unique.

       You may not think it's a competition, but it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       . If you want your site to succeed in being a valuable resource, you have to give people a reason to go there and use it. Without that, it's just another Internet billboard no one sees.
      </p>
      <p>
       What reason are you giving people? You're not really describing anything that doesn't already exist on a dozen other sites, nor have you described anything I'll find on your site that I can't already find somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to create something new and useful, that's important. That's why I ask, why should we eat your burgers when there are countless other established burger joints already available to us?

      <p>
       If you want your endeavor to be successful, I shouldn't be the one asking these questions. You should be asking them of yourself.

       Neither of these statements says anything; they completely lack substance.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I understand it, though, your website will actually have some substance, right? I do hope you plan for your articles to be more focused and substantive, otherwise I'm not really sure what the site's purpose will be.
      </p>

        Most websites and books in their eye have controvertional titles like "9/11 was a false flag" and or "TheRealConspiracy.com" as opposed to what I've named this site "Nexidy" which is something new and unique.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This seems like the most substantive answer so far. Basically, your website has a more interesting, less controversial name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fair enough. Branding is important, and a site that doesn't bill itself like the usual conspiracy site might have a better chance of reaching people than Black Helicopters Central or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a good idea and is definitely unique in this corner of the 'Net. A good place to start, I think.

       Good luck.

       Rather than being sarky you should take time to listen to this guy. He is giving you time and considered criticism. These can be useful to either take on board or not if you understand why not. Your response comes off as immature and defensive. Your site is competing for attention. That is irrefutable. You explicitly outline your plans for growth. That leads to his comment that if you want to attract attention in a busy space what is your unique angle? 
Why should I visit your initially quieter site when there are already very busy alternatives. That question is helpful and essential not threatening to a new endeavour.

       When you say "this isn't a competition," that usually means, you know, that you don't think it's a competition.

      <p>
       Absolutely none of this is relevant in any way. I'm not sure why you'd even bring up advertisements, and not a single person cares about your background. The topic is your
       <em>
        website
       </em>
       and what it offers.

      <p>
       That all sounds
       <em>
        fantastic
       </em>
       , but you won't have any of that if people don't go to your site in the first place. The only way they
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       is if you give them a reason to go to your site rather than the many others that already provide the same sort of content, topics and community you say you plan to provide.
      </p>
      <p>
       By definition, you're competing for eyeballs and clicks.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I've been asking is, why should I (or anyone else) go to your site instead of one of the many established sites providing the same thing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only do I think it's a fair question, it's a question I hope you asked yourself when you created it. If you want to succeed in creating what you want to create - and again, I wish you good luck with it - it's something you have to consider, otherwise it's destined for failure.

       He is asking you questions that can be answered by just using the site. If he doesn't it like it, fine the he won't use it. I think it is a cool site and will check on it and try to contribute as much as I can. Thanks for putting in the effort!

       Great work man. I would definitely get an SSL on the go. Also if you're using Wordpress, get it locked the fuck down because this site will absolutely get targeted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like the simple design a lot and it seems very quick. You might just want to keep an eye out on some of your mobile layout work. Especially on the forum sections.

       Seriously well played though. You deserve some serious kudos for getting this put together :)

       I think conspiracy is a fine word to step away from. it has a lot of derrogatory connotations, but at the same time I think we could easily own it, and it would be fine either way,. it's a nice point it's not as dirty a word as it used to be,

       cool!! I noticed you have "the archaic belief of the earth's shape" the new flat earth theory is new and based on new research, I'd like to see it included, maybe as "new flat earth theory" or "questioning shape of the earth" or just "flat earth theory" , as "archaic belief" is a bit dismissive and not entirely accurate, you can research the new theory and see it's a legit discourse, if you have doubts. as I know many who recognize other stuff about world banks, 9/11, false flags - stop at flat earth and say no way, but it's a sincere debate.

       that said love your web site - very strong mission statement. :) yay.

       Thanks:) the term "flat earth" is what draws people away from learning this topic, I have researched this topic myself and it truly is a sincere debate, that's why I named it "the archaic belief of the earth's shape".

       There is no sincere debate that the earth is flat. None. Zero. Nonsense. Flat earth garbage is used to discredit serious conspiracy researchers. Nothing more, nothing less

       hm, yes it is quite a repellant isn't it. even people saying it's throwing too much shade on 9/11 truth because it's making all conspiracy theory look bad, ha, ugh. I disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       you can name it what you like - thanks for sharing your reasoning, but I do think the word archaic is not accurate since the new theory is based on new research.
      </p>
      <p>
       but either way, nice to chat with somebody else who sees the flat earth questions as legitimate.

        So why should we eat your burgers when there are countless other established burger joints already available to us?

       You can eat my burgers and eat the burgers at the other joints as well. This isn't a competition like capitalism is bro.

        You say you're going to have irrefutable articles that will put an end to debates. If dozens and dozens of other sites (not to mention books, videos, etc.) have been unable to do that, how will you manage to get a different result?

       The more knowledge in one website the better, other people tend to stick with one subject as opposed to what I've created here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dozens of sites, books, videos you speak of have done a great job for people like us who don't have the attention span of a dog, as opposed to your average incompetent human sheep who accepts everything the corporate media feeds them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most websites and books in their eye have controvertional titles like "9/11 was a false flag" and or "TheRealConspiracy.com" as opposed to what I've named this site "Nexidy" which is something new and unique.

       This is new. It will grow, like a child, in its own direction. Different inputs over time will determine what comes of this.

       Your question could have been proposed to every new thing, like Reddit, like Amazon, like Facebook. How this evolves cannot be predicted. Good ideas and good creations should be encouraged.
