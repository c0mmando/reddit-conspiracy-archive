        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The first thing I noticed was how well placed Lee Harvey Oswald shooting position was. The road is more downwardly sloped than the movies make it look, making the target very stable for about 5 seconds.
The second thing I noticed was that the Grassy Knoll would be a terrible shooting position. From that position you would be very visable, the vehicle (target) would be moving left to right rather quickly, and the crowd would be so close you would have people feeling the blast wave move their hair. It is that close! The shots from there would be 10x louder than from the 6th floor window. Very memorable and obvious! The only other good shooting position would be on/under the bridge in front of the motorcade. Great line, but very vulnerable!
No comment on the broader conspiracy, but being there answred a bunch of my questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep in mind this would tie into the theories about the alleged stopping/near stopping of the car just before the fatal shot. Right at the prepainted white marker on the curb. Puts the shooter much closer. According to the jfk to 911 movie someone else linked to, the young man who delivered the fatal shot arrived at his work covered in mud on a hot dry day in Dallas, in obvious distress, and went to the bathroom and threw up. His coworker/boss thought it so strange (and having heard about the assassination over the radio) he called the police who supposedly recorded it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem I have with this point is the amount of high-velocity lead you have flying around a small space, all aimed at one point.
That car would have 16 or more impact points and a similar number of exit points. Everyone would get hit, and some bystanders as well considering the deflections off of the pavement that they mention.
I am open to a second shooter in the storm drain, and will look at that tomorrow.</p>

<p>You know, when you dismiss with mocking and hyperbole (&quot;unicorns or aliens&quot;??) rather than reasoned discourse, it says more about you than the subject at hand. Given our high shill to user ratio, I&#39;d even suggest it gives the subject more credibility, not less.</p>
