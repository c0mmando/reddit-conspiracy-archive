       From pages 386, and 387 in William Bramley's

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Bank of England continued to support Hitler even after the Nazi dictator embarked on his program of conquest.
After Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia in violation of the nonaggression pact between then-Prime Minister Chamberlain of England and Hitler, the Bank of England gave Nazi Germany six million Pounds of Czech gold reserves held by the Bank.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the same way that a small clique of German petty princes had made a fortune from war in the 18th century
by renting soldiers to warring nations,
        <strong>
         a small clique of banks and multinational corporations made a large profit
by providing goods and services to both sides fighting in World War II
        </strong>
        . After giving early support to Hitler, the
Bank of England naturally provided loans to Britain to fight Hitler. At the same time that the German subsidiaries
of I.T.T. and General Electric were giving money to the SS and providing needed services to Nazi Germany, other
branches in America and elsewhere were aiding Germany's enemies. As I. G. Farben fueled Hitler's war machine in
Germany, one of its old cartel partners, Standard Oil, fueled the allied effort against Germany. While the Ford Motor
Company produced materials for the American army to fight Germany, Ford plants in Germany were turning out
military vehicles for the Nazis. No matter who won the war, those banks and companies would profit and find favor with
whoever emerged victorious.
       </p>
       <p>
        The overwhelming role that various bankers and industrialists
played in propping up Hitler and in building the Nazi war machine has caused some historians to view
those bankers and industrialists as the true powers behind Naziism.

       Many say it ultimately

       Hitler was a puppet to the West (not a good guy, can burn in hell for all I care). I suggest you re research the history of WW2 and not from your grade school or college textbooks. The West played Hitler and Hitler was not smart enough to realize he was being fucked like a parlor whore. WW2 create what TPTB wanted in the end. It was either supporting USSR to do it or NAZI Germany to do it, either way,
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       (TPTB) won.

       Translation:  "Look.  I'm not going to discard my comfortably held belief system just because you throw some facts at me, dammit.  Either give me some elementary, bite size pieces of monosyllabic data that your average 5 year old can grasp, or I'll just continue spouting off at the mouth like I know what I'm talking about instead of making any real sense.

       An insult is, in part, a statement that's untrue.  As such, there has been exactly no insult that has taken place.  You've been given what you need to understand what's being talked about here, but you're not intelligent enough to understand it or go through it.  Again, that's not an insult.  It's a fact demonstrated by your responses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go through what's been given to you.  Or not.  Don't, and continue thinking you know what you're talking about.  At the end of the day, it is only you that ends up looking like a dunce.  No one else.

       You didn't look at the video.  At absolute best, you touched upon a tiny bit of it only.  I know.  You didn't look through the entire thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that your small mind obviously, desperately needs to make sure that it is the last one to make a response so that you can go to sleep thinking that "Ha!  I got the last word! therefore, I'm right!  I'm right!  I was the right one!" lol.  Shit is
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       funny actually.  Very funny indeed.  With that in mind, and considering that there is nothing more to say other than that you continue showing and proving that you know nothing and are only here to continue trolling for the sake of your own, small, damaged ego, I shall allow you to go ahead and say whatever it is you feel you need to say to save your desperate cognitive dissonance from getting the better of you.  I know you gerbil-brained types have a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       difficult time sleeping better at night when you can't hold on to the security blanket of your false belief systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, go ahead, little one.  Take it away.  Have the last word, and enjoy thinking you A) had a point in any of this, and B) that I will actually read your last response.

       I didn't claim to have watched the video, and therefore don't have notes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did challenge the same user you did for linking me a long video instead of text...But I watched
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       video and took notes, you can look through my posts and see that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I probably will watch
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       video at some point, and I will notify when I do that with my notes/observations.  If you have the time I suggest you do the same thing.

       You said you watched it but you have no response that proves it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like you wanted that other guy "IN HIS OWN WORDS" to break it down, I would like you to break it down...
      </p>
      <p>
       I've watched part of it, and these are my minimal notes:

       <a href="http://youtu.be/dTnHcHsUNM0">
        http://youtu.be/dTnHcHsUNM0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       2:40 "Nazism had been mostly a jewish controlled movement"
      </p>
      <p>
       4:18 "Nazism, like communism, was another operation of the jewish bankers"
      </p>
      <p>
       7:17 "Jewish bankers were concerned Jewish race was disappearing through assimilation"
      </p>
      <p>
       7:35 "ghetto system was always desired by rabbis"
      </p>
      <p>
       10:07 "they preferred to live in Nazi Germany instead of Palestine"
      </p>
      <p>
       10:44 "Rothchild had setup, through WW1 and destruction of Turkish empire to enable themselves to set up a Jewish state in Palestine"
      </p>
      <p>
       10:48 "only resistance they met was for jewish community itself"
      </p>
      <p>
       11:40 "hitler worked for communists who took over munich in 1919, for 6 months"
      </p>
      <p>
       12:17 "hitler orchestrating controlled opposition to communism"
      </p>
      <p>
       14:07 "Modus Operandi of Communism is to kill Intelligentsia of countries they take over"
      </p>
      <p>
       14:15 "Nazism subverted education system"
      </p>
      <p>
       17:15 "Hitler marching in Jewish funeral procession"
      </p>
      <p>
       20:00 PAUSED
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have watched it, as you have claimed many times, I would expect you to have a few notes, or at the bare fucking minimum to have general observations and points from the video to agree with or refute.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead you keep asking me if I've watched it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You sound like a bullshitter and I'm calling you out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Respond and prove me wrong.

       He was pressing you for textual information, like I was in the other thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched the video you linked and provided notes for you to corroborate/refute/expand on, which you did.
      </p>
      <p>
       He obviously isn't willing to put any effort into obtaining knowledge, and even after being called out multiple times he still refuses to contribute anything real to the discussion.

      <p>
       It's my own fault for feeding a troll, but this guy has been annoying me enough to push a little bit and see how deep under the bridge he lives.

       He's
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       deep under the bridge.  Like...he's a permanent resident.  Yeah.  I did the same thing and fed him for a while (unfortunately), but I just absolutely
       <em>
        had
       </em>
       to stop after a while.  100% troll indeed.  He is just either a shill who is being paid to be disruptive, or he's literally
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       stupid.  I hope for his sake that he's actually a shill and not a troll because in that case at least he's getting
       <em>
        paid
       </em>
       to be an evil p.o.s. instead of actually being
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       However...if he's a shill, then that means he's actually spending as much time as he has in being
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       much of a shill...in which case, he's going WAY above and beyond the call of his shill duty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, it seems that either way one looks at it - whether he's a shill or a troll - either situation is REALLY bad in his case...like
       <em>
        ruefully
       </em>
       bad.

       Sad rally.  Oh well.  Shake your head and move on.  There are all types of dreadful mindsets on this planet.  That's what this planet is.  They don't call it a "planet of sorrows" for nothing.
