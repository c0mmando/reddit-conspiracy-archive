<p>The part about confiscated cell phones was removed from the New York Post article sometime last night/this morning. The excised paragraph and the now edited link:</p>

<p>&quot;Sometime later, students’ cell phones were confiscated and they were escorted out of their buildings with their hands up as authorities patted them down and lined them up to be evacuated on buses, according to NRToday.&quot; <a href="http://nypost.com/2015/10/01/oregon-gunman-singled-out-christians-during-rampage/">Oregon gunman singled out Christians during rampage</a></p>

The second pic doesn&#39;t prove credibility, either.
Both give the impression of photos supplied to ops, in order to be used to combat chatroom doubters.

    <div class="md"><p>The card wasn&#39;t what was being questioned. It was the superimposed look of the ink with your username and the date, on the torn piece of paper. It wasn&#39;t in the correct depth of field, and the angle looked far too &quot;flat&quot;, to be written on a piece of torn, slightly crumpled paper. 
You had a &quot;New Student Orientation&quot; folder in the pic, which seems odd for an employee. 
You agreed with another poster that suggested that you do a <a href="/r/IAmA">/r/IAmA</a> with moderation, when your &quot;proof&quot; wasn&#39;t being challenged. I questioned your &quot;proof&quot;, as it looks highly suspect.
Now, you are &quot;done convincing&quot; us. 
I understand a great deal more about how such ops are carried out than you might guess, and I do not believe you. You may be an attention seeker and not an op, but your sloppy work is not below the threshhold of &quot;acceptable&quot; in today&#39;s intel world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, that is a &quot;New Student Orientation&quot; Folder, which anyone (including ops) could have, so really, it doesn&#39;t constitute proof.
If it were my job to pretend to be a surviving victim, thus using the emotions of the public to make them feel as though they were being horrible people, (and to synthesize a de-bunking), I would probably be supplied with either a picture of such items, or the items themselves. News interviews, corroboration with other witnesses on camera, THOSE would go a long way to prove a claim of someone being there.</p>

People with known internet presences are still slipping through the cracks and shooting up schools? Or are they.  Specific information is being censored,  disinformation is being pushed.</p>

<p>Two top r/news stories surrounding this event are posted and followed based on hearsay- the one regarding christians being singled out and the one regarding Chris Mintz charging the shooter. The truth doesn&#39;t seem to be the objective here.</p>

<p>Phones confiscated, backpacks searched, no independent images of the shooting, a campaign to ignore the shooter&#39;s identity, reddit censorship, conflicting news reports of a drill, witnesses reporting hearing no shots fired, the mayor a known gun-rights supporter, Obama&#39;s timely and political speech...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks K-Vox. In addition, they also had drills in Roseburg in March and in June, or maybe it was July. So although we do not see a drill scheduled for this exact place and time, as we did with Sandy Hook and Charleston, it&#39;s consistent with our theory that the feds are at these locations in advance and training for mass casualty incidents completely similar to the ones that eventually occur.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t hunt for exceptions to preconception, find flaws with the occurrence. The fact that someone doesnt interview the way you think they should isn&#39;t a red flag. This was a traumatic event, people don&#39;t act normally during traumatic events. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>no shots heard by the interviewee or anyone he knows.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never heard the shots at the Ruggles T-Station when I went to Northeastern, but they certainly happened. I also wasn&#39;t locking myself in a room in a separate building. This doesn&#39;t strike me as especially suspect. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>this woman just appears thrilled that her friend is in critical condition and she too could have been killed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually her friend was cleared and not in critical condition. If you watched the interview the bullet missed her spine and lungs, and there was jsut muscle tissue damage. All in all a great prognosis. Minor surgery to remove the round and she&#39;s on the mend. That being said, if you watch the interview without the preceding video poisoning the well you can see that she isn&#39;t happy. She&#39;s quite nervous. You could shoot a video of yourself crying and I can snap still that look like you&#39;re smiling too, especially if you&#39;re staring into direct sunlight. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Which is well answered above.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The presence of one or two bizarre interviews is not in and of itself evidence of anything. The altogether absence of the type of reactions you would expect from this sort of situation is what&#39;s far more telling. I would urge anybody to link me to a video where you see someone who is clearly emotionally distraught, representative of a normal human reaction to loss and tragedy.</p>

<p>So, here we go again. As in every false flag...every single one...I am to simply believe that &quot;not all people react to trauma the same.&quot; While this statement is indeed true, to see the lack of standard traumatic reactions from virtually every person in each false flag, you&#39;d have to be a believer in amazing coincidences that each and every one of these people just happen to be different than us and are largely unemotional.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had a lot of loss in my family, and those closest to the tragedy were inconsolable, and my aunt, who lost her 18 year-old son a decade ago, still breaks down when talking about him. But we just don&#39;t see this in the eyes and faces of parents of Sandy Hook and other similar events. Any of them. Are you familiar with Andy Parker, the father of the Virginia live TV shooting &quot;victim&quot;, Allison? Is he just another person who simply &quot;reacts differently&quot; to trauma? Ask yourself...what kind of person must he be to laugh and dance while enjoying beverages at a fundraiser just two days later? He must grieve differently. This woman was supposed to have been shot live on air, killed suddenly and tragically, and this guy chooses to appear on TV that night giving a BS interview instead of spending time grieving with family.</p>

<p>So...is it more bizarre for me to believe that this lack of emotion from participants is actually telling of something deeper, rather than simply believing in coincidence theory, that all these people just happen to express zombie-like emotion when experiencing trauma? Regardless of whether or not this Baynardo woman&#39;s friend will survive, 30 people were still shot, many of whom died. Not at all something I&#39;d be laughing through a couple hours later when I could have easily been targeted.</p>

<p>Any opinions on the Virginia TV shooting? Once you discover how fake that is, you truly have to start questioning anything you see.</p>

<p>Demonstrably false. Everything you&#39;ve said above is demonstrably false. Do you really think there&#39;s no media showing reactions to traumatic events when you view the media output from these shootings? </p>

<p>Your assertion that it was fake is utterly mind boggling. You do understand why you do this though, right? You have an assumption that bad things like this don&#39;t just happen, someone must be behind this and that someone must have an agenda. </p>

<p>Well the someone is the shooter, and their agenda is attention. Calling every shooting  fake is purposeless. After all, why in the world would a government perpetrate something like Newtown, or the latest shooting? What&#39;s the purpose and incentive? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You too are holding an assumption - that I think bad things don&#39;t occur. Of course I think that, and I know that.</p>

<p>Regarding the pictures you linked to - great, there&#39;s a still photo of Carlee Soto looking distraught. That&#39;s a photo that is shown in almost every collage. Convenient that someone was there to snap her photo right as she was hearing the news. I don&#39;t see any tears, though, nor do I in the other two photos.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an interview with Carlee a few days later. She does a decent job at first, but glows while talking. No nasal discharge.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agl4rib4n4U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agl4rib4n4U</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s an interview with the whole Soto family, also a couple days later. Seems like a pretty joyous occasion! Watch these people recall generic details about Victoria as they laugh and joke around.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZMd5XM_OCo#t=09m05s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZMd5XM_OCo#t=09m05s</a></p>

<p>Speaking of Vicki Soto...have you seen the class photo from 2012? Why is the only class photo we get such horrible quality, and why are there so many deficiencies? Why is Vicki&#39;s hand photoshopped?
<a href="https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/web_sandy_school-525x429.jpg?w=525&amp;amp;h=429&amp;amp;crop=1">https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/web_sandy_school-525x429.jpg?w=525&amp;amp;h=429&amp;amp;crop=1</a></p>

<p>And this is one of the few family photos we got of the Sotos. Why might the shadow from Vicki be pointing in a different direction? I&#39;ve yet to find a spot on Earth where I can change the angle of a shadow by stepping five feet to the side.

<p>So, we have a couple photoshopped items here, and still no tears from the family. How will you attempt to rationalize this?</p>

<p>Regarding the Virginia shooting - this is an absolute hoax, 100%. Instead of arguing with me, look up and watch/read about it. Have you seen the shooter&#39;s POV video? Why are there no shell casings, why is there virtually no recoil in comparison to a real 9mm, and why does the woman run away after being shot point blank? The real smoking gun, however, is in the wooden boards.</p>

<p>The pictures in the link below should speak for themselves. Doubtlessly, the wooden boards behind Allison are perpendicular to the ones she is standing on. Those boards run all the way up to the pillar directly behind her. This is the first pillar behind her.</p>

<p>The overhead shot of the scene is shown below that. Now, forget the fact that there&#39;s no blood anywhere near Adam. Take a look at those wooden boards. They&#39;re now all pointing in the same direction! What?! They cleaned up the bloody mess and changed wooden boards before they even removed the dead body? Quite odd, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/3XF50">http://imgur.com/a/3XF50</a></p>

<p>Watch the videos of the shooting to verify what I&#39;m saying is correct, and that Allison and Adam are standing between the same two pillars. Either the news footage was captured on a different day, or this is being shot in a separate location. Either way, it&#39;s an absolutely massive bombshell and proves that this is anything but your ordinary crime scene.</p>

<p>So, yes, my assertion that it is fake IS mind-boggling. If you don&#39;t know about it. That&#39;s how this all began for me, too. Once you realize one event is fake, it brings many, many others into question. Before long, it&#39;s easy to see how the media slowly but surely brings more and more questions about gun control each time another shooting happens. More will happen, and you will see more of the same. These are psychological operations being used to study public reaction and media/information manipulation. It&#39;s quite the sad state of affairs.</p>

<p>So I must ask, after reviewing that page, what do you now think of the Virginia shooting? Are you at all suspicious? If not, I ask you to open your mind a little bit. What might you be basing YOUR knowledge off of? The fact that the news reported the murders? Trust of the sources? Why is that stance any more plausible than mine?</p>

<p>Regarding the pictures you linked to - great, there&#39;s a still photo of Carlee Soto looking distraught. That&#39;s a photo that is shown in almost every collage. Convenient that someone was there to snap her photo right as she was hearing the news. I don&#39;t see any tears, though, nor do I in the other two photos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that&#39;s a goalpost move. We&#39;ve gone from &quot;show me someone looking distraught IT DOESN&#39;T EXIST!&quot; to &quot;Well, she&#39;s not crying.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Speaking of Vicki Soto...have you seen the class photo from 2012? Why is the only class photo we get such horrible quality, and why are there so many deficiencies? Why is Vicki&#39;s hand photoshopped?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On what basis do you think this hand is photoshopped?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And this is one of the few family photos we got of the Sotos. Why might the shadow from Vicki be pointing in a different direction?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not, the light source is consistent for all shadows, behind the subjects of the photo. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, we have a couple photoshopped items here, and still no tears from the family. How will you attempt to rationalize this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your false assumption followed by a challenge to prove you wrong when you&#39;ve supplied no support for your assertions that these are photoshopped.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regarding the Virginia shooting - this is an absolute hoax, 100%. Instead of arguing with me, look up and watch/read about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve seen the relevant materials. It is not a hoax. The fact you think so is still mind boggling when rather than supplying your evidence, you insist I just look it up. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you seen the shooter&#39;s POV video? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are there no shell casings</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Several recovered at the scene matching the gun. Are you asking why you didn&#39;t see any in the video? If so, I&#39;d suggest you didn&#39;t watch the video. The firearm is off camera for 99% of the video. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>why is there virtually no recoil in comparison to a real 9mm,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s plenty in the video, plus the camera is also shaking like crazy, making any determination of &#39;no recoil&#39; largely impossible.  Not sure how you&#39;d be able to suggest this if you had seen the video. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and why does the woman run away after being shot point blank? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you really questioning why someone would run away from live gunfire? The POV video does not show the entirety of the shots fired. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The real smoking gun, however, is in the wooden boards...Take a look at those wooden boards. They&#39;re now all pointing in the same direction! What?! They cleaned up the bloody mess and changed wooden boards before they even removed the dead body? Quite odd, isn&#39;t it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the hell are you talking about? Again, this is all quite easily explained by the fact that the entirety of the gunfire did not take place in one 10&#39; x 10&#39; location. Did that ever occur to you? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Either way, it&#39;s an absolutely massive bombshell and proves that this is anything but your ordinary crime scene.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or you just made assumptions about what happened and assumed the evidence provided didn&#39;t match your preconceptions, or the preconceptions of the conspiracy theorist that poisoned the well for you before you actually looked into it. And police tape is used to bar exit and entrance to a crime scene. You use as little of it as possible and cover all the relevant exits and entrances, you do not setup some huge movie-like line around the scene, That&#39;d be Hollywood, not reality. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, yes, my assertion that it is fake IS mind-boggling. If you don&#39;t know about it. That&#39;s how this all began for me, too.

</blockquote>

<p>There has been absolutely zero restrictive change to gun control legislation in the wake of all of these shootings. If that is their goal, and they&#39;re a huge powerful shadowy organization pulling the strings, then why the hell would they put on a dog and pony show and not just pass a bill in congress? No actors needed, no public debate, no conspiracies for you to tug at. </p>

<p>&quot;Here&#39;s the new gun control law, we&#39;ve bought all the necessary votes, all set.&quot; </p>

<p>Seriously dude, use your head. There&#39;s no need for this Rube Goldberg style manipulation of the public and no one would put in the effort to do so. It&#39;s ridiculous because it&#39;s utterly stupid. No one would be so smart as to be able to stage and hoax all these shootings and simultaneously not be smart enough to get gun control legislation passed without staging mass shootings.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Shell casings were recovered from the scene.&quot; This is exactly the kind of thing we&#39;re told and are expected to believe. The authorities who were there the moment the shooting was aired on television are in on it.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an interview with Keli Kohlmeier, who lives closest to the shooting scene. She states very plainly that the feds were storming her apartment right around 6:45. She does NOT have an agenda - she begins the interview with full faith in the official story, but eventually realizes that it&#39;s a big cover-up. I&#39;ve listened in its entirety, and there&#39;s nothing Professor Doom states that is false.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3fR--wsWL0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3fR--wsWL0</a></p>

<p>So while those who view the news are in a state of belief, even the woman who was right there when it happened wasn&#39;t convinced anything really happened, and concedes that something really, really strange is going on.</p>

<p>Ok, regarding the Virginia shooting again. I don&#39;t think you understood my point. Watch the news footage again if you can. While one may understand why Allison would be out of the shot, there&#39;s little credibility in any contention that Adam is in a different area of the complex. That&#39;s where they were standing during the news clip, and that&#39;s where he continues to lay. It&#39;s at the end of the top deck that overlooks the bay. In a standard crime scene, his body would not have moved from this very spot.</p>

<p>Look closely at those wooden boards, man. Use YOUR head. They are in a different pattern in those shots. Plain as day. No, the rationalization that the body is in a different spot from the news clip isn&#39;t sound. Those boards were replaced between the time the footage was shot and the time this photo was taken.</p>

<p>The news footage was very likely not shot on the same day it aired. How convenient was it that we caught just one grainy frame in which we can see the shooter&#39;s face? Though it&#39;s similar to Flanagan, we can&#39;t be positive it&#39;s really him. Don&#39;t fool yourself into thinking that we were so lucky as to get one, and only one, still frame of his face.</p>

<p>See, I had no preconceptions about this shooting. You can look back on my posting history and see that I was even quelling the ideas that it was a hoax that morning. I truly did think it was real. But once I saw the videos and saw how the story unfolded, it began to look suspicious. When Andy Parker and Chris Hurtz took to TV that night, I got even more suspicious. Once the side-by-side gun footage was posted, and once these photos were compared to the footage, it then became clear to me that we have another false flag on our hands. It wasn&#39;t without evidence that I came to this conclusion. Fact is, there is no definitive evidence in either direction. I don&#39;t have any reason to believe a suicidal maniac would pocket his cell phone camera after three shots without showing anything resembling a real wound. They try to condition us to accept the news as reality, when indeed, it IS more like Hollywood.</p>

<p>As far as who does this...look into FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security. They are constantly, actively running mass shooter drills and similar exercises that allow them to build a scene that resembles a real-life tragic event. There was a drill occurring the morning of Sandy Hook in southern Connecticut, one that was directly related to mass casualty events involving children (which had oddly enough never really happened before that day). There was an active shooter drill in Charleston the same weekend the church was shot up.</p>

<p>Sure, many of these claims alone sound completely crazy, and I&#39;d agree. But there&#39;s much, much more out there you can discover, even at the tip of the rabbit hole. I won&#39;t be diving into everything in one post on Reddit, but I urge everyone to look at the &quot;Hoax&quot; material for themselves and think very hard about what you really know, and what you know based on what you&#39;ve simply been told.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave one more quick link, I know it won&#39;t change any minds, but it&#39;s a peek behind the curtain of the fraud we deal with in national media now.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmWmxBO0hI#t=03m55s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmWmxBO0hI#t=03m55s</a></p>

<p>As soon as he mentions the drills the DHS is running, she suddenly cuts him off, communicates with the control room, and they then cut to another reporter for an &quot;update.&quot; But in that &quot;update&quot;, she doesn&#39;t actually give any news. What she says has been on the screen the entire time. They just needed to get away from the guy on the phone so he couldn&#39;t have a chance to elaborate on the exercises.</p>

<p>Your reasoning for this is... nothing. Just another assumption. Go read the police report. The two of them ran. they were stalked and shot, you can even see marginal evidence of this in the shooter&#39;s video you told me to look at (which I don&#39;t think you did). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The police report is fabricated, man. Hate to say it. If Adam ran off to a different part of the complex, then were is the trail of blood? Sure sounded like he was getting shot in the shooter&#39;s POV video. Your theory that he ran away and happened to fall and die in a spot that looks strikingly similar, albeit definitively different, with no evidence other than nearby officials standing around his body, is just as incredible to me as mine is to yours.</p>

<p>Did you bother to take the time to listen to the Kohlmeier interview? The same police who wrote your trusted report are the same ones who were on the scene the exact same time the &quot;shooting&quot; occurred, terrorizing nearby residents with unwarranted break-ins, holding them hostage while confiscating their phones.</p>

<p>So, yeah, I can&#39;t respond to every single report, shit gets exhausting. But you&#39;re not doing any better. I&#39;m offering you information and evidence that points directly to what we know about this charade. You&#39;ve done nothing to support your stance other can use ad hominem attacks and just assume that I&#39;m some nutbag who views the world with nothing but preconceptions and delusion. But considering how free thinkers are portrayed, it&#39;s no big surprise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jeez dude, did I call you a shill? Thanks for putting words on my keyboard. To gloss over a couple of your points:</p>

<p>You suggested in the photo I linked to of the Soto family, the shadows are all facing the same direction. Was this a joke? Carlee&#39;s shadow goes to the right, and Vicki&#39;s goes to the left. This is good reason to believe she was photoshopped in. Link me to some real photos where the shadow changes direction in five feet and maybe I&#39;ll drop this point. The light source that would have resulted in these shadows would have to have been directly behind them. The sun sits at about 93 million miles away, so this doesn&#39;t explain it.</p>

<p>There was a good video on YouTube, which has been taken down, of course, showing a side-by-side of a REAL gun like the one &quot;Flanagan&quot; used, and there is clearly a remarkable amount of recoil not seen in the gun that fired the blanks at Allison Parker. Fine, believe that a woman who was shot at point-blank range can turn, run, and scream with no indication she&#39;s been shot with blood splatter or a change in voice. Also believe that the shooter would go through the trouble of filming the shooting, only to put the camera away before he can capture any footage proving people were shot.</p>

<p>Now on to the topic of WHY these false flags are being done. FEMA and the DHS run dozens and dozens of these drills in virtually every state each month. Once in a while, they stage a shooting during a drill to legitimize their exercises and retain funding so they can continue it. Additionally, the gun control narrative is slowly becoming more and more pervasive. &quot;Sweeping&quot; gun laws have not yet been enacted, but minor ones have. The &quot;shooter&quot;&#39;s father was in the news saying &quot;I have a strong belief that you don&#39;t buy guns, you don&#39;t buy guns.&quot; Repeating something is a method of conditioning. You wouldn&#39;t have seen someone in the news saying this last year, but now, you do. Now it&#39;s wrong to buy a gun? You can see how each shooting slowly escalates the debate. Down the road, people will be more willing to accept new laws. My take on it, however, is that they&#39;re failing. It&#39;s not as if the dark side of our government is successful at everything they do. As long as people hold on to their rights, we don&#39;t have anything to worry about (hopefully).</p>

<p>So, if you can provide some of the evidence I&#39;ve supposedly ignored, I&#39;d love for you to direct me to it. Only evidence I&#39;ve ever seen to this point is news reports.</p>

<p>Look at the picture again. The shadows are being cast onto disparate surfaces. They&#39;re not all standing in a field with wildly divergent shadows. The light source is the same for all people in the shot, the shadows fall naturally. You think this is photoshopped, have you zoomed into the photo in photoshop to see if there is the telltale tesselation of an additional layer? Of course you haven&#39;t, because doing the work just isn&#39;t in a day&#39;s work for you. Just like not spending the time to read the police reports, or even go collect the evidence of your crazy ass hypothesis.</p>

<p>And you really think all this crazy shit is being done for gun control. How stupid do you have to be to think that is how gun control would come about? </p>

<p>The reason why I&#39;ve spent this time talking to you is to show you that you&#39;re rabidly believing people with no expertise who have done no investigation. You admitted as much. So why do you believe the things you do?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;No investigation&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s incredible, man. There are hours and hours and hours on YouTube containing a myriad of information that either wasn&#39;t in the mainstream media, or was mentioned but glossed over. I couldn&#39;t possibly link to all the relevant materials. Once you learn enough, it&#39;s simple to piece this together and realize this was a drill. There&#39;s even a leaked FEMA document pertaining to this very drill, which was run on 13-Dec-2012 and &quot;evaluated as a real-time event&quot; on the morning of 14-Dec-2012.</p>

<p>So, where did I admit that I hadn&#39;t done any investigation, and nothing I reviewed from anybody contained any investigative materials either? This is getting absurd, dude. You&#39;re not really good at this. Of course, not 100% of all Sandy Hook truther material on YouTube is going to be accurate. There are videos you and I could find and debunk without a problem. But there are many, many, many more videos that simply have not been.</p>

<p>So if your goal was to show that I believe in anything, then you haven&#39;t quite gotten there yet. When I began looking at this hoaxer material, I was not only skeptical, but I was in complete disbelief and wanted to debunk everything I saw. Before long, I realized I couldn&#39;t, and my belief system crumpled. I wouldn&#39;t have been convinced if there weren&#39;t so many other &quot;tragedies&quot; that have a strikingly similar formula, where no more hard proof is provided to the public than what we were given from Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve encountered plenty of shills online, and I&#39;ve also engaged with many people such as yourself, who appear to get a kick out of jumping in with the &quot;crazies&quot; and shooting them down as some form of social reinforcement or mental stimulation (I&#39;m not quite sure). Most often, they&#39;ll appear ready to debate at first, only to see that they&#39;re in over their heads, after which they fade away. Others will start the debate and degrade it into an elementary name-calling fiasco. Some will even become curious about the facts which they have not been able to debunk, and may even come around to agree with us.</p>

<p>While you&#39;ve called me a few names, it&#39;s actually quite tamer than normal, which is why I&#39;m still here. I believe the things I believe because I look at as much information as I can, separate evidence from hearsay, educate myself on the sources peddling said information, and use my instincts to spot lies and actors. It&#39;s really as simple as that. I never wanted to be a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;; it&#39;s anything but beneficial to me, and being willfully ignorant was a much happier, easier time in my life. But there comes a point when you see the same inconsistencies over and over again, to the point where you seriously have to doubt what&#39;s being shown on nationwide media owned by the wealthiest people in the world and look elsewhere. And that&#39;s what many people are doing.</p>

<p>So, it&#39;s a shame that your intent was to simply demonize me as a lunatic wanderer who says the sky is green just cause some guy said so. I&#39;ve learned my lesson not to waste my time just for someone else&#39;s entertainment, though, as it&#39;s clear you&#39;re not quite as open as I thought you might be (since you are in this sub, after all). Had you been, we&#39;d be talking about the Kohlmeier interview, discussing why you may or may not believe some of the things she says. But no, instead, it&#39;s yet another person who gets their jollies off by laughing at people who aren&#39;t like them, maybe cause they&#39;re ignorant, maybe because they&#39;re not getting that satisfaction from elsewhere, I really don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Once you learn enough, it&#39;s simple to piece this together and realize this was a drill. There&#39;s even a leaked FEMA document pertaining to this very drill, which was run on 13-Dec-2012 and &quot;evaluated as a real-time event&quot; on the morning of 14-Dec-2012.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an entirely valueless statement. The fact FEMA runs drills to prepare for emergency situations doesn&#39;t mean when a similar emergency situation occurs that it is directly related. That&#39;s a huge logical leap. Further, as I&#39;ve said several times now, of what value would this incident be to FEMA?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, where did I admit that I hadn&#39;t done any investigation, and nothing I reviewed from anybody contained any investigative materials either? This is getting absurd, dude. You&#39;re not really good at this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every time you assert it was a false flag, and that photographs were photoshopped without actually showing anything other than some nonce on youtube asserting as much. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course, not 100% of all Sandy Hook truther material on YouTube is going to be accurate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>None of it is accurate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So if your goal was to show that I believe in anything, then you haven&#39;t quite gotten there yet. When I began looking at this hoaxer material, I was not only skeptical, but I was in complete disbelief and wanted to debunk everything I saw. Before long, I realized I couldn&#39;t, and my belief system crumpled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re either lying or you don&#39;t try hard. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve encountered plenty of shills online, and I&#39;ve also engaged with many people such as yourself, who appear to get a kick out of jumping in with the &quot;crazies&quot; and shooting them down as some form of social reinforcement or mental stimulation (I&#39;m not quite sure). Most often, they&#39;ll appear ready to debate at first, only to see that they&#39;re in over their heads, after which they fade away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, you may see it as someone being in over their head and fading away. I&#39;m quite certain they see it another way, namely that they&#39;re smashing their head against a brick wall while someone with more time than sense &#39;kitchen sinks&#39; the argument with &quot;but what about this&quot; evidence, that is just as easily dismissed as it is brought up. If you think that isn&#39;t the case, I&#39;d invite you to have a conversation with one of the flat earth advocates in this sub and we can see how it progresses. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>While you&#39;ve called me a few names, it&#39;s actually quite tamer than normal, which is why I&#39;m still here. I believe the things I believe because I look at as much information as I can, separate evidence from hearsay, educate myself on the sources peddling said information, and use my instincts to spot lies and actors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But 99% of the stuff you&#39;ve supplied IS hearsay. The amateur picture analysis you&#39;re seeing isn&#39;t evidenced, it&#39;s certainly not well researched. It&#39;s some dude looking at the picture in MS paint making assertions about how light strikes water, or drawing lines that are contra-perspective. First year art students would cringe at that type of nonsense. I&#39;m highly surprised that you don&#39;t. If you were genuinely interested in this, you&#39;d be reading a lot more about how photography and photo editing work, not referring me to low res youtube &#39;evidence&#39;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But no, instead, it&#39;s yet another person who gets their jollies off by laughing at people who aren&#39;t like them, maybe cause they&#39;re ignorant, maybe because they&#39;re not getting that satisfaction from elsewhere, I really don&#39;t know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trust me, there&#39;s no fun to be had in these conversations. It&#39;s a matter of trying to make you people into functioning adults as opposed to 14 year-olds who can&#39;t tie their shoes without blaming others for things they don&#39;t understand. Good luck, maybe one day you&#39;ll look back at your thought processes here and feel stupid. Maybe worse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you want to disagree about the shadowing, I guess that&#39;s fine, but I disagree.</p>

<p>To your first point...yes, I have analyzed this picture, as have others. You&#39;ll notice a rather unusual vertical STRAIGHT line on the right side of the rock Vicki is sitting on. This is indicative of layering. Also, the left side of the shadow of the girl with the yellow dress goes in a STRAIGHT vertical line from top to bottom, despite the fact that she too is sitting on a rock with a LOT more curvature.</p>

<p>Copy the image yourself, zoom in, and draw a straight line in paint from the top to the bottom of these along the vertical lines I mentioned. What you&#39;ll notice is that the images on each side of that line look entirely different. It doesn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to figure out that a perfectly straight line on a shadow cast on a curved rock is absolutely impossible.</p>

<p>And to your second point...I had mentioned in my previous post that this isn&#39;t ONLY for gun control, but also to extend and build the government agencies that are continuously growing and holding these exercises. These &quot;shootings&quot; convince people there is danger they need to be protected from, and as a result, they need to be protected by someone. Therefore, large anti-terrorist government agencies are seen as a necessity rather than an absurd waste of taxpayer dollars.</p>

<p>Obama has said on multiple occasions that the only way to get stricter gun laws is to &quot;change public opinion.&quot; I can&#39;t tell you what the absolute best method to go about gun control is. That being said, framing a drill that has already been practiced and refined, creating fake victims, allowing you to control the narrative and prevent investigations, and use it to debate about guns is an attractive method. No one said this is the best method to go about it - as I said, it&#39;s a failing mission so far. What might be an easier / more effective, convincing way to spark more gun control debates? I&#39;d like to hear your suggestion.</p>

<p>Have you listened to the Kohlmeier interview yet? Or are you committing the same crime as me in &quot;ignoring the evidence&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I don&#39;t know what constitutes proof for you. The proof is right there in the foot that sits in the light but gives no shadow. You can discredit every YouTube video you want, maybe because the producers are not &quot;the authorities&quot;, but facts are facts and discerning minds will find some videos to be legit, others to be BS. Lumping all the videos together as crap is infantile.</p>

<p>Anyway, the photoshopping didn&#39;t end with Vicki Soto. Emilie Parker is photoshopped into all the Parker family photos as well. And before you deny this...keep in mind that <em>the mother even admitted this</em>. Once they got called out, instead of providing a real photo that could quell the controversy, they simply made a story up instead.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-SpUw9yR4Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-SpUw9yR4Q</a></p>

<p>So there ARE photoshopped pictures of Sandy Hook &quot;victims&quot;, and there&#39;s your proof. Why, though, would photos be doctored at all? Wouldn&#39;t the families simply grab a few photos and hand them over? Apparently it&#39;s just not that simple in Newtown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In order for all video to be suppressed, the mainstream media would have to be the only ones who had it. Here in 2015, everyone with a phone can be capturing and uploading videos within minutes. I don&#39;t need to see any bodies or any shooting or anything like that. I&#39;m not some morbid, twisted fuck. I just can&#39;t understand why nobody has any footage of a scene outside the building where people are rushing victims to ambulances, helicopters landing and being loaded, EMT&#39;s rushing to the property and entering the building. These videos would no doubt be SOMEWHERE for us to see. But since the entire area was cordoned off before anybody even knew anything was happening, they didn&#39;t have access to do so. Much like Sandy Hook, the fire department blocked the entry roads that would have allowed additional qualified personnel to enter the premises and administer medical aid to the injured.</p>

<p>Nor do we, by the way, have any security snapshots or anything showing this Harper-Mercer character walking outside, or holding a gun, or anything like that. There would certainly be some point at which he could be seen without having to show us a violent scene.</p>

<p>So even if there WAS an elevated effort to hide the videos out of respect for the families, it could never work.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;ve forgotten where you are. People here talk about the horrors of a surveillance state, but then want HD footage of any event anywhere that they happen to take an interest in, and throw a hissy fit when they can&#39;t have it.</p>

<p>Privacy is an absolute right... unless you were unfortunate to be near a shooting, in which case these anonymous people on the internet want access to every aspect of your life.</p>

I made a comment about the cell phones on my commute this morning, and when I tried to go back to post a link, it was like that portion of the story never existed.</p>

<p>Thanks for posting this.  I thought i was having a vivid fever dream.</p>

<p>So this opens the new question: why remove that portion of the story?  It&#39;s odd enough the officials were patting down students to take their cell phones, and evacuating them away in buses. (if the students were out of the buildings and in custody to be searched...wouldn&#39;t they already be a safe distance from the scene?  Has this kind of bus evacuation ever happened before?  It&#39;s the first time i&#39;ve heard of such a thing) But why would the post feel the need to edit this detail their article in the middle of the night?</p>

<p>When Sandy Hook happened, Michael Moore said if they really wanted to get gun control enacted, they should show the victims bodies. I&#39;m not asking for that, but if they really wanted to drive it home that guns need to be banned or stripped or whatever, show us proof this happened. </p>

<p>As many have said on here, in this day and age where we see people filming the most random once in a lifetime viral video incident of something, we have nobody going on their Instagram or Twitter and posting some sort of compelling images this all went down. </p>

<p>Not for lack of trying. It only takes a few minutes after each shooting before the president is on the air, shaking his head in disapproval, urging us toward stronger gun control. The president could pick other stances, mental health, poor economy, prescription drugs...but it&#39;s always gun control.</p>

He attempted to use a pic that, under a little scrutiny, was faked as his &quot;proof&quot; that he was there, and it was in fact a real event, and that no phones were confiscated. When sophisticated fake photos are used to push a narrative, and the fakers have accounts with fake cred (said he had thousands of karma points, redditor for 4 years, paid for 39 days of server time, etc.), it is a sure sign of an operative. That&#39;s part of what they did when the site was down, manufacture false accounts, and add false &quot;tenure&quot; to their stats. This has been covered elsewhere on reddit. Shine a light on these cockroaches, and they scatter. Those that attempt to defy the tactic, risk exposing themselves even further, so they really have no choice but to flee. </p>

<p>Now, whether or not you want to add into the above the Boston Marathon bombing or the Aurora Shootings, or the AZ or LAX shootings...we live under rule by a government that commonly does this kind of ridiculous behavior to sway the public opinion. </p>

<p>Any other argument is unnecessary. There is an agenda. They&#39;re pushing it. There&#39;s no sense in attacking one another in a thread like this because let&#39;s face it-- nothing is what it seems. I for one love these threads because yes, there is blatant discrepancies in all of these events.</p>

<p>Columbine was a great example of something that was real. Even if you take into consideration military footage of attacks overseas, when you die, notably by gunfire-- there&#39;s a lot of blood. </p>

<p>No bodies. No blood. Lack of evidence. Out the window. When in doubt, throw it out. </p>

<p>What&#39;s sad is we&#39;re living in this place, where this kind of shit is now becoming common place. This is our normality now. I laughed when Obama was saying how all of this was routine. It&#39;s disgusting. Not that we&#39;re experiencing these shootings, but that we have a government that is FAKING potentially atrocious and violent acts in order to enforce their agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody wants to believe this, but you can&#39;t ignore the possibility when you look closely:</p>

<p>&quot;Two things to consider: 1) There isn&#39;t an agenda to ban guns and these aren&#39;t false flags. Have any major gun laws been implemented since Aurora, Sandy Hook, etc.? ;&quot;</p>

<p>Not for lack of trying. It only takes a few minutes after each shooting before the president is on the air, shaking his head in disapproval, urging us toward stronger gun control. The president could pick other stances, mental health, poor economy, prescription drugs...but it&#39;s always gun control.</p>

<p>&quot;2) I imagine many people, upon hearing shots being fired, aren&#39;t going to stick around just filming or taking photos to share later.&quot; </p>

<p>Nope. Because they were confiscated and their belongings were searched. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what exactly isn&#39;t accurate? That we have &quot;hours and hours of footage from inside the building, outside the building&quot; of the Columbine shooting? No, we know that&#39;s true. That today &quot;everybody has an HD camera on them&quot;. OK, so maybe not entirely accurate, but most do. That &quot;School surveillance is now a massive industry, and most schools are wired up the ass&quot;. No, that&#39;s true. </p>

<p>Do we have footage of a chaotic scene? Do we have witnesses who were close to the scene and didn&#39;t hear shots? Do we have &quot;other witnesses laughing as they talk about people dying in the classroom right next to them&quot;? I don&#39;t know. So far I can&#39;t confirm any of the above. I&#39;ll check later.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>If you dig enough, there are plenty of quirky interviews with witnesses and family members that should put a red flag in your head. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t hunt for exceptions to preconception, find flaws with the occurrence. The fact that someone doesnt interview the way you think they should isn&#39;t a red flag. This was a traumatic event, people don&#39;t act normally during traumatic events. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>no shots heard by the interviewee or anyone he knows.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never heard the shots at the Ruggles T-Station when I went to Northeastern, but they certainly happened. I also wasn&#39;t locking myself in a room in a separate building. This doesn&#39;t strike me as especially suspect. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>this woman just appears thrilled that her friend is in critical condition and she too could have been killed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually her friend was cleared and not in critical condition. If you watched the interview the bullet missed her spine and lungs, and there was jsut muscle tissue damage. All in all a great prognosis. Minor surgery to remove the round and she&#39;s on the mend. That being said, if you watch the interview without the preceding video poisoning the well you can see that she isn&#39;t happy. She&#39;s quite nervous. You could shoot a video of yourself crying and I can snap still that look like you&#39;re smiling too, especially if you&#39;re staring into direct sunlight. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are several more out there, I can&#39;t spend the time to search for and link for others but if you sift through all the witness interviews, you won&#39;t be fortunate enough to find one where someone truly seems emotionally troubled by what they&#39;ve seen, and most likely, they didn&#39;t hear any gunshots.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is well answered above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ones who did, if there are any, will be giving you some pretty elaborate, poorly-acted stories. Not because I&#39;ve seen those interviews, but because we&#39;ve seen all this shit before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So without viewing the evidence, you&#39;ve made a judgement. How scholarly of you.</p>
