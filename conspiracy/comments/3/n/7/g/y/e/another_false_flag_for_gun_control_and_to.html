    <div class="md"><p>This is actually not true. Guns kill people in the same way that you need three things for a fire. It&#39;s a key ingredient particularly in mass shootings. Notice we don&#39;t have a term for mass knifings because it&#39;s virtually impossible to have anyway near the same ability to kill more than 1 person with any other weapon.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll notice this guy didn&#39;t use a gun and did far more damage than the Oregon shooter.  I don&#39;t like to contradict you, but it is true that other murder weapons are just as capable.  Hate is the problem, not guns.  It may be weird to say this, but people who are accepting of people and willing to share experiences with these types of socially outcastes young males are doing far more to stop mass killings than gun control will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is true for the most part, but it simply shouldn&#39;t be easy to get a gun.  I&#39;m not saying it should be too difficult either, but a 10 year old kid for example shouldn&#39;t be allowed to walk into Toys R Us and buy an AK-47 with several mags using his pocket money.  Of course this is an extremely unrealistic example, but it proves that there should be some sort of control on gun distribution.  The tricky part is finding the right level of gun control.</p>

<p>Also as a side note, I&#39;m a supporter for control of other potentially deadly tools like knives and medieval weaponry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I&#39;ve read, a &quot;false flag&quot; is an event in which an operation is carried out by someone other than who is blamed. If one&#39;s stance is that this shooting did not truly occur, than yeah, I guess it doesn&#39;t quite qualify. If this shooting really did occur, then I don&#39;t think anyone believes it would have been carried out by anyone other than who they say it was, with the caveat being that the guy was under some form of mind control.</p>

<p>My stance, though, is that this was just an elaborate drill with DHS (they were on the scene according to the police scanner feed), and that pretending a &quot;domestic terrorist&quot; attack occurred, even though no one died, should qualify.</p>

<p>At the most basic level, yes, that is correct. But there is more to it, since the aim is to blame someone else. Who gets blamed, and by whom, are crucial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do false flags work exactly?</p>

<p>To my knowledge, a false flag event can be an event that is entirely fictional, but is sold to the public as fact or it can be an event that factually occurred, but it was perpetrated by someone to accomplish an entirely premeditated goal that had little to do with the event (usually a political or military goal).</p>

<p>So, why couldn&#39;t any mass shooting or bombing theoretically be viewed as a possible false flag?</p>

<p>Most crimes of passion or revenge committed by a single person involve harming one person or a couple people they know or their own families, not entire groups of strangers.</p>

<p>These media frenzy shootings however, always have the same recipe: someone with a gun killing multiple people all at once or someone with a bomb killing multiple people all at once (usually strangers).</p>

<p>If you want gun control or populace control of any sort, these events are tailor made to push for those goals.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of any mass shootings before the 1960s that fit the same mass shootings we have had since then?</p>

<p>Most of the pre-60s mass killings I have read about were related to crime and/or someone taking out their entire family....</p>

<p>We still had bomb making capabilities and guns back then- so why the sudden surge of these types of odd killings?</p>

<p>How do false flags work exactly?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s simple. Actor A perpetrates a crime/terror attack and makes it appear that another actor, let&#39;s call them Actor B actually did it. The point of a false flag event is to blame it on someone else. People in this sub love to label EVERYTHING a false flag or a hoax, as if the two terms are interchangeable. They are not. </p>

<p>A false flag is very specific. The term comes from &quot;the Age of Sail&quot; when great navies ruled the seas and pirates made their living stealing from cargo ships crossing the ocean unprotected. If a pirate or privateer wanted to attack a French ship, for instance, they would raise up a French flag on their stern. This would trick their prey into believing that the ship trailing behind them was a friendly vessel. That French flag, waving from the back of the pirate ship, was literally <em>a false flag</em>. As the pirates got within cannon range of the French ship, they would lower the false French flag, and raise their actual colors as they open fire with a broadside. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, if the government is actually perpetrating the shootings, then whatever fictional character they blame for the shootings is the &quot;false flag&quot; victim. In this case, the other &quot;country/entity&quot; being blamed are &quot;people with access to guns/gun owners&quot;.</p>

<p>It still seems an appropriate term to describe the possible situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, wrong. If you blame a fictional character, then it is not a false flag anymore. If the guy who did the shooting were a CIA asset, and then the attack gets blamed on ISIS, <em>that</em> would qualify as a false flag. But, if the guy doing the shooting is just a patsy who was coaxed into doing the attack for ISIS but it was actually the CIA who convinced him to do it, that would not qualify as a false flag. I am not saying that this attack is what the media will eventually tell us it is. I am saying, too many people throw around the term &quot;false flag&quot; without understanding it&#39;s very specific meaning. </p>

<p>Let me try to illustrate my point with an example: The Boston Tea Party, 1773. A bunch of &quot;Americans&quot; who were angry at the Crown over taxation decided to protest by tossing a ship load of tea into the harbor. As this was an illegal act, many of the &quot;protestors&quot; dressed themselves as Mohawk tribesmen before they attacked the cargo ship. If the &quot;Americans&quot; were dressing as Mohawks so that the Mohawk tribe would be blamed for the attack, then that could have been described as a false flag attack. But, that was not the case. The &quot;Americans&quot; dressed as Mohawks to disguise themselves so that they could avoid criminal prosecution if anyone recognized them. It&#39;s a fine line, but there is a line. The term means something, it&#39;s not a catch all term for any black op.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Mentally ill gun owners&quot; is not specific enough to be a false flag. What you are trying to articulate would be better defined as &quot;scapegoating&quot;. Words have meanings, we don&#39;t just make them up as we go. Don&#39;t call me stupid because you don&#39;t know what the definition of &quot;false flag&quot; is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol that&#39;s hilarious. It&#39;s a term that evolved from what used to be a <em>physical</em> false flag. By your line of thinking it only applies to old, old sailing ships! So naive, and yet so confident, pretty funny if you ask me.</p>

<p>A true &quot;false flag&quot; was the USS Liberty bombing by Israel, where one country (flag) makes it look like another &quot;flag&quot; did the deed. In that case Israel tried to make it look like Egypt did the bombing. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the correct term? Beats me! </p>
