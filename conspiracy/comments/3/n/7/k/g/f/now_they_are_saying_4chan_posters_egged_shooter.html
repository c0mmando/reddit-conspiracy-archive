       Briefly stated, Gell-Mann-Amnesia effect:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backwardâ€”reversing cause and effect. I call these the "wet streets cause rain" stories. Paper's full of them.
In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.

       That may not be a coincidence. These shooters idolize previous shooters, which is why the media makes rock stars out of every one of them.

       You're comment has nothing to do with what OP was asking. Internet ID's are a thing in China and they are being beta tested in the US. Now that the FCC has control over the internet as a public utility, OP's question is valid. You on the other hand posted nothing of substance. Hence, you're missing the point.

      <p>
       What OP was asking was predicated on the false point he had just made/implied. He did not identify who "they" are, and he implied that "they" are lying (i.e. "now they are saying", instead of "it is pretty fucking obvious that...").
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence, I refuted the point on which the question was predicated.

       And FYI it's "your".

       Dude, you just confused the contraction of "you are" with the possessive pronoun, "your". That's an elementary error. You are in absolutely no position to criticise anybody else's understanding of English.

        Dude, you just confused the contraction of "you are" with the possessive pronoun, "your". That's an elementary error. You are in absolutely no position to criticise anybody else's understanding of English.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You should have used the contraction in your third sentence. You should have used
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       else's instead of anybody. Punctuation on an internet forum isn't a good gauge of English understanding, maybe you meant  grammar?

       Stopped is past tense.

       <em>

       if you look at the 4chan conversation it's very suspect. op/shooter says don't go to school tomorrow,

      <p>
       No, the opposite claim is indefensible given the content of the thread, and hence the 4Chan posters factually egged him on. The poster altered this fact to include a third party (i.e. "they"), did not identify the third party, and tried to imply that it was not a fact that the 4Chan posters egged him on, but rather propaganda coming from the third party.

       also - to go deeper - I suspect the 4chan conversation is itself a set up. as I just explained, so I think the propaganda is all coming from the same place,  *they got their hand in every pot here Imo. but if that's not the case - sure - taking the 4chan conversation at face value  - saying they are egging him on is a fair interpretation. if that leads to any responsability of anonymous posters (if they are real) is a different question.

       That's fine. I respect that. However, you can't expect people to take your "suspicions" seriously unless you can provide evidence, or at least very good reasoning. I'm neutral, and it just reads to me like you're making shit up. You're inventing seemingly unnecessary explanations for facts and failing to show why you think those explanations are necessary.

       huh. not sure what you mean exactly. I'm not attemting to lock down a proof here, I'm just raising a question about something that raised suspicion for me. the evidence I offer is that second poster in the 4chan conversation knew community colllege was the target without op giving that info. if you read the conversation that is plane as day.
      </p>
      <p>
       you have standards for my post I wasn't aiming for, my goal was to pose a question. I don't know the answer to the question myeslf.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it would be a really big deal if they/authorities/media/LE did start saying these anaonymous posters are responsible, that would be unprescendented, and I feel by them bringing up this issue that posters were egging them on - that seeking to identify and hold them responsible might be their next step.  might, I don't know if they will, but it seems they are close to it - and I wanted to know what others think.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think "we" have given them amunition, whoever made those posts / real or fake are not "We" they are individuals who made the posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway. - I don't see too much conflict here with what we are saying, peace.

       I understand. It's just that the claim that this suspicion is predicated on is nonsensical. You don't make clear who it is you're talking about, and you don't make clear that everybody who has read the thread is going to be saying that the shooter was egged on. It's a ubiquitous value which you're implying is exclusive to some shadowy third party called "they".

       I think the thread speaks for itself and I don't need to verify how it reads. I don't think I infered the opposite of what "They" are saying is true, by pointing out that they are saying it.

       there would be no reason to infer I was trying to get accross that it is not sunny. my reasoning for stating this information is focussed on the question - what do they plan on doing next - what is there reason for saying this?

       Dude, then just say "the media". If you don't identify specifically who you're talking about, then how am I supposed to know?

       Maybe I'm being a little bit pedantic about this particular point, because I can see you wrote your post informally. Most people here will have a rough idea of what you mean by "they", but we're living in a world where words are perpetually being twisted to satisfy the demands of personal bias. You don't need to hand over ammunition to the enemy.

      <p>
       That wasn't my point. You inferred that "they" are the only people saying the shooter was egged on, but it is actually everybody who has read the 4Chan thread. The way you worded it makes it sound like it is debatable that the shooter was egged on, and it really isn't.

      <p>
       No, the opposite claim is indefensible given the content of the thread, and hence the 4Chan posters factually egged him on. The poster altered this fact to include a third party (i.e. "they"), did not identify the third party, and tried to imply that it was not a fact that the 4Chan posters egged him on, but rather propaganda coming from the third party.

        oh - by "they" I mean the media controlling conspirators, I don't know their real names! maybe I should call them "They" for a reach towards more clarity.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Dude, then just say "the media". If you don't identify specifically who you're talking about, then how am I supposed to know?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I'm being a little bit pedantic about this particular point, because I can see you wrote your post informally. Most people here will have a rough idea of what you mean by "they", but we're living in a world where words are perpetually being twisted to satisfy the demands of personal bias. You don't need to hand over ammunition to the enemy.

        I don't think I infered the opposite of what "They" are saying is true, by pointing out that they are saying it.

      <p>
       That wasn't my point. You inferred that "they" are the only people saying the shooter was egged on, but it is actually everybody who has read the 4Chan thread. The way you worded it makes it sound like it is debatable that the shooter was egged on, and it really isn't.
