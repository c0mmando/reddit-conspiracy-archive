       It is impossible to prove either way, in the way that one may ask for "proof" of scientifically accepted data. You're asking people that cannot possibly have such proof at their disposal, to prove something.
Can you prove, with "quantifiable evidence", that the evidence is not indeed fabricated?
I mean, crap! If there's no way to apply the scientific method, we must all be the dream of a little autistic boy, right?
Masterdebaters are laughable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't fall for this tactic, folks. It's just to waste your time. Plenty of speculation has gone in several directions, and no one theory will explain every little angle. But you know what? I've already seen two fake pictures posted on reddit, with a fake account that had manufactured stats (cred), that pushed the mainstream story (which changed already a couple of times). These fake pics were interesting in that they were obviously taken to be used whenever questioned by the public. That means that there is a concerted effort, using somewhat sophisticated techniques and foreplanning, to push a narrative and "debunk" those questioning that narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the intel world, that would be more than enough "evidence" for mission-go.

       The burden of proof isn't on me, my claim (which is essentially just skepticism towards the false flag/hoax narratives) doesn't involve a conspiracy of hundreds and perhaps thousands of people from "crisis actors" to law enforcement and even the federal government.
      </p>

       I'm sorry but mentally unhinged people with access to firearms in America is simply more plausible.

       Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. But in this case, I will literally take any actual evidence. Try me out.

       Yes. I have already stated it in my general reply to your post. You, however, asked the community at large for evidence. If you want evidence, then spend your time seeking it, and form your opinion, as a civilian should. The tactic of resorting to challenging the public to "debate" issues is preposterous, and shows that your purpose is to either divert public opinion, or to troll. Thanks for the continued push to engage me, though. I like the demonstratable escalations that go along with those cute little charts they print up for 28 year old Colonels that can't pass three jumps. Buh-bye, now.

       You didn't give any evidence at all in your post. You just said it was impossible to prove one way or the other.

      <p>
       So on one side of the argument, we have zero evidence. On the other side we have dead bodies, grieving families, hundreds of eye-witnesses, weapons, shells, bullet holes, blood, finger-prints, a dead shooter.

       It is ironic seeing we know of the Iraq wmd &amp; nsa spying conspiracies are now true &amp; they involved just as many. Then there was Project Manhattan. And the evidence against 911 is so much that literally anything besides 2 planes hitting the building has been disproven.

       No it doesn't mean that. Likewise when we can't prove something as a conspiracy it doesn't mean it isn't. The important thing is to keep an open mind &amp; only follow the physical evidence.

       And if we only follow the evidence, in this instance, we cannot reach the conclusion of "conspiracy"
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely the most sensible way to look at things is with an open mind, as you said. You cannot start with "this is a conspiracy" if there is nothing to suggest that; it's not really critical thinking.

       Sandy hook &amp; the live tv shooting have physical evidence. The newest school one doesnt have anything yet that im aware of. It is always more complicated when they actually kill people then blame a fall guy. With charlie hebo is was easy cause they wanted us to see the footage.

       There isn't any. Most of it is people taking snapshots from videos and saying "those parents aren't crying hard enough" to claim they are crisis actors.

       It all comes down to terrible and almost delusional analysis of the  videos.

       Anything that goes against the social norm can be considered evidence. Like why was the Canada parliament shooting covered by a dozen press people chilling along the hall to the side nearly next to each other but outside of each others footage. And why would the police not secure the area, remove civilians (potential hostages) to a safe distance? When something goes against the standard protocols you need to ask why are they being avoided this time.

       No this is completely fallacious. Evidence explains or proves something, inconsistencies or apparent irregularities are not evidence. Situations such as a terrorist attack are far too complicated to be adequately explained by small amounts of  video footage, of course there will be things which appear to have no explanation. It isn't proof of a conspiracy.

       so seeing Parker laugh before walking up on stage doesn't seem a little strange to you? There is evidence, such as the police dash cam footage but it seems you're too busy talking smack on reddit to actually do any research.

       There's no true "psychologically appropriate" way to deal with the stress of a mass casualty event. Some people cry, some freeze in shock, some laugh or exchange "gallows humor", some show no immediate signs. Just like the classic stages of grief.

       This is sort of why PTSD exists.

       Yeah, I think we're seeing two different things here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see someone laughing in the face of tragedy and disaster and at the absurdity of having (or feeling compelled) to announce the death of his daughter on national TV, and then emotional heft of that moment starts sinking in as he does so. You can see it happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever been to a funeral of a loved one? That loved one may have been dead for a day or so, you may feel you have your shock contained. You may even laugh with friends and family.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then you have to go up to speak. You keep a handle on your emotions until seconds into your words.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, you're speculating on a possible motive for what you personally believe to be "bizarre" behavior. You claim it's an "acting technique". Neither of these speculations is evidence.

      <p>
       So, in lieu of one piece of evidence, a YouTube dump of over four hours of video. Could you maybe pick one single piece of evidence from any of these instead?

       Mfw you literally just confirmed the fact that you are too lazy to do your own research. Just like any conspiracy it's a combination of many different elements (think 911). For example I already told you before, police dash cam footage in front of the school shows absolutely nobody exiting. Footage from above the school from helicopters shows people walking around in a giant circle, with no purpose whatsoever. If you are unwilling to sit down for a day or even a week doing your own research dont expect anyone to show you any respect.

       And when people do ask questions about sensitive topics such as this one they get into a whole lot of trouble (see wolfgang halbig). Since you keep asking for the one big piece of evidence which points to foul play ask yourself why the ambulances were forced to wait far away from the school and why proper medical procedures weren't followed? Also with regards to your first point l, you think investigation is just about asking people and that's it? You think that whenever an airline goes down the NTSB simply walks in, asks a bunch of questions and then call it a day? This is the reason why I rarely ever post on reddit. People who readily admit they have done no research yet they feel like they can act in a condescending manner.

       No, asking questions is

       of research, as I have said here before. I don't understand what your issue with me opening a thread to inquire and debate could possibly be. Nobody is forcing you to engage.

       I know that active shooter protocol for law enforcement means swarming in and neutralizing a shooter as fast as possible (even if they have to step over the dying to do so), and denying anyone else access to the area until its deemed secure. That can unfortunately mean that medical staff may have to triage outside until law enforcement has declared it absolutely safe to enter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Active shooter protocol changed since Columbine. Back then law enforcement wouldn't even raid, they'd secure from outside assuming they would have a negotiation situation.

       When did I say I had a problem with a thread like this? I have a problem with people asking to provide evidence, while being entirely convinced that they already know the truth. It's a false sense of openness which people like you have time and time again have pretended to have. And again you're ignoring the facts. Leaving ambulances several streets away IS NOT normal protocol, before and after columbine. None of the protocols regarding site cleanup were followed either. You've also completely missed the point I made about wolfgang halbig (also given the fact that you replied within 10 minutes showed you didn't even bother reading what happened to him). This conversation really isn't worth pursuing. Any onlooker who sees this thread will realise you are unable to change your view point, so why bother posting or arguing? You've made up your mind and that's fine, but dont ever try to pretend you are open to changing it. Any onlooker who sees this thread will realise that in an instant. So long

       Isn't it funny how its always the arrogant and ignorant who are so unwilling to open their minds. Ambulances appeared near school after several hours, when it doesn't matter. But I suppose you think that's normal. You ignored my point about cleanup, but that's ok because you know better right?

       Trauma cleanup in Connecticut does not require the licensing or "protocol" (you may need to be more specific about that) of other states, take that for what you may.

       To further prove how little I'm reading, or maybe how little you are, all your points seem to lead to one particular kook Jim Fetzer who seems to think that Sandy Hook might be real, but that the kids could have been murdered by Israeli Mossad:

       He shows none of the 5 stages of grief. You really think someone who just lost their daughter would be joking around like this? It goes against the physical norm &amp; is more credible than the evidence that the media told you this guy is this dad proof. 
Of course you wont buy it. I once had the same thing over wtc7 guy would use anything slightly true to justify the official story. But that isn't my goal. I was 1st exposed to the truth by watching 'loose change 911'. I was shocked &amp; took to the net. Ended up watching 'debunking loose change' straight afterwards. But what they failed to answer stayed with me. Some point years later more evidence appeared. As long as you are aware you are being manipulated or lied to then that's all I want.

       There is literally no "physical norm" in this type of situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       People overloaded by emotional stress can behave in all manner of ways, and many may seem "inappropriate" but may just be coping mechanisms. It's not really smart to just say the guy is lying about his dead daughter because he managed to smile and joke in the midst of crisis.

       Go to a funeral &amp; see how many people are laughing. It is a social norm to experience &amp; display some form of grief. Giggling like it didn't mean anything is not normal. Research by Paul Ekman has shown these are universal &amp; a number of studies have shown real emotional responses are involuntary. Even if he was trying make a tragedy better with humour his eyes would still display his real pain.

       Sometimes people laugh at funerals, there are many ways to cope. Subjective opinion about whether someone's eyes are "honest" is just speculation based on the physical manifestation of psychological stress, or lack thereof I suppose. But it's not evidence, just speculation.

       A valid point. Your question should be respected. It should be noted though that when evidence is provided the 'burden of proof' falls on you &amp; others to 'disprove' it with a possible explanation like you did earlier.

       Preferably the latest, the UCC shooting. But really whatever American shooting or mass casualty event of recent memory (not 9/11) you think has the most compelling argument for a hoax or false flag.

       There is only speculation &amp; discrepancies at this point &amp; shall remain like that for a while I suspect. What triggered my suspicion was I 3 media stories calling for gun control after latest shooting before I saw a single article telling me about the shooting &amp; what state it had occurred in. Then there is the photo of people walking with their hands up in front of the media. Why are there hands up when the gunman killed himself? Where is the footage from security cameras like the actual school shooting columbine? Where is the camera photo footage, fb posts &amp; tweets while people were hiding behind desks? How come so many of them appear to have colour coded outfits on? How did the white house have a press conference minutes after the shooting calling it out &amp; gun control.

       In the case of people walking out with their hands up, this was standard protocol even during Columbine in a situation when law enforcement are not entirely sure they have eliminated all suspects.
      </p>
      <p>
       It took years for us to even see the small amount of footage from inside Columbine that we have seen.

       The shooting took place at 1:38PM EST, Obama addressed it around 5:30PM EST. So yeah, it was minutes after in that it was 232 minutes later.

       Yes New reports are coming out police stripped searched the victims. Main killer has 4 guns &amp; they strip search everyone. One extreme to the other. 
The White House had a press conference about 3 minutes afterwards. I never said it was Obama that gave it.

       You're the only person I've heard say "strip search". Haven't seen it in an actual news report all day. It's possible they did search survivors because the killer handed out his manifesto to one of them.

       I don't need to. The Boston marathon wasn't 20 events. It was one. All those pictures together tell a story. And that story is the mainstream media and government lied to everyone. We can speculate on why (martial law practise, privacy limits, distraction) but that is getting away from the point. The important bit is the official story cant be true.

       Well, of course you don't need to.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in order to debate a giant chaotic event you have to look at in parts. Even the websites breaks it down into images for this reason, but to opposite effect. It uses the classic "inundation" technique of the conspiracy theorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've noticed that conspiracy theorists really object to things being broken down into manageable and debatable pieces.

       Watch this when watch the footage. The cop who died wasn't shot. A couple of white people with high precision shooting (1 bullet per person) missed at point blank range? The media was covering the guy playing dead? Nope, cause the next day police tape &amp; blood were shown at the crime scene.

       I appreciate the effort you took to share this one, and in general your willingness to engage this thread, but I'm focusing on recent American mass casualty events and the commonalities between their respective Internet conspiracy theorists. Nothing personal.

       While this isn't mass shooter related, it's a great one. We have mainstream media interview with a qualified engineer discussing physical evidence. Opinions &amp; speculations mean nothing on it.

       Sandy Hook was a drill used to promote gun control, no children died. Evidence aplenty, from vehicle tracks at the wrong house to charity websites being setup before the event took place.

       Sandy hook was a drill gone live. It was an abandoned school. Google maps shows no cars in carpark while nearby schools all have full carparks. You didn't see the bodies. Photos of the school show that it had experienced flooding &amp; the walls were stained with mould (what parent/admin would accept this). But the most damning piece of evidence is the FBI how many victims of shootings for the area that year; answer 0. OF course they have had time to change the details to fit but the fact it was missing remains.

       When every other school nearby has full carparks it is. It was all collected at the same time. Which means for some reason the school was closed that day. We get to speculate why that is.

       The one with the hallway, someone moved stuff into the hallway. And? You're saying that this inoperative fake school was filled with school supplies and kids artwork?

       I mean, classrooms move around sometimes. Sometimes classrooms have to be deep cleaned. There are much more plausible explanations than a dummy school full of school supplies.

       The school holidays are when classrooms get deep cleaned, repainted etc. That first pic looks like a normal classroom in itself. If you are going to fake a school you will need some school supplies. That being said your explanation is just as plausible as mine. There is not enough info in photos of 2 rooms to draw conclusions of a whole school.

       Well, your explanation is a fake school created by... somebody (intelligence agencies? FEMA? Obama? Mossad?) in order to create a fake mass shooting involving hundreds of actors.

       Mine is that it was closed the day that picture was taken, and that in 2008 they cleaned it of asbestos.

       That only sounds intriguing from afar on the internet. Do you realize how silly that sounds? Don't you think every person in that town would know whether the school was active or not? There's no need to sit and debate whether a school is abandoned. Just ask someone in town.

       Anyone can claim to be from the town. And those there on the day will all claim to be from town. Even if you went there yourself &amp; started asking around it wouldn't help. You would have feds following you within an hr. And even if you heard the truth you wouldn't be certain it was true. Physical evidence is better. Perhaps if you found someone in a photo from say the local paper years before then you could trust their answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I have no doubt many wouldn't be afraid to tell you the truth. But like that guy would the CIA killed; his neighbours reported black vans before &amp; after the shooting &amp; media/gov reported it as a suicide. Anyone who gets listened to too much is silenced.

       Of course not. Only those who knew the school was shut down years earlier would have known it wasn't real in retrospective. Thousands of people who attended legitimate funerals like Robbie Parkers one which witnesses describe as weird. When you can fake mass killings, fake coroner reports, create fake masks why would you bury an empty casket?

       Yes. When the school was shutdown in 2008 due to asbestos. And the ex principal photos a wk before the shooting on twitter were fake prep work. A nice touch but still very lazy.

       There is only speculation &amp; discrepancies at this point &amp; shall remain like that for a while I suspect. What triggered my suspicion was I 3 media stories calling for gun control after latest shooting before I saw a single article telling me about the shooting &amp; what state it had occurred in. Then there is the photo of people walking with their hands up in front of the media. Why are there hands up when the gunman killed himself? Where is the footage from security cameras like the actual school shooting columbine? Where is the camera photo footage, fb posts &amp; tweets while people were hiding behind desks? How come so many of them appear to have colour coded outfits on? How did the white house have a press conference minutes after the shooting calling it out &amp; gun control.

       Mfw you literally just confirmed the fact that you are too lazy to do your own research. Just like any conspiracy it's a combination of many different elements (think 911). For example I already told you before, police dash cam footage in front of the school shows absolutely nobody exiting. Footage from above the school from helicopters shows people walking around in a giant circle, with no purpose whatsoever. If you are unwilling to sit down for a day or even a week doing your own research dont expect anyone to show you any respect.
