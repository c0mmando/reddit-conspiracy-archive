    <div class="md"><p>A pamphlet aimed at civilians, and designed to look like &#39;religious literature&#39;, read: &#39;Co-operate with the army and leave the zone of the special operations for the sake of your own life.&#39;</p>

<p>It said they can travel through Syrian checkpoints safely with the leaflet, and the government will give them &#39;shelter, food and medical aid&#39;.</p>

<p>Another one, meant for ISIS fighters, said: &#39;Don&#39;t make it even worse for yourselves.</p>

<p>&#39;The Motherland [presumably Syria] is ready to hug you back again. Give up your arms as hundreds of other young guys like you have done.&#39;</p>

<p>One of the pamphlets, obtained by the Kremlin-friendly Russian Komsomolskaya Pravda website, featured a cartoon of an al-Nusra front figurine being wound up by Israel and the United States.</p>

<p><strong>The message accompanying the propaganda cartoon - designed to sow divisions between the extremist factions - read: &#39;Al-Nusra terrorists, they are American and Israeli rebels.&#39;</strong></p>

<p>The leaflets, were dropped out of ageing Russian-made Mi-8 helicopters guided by a &#39;tablet with Google Maps&#39;.</p>

<p>The newspaper&#39;s reporter also said: &#39;Very soon the attack of the Syrian army will start here&#39; - referring to Rastan and Talbiseh. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Credit is due where credit is due. I don&#39;t completely agree with the implications of that picture i.e. israel controlling the US (disproportionate influence) US controlling ISIS, no way, (paved the way for their rise and halfassed the war against them yes way). It will be very interesting if this is indeed true, will this resemble afghanistan for either/both the US and Russia? The  geopolitical chess match continues...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, believe it or not, to a large extent, religion <em>is</em> a huge problem here.  Think about it.  The Jewish religion explicitly states that they are &quot;the chosen ones&quot; and all else are &quot;goyim&quot; to be treated as cattle and used &quot;at the behest of the Jew&quot;.  The Torah has passages that are <em>not</em> very...um...friendly toward any non-Jew.</p>

<p>The more layers you peel back of the lies and deceit and wars and chicanery on the planet, the more you see Zionism&#39;s hand <em>deeply</em> within what&#39;s going on.  Christianity and Islam, etc, etc suck too, but Zionism <em>does</em> indeed keep showing itself more and more to be to a significant extent the scourge of the human species.  </p>

<p>Zionist motivation <em>does</em> come from a &quot;we are the chosen people&quot; place.  &quot;Chosen&quot; by who, you may ask?</p>

<p>Chosen by God - or <em>their</em> god (which, according to them, is, of course, the &quot;only god&quot;).</p>

<p>So when you really get down to it, this actually <em>is</em> all about religion.  Governmental, corporate, and political machinations get used to achieve the ultimate, final ends, of course, but the ends are most definitely motivated by what a group of people are <em>religiously</em> indoctrinated with via their bible.</p>

<p>I understand what you&#39;re saying, and don&#39;t disagree.  Religion in general isn&#39;t necessarily the problem.  Religion can indeed be a very, very good thing if/when utilized properly.  However - yes - the Zionist form of it seems to be about one of the worst variants of religion.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Fair enough.  Although there are many aspects of Christianity that have been absolutely barbaric and horrible, there are also good aspects as well...and I don&#39;t believe Buddhism has been responsible for much if any global murder like some of the other world religions have.</p>

<p>Thank you for the valid counterpoints.  Appreciated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you haven&#39;t read the book then how can you deem it to be positive behavior (re)enforcing?</p>

<p>I was raised christian, and the bigotry and dogma is unbelievable. Not to mention, modern day christianity is just judaism lite. The ACTUAL messages of jesus in the new testament are actually good and on point (treat others how you want to be treated) but modern christianity does not follow the teachings of christ, but moreso the teachings of the old testament. </p>

<p>The god of the old testament was hateful, spiteful, and jealous. </p>

<p>The epitome of the old testament is the modern state of israel. And if that&#39;s your example of a real world positive example, you should probably have your head checked. </p>

<p>To model your good deeds off of that god is not positive, in any sense of the word. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know exactly why it did, but it wasn&#39;t directly relevant to the discussion.</p>

<p>Christianity was starting a spiritual revolution because no longer did your average person have to pay priests to go and converse with god for them. The jews did not like the fact they were losing business, so crucified christ. The messages of christ continued to spread and so they had to fight fire with fire. They co opted christs message, most notably at the council of nicea, and declared anyone who didn&#39;t agree with their hybrid abomination a heretic and they hunted them down. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been exposed to most of them. Baptist, Methodist, Catholic, Pentacostal, all the major ones. I went to church twice a week and went to christian school until I was 18. </p>

<p>Core tenements of all of the above (the huge majority of christians) are: </p>

<strong>Having slaves is acceptable, and there are rules in the old testament regulating slave ownership.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The core purpose of this life is only for the enjoyment of god, who created everything. It is not personal soul growth over many lifetimes (as more advanced spiritual systems talk about) but rather the entire purpose of your time on earth is either to accept christ and go live in heaven forever, or don&#39;t, and go burn forever.

<p>Generally speaking the core tenements of &quot;modern christianity&quot; (which like I said aren&#39;t really what jesus said) are principles of judaism extrapolated for non jews. </p>

<p>It&#39;s heavily authoritarian based, not accepting of other religions, and very VERY fear/guilt based.</p>

<p>The core tenement of the religion is that everyone is inherently sinful, and you need christ to save you. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not a healthy spiritual outlook compared to say buddism, or taoism or daoism. </p>

<p>Here is an example of a real &quot;christian&quot; outlook, one that 99.999% of christians do not use:</p>

<p>That&#39;s not how you define a church.  Those are subsets of the religion.  Each of those subsets have different churches with generally different attitudes, although the core beliefs might be the same.  For example, I&#39;ve seen three different Prodestant Christian churches with vastly different cultures, and even different community names.</p>

<p>I have nothing against any of those beliefs.  Even if they&#39;re not necessarily positive, they&#39;re certainly not negative.  I could list my reasons but I honestly cbs.  Sure, some of them can make it seem foolish, but none of them are things like &quot;steal if you want&quot; or &quot;only care for other Christians&quot; like you make it seem.</p>

<p>My problem with Zionism is the exclusivity and the tribe-like culture that&#39;s created by it.  That was the primary basis for your anti-Zionism rant, as far as I could tell.  This is a key difference.</p>

<p>That is also what I would call the &#39;best type of Christian&#39;, and the type to which I belong.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s correct to say &quot;one that 99.999% of christians do not use&quot; though, since it&#39;s mostly what I have seen even if most people don&#39;t take it to heart.  That might just be because of a geographical culture difference though, since I&#39;m Australian.</p>

<p>You think most christians search for divinity within? Seriously, what are you smoking? Most christians seriously believe that they are at the core of their lives, sinful and need christ to redeem them. Christ said &quot;we are all children of god&quot; and this was due to his mystical training from what was left of the tenements of the library of alexandria in egypt. We are not fallen people that need an all powerful god to save us from eternal damnation. This is JUDAISM being injected into christian teachings. </p>

<p>NONE of the core tenements of christ were about people being sinful or fallen and needing christ to save them. None of that is true to his original teachings. Modern christian interpretation of christ has been completely co opted. </p>

<p>The core of 99% of christian life outlook is that the world is fallen, and in need of redemption. This is unhealthy, for numerous reasons. 99% of christian tenements today are due to judaism CO OPTING christianity because it was starting a spiritual revolution, and needed to be co opted in order to be controlled successfully.</p>

<p>The council of nicaea and all that was a betrayal of all of christs true teachings, for political and control reasons (constantine wanted the whole divine right to rule) and the jews once again gained successful control over the monetary benefits of religion, although they had to mix a few books together to do so. </p>

<p>To this day, the only reason israel is allowed to exist is because christians view jews as &quot;god&#39;s chosen&quot; and american christians explicitly support israel&#39;s actions in palestine, regardless of how many children and innocents are murdered.</p>

<p>That&#39;s probably the most anti christian thing possible (do to others as youd have them to do you) but yet here we are...observing it in real time.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that Israeli support is managed by the higher-ups without any of us having a say in it.  The US has done similar shady stuff before with roughly equal populace opinions.

<p>This is seriously optimistic and simply wishful thinking. I&#39;ve met many many christians in my time, and the huge majority of them have morality and truth dictated to them from the mainstream position of their church, not from searching within. You can&#39;t seriously believe what you&#39;re typing if you&#39;re honestly referring to the majority of christians. The PERFECT example is how many/most Christians feel about gays. </p>

<p>I&#39;m on r/conspiracy to learn, not because the &quot;world is fallen from grace&quot;. The world has issues, but the CORE of our purpose here is not a mistake, as mainstream christian thinking postulates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please provide evidence of this claim</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two reasons.</p>

<p>For one, do some research into the council of Nicaea. In order to consolidate power under a supposed &quot;divine right to rule&quot; Constantine solidified power under one banner of Christianity and he based this decision purely for political reasons. I&#39;ve taken a roman history class in college and my professor even stated that those that had opposing views were not allowed to speak at the council. It was purely for show. </p>

<p>Thus roman Catholicism was born, and the roots of all major christian tenements were solidified by a solid backing of the statement that Christ and God are one in the same. This necessitates combining the old testament for dogmatic purposes. </p>

<p>Secondly, given the decision of the council, many MANY books that should be in the bible were cut out because they portrayed jesus as less than god. The gospel of thomas for example, as well as many others.  This is blatant censorship purely for political means. </p>

<p>Again, your average christian is totally unaware of the fact that their core dogma was influenced for political purposes only, and core books of apostles and those that knew them were discarded because they did not fall in line with the conclusion that the council wanted, as far as a standard version of Christianity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone knows that Israeli support is managed by the higher-ups without any of us having a say in it. The US has done similar shady stuff before with roughly equal populace opinions. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The &quot;higher ups&quot; only get away with what they can because the population thinks it is the correct thing to do. Hundreds of UN resolutions condemning Israel would have been passed by now if not for the US blocking them, and this is directly enabled because half the population sees Israel and thinks they can do no wrong. Quite literally.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Besides, even if it was a primary contributor it&#39;s unrelated to the religion&#39;s ideology itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course it&#39;s related. Actual genocide is enabled on the planet today because of dogmatic beliefs of those defending Israel on the political stage.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Everyone has different belief systems and I can respect that. That doesn&#39;t mean that they are all equal, and some can be objectively worse, or bad. I have stated concisely what is wrong with modern day Christianity, and I even specify that the actual words of Jesus Christ in the new testament are true and on point. The interpretation (as I elucidated on above) that most Christians believe is inherently flawed and it goes back 2 thousand years to a decision made for purely political means/profit, not spiritual reasons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your recent post made this most evident.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How so? That I disagree with you that most Christians really search within themselves for divinity? You can believe that if you want, but it&#39;s just blatantly false, I know way WAY too many Christians to seriously believe that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have no reason debating with a person like that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you can&#39;t handle historical facts like the council of Nicaea being completely motivated for political purposes, and out of the decision that council made the core tenements of Christianity were formed, with historical books being essentially banned from the religion, then I have no reason debating with you either.</p>

<p>Historical facts are historical facts. The religion of Christianity as we know it today is a bastardization of Christ&#39;s true message. While there may be positive elements within it, it...in and of itself...is not a positive system since it was formed in deceit from the very beginning. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well I was talking about the positive culture, so keep on topic dude.</p>

<p>I like how you moved the goalposts on this one. </p>

<p>You might want to check your definition of a strawman argument. Every single thing I have said has been in direct response to your statements. </p>

<p>We might have a philosophical difference of opinion as far as what this world is, but the main point of this conversation is &quot;is Christianity a positive force&quot; </p>

<p>I have stated concrete reasons why modern day christianity is not a force for good, because the core christian tenements have been co opted by judiasm for political purposes. As I have provided ample evidence for. </p>

<p>Unless you are assuming judiasm is a force for good, then sure, I&#39;m strawmanning. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>but pretty much nothing you&#39;re saying is a direct response to what I&#39;m saying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Literally everything I said was a direct response. </p>

<p>The core of this entire conversation has been me postulating that modern christianity is not <strong>inherently</strong> a positive thing, because the core of the religion is not based on christ&#39;s actual message (which is good), but on tenements of judaism combined with jesus&#39;s goespel merely for political purposes, with the actual result being an abomination because it&#39;s not rooted in the actual teachings of christ. </p>

<p>Christ&#39;s purpose (according to my extensive research, that is readily available on the internet) never was to die on the cross, but that&#39;s what 99.9% of christians will tell you. </p>

<p><strong>If the core point of the religion (die on the cross for your sins) is founded in deceit for political purposes, almost by definition that cannot be a positive force for good as a whole because truth inherently is better than lies as a universal principle.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very correct.  However (and this is a very big however), it becomes unfortunate when A) one considers the specific and particular version/interpretation of God that one has as the &quot;only&quot; version.  That interpretation is (usually very forcefully) applied to everything and everyone &quot;or else&quot; (i.e. at threat of force - &quot;believe or die&quot; sort of thing).  Additionally, it becomes doubly bad when B) that particularly limited version involves an interpretation that puts you as being &quot;numero uno&quot; and everyone else as being far, far beneath you in importance and worthiness - making everyone/everything else &quot;worthy of being treated like trash&quot;.</p>

<p>Enter Zionism at this point.  To be sure, Zionism is not unique in doing this, as many other religions push this horrible m.o. forward, but Zionism seems to be a particularly caustic strain of this horrible m.o.</p>

<p>While valid, one shouldn’t necessarily confuse intelligent cosmic design with religion.  Those are not necessarily the same things in the least.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Are you saying that the reason that some take their interpretation of God and put themselves far above others in importance is because people don’t <em>depend</em> on their race or religion?  It is BECAUSE many depend on their race or religion that this very thing happens.  Maybe I’m not understanding what you said here correctly, however.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t disagree with this.  Certainly seems this way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So at the end of the day, it&#39;s not really the religious text, it&#39;s people. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very correct.  Agreed.  Granted the religious context heavily indoctrinates and influences the people, but yes.  If the people can see through the religious indoctrination, then it is possible for it to have little to no power over the individual in question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s always the individual&#39;s decision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  You’re right…in one sense.  Problem is that peer pressure is an <em>extremely</em> powerful thing.  Additionally, it’s to a great extent <em>not</em> the individual’s decision what they think and don’t think while in their formative years.  When an individual is growing up, they will simply pay attention to and go along with and believe whatever they’re raised with…and an overwhelming amount of people simply never really stop to question the tenets they were raised and indoctrinated with from birth.  They just go right along their entire lives with how they were raised because “this is just how I was raised”.  In that sense, it suddenly doesn’t necessarily become just “the individual’s decision”.  There is a strong extent to which the individual becomes/is a product of their upbringing independent of their own personal decisions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We somehow are teached to forget personal responsibility with all the popularity in race-baiting and religion-blaming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On one level (again), you are correct.  On another, it’s a LOT easier to see how someone will fall right in line with racist idealism if they were born and raised in that type of environment rather than if they weren’t raised in that type of environment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s like the special religiously racial plants in those people&#39;s houses make them do this and that and every single day there&#39;s an euphoric cure on r atheism or some other shithole made for dividing people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  There’s definitely a lot of indoctrination crap designed to divide people - yes.  However, when one is brainwashed literally from birth to think in only one way, it does become difficult to just “think for yourself” and go <em>away</em> from that type of upbringing.  I certainly wish there wasn’t as much close mindedness on this planet, but there is - and a lot of it is almost an inevitability based upon how some people were raised.  The human mind is a lot more manipulatable than we often think.  We are not as “free and autonomous” as we might be led to believe sometimes.  It’s not quite as easy for some people to simply “think for themselves”.  Heck, I’m not sure that too many of us think for ourselves.  I’m not sure that too many of us don’t do things as per what we think our peers, coworkers, family, and friends <em>want</em> us to do.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I don’t disagree with a great deal of what you’re saying, but I also feel that societal influences are a lot more responsible for things than we might otherwise think or give credit for.</p>

<p>This can be a good thing if those influences help the civilization be good and helpful and less racist and more joined together, etc, etc. but it’s, of course, <em>not</em> a good thing when those influences engender and foster the separation, bickering, and constant fighting that has been the case it seems throughout human history.</p>

<p>This is seriously optimistic and simply wishful thinking. I&#39;ve met many many christians in my time, and the huge majority of them have morality and truth dictated to them from the mainstream position of their church, not from searching within. You can&#39;t seriously believe what you&#39;re typing if you&#39;re honestly referring to the majority of christians. The PERFECT example is how many/most Christians feel about gays. </p>

<p>I&#39;m on r/conspiracy to learn, not because the &quot;world is fallen from grace&quot;. The world has issues, but the CORE of our purpose here is not a mistake, as mainstream christian thinking postulates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please provide evidence of this claim</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two reasons.</p>

<p>For one, do some research into the council of Nicaea. In order to consolidate power under a supposed &quot;divine right to rule&quot; Constantine solidified power under one banner of Christianity and he based this decision purely for political reasons. I&#39;ve taken a roman history class in college and my professor even stated that those that had opposing views were not allowed to speak at the council. It was purely for show. </p>

<p>Thus roman Catholicism was born, and the roots of all major christian tenements were solidified by a solid backing of the statement that Christ and God are one in the same. This necessitates combining the old testament for dogmatic purposes. </p>

<p>Secondly, given the decision of the council, many MANY books that should be in the bible were cut out because they portrayed jesus as less than god. The gospel of thomas for example, as well as many others.  This is blatant censorship purely for political means. </p>

<p>Again, your average christian is totally unaware of the fact that their core dogma was influenced for political purposes only, and core books of apostles and those that knew them were discarded because they did not fall in line with the conclusion that the council wanted, as far as a standard version of Christianity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone knows that Israeli support is managed by the higher-ups without any of us having a say in it. The US has done similar shady stuff before with roughly equal populace opinions. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The &quot;higher ups&quot; only get away with what they can because the population thinks it is the correct thing to do. Hundreds of UN resolutions condemning Israel would have been passed by now if not for the US blocking them, and this is directly enabled because half the population sees Israel and thinks they can do no wrong. Quite literally.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Besides, even if it was a primary contributor it&#39;s unrelated to the religion&#39;s ideology itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course it&#39;s related. Actual genocide is enabled on the planet today because of dogmatic beliefs of those defending Israel on the political stage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall it just seems like you&#39;re a person who can&#39;t accept that other people have a belief system that you don&#39;t agree with, and so you think they are wrong to have that belief system and the belief system is bad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone has different belief systems and I can respect that. That doesn&#39;t mean that they are all equal, and some can be objectively worse, or bad. I have stated concisely what is wrong with modern day Christianity, and I even specify that the actual words of Jesus Christ in the new testament are true and on point. The interpretation (as I elucidated on above) that most Christians believe is inherently flawed and it goes back 2 thousand years to a decision made for purely political means/profit, not spiritual reasons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your recent post made this most evident.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How so? That I disagree with you that most Christians really search within themselves for divinity? You can believe that if you want, but it&#39;s just blatantly false, I know way WAY too many Christians to seriously believe that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have no reason debating with a person like that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you can&#39;t handle historical facts like the council of Nicaea being completely motivated for political purposes, and out of the decision that council made the core tenements of Christianity were formed, with historical books being essentially banned from the religion, then I have no reason debating with you either.</p>

<p>Historical facts are historical facts. The religion of Christianity as we know it today is a bastardization of Christ&#39;s true message. While there may be positive elements within it, it...in and of itself...is not a positive system since it was formed in deceit from the very beginning. </p>
