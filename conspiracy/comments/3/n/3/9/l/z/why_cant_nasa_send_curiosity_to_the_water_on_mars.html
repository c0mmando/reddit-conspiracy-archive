       NASA just announced that water is on the surface of Mars. One would think we would just send either the Curiosity rover or Opportunity rover (both are currently on the surface of Mars) to investigate the area. However, NASA actually can’t. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks to a international treaty signed in 1967, both rover’s aren’t allowed any where near the water.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Every country on Earth is bound by the stipulations of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which forbids “anyone from sending a mission, robot or human, close to a water source in the fear of contaminating it with life from Earth."

       They might... but currently they have a multi-year plan already laid out for the area close to where they landed that took years to arrange.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The United Nations Outer Space Treaty of 1967 forbids the “harmful contamination” of other worlds with Earth's biology, and an international organization called COSPAR (the Committee on Space Research) sets the planetary protection protocols for the U.S., Europe, Russia and other signatory spacefaring nations to follow. To protect Mars, since 2002 COSPAR has designated restricted “Special Regions” on the planet where conditions are warm and wet enough to possibly support extant Martian life—or to allow Earthly invaders to gain a flagella-hold. Because of rapid, ongoing progress in our knowledge of the Martian environment and the fundamental limits of Earthly biology, the precise definitions for Special Regions remain works in progress that are officially revisited every two years. The new joint review, released last week, recommends revisions to the findings of a 2014 report on COSPAR’s Special Regions from NASA’s Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group.

       Do you know how the terrain between its current location and the site with the water looks like? Can Curiosity make it that far over that terrain?

       Nope, you're lying. Ive learned from many users here, including you, that simply saying something Is a lie or a hoax makes me right. All of your sources are lying, and the flat earth theory is a hoax.

       So the entire rest of the world outside of your little collection of youtube videos and blogs is
       <em>

       an echo chamber? I think your perspective is skewed, little paranoid metabolix.

       Thinking about this further, I'd love to see how you manage to rationalize the thousands of people in hundreds of disciplines into an "echo chamber" as well. Is
       <em>

       Its cause of the "system". You don't realize how the system has you doing a job you'd rather not do? Don't you understand the power of money? Or are you still in high school?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its also because most people don't think deeply about topics, maybe just 5-10% percent of the population have the thirst for truth and knowledge. Most people think up to a certain level, but they don't conduct an exhaustive inquiry on certain topics especially the taboo ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people are also very gullible and suggestive. They are not critical about information they hear from everyday sources or authority figures. Society (esp western society) puts emphasis on other things for example getting laid as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also a lot of people look the other way when they see such evil in the world. My relatives for example have some high paying jobs and they know the truth of this world (9/11, NASA hoaxes, propaganda etc), but they say it is how it is, what can you do about it. They don't want to loose what they have. Would you?
      </p>
      <p>
       See I listed out 4 of many points, to get you to start thinking. I'm glad you are thinking further about this, because you are now using more of your brain than say 90% of the population.

       Nope you don't understand the nature of propaganda. Good propaganda is designed to be indistinguishable from reality. Its not so easy to see through as you propose. Its only a matter of time before more people start speaking out. Have you heard of the French revolution? A Revolution can happen in our lifetime as well. Don't be so glum.

       It's not propaganda when it's science. Once again, there are more sources for science in this world than NASA. You have repeatedly claimed that basic science is "false" or a "lie" when it goes against your "flat earth" or "NASA lies!" claims. I don't think all of the science that is out there is a lie, because some of what NASA does and claims would be easy enough to disprove by even a basic scientist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe it or not, not everything you read or see is propaganda. I know that may be hard for a paranoid such as yourself to grasp, but there is some reality out there. Even some you could find for yourself if you bothered to look up from your cut-rate youtube videos and blogs and instead looked through a telescope.
