        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Speech delivered in New York, Monday 28th September 2015</p>

<p>PUTIN (THROUGH INTERPRETER): Your excellency Mr. President, your excellency Mr. Secretary General, distinguished heads of state and government, ladies and gentlemen, the 70th anniversary of the United Nations is a good occasion to both take stock of history and talk about our common future.</p>

<p>In 1945, the countries that defeated Nazism joined their efforts to lay solid foundations for the postwar world order.</p>

<p>But I remind you that the key decisions on the principles guiding the cooperation among states, as well as on the establishment of the United Nations, were made in our country, in Yalta, at the meeting of the anti-Hitler coalition leaders.</p>

<p>The Yalta system was actually born in travail. It was won at the cost of tens of millions of lives and two world wars.</p>

<p>This swept through the planet in the 20th century.</p>

<p>Let us be fair. It helped humanity through turbulent, at times dramatic, events of the last seven decades. It saved the world from large-scale upheavals.</p>

<p>The United Nations is unique in its legitimacy, representation and universality. It is true that lately the U.N. has been widely criticized for supposedly not being efficient enough, and for the fact that the decision-making on fundamental issues stalls due to insurmountable differences, first of all, among the members of the Security Council.</p>

<p>However, I’d like to point out there have always been differences in the U.N. throughout all these 70 years of existence. The veto right has always been exercised by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China, the Soviet Union and Russia later, alike. It is absolutely natural for so diverse and representative an organization.</p>

<p>When the U.N. was established, its founders did not in the least think that there would always be unanimity. The mission of the organization is to seek and reach compromises, and its strength comes from taking different views and opinions into consideration. Decisions debated within the U.N. are either taken as resolutions or not. As diplomats say, they either pass or do not pass.</p>

<p>Whatever actions any state might take bypassing this procedure are illegitimate. They run counter to the charter and defy international law. We all know that after the end of the Cold War — everyone is aware of that — a single center of domination emerged in the world, and then those who found themselves at the top of the pyramid were tempted to think that if they were strong and exceptional, they knew better and they did not have to reckon with the U.N., which, instead of [acting to] automatically authorize and legitimize the necessary decisions, often creates obstacles or, in other words, stands in the way.</p>

<p>It has now become commonplace to see that in its original form, it has become obsolete and completed its historical mission. Of course, the world is changing and the U.N. must be consistent with this natural transformation. Russia stands ready to work together with its partners on the basis of full consensus, but we consider the attempts to undermine the legitimacy of the United Nations as extremely dangerous. They could lead to a collapse of the entire architecture of international organizations, and then indeed there would be no other rules left but the rule of force.</p>

<p>We would get a world dominated by selfishness rather than collective work, a world increasingly characterized by dictate rather than equality. There would be less of a chain of democracy and freedom, and that would be a world where true independent states would be replaced by an ever-growing number of de facto protectorates and externally controlled territories.</p>

<p>What is the state sovereignty, after all, that has been mentioned by our colleagues here? It is basically about freedom and the right to choose freely one’s own future for every person, nation and state. By the way, dear colleagues, the same holds true of the question of the so-called legitimacy of state authority. One should not play with or manipulate words.</p>

<p>Every term in international law and international affairs should be clear, transparent and have uniformly understood criteria. We are all different, and we should respect that. No one has to conform to a single development model that someone has once and for all recognized as the only right one. We should all remember what our past has taught us.</p>

<p>We also remember certain episodes from the history of the Soviet Union. Social experiments for export, attempts to push for changes within other countries based on ideological preferences, often led to tragic consequences and to degradation rather than progress.</p>

<p>It seemed, however, that far from learning from others’ mistakes, everyone just keeps repeating them, and so the export of revolutions, this time of so-called democratic ones, continues. It would suffice to look at the situation in the Middle East and North Africa, as has been mentioned by previous speakers. Certainly political and social problems in this region have been piling up for a long time, and people there wish for changes naturally.</p>

<p>But how did it actually turn out? Rather than bringing about reforms, an aggressive foreign interference has resulted in a brazen destruction of national institutions and the lifestyle itself. Instead of the triumph of democracy and progress, we got violence, poverty and social disaster. Nobody cares a bit about human rights, including the right to life.</p>

<p>I cannot help asking those who have caused the situation, do you realize now what you’ve done? But I am afraid no one is going to answer that. Indeed, policies based on self-conceit and belief in one’s exceptionality and impunity have never been abandoned.</p>

<p>It is now obvious that the power vacuum created in some countries of the Middle East and North Africa through the emergence of anarchy areas, which immediately started to be filled with extremists and terrorists.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of militants are fighting under the banners of the so-called Islamic State. Its ranks include former Iraqi servicemen who were thrown out into the street after the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Many recruits also come from Libya, a country whose statehood was destroyed as a result of a gross violation of the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973. And now, the ranks of radicals are being joined by the members of the so-called moderate Syrian opposition supported by the Western countries.
First, they are armed and trained and then they defect to the so-called Islamic State. Besides, the Islamic State itself did not just come from nowhere. It was also initially forged as a tool against undesirable secular regimes.</p>

<p>Having established a foothold in Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State has begun actively expanding to other regions. It is seeking dominance in the Islamic world. And not only there, and its plans go further than that. The situation is more than dangerous.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, it is hypocritical and irresponsible to make loud declarations about the threat of international terrorism while turning a blind eye to the channels of financing and supporting terrorists, including the process of trafficking and illicit trade in oil and arms. It would be equally irresponsible to try to manipulate extremist groups and place them at one’s service in order to achieve one’s own political goals in the hope of later dealing with them or, in other words, liquidating them.</p>

<p>To those who do so, I would like to say — dear sirs, no doubt you are dealing with rough and cruel people, but they’re in no way primitive or silly. They are just as clever as you are, and you never know who is manipulating whom. And the recent data on arms transferred to this most moderate opposition is the best proof of it.</p>

<p>We believe that any attempts to play games with terrorists, let alone to arm them, are not just short-sighted, but fire hazardous (ph). This may result in the global terrorist threat increasing dramatically and engulfing new regions, especially given that Islamic State camps train militants from many countries, including the European countries.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, dear colleagues, I have to put it frankly: Russia is not an exception. We cannot allow these criminals who already tasted blood to return back home and continue their evil doings. No one wants this to happen, does he?</p>

<p>Russia has always been consistently fighting against terrorism in all its forms. Today, we provide military and technical assistance both to Iraq and Syria and many other countries of the region who are fighting terrorist groups.
We think it is an enormous mistake to refuse to cooperate with the Syrian government and its armed forces, who are valiantly fighting terrorism face to face. We should finally acknowledge that no one but President Assad’s armed forces and Kurds (ph) militias are truly fighting the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations in Syria.</p>

<p>We know about all the problems and contradictions in the region, but which were (ph) based on the reality.</p>

<p>Dear colleagues, I must note that such an honest and frank approach of Russia has been recently used as a pretext to accuse it of its growing ambitions, as if those who say it have no ambitions at all.</p>

<p>However, it’s not about Russia’s ambitions, dear colleagues, but about the recognition of the fact that we can no longer tolerate the current state of affairs in the world. What we actually propose is to be guided by common values and common interests, rather than ambitions.</p>

<p>On the basis of international law, we must join efforts to address the problems that all of us are facing and create a genuinely broad international coalition against terrorism.</p>

<p>Similar to the anti-Hitler coalition, it could unite a broad range of forces that are resolutely resisting those who, just like the Nazis, sow evil and hatred of humankind. And, naturally, the Muslim countries are to play a key role in the coalition, even more so because the Islamic State does not only pose a direct threat to them, but also desecrates one of the greatest world religions by its bloody crimes.</p>

<p>The ideologists (ph) of militants make a mockery of Islam and pervert its true humanistic (ph) values. I would like to address Muslim spiritual leaders, as well. Your authority and your guidance are of great importance right now.</p>

<p>It is essential to prevent people recruited by militants from making hasty decisions and those who have already been deceived, and who, due to various circumstances found themselves among terrorists, need help in finding a way back to normal life, laying down arms, and putting an end to fratricide.</p>

<p>Russia will shortly convene, as the (ph) current president of the Security Council, a ministerial meeting to carry out a comprehensive analysis of threats in the Middle East.</p>

<p>First of all, we propose discussing whether it is possible to agree on a resolution aimed at coordinating the actions of all the forces that confront the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations. Once again, this coordination should be based on the principles of the U.N. Charter.</p>

<p>We hope that the international community will be able to develop a comprehensive strategy of political stabilization, as well as social and economic recovery, of the Middle East.</p>

<p>Then, dear friends, there would be no need for new refugee camps. Today, the flow of people who were forced to leave their homeland has literally engulfed first neighboring countries and then Europe itself. There were hundreds of thousands of them now, and there might be millions before long. In fact, it is a new great and tragic migration of peoples, and it is a harsh lesson for all of us, including Europe.</p>

<p>I would like to stress refugees undoubtedly need our compassion and support. However, the — on the way to solve this problem at a fundamental level is to restore their statehood where it has been destroyed, to strengthen the government institutions where they still exist or are being reestablished, to provide comprehensive assistance of military, economic and material nature to countries in a difficult situation. And certainly, to those people who, despite all the ordeals, will not abandon their homes. Literally, any assistance to sovereign states can and must be offered rather than imposed exclusively and solely in accordance with the U.N. Charter.</p>

<p>In other words, everything in this field that has been done or will be done pursuant to the norms of international law must be supported by our organization. Everything that contravenes the U.N. Charter must be rejected. Above all, I believe it is of the utmost importance to help restore government’s institutions in Libya, support the new government of Iraq and provide comprehensive assistance to the legitimate government of Syria.</p>

<p>Dear colleagues, ensuring peace and regional and global stability remains the key objective of the international community with the U.N. at its helm. We believe this means creating a space of equal and indivisible security, which is not for the select few but for everyone. Yet, it is a challenge and complicated and time-consuming task, but there is simply no other alternative. However, the bloc thinking of the times of the Cold War and the desire to explore new geopolitical areas is still present among some of our colleagues.</p>

<p>First, they continue their policy of expanding NATO. What for? If the Warsaw Bloc stopped its existence, the Soviet Union have collapsed (ph) and, nevertheless, the NATO continues expanding as well as its military infrastructure. Then they offered the poor Soviet countries a false choice: either to be with the West or with the East. Sooner or later, this logic of confrontation was bound to spark off a grave geopolitical crisis. This is exactly what happened in Ukraine, where the discontent of population with the current authorities was used and the military coup was orchestrated from outside — that triggered a civil war as a result.</p>

<p>We’re confident that only through full and faithful implementation of the Minsk agreements of February 12th, 2015, can we put an end to the bloodshed and find a way out of the deadlock. Ukraine’s territorial integrity cannot be ensured by threat of force and force of arms. What is needed is a genuine consideration for the interests and rights of the people in the Donbas region and respect for their choice. There is a need to coordinate with them as provided for by the Minsk agreements, the key elements of the country’s political structure. These steps will guarantee that Ukraine will develop as a civilized society, as an essential link and building a common space of security and economic cooperation, both in Europe and in Eurasia.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I have mentioned... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why I no longer buy into US propaganda. I know what my government is up to. They aren&#39;t just screwing up the rest of the world for their own self gain but also screw over the American civilians as well. This speech was exactly what needed to be said. I hope that all of the world&#39;s countries come together and teach the US government a lesson in humility. You don&#39;t get to just do whatever you want with no consequence. </p>

<p>Our leadership has needed to be put in its place for a long damn time and its just unfortunate that it has to be an outsider who does it. It should be the civilians here rising up to tell our government to fuck off with their self absorbed bullshit and to drag certain people out of their positions of power for their crimes against humanity and throw them in jail cells where they belong. From there we can actually start holding big industry, the military, and the police accountable for their violations of the law both internal and international. </p>

<p>Its starts with us. WE have to get our own government in check. Its embarassing that we have not done that yet but then again we have become a nation of lazy cowards that live to do nothing but talk and consume. That may sound harsh but I would love for another American to look around and how we act and tell me that isn&#39;t the case. Sometimes you gotta say fuck patriotism and do what&#39;s best for everyone world wide. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>God damn.  <em>This</em> a hundred times over.  You could not be more right.  Some of us Americans are sitting here looking at what Russia&#39;s doing and are going &quot;Oooh!  In your face, American government!  That&#39;s what you get for being such assholes!  Get some!  Ha ha!&quot; when the fact of the matter is that this move on Russia&#39;s part not only makes American government look horrible...but it makes American CITIZENS look pretty damn horrible too.  That another country had to be the one to step in and discipline our own government for us when it really should be <em>we ourselves</em> as a citizenry that should have woken up and taken the responsibility to do that <em>ourselves?</em>  Yeah.  Russia is stepping up and beginning to do what <em>we</em> should have been doing ourselves as a citizenry - further showing and proving that we as a citizenry <em>are</em> indeed very little more than dumb, useless, mouth breathing sheep being led to slaughter while we do nothing.  It doesn&#39;t have to <em>remain</em> this way, and we <em>could</em> indeed grow a pair of balls and figure out how to come together and take responsibility for the horrible shit that the U.S. government is doing (in <em>our</em> name), but right now?...we as a citizenry haven&#39;t done shit...and we&#39;re just making ourselves look like nothing but complete and total cannon fodder.  We get pissed off when we&#39;re classified as &quot;sheep&quot; or &quot;useless&quot; or expendable or whatever...but then we turn around and act <em>exactly</em> like these things.  I mean wtf?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t pretend to be &quot;the&quot; trail blazer.  I don&#39;t pretend to be the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/files/x-all-the-things-template.png">Come follow me!!</a> figure.  I look at people like Christopher Dorner and Michael Hastings and, of course, am not in a super rush to jump headlong into &quot;fighting the power&quot; all by myself and ending up like them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m totally okay with ending up like them in the face of moving forward in a group that might have a real chance of changing things, but the idea of moving forward <em>individually</em> seems naturally foolhardy and pretty overtly <em>not</em> recommended.</p>

<p>I have joined groups moving forward and discussing ideas that may be considered very different from what the establishment works with, I have taken part in various demonstrations and marches that have occurred, and in &quot;grass roots&quot; community help programs that have gone forward, but...well, it&#39;s obviously not been enough, and many of us are simply still idle (including myself sometimes).</p>

<p>There is significant PTB resistance to our collectively coming out of our stupor as a citizenry, however.  I feel it, I think many feel it, and this seems to keep a lot of us stagnant.</p>

But no. Most humans are vile creatures, I&#39;m sorry to say it, but I would be remiss not to say it; and I will continue believing so until I am proven otherwise.

</blockquote>

<p>God dammit I wish that too.  I keep waiting, somehow, for that “backdoor, ptb infiltration community” to just magically spring up and somehow contact me to join its ranks. lol.  I’m a fucking dumb ass thinking like this - I know - but I would join in a heartbeat a serious resistance movement that <em>really</em> has its shit together.  Hell, I’d even help lead a group like that if it was <em>that</em> on point.  I’d really go “balls deep” in that type of resistance movement.  However, I haven’t, of course, come across any such “magical resistance group”, so I do the little I can from my current, very limited vantage point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if they just used all of that motivation they have for defending the homeland, we could feed every human on this planet, and offer every single human being a life worth living.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think this has ever been their intention, however.  I don’t think that the <em>real</em> PTB have any interest in <em>really</em> helping humanity.  You see, we are, I believe, <em>sheep</em> to them.  We are chattel.  We are expendable workers that they use only to take advantage of, chew up, and then throw away.  They only see us as a resource, and they do NOT want that resource to <em>ever</em> get too strong or too smart or too independent of them.  They want that resource to remain <em>just</em> strong enough and <em>just</em> smart enough and capable and able bodied enough to do the <em>slave work</em> for them…but <em>never</em> strong enough to rise above mere subsistence.  They do not want too many of us to get TOO powerful or <em>too</em> independent because they have THEIR system and they don’t want the 99% expendables to ever threaten their “lofty” way of life.</p>

<p>So this is the reason why TPTB really <em>could</em> help all of us and they do have what it takes to end poverty and hunger and homelessness and disease…but they <em>don’t</em> end these problems.  They don’t end these problems because they <em>want</em> these problems…they NEED these problems.  They can’t have the herd of “stupid mouth breathing humans” get too fat and too populated and overbearing, you see.</p>

<p>Gotta have the sheep be just strong enough to be good slaves…but nothing more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most humans are vile creatures, I&#39;m sorry to say it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of us have, I feel, largely been <em>made</em> to be vile greatly because of the circumstances we live in.  It’s difficult for many of us to NOT be vile when our lives are surrounded by such unchecked <em>filth</em> everywhere.  I think most if not all of us humans that are vile would/could also be very productive if this civilization were formulated to really HELP instead of covertly hinder.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will continue believing so until I am proven otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You want proof that you shouldn’t believe that most humans are vile creatures?</p>

<p>Look in the mirror.</p>

<p>I bet you that on any given day, you might be/are the coolest fucking dude in the world.  I bet on any given day most people around you would be like “This dude is fucking <em>awesome</em>.  I’m <em>super</em> glad to call him a friend.”</p>

<p>I bet you on any other given day, however, you can also find people that would think you a horrible jerk.  You might find yourself in a situation when somebody - friend or stranger - can look at you and think “What the <em>fuck</em> is wrong with this motherfucker??  Fucking <em>seriously??</em>  He didn’t need to do <em>that shit!</em>  I swear some people are just SUCH horrible assholes!  Why would anybody <em>do</em> that??”</p>

<p>Crazy, isn’t it?  We are all each other on any given day.  We just have to keep working toward manifesting that part of us which is the good and constructive and loving and helpful part.  Easier said than done, but still.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the United States is the beacon of humanity -- then what does that say of our species?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The United States <em>isn’t</em> the beacon of humanity - not any more so than any other place is.  We are <em>all</em> “humanity” and we are <em>all</em> full of potential to be great and beautiful - regardless of whether we are from the U.S. or Africa or Europe or wherever.</p>

<p>Good points you made ultimately, though.  I upvoted you because I feel you are saying important things, and I definitely understand them on a certain level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great response, I totally agree with everything you&#39;ve stated. To further underscore what I meant about humanity; I absolutely realize that to see the folley of our race all I must do is look in the mirror. This is why I have little hope for us.

But right now -- with my severe lack of technical prowess, I&#39;d be of little help to anyone. So I try to educate myself on the real mechanics of power, on what is happening in this world of ours. So that at least I may understand what forces are acting upon us on a daily basis, so as to at least teach and inspire others to educate themselves. But I see little hope, their propaganda machine is so comprehensive and entrenched in the very culture of our world. It is in our economics, our education, our politics. It is humanity itself that is corrupt, this seems to be the point I return to so often.</p>

<p>Yeah but you also have parts in your that, for the right cause and the right reason(s), will get up and be a dynamo of thought, action, and inspiration.  Perhaps you haven’t come across too many if any of those reasons yet, but they most definitely exist.</p>

<p>By simple virtue of just the very few sentences you have responded with here, I can tell you are a conscientious person, however; an individual that is thoughtful and careful with how they say things and with making sure their thoughts and intentions are accurately understood.  This alone tells me that you have a lot to offer, for that conscientiousness and consideration is often a significant foundation behind what is needed to effectively connect with others and communicate powerful ideas - and powerful ideas drive forward powerful actions and powerful movements.  All this is to say that one need not necessarily have any sort of technical prowess alone in order to be useful to a group, for it takes all types to get an operation going and moving forward.</p>

<p>Sounds like that would be <em>extremely</em> helpful actually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I see little hope, their propaganda machine is so comprehensive and entrenched in the very culture of our world. It is in our economics, our education, our politics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Their propaganda is indeed quite ubiquitous and comprehensive.  However, although I know that the possibility of exacting a successful revolution might not be the most likely thing in our lifetime (maybe), I do know that I can continue (as you mentioned above) educating myself and learning about as many things as possible so as to be able to enrich myself and others as much as I can while I’m on this planet.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On a certain (possibly very deep) level, this is correct as well.  What this means, therefore, is that our greatest hope of effecting change may lie not in any external show of force or grandiosity, but most effectively within our very selves.  Inside.  In our hearts and in our minds.  It involves a developing and an evolving of our ability not only to “do” the right thing, but to <em>think and feel</em> the right thing as well.</p>

<p>Well said. Unless we drop the selfishness there is no way for a real change. If I or nobody else can stand up for the good of everyone just because it might hurt my own situation nothing&#39;s going to happen.</p>

<p>People point fingers at the &quot;illuminati&quot; and what not, but it&#39;s the people that makes everything actually happen. And what if any of us was in &quot;their&quot; shoes, lived a life where you gain more and more power, would you not do the exact same things that the people with power do? I would. And I guess that is the problem.</p>

<p>Very correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How will we convince our countrymen to put aside petty divisions and step up to the plate?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a very good question.  I often think about what kind of message(s) I myself would give if speaking to a crowd, etc.  They would be similar to some of the things I say on this very website.  The point is to look beyond our (as you correctly said) &quot;petty divisions&quot;.  I would not only try to set up some sort of program to feed the homeless, but I would try to educate them as well...and the type of education that I would stress would involve a great deal of overall tolerance and unity and self discipline amongst people.</p>

<p>It&#39;s ultimately a very, very tough uphill battle because there is a lot of influence on this planet running counter to the unity that we as a citizenry need to develop in order to come together as one and overcome many of these problems in the first place.</p>

<p>That would seem to be a valid reason, but I consider myself a “people” and I think it’s <em>very</em> possible.  Even though I’ve never seen it done right, that doesn’t mean that the manner that I’m envisioning in my mind wouldn’t itself work.  I very much think it <em>would</em> work.  Now, getting all of us to be and work together as one people is a tall order, to be sure, but I very much <em>do</em> think that it would be <em>very</em> difficult - if not downright impossible - for TPTB to stop <em>all</em> of us if all of humanity were moving together against their manipulation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That’s definitely understandable.  When I think about ALL of us working together and moving forward, I don’t see any way that we <em>can’t</em> succeed.  However, if I think about just <em>me myself</em> trying to “make it happen” and “fighting the power” (which I still try to do as much as possible) then I understand that such a thing becomes <em>very</em> difficult on one’s own.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re all in the same place and we always have been.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems that way.  The more things change, the more things stay the same…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We just need to do what hasn&#39;t been done before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a thing which I <em>know</em> is not impossible to actually do.  I <em>know</em> it’s very much possible for us to put our differences aside for the sake of improving ALL of us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Non-participation and a boycotting of sorts by the appropriate amount of people will do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct, but not just boycotting and non-participation is needed.  Boycotting and non-participation from the context of a citizenry that is also at the same time HELPING EACH OTHER during those times when they are fighting the system and not living off the teat of the manipulative state.  Then the fight can be sustained because we can fall back upon the help that we are providing each other instead of being unable to “fight the good fight” because we’re afraid to lose our jobs or because we have dependent mouths to feed and care for, etc.  If we helped each other, then it wouldn’t matter if any one of us lost our jobs, etc because the community of resisters would be living independent of the manipulative state anyway.</p>

<p>Yes.  I know.  This is a tall order and is MUCH easier said than done, but it is still very much not impossible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They can&#39;t put people in jail or attack/kill people for not wanting the system to be run this way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes they can, and they <em>do</em>…but we would <em>still</em> have to stand up and fight TOGETHER against it nonetheless.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If non participation doesn&#39;t work, we non-violently walk up and remove them. By the arm, walk them out. There is no other option for them except to make people fear more via violence, which we would have to be prepared for. As soon as they resort to violence, we have won.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I would say that we should be ready and willing to fight with arms <em>if we have to</em> and there is no other choice.  However, that should be a last resort, and non violence should be the standard.  I wouldn’t say we have won once they resort to violence because if they resort to violence and we as a result end up cowering and giving in to their demands <em>because</em> of that violence, then <em>they</em> have won.  This is what happened as a result of the false flag attack on 9/11/01.  They murdered thousands of us and scared the shit out of tens of millions of us…and, after shitting our pants, we just said “Yes!  Do it!  Whatever you want!  Whatever you need to do!  Just <em>do it!</em>  Help us!!”</p>

<p>It’s not just “once they turn to violence” in and of itself that shows when we have won.  We have won once the violence that they resort to is still not enough to make us cower; not enough to keep us from still moving forward toward truth <em>together</em>; not enough to make us back away from our principles of togetherness and communal development as one species <em>independent</em> of them.</p>

<p>Once the violence they may resort to doesn’t work, and it doesn’t keep us from moving forward toward non-participation and toward togetherness, <em>then</em> we have won.</p>

<p>Ultimately, however, we are not really in much disagreement here, sir.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;ve got the right attitude and your comment is on the right track as well. But you might have missed or misinterpreted <em>this crucially important</em> comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a single center of domination emerged in the world, and then those who found themselves at the top of the pyramid were tempted to think that if they were strong and exceptional, they knew better and they did not have to reckon with the U.N.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Those at the top of the pyramid&quot;... so let&#39;s assume that Putin has chosen his words deliberately. I&#39;m going to suggest that he&#39;s not talking about the government in general, but the deep state government hidden within.</p>

<p>These are the people that have brought us to the brink of WWIII. The question is why?</p>

<p>Now I&#39;ll suggest that their plan is working. It has always been about drawing the Russians into a hot war. They tried in Ukraine and it didn&#39;t work. Now they&#39;re trying it again in Syria.</p>

<p>They are trying to get WWIII started so they can scare every nation into accepting their New World Order. It will be like the Cuban Missile Crisis, except ten times worse. Everyone will see powerful individual nations as part of the problem and not the solution. The UN will be seen as either corrupt, or ineffective in the face of individual national power.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll have the crisis. And then we&#39;ll be offered the pre-planned solution. Replace the UN or upgrade it to something more powerful. People will accept this solution or even demand it. A transnational organization whose authority supersedes that of any individual nation.</p>

<p>Putin has actually been drawn in by the pied piper of geopolitical necessity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A fantastic speech. Putin is very clever in his choice of words, he&#39;s someone in a very powerful position and I feel as though he is offering his hand and if the west doesn&#39;t take it, his actions will only get bolder.</p>

<p>I have studied the cold war for many years and I honestly believe we are about to enter a new era. America is not short of its failures and oppression but dont forget what is going on in Russia at the moment- Freedom of the press is appalling and gay rights are being swallowed up by new far right laws. For a man who talks about freedom and democracy he should look at himself first- he&#39;s been in power for over 15 years.</p>

We&#39;re still funding proxy armies to fight it out for US and Russian interests.  Russia and the US are now bombing opposing forces in Syria.  That&#39;s pretty damn close to a hot war between the two.</p>

I&#39;m not really that knowledgeable about any of it, but I believe it&#39;s never too late, and we should never give up on the Nation our Forefathers intended, and not giving up and letting our country commit immorality globally without consequences, he is right, Isis and terrorism in the region is our FAULT, the CI A educated children with textbooks they still are using.

<p>after the end of the Cold War — everyone is aware of that — a single center of domination emerged in the world, and then those who found themselves at the top of the pyramid were tempted to think that if they were strong and exceptional, they knew better and they did not have to reckon with the U.N., which, instead of [acting to] automatically authorize and legitimize the necessary decisions, often creates obstacles or, in other words, stands in the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, exactly. This is the pot calling the kettle black. Russia and the US are the two main sides of most of the proxy wars going on in the world for the last several decades. Russia arms one side, the US arms the other. One does the government, the other does the rebels. Then once everything is destabilized enough, the proxy winner invades that country with their army, and then installs a new puppet government. Rinse and repeat. </p>

<p>They both do it. The US and Russia are the #1 and #2 arms exporters in the world, by a long shot. </p>

<p>This is like the Italian mob calling out the corruptness of the Yakuza. They may be right (and very accurate), but look at who is saying it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true, he is bringing it up. It&#39;s good it&#39;s being talked about by someone important. </p>

<p>But I also imagine in the Russian media what putin said is censored. It&#39;s sad we have to look to people from other countries to point out the systemic corruption in our own. I bet many in Russia look to US media to point out the corruption that Russian media ignores. No one will say it, people are too afraid of the social/professional/legal consequences of calling out the BS their own government. In the US and Russia.  </p>

<p>A cultural atmosphere generated by media propaganda reinforces this, and we are drowning in pro-corporate pro-government media in America. It&#39;s disheartening if you have a differing opinion, to say the least. But that&#39;s why we all need to speak up about what we think as individuals and stop letting the media create our culture for us. This is the only way we can transcend this crap as a species.  </p>

&quot;Sir,</p>

<p>I am directed by the Ministry to send you the following circular letter: It is often the &#39;duty of the good citizens and of the pious Christians to turn a blind eye on the peculiarities of those associated with us&#39; (Lunatic Jew Logic)</p>

<p>But the time comes when such peculiarities, while still denied in public, must be taken into account when action by us is called for: We know the methods of rule employed by the Bolshevik dictator in Russia itself from, for example, the writing and speeches of the Prime Minister himself during the last twenty years. We know how the red army behaved in Poland in 1920 and in Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Galicia, and Bessarabia only recently. (Yeah right)</p>

<p>We must, therefore, take into account how the Red Army will certainly behave when it overruns Central Europe. Unless precautions are taken, the obviously inevitable horrors which will result will throw an UNDUE STRAIN ON PUBLIC OPINION in this country (Jewnited Kingdom)</p>

<p>We cannot reform the Bolsheviks but we cand o our best to SAVE THEM AND OURSELVES FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTS. The disclosures of the past quarter of a century will render mere denials unconvincing. THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO DENIAL IS TO DISTRACT PUBLIC OPINION FROM THE WHOLE SUBJECT. (How will they do this?)</p>

<p>Experience has shown that the best distraction is ATROCITY PROPAGANDA directed against the enemy. Unfortunately the public is no longer susceptible as in the days of the &quot;Corpse Factory&quot;, and the &quot;Mutilated Belgian Babies&quot;, and the &quot;Crucified Canadians&quot;.</p>

<p>Your cooperation is therefore earnestly sought to DISTRACT PUBLIC ATTENTION FROM THE DOINGS OF THE RED ARMY BY YOUR WHOLEHEARTED SUPPORT OF VARIOUS CHARGES AGAINST THE GERMANS AND THE JAPANESE WHICH HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE PUT INTO CIRCULATION BY THE MINISTRY (of information, U.K.)</p>

<p>Your expression of belief in such (because it&#39;s not true) MAY convince others.</p>

<p>I am, Sir, your obedient servant,</p>

<p>(signed) H. HEWET, ASSISTANT SECRETARY</p>

<p>The Ministry can enter into no correspondence of any kind with regard to this communication which should only be disclosed to responsible persons. (Communists). </p>

However, it is important to at least move in the <em>direction</em> of the more correct proclamations - and Putin is most definitely making proclamations that are VERY much more correct than those being made by the United States and Israel and their allies, and it is important to recognize that fact and understand some of the points Putin is making.</p>

<p>What you’re doing is the equivalent of rejecting the message because you don’t like the messenger.</p>

<p>You have to be able to separate the two.  This isn’t “black or white”, and it doesn’t mean that if you listen to Putin, then you are “100% go Russia!!  Woohoo!!”  No.  Don’t think like that.  Politicians are SHIT regardless of where they’re from and shouldn’t be listened to without critical investigation for sure.  However, what Putin is saying in calling out the United States, etc simply IS VERY CORRECT…and truth is truth regardless of <em>whose</em> mouth it comes out of.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am taking my news from a variety of news sources, out of several countries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At least one of which should be Russia, bro…and yet you’re here saying that you’re not going to pay any attention to what one very <em>big</em> representative of Russian news has to say.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But life is full of choices, and this one is rejected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough.  I guess all I’m saying is that rejecting this particular choice seems like it keeps you from having a greater breadth of understanding where it regards grasping A) the chicanery that the U.S. and Israel keep perpetrating, B) Putin and Russia’s calling them out on it on a world stage, and C) what this might very well do to the U.S.’s destabilizing global hegemony.  The U.S. has already been acting like a <em>veeery</em> desperate bully who’s about to lose its power.  This move on Russia’s part can push U.S. up against a corner even more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am sorry to understand people&#39;s distrust in western mass media is converted in choosing for an at least equally bad source of news and do find that a total lack of critical thought</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And…you see…that’s the point I’ve been trying to make from the beginning:  If you think that what’s being done here - or what <em>I</em> am doing - is “choosing only between one or the other - A <em>or</em> B - Putin or Obama…the US or Russia only!” then you’re simply just NOT doing it right.  You’re not thinking about this right.</p>

<p>This isn’t about “Russia or the U.S.!” only.  Shit is a lot more complicated than that.  Don’t get stuck in some unnecessary dichotomy because that’s certainly not what I’m saying, and one can listen critically to what Putin is saying and understand the good, valid points that he’s making without, somehow, thinking that he’s “the great savior of the world!”</p>

<p>and one from China, Japan, India, two political wings in the US, and as European a bunch from Europe too. At least Germany, France, UK (besides my own Dutch that is).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct.  Making proclamations against the U.S. does <em>not</em> automatically make the statements correct.  However, you are (once again) thinking a bit too simplistically by assuming that I feel Putin&#39;s move was in the right direction strictly because he was being &quot;against the US&quot;.  His move was in the right direction because, among many other things, he was talking about not continuing to wage covert proxy wars of aggression against other nations in attempts to overthrow them when they haven&#39;t attacked you or caused you any direct harm.</p>

<p>THAT data point is correct regardless of what Putin&#39;s other policies may be, and the US and Israel are <em>very</em> much in the wrong in that they have proven to engage in these types of malevolent actions over and over again.</p>
