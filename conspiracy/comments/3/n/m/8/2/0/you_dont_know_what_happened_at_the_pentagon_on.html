      <p>
       I have the most controversial opinion around about what happened at the Pentagon but I also have  some rare evidence to back it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first call to 911 on 9/11 was from a lady who said that a helicopter had gone around the Pentagon and fired a missile at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assume with me for a moment that the first report, before the spin doctors could change or block it, was correct and that a helicopter had gone to a predesignated position below eye level, in front of the bridge abutment at the expressway, at the edge of the lawn and fired a missile out of sight of traffic and witnesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason they would do this would be to get rid of all the evidence and the personnel that were working on that evidence in the disappearance of the 2.3 trillion dollars. To make sure that nothing was missed, or hit accidentally, the personnel inside the Pentagon needed a visual marker to show them where the attack would come form so they could place people and computers in the line of fire. Nothing could be left to chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The necessary visual marker should be visible from inside the Pentagon and from outside so that no one 'in the loop' could become confused and also as I said in a position where there would be no witnesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such a marker was indeed placed on the lawn to indicate where the computers and accountants should be and where the heli. should position itself, where it should hover and in which direction it would be firing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should be seen from inside and from outside but what the planners may not have realized was that it could even be seen from a satellite. Such a marker was indeed photographed by Space Imaging Corp. on the 7th of September 2001. I found it by doing a google image search soon after the attacks. Another such image was made on the 15th.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the full image of the lawn marking.

      <p>
       A few working hours after the attack the lawn marking was aggressively covered up.

       I say it's controversial because at every mention online I suddenly get fucked with by some unknown entity or heavily brigaded and have in fact suffered a blue screen after I wrote all of this out for you the first time. I'll try to get screen shots with my camera if it happens again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I value all opinions about this.

       I'd like to say at the outset that I didn't think to get a copy of the Washington newspaper article published within a month of 9/11 that included the story of the first 9/11 call. I can't find it now so long afterwards and I solicit the help of anyone interested in finding it. I have  a list of those killed and they do seem to be the accounting department looking into the missing trillions. When you are talking about trillions of dollars there is no limit as to the skulduggery that would be allowed in order to get control of the situation.

       39 out of 40 employees working in the Office of Naval Intelligence were killed. They are the department that was investigating the missing money. I believe that in addition to your theory,  pre-planted explosives inside the building were also responsible.

       I had heard about the files being targeted, but I had never head 39 people lose their lives - I thought they reported no one was conveniently killed as the area had just been renovated (I think to resist missile attacks...) and wasn't functional yet?

        "
        <em>

       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then at 55:34 in that video it makes the baseless assertion that:
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He provided this as evidence to bolster other unsourced assertions that the people who died were naval intelligence. It was pretty far up the thread so you'll have to concentrate if you want to get to the bottom of this.

       Why should I be the one to dig around to find that? He made the claim, he needs to support it. The Office of Naval Intelligence does not account for funds - it's as absurd as saying that the Pentagon gym staff is looking into it. It's a totally separate field.

       you're trying really hard to ignore reality while pretending like this is all a big intellectual exercise. Go look it up yourself. You saying "if you don't do my research for me, to inform me in exact detail, then it doesn't count and I don't believe you" is childish and ignorant and ridiculous.

       I'm not asking anybody to do my research for me. I've done plenty of research about this. I'm one of the few people on this forum to have actually
       <a href="http://www.dodig.mil/audit/reports/fy00/00-179.pdf">
        read the inspector general's audit report
       </a>
       where $2.3 trillion dollar figure came from. I've read
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100301161721/http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=430">
        Rumsfeld's speech on 9/10/2001
       </a>
       where he briefly mentions those transactions--not an announcement since they were
       <a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20010103&amp;amp;slug=pent03">
        known publicly before Rumsfeld even took office
       </a>
       and in fact, he was
       <a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4521969/sen-byrd-rumsfeld-nominatin-hearing">
        asked to look into them at his confirmation hearings
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       But what does the research matter if people just make stuff up like "the accounting records were in the part of the Pentagon that was destroyed" or even "the records were in the basement of WTC7"! Or "the accountants who were killed in the Pentagon were investigating the missing 2.3 trillion dollars." Not true, but that one is at least plausible. This is the first time I've heard that the Office of Naval Intelligence was investigating that, which doesn't even make sense. People just repeat these things over and over.

       I'm not really sure if you're aware of this, but the financial accounting office was situated right where the 'thing' hit. The off-site backups for the DoD spending and black budget programs was indeed stored in a secure federal office suite at WTC Building 7, where the CIA had a large NY headquarters as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The office of naval intelligence wasn't investigating that, they were investigating something else. If you want somewhere to start and something new for you to look into, a great place to start is the video '9/11 conspiracy solved'.

      <p>
       You think that the Department of Defense has one financial accounting office that fits in a little corner of the Pentagon? The main accounting group in the Department of Defense is DFAS - the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Finance_and_Accounting_Service">
        Defense Finance and Accounting Service
       </a>
       . It has
       <strong>
        12,000
       </strong>
       employees and locations all over the world. The largest part of the "$2.3 trillion" had to do with transactions between the Kansas City and Cleveland DFAS offices, copying data from the Marine Corps ledger to the Navy ledger. Neither DFAS, nor the two groups that were responsible for investigating these transactions--the Inspector General and the Office of the Comptroller--suffered any losses on 9/11. There were a number of accountants killed, but they worked for a small office called Resource Services Washington, which had nothing to do with investigating DFAS.
      </p>
      <p>
       The story about "off-site backups" at WTC is completely fabricated. DFAS has multiple redundancy in their own systems, plus they have to send records to the National Archives and Records Administration. NARA is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       located in the World Trade Center. It has its own dedicated warehouses and salt mines to store records, not expensive Manhattan real estate.

       You want to go watch that video so you can know what we are actually talking about here? That's what I am referencing, if you want to go and watch it and tell me about how literally every bit of that is make believe and not in any way indicative of a greater conspiracy (whether it was saudis or anyone else - I mean more than some angry religious nuts in a cave), I would welcome all of your knowledge to inform me.

       Now you don't necessarily have to agree with everything, but skepticism is expected, and further, that skepticism and desire for the truth— whatever it may be— should be a joint effort.

       We all want to know the truth. However, you sound like you are opposed to this whole line of reasoning. If that's the case, you should seek out and submit evidence to the contrary.

       A skeptic is also skeptical about things that support their views. You are not a skeptic. You haven't done any investigating on your own. You've read through conspiracy sources that handed you the info and you sucked it in without second guessing it. Probably haven't even done something as simple as wikipeding something you didn't understand . There is so many glaringly obvious holes in this post any actual skeptic would see immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) People look up when they see helicopters, yet a missile loaded helicopter got all the way to the pentagon in the center of a city unseen?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) A pilot trained enough to fly an assault chopper, on probably the most sensitive mission a helicopter pilot has ever flown, wouldn't need a line in dirt to hit a spot on such a well known building.
      </p>
      <p>
       3)Neither would the people on the inside. It's a center office on the ground floor not a maze.
      </p>
      <p>
       4)Apart from bunker busters, missiles explode on impact and don't blow circular holes directly forward. They explode in every direction. Bunker busters which are designed to penetrate concrete before detonation explode after penetration, obviously. Meaning the area after the last hole would be absolutely fucked. Yet it's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       5)It's spelled skeptic for fucks sake.

       That's not the point. This isn't about whether the OP is right with his theory or not. Rockytimber wondered why his theory couldn't possibly be pondered upon. And it's a valid point. This is about not ridiculing people for trying to form their own ideas about something with sceptical or critical thinking.
In my opinion, you have debunked his proposed theory. I am convinced by your arguments. This is what should happen.
If someone proposes a theory which they formed themself, it should be argued with in a civil manner if it's probable or not. But not outright ridiculed.

       I shouldn't have to convince you of anything with something this obvious. You should have the capacity to do that on your own immediately while reading it. You should've had the thought "wow this is absolute bullshit" before you even finished the first paragraph. You and him are followers on the opposite side of the fence not skeptics.

       Yah it is the point. Because what you are describing is not skeptical thought. You're describing an excuse for people to not laugh at you for lacking common sense. You're the same person that would ridicule anyone's opinion supporting legit collapse with "shill" and "sheep" while simultaneously crying about people doing it to you. You're not only a follower but a hypocrite.

Official accounts have claimed that Park Police helicopters only took to the air after the Pentagon was hit.

       It is interesting, a bit.  That's just me.  The problem is more about the plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tie this in because we know Norman Mineta talks and mentions in his 9/11 commission testimony that Dick Cheney had a "young man" come in and inform him that the plane was 50 miles out and every 10 miles as it came in.  With him asking if an order still stood.  That order was obviously NOT to shoot down said plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about a helicopter but the plane issue, along with a damage path that DOES NOT line up with those who witnessed it, is more critical than a mention of a helicopter.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plane was witnessed, the explosion happened and a plane was seen traveling away from the building.  The event seems to be centered around this detail and not a helicopter.  None of these witnesses talk about a helicopter.  They all saw a plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       That and we know if they blew up the building intentionally, a helicopter would not be used for that purpose, nor to distract from it.  Don't you think?
      </p>
      <p>
       What would help this would be if this persons testimony could be attributed to a particular time.  If you can find that out, we will know if it is relevant or not.

       I'm still not sure how you can reconcile a helicopter (I imagine hovering) and a plane in the same spot at the same time.

       What did make it into the 9/11 commission report is about a plane.  Since we're dealing with planes, how about we address that?  Planes were seen and obviously the place was blown up.  There are zero
       <em>
        credible
       </em>
       sources for a helicopter shooting a missile.  Even the control tower operator Sean Boger didn't mention any such thing.  Dick Cheney and what he says can't be taken seriously at all, so I have to question where you're going with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you tell me what keeps you going on such a small and likely irrelevant detail like this one, even if it were true?  The damage path could not be caused by a helicopter.  It was supposedly caused by a plane, that detail is impossible given what people saw with the plane and where it was seen.  You yourself said all of those witnesses and their testimony is compelling.  Yet, you're over in left field waving your arms and smoke and conjecture!
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you possible keep on this witch hunt?  That's what this is.  I question your motives when it comes to this, but that's just me.

       The flight path was also reported differently by different observers and the pilots for 9/11 truth studying the black boxes claimed the data showed the  data / plane overshot the Pentagon by 50 ft. in altitude  I could come up with a better answer but it would take time I don't immediately have.

       Two Pentagon police officers and 12 other witnesses, as well as the Pentagon police officer inside the Pentagon after the explosion should give you something else to consider in this regard.

       If they were in the Pentagon, I don't know if I would ask anything.  That person would need to be outside for their POV to help show that the plane was not in a position to do the damage it supposedly did that day.

       If the wings hit at 3 feet or less, where did the 9 foot tall engines under the wings hit? answer they were small wings without 9 ft. tall engines under them.

       This is the exact plane we're talking about.

       There are other indications. The wings hit some  3 ft. above ground and yet the 9 ft. tall engines under the wings made no marks on the lawn.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask you this. Which one can disappear instantly, an airliner, or a missile?

       A photographer was in place in  the no mans land between the Pentagon and the expressway and took this picture before the flames could even become flame shaped.

       My other question is how was this person in position and ready to take a professional photo at an instants notice?

       Just for the record. The first predator drone to fire a missile had it rigged up by the cia. Neither the missile nor the first type of predator type drones were designed to work together. In fact the drone was designed to be passive observation  only.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isnt that hard to rig a missile to fire from anything
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying it DID happen. Just that rigging such a thing isnt that hard for special ops.

       An AIM-54 is air-to-air. There is no helicopter capable of firing it. Furthermore, there is no perpetrator variant that would be necessary to pierce the reinforced concrete of the Pentagon, little less to cause a "cosmetic breach hole". Beyond that, it is an active radar seeking weapon, which would not create an effective lock on the structure of the building.

       What makes you think that the helicopter or the missile couldn't have been modified?  If it cost hundreds of millions/billions to carry out 9/11, what would be the R&amp;D cost to reconfigure the missile and helicopter?

       That's... really not much damage. It's just a collapsed wall and a few fires. Hellfires or TOWs could easily do that kind of damage, maybe with 2. I don't know what makes you so qualified, all you do is yell HELICOPTER MISSILES CAN'T DO THAT NOPE without providing any argument or evidence. There's absolutely no reason a hellfire couldn't do that kind of damage, it can probably level a weaker but bigger building easily. You haven't provided one iota of proof that a plane is needed to knock over a wall and catch a building on fire. Furthermore, the plane did alledgedly did this damage whilst not leaving any debris or damage in the lawn despite every single report saying the plane hit the lawn first. Without any part breaking off, huh. Seems logical.

       Those missiles are each over 2-3000 pounds. EASILY able to do that kind of structural damage. You really have no idea what you're talking about.

       i agree.  the pentagon didn't collapse until long after the missile hit.  there could have been additional explosives inside the pentagon.

       None of those weapons are over 3000lbs (you need to be looking at their explosive payload, not the armament weight), and none of them would do the multi-ring structural damage seen at the Pentagon. Sorry bud.

       Again you don't think an 800 pound explosive can do that kind of damage? You are either an idiot, or a troll. Telling by the childish way you debate, I'm assuming a troll at this point. The few missiles I listed were examples of weapons used to destroy enormous ships and aircraft carriers. I didn't even look through the 50+ different helicopter based payloads.

       <p>
        Around the Pentagon there were reports of high radiation levels after 9-11. American Free Press has documentation that radiation levels in Alexandria and Leesburg, Va., were much higher than usual on 9-11 and persisted for at least one week afterward.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Alexandria, seven miles south of the burning Pentagon, a doctor with years of experience working with radiation issues found elevated radiation levels on 9-11 of 35 to 52 counts per minute (cpm) using a “Radalert 50” Geiger counter.
       </p>
       <p>
        One week after 9-11, in Leesburg, 33 miles northwest of the Pentagon, soil readings taken in a residential neighborhood showed even higher readings of 75 to 83 cpm.

       Good observation. Can it be confirmed that the area of the pentagon that was struck was the area that they were using to conduct an investigation into the lost trillions?Also i noticed from the photo that this side of the building had the least amount of public access. However, can i suggest that there may have been a reason a woman had seen a helicopter in the vicinity and that was it had something to do with the helipad directly adjacent the strike zone. Do you think the mark on the ground could be seen by a drone? Someone here provided an interesting link not to long ago where they also did an analysis of the strike footage and suggested that it was a type of drone that has been unaccounted for. I think your argument and the drone argument are both very plausible.

       Out of all the theories, why a helicopter? Why not a cruise missile? Why not an AGM-86 dropped from a B-52 or B-2?

       Honestly a tomahawk or an AGM-86 could be mistaken for a plane. In addition, there could have just been a remote controlled 737 or some other plane.

       Close range firing from below the road level above it prevented witnesses. It was done within a couple hundred feet of a helicopter pad and no one would notice a helicopter  there as being unusual at all.

       Possibly because it was right by the helipad where the people there are used to that type of traffic and would think nothing of a helicopter coming that close to the building there.  It would also be able to avoid the pentagon's missiles that no one ever talks about.

       I know that people will say "but there could be some super secret explosive that we don't know about", but no weapons carried by a helicopter will do that type of damage. I could have just been an old Air Force jet that was remotely controlled or a cruise missile like a tomahawk. I could see how you could mix up a jet and a tomahawk missile.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other tower had already been hit by that point, so it would make sense that an extra helicopter might have been deployed around the pentagon due to fears of another attack at the pentagon.

       So you saw a mark on the lawn and then formed all this back from that on the basis that somehow a scuffed lawn is the marker that would be necessary to correctly place employees and equipment in harms way? Even though that mark was likely only visible from close to the external wall and the Pentagon's interior is well mapped (like most large buildings)?
      </p>
      <p>
       The people killed in the Pentagon had nothing to do with the "missing trillions" - the accountants and budget analysts worked for the Army's Resource Services. They were responsible for some small amount of Army spending. They did not work for the wider DoD and certainly not for Defense Finance and Accounting Services who were most likely responsible for that.

       I've answered this in a previous thread, but what I believe why he announced this the day before he shredded the evidence, is either is A. Extremely bad at cover-ups, evident by his piss poor cover-up of the WTC 7 building, mentioning he didn't even know what it was even though the company that took up 37 of the 47 floors of the tower took a massive beat down from the collapse, including chairman of the International Advisory Board of the company, Donald Rumsfeld himself, B. He didn't know the attack would be on that day, evident by the fact that he was present in the Pentagon when it struck, and also his lack of the deployment of the air force on that day, or C., the most likely, $2.3 trillion is a fuckton of money. After at least a week, people would figure out that $2.3 trillion was mysteriously lost
       <em>
        the day before
       </em>
       9/11, and that Donald Rumsfeld knew about the money but decided not to speak. That would give him a higher chance of putting him in legal trouble, and once people see that a federal agent is being put on trial for negligence, all the conspirators are in deep shit.

       Do you actually think it's believable that someone could be so bad at coverups that they would destroy the evidence 24 hours after announcing the existence of the problem in the first place? That's cartoonish.

       If Rumsfeld did not order the coverup than who did? Because even if he didn't know the exact date and time of the attack he still made a decision to go public with the accounting issue with the knowledge that the evidence would be destroyed. Which brings us back to issue A - which requires inconceivable levels of stupidity.

       This is a fundamental misunderstanding of what was announced on 9/10. Rumsfeld did not announce that 2.3 Trillion dollars went missing on a specific day. He announced that the Pentagon was not able to adequately track 2.3 Trillion in spending - spending that occurred over a period of years. So it didn't just up an vanish. More specifically it didn't even necessarily go missing. It's more like the Pentagon could not find all the receipts (but that's actually neither here nor there when thinking about why someone would announce a "scandal" hours before blowing up the evidence).

      <p>
       If we consider the announcement Rumsfeld made to be admission of a crime and that 9/11 was an attempt to destroy the evidence then we once again get to issue A. If destroying the evidence is sufficient to get Rumsfeld off the hook then why admit to the crime before destroying the evidence?

       No. It's not that it's suspicious. It's that it's objectively pointless. If the attacks really were staged to destroy the evidence then there is literally no reason to announce the scandal for which the evidence will be destroyed. In the absence of Rumsfelds announcement it is unlikely we would even be discussing this which would have made the coverup that much more successful.

       Yes. The poster above me suggested that the reason the attacks occurred when they did (post announcement) was that Rumsfeld was not aware of when the attack would happen. The rest of his posts suggests that the attacks were done at Rumsfeld's behest. I was simply inquiring as to who would be coordinating the attack if not Rumsfeld. Obviously you could pick any number of people. I'm just curious who he thinks did it.

       Except that's actually moronic and does nothing to justify announcing it. This isn't the "big lie" or "hiding in plain sight", they aren't pretending that something is different than what we all know it to be (like Russia claiming troops are volunteers or the United States insisting Iraq had WMD) its revealing something no one knew about only to allegedly try and cover it up the next day. The circular logic of "it's so crazy on one would think it was true so we'll say it" is irrelevant because if they never said it we'd never have heard about it (because they blew everyone up).

       You're just wrong to assume that. It could have been perfectly logical to announce it. The investigation was already well underway. Even if most of the people performing the investigation are killed... you're just going to assume that nobody would ever know there even was an investigation? Perhaps we'd be talking about this even
       <em>
        more

       if the "previously secret" investigation was destroyed.

      <p>
       You're making an ignorant assumption that nobody would ever know about it at all if it weren't announced at that time. Destroying the paper-trail doesn't remove the investigation from history.

      <p>
       For all you know it didn't make any difference to announce it before or after, or any other number of possible situations that result in an announcement seeming ideal. Your assumption is flawed.

       Some guys ambush interviewed Rumsfeld about it, and Rumsfeld said it was 2.3 Billion, not Trillion and that it was just a tracking issue, none of the money was missing nothing to see here, it's all cool don't worry about it.

        he would be in the building during a missile attack he helped set up

       it's not just that, he already responded to you about the trillions missing that the financial accounting office would have had the records on - which is another office right in front of what got hit that morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       there was also a case of $243 billion or so in securities that were cleared immediately after sept. 11 (without thee normal legal process of ownership checks and authenticity checks because the fed and SEC declared an emergency and eased the restrictions normally governing the maturation of securities) that were part of an ongoing money laundering investigation that the El Dorado Task Force and the Office of Naval Intelligence was part of - can you guess which command in the pentagon had the most casualties? The Office of Naval Intelligence lost something like 90% of their people in the office that morning. Can you guess where the entirety of the offices for the El Dorado Task Force (an interagency money laundering investigations unit for the US) was located? In the world trade center.
      </p>
      <p>
       can you guess where the ONLY off-site backups storing the financial records of the Pentagon were kept? In a secure federal office suite in Building 7 at the WTC complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's recap, 2.3 trillion, 240 billion, all the records vanishing into puffs of smoke in a period of 5 hours or less and all the people investigating having their commands cut off - and a perfect scapegoat.

       2.3 trillion was the estimated sum which the Pentagon could not account for due to issues with it's multitude of accounting systems and frankly lax standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the actual speech given by Rumsfeld on 9/10/01:
       <a href="http://library.rumsfeld.com/doclib/sp/1478/2001-09-10%20to%20George%20W%20Bush%20re%20Waste%20to%20Warfighting-%20Memo%20Attachment.pdf#search=%22pentagon">

       </a>
       bureaucracy"
      </p>
      <p>
       "The technology revolution has transformed organizations across the private sector, but not ours, not
fully, not yet. We are, as they say, tangled in our anchor chain. Our financial systems are decades old.
According to some estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions. We canuot share
information from floor to floor in this building because it’s stored on dozens of technological systems
that are inaccessible or incompatible.
We maintain 20 to 25 percent more base infrastructure than we need to support our forces, at an annual
waste to taxpayers of some $3 billion to $4 billion. Fully half of our resources go to infrastructure and
overhead, and in addition to draining resources from warfighting, these costly and outdated systems,
procedures and programs stifle innovation as well. A new idea must often survive the gauntlet of some
17 levels of bureaucracy to make it from a line officer’s to my desk. I have too much respect for a line
officer to believe that we need 17 layers between us."
      </p>
      <p>
       "We have committed $100 million for financial modernization, and we’re establishing a Defense
Business Board to tap outside expertise as we move to improve the department’s business practices."
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, the Pentagon is godawful about keeping track of what it spends its money on, in part because it wastes that money with reckless abandon:

       At the very least, an inbound "airplane" wouldn't leave a trail marking like that, would it?

       Also the immediate lawn coverup by that construction equipment is very strange. Wouldn't they want to do some testing of the impact area or at least collect some debris from the lawn? Just a few hours and the heavy construction equipment comes in?

       They had been doing construction on that section of the building prior to 9/11, it is entirely possible that this "marker" could be the tracks left by construction vehicles entering the work zone while construction was happening.

       With these things, I try to eliminate mundane explanations before moving to the next level.  It's a good catch, and an interesting addition to the whole picture, but personally I'm still more interested in the engine they found and whether it fits the plane that hit the building.

       There were pictures doing a comparison of the engine (one) found at the site, and of the engine type from the model that hit the building, and they were clearly not the same engine, as well, the one found seemed to match that of a cruise missile...possibly that has been debunked?  I'm not up on all of this.

       What confuses me about the whole Pentagon thing is the lack of witnesses either way.  At that time in that area there are an assload of people.  395, the GW parkway, and route 1 go right by it.  It was late rush hour.

       The jet was traveling at 530mph at the time of impact. It flew perpendicular to the road, and would have been visible for only a few seconds. Tracking it would have required that witnesses find the source and turn their heads fast enough to keep it in sight as it whipped by. Even then it would have been difficult to positively identify what they just saw.

       I think you are onto something with this.  Nice work.  To me it's always been obvious that the missing trillions were the real story at the Pentagon and that a plane never hit it
       <strong>
        but
       </strong>
       a missile fired from miles and miles away leaves all sorts of risks like: will it get seen on the way there?  Will it have an error or accident before it reaches its destination?  Will it get spotted on satellite or radar from some other entity?  Will it strike in exactly the correct spot?  Will the people "in the know" know where it's going to hit?  All of these scenarios are totally unacceptable here because there were
       <strong>
        trillions
       </strong>
       of dollars missing.  This was no time for fucking around, those offices needed to be destroyed and those people investigating needed to be killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these issues are solved instantly by having the missile fired from a helicopter right outside the building with a clear marker on the ground for all in the know.  There might've been some room for chance with the other planes/buildings, but not with the missing trillions at the Pentagon (the same can be said for WTC7 which was brought down even without being hit by a plane - obviously it was very important that
       <em>
        it
       </em>
       was destroyed too).

       The missing trillions, which they mentioned the day before in Rumsfeld's speech, which they had also mentioned several times before in reports to Congress, which were not missing in the sense that the money had been misplaced or stolen. The missing trillions which they supposedly attacked a section of the Pentagon which included some accountants for, while mentioning the sum in a speech the day before instead of just saying nothing...
      </p>
      <p>
       The money had been spent, but information regarding the expenditures was spread across multiple incompatible accounting systems and could not be properly itemized for audits and accountability. The 2.3 trillion sum was the accumulated sum that they couldn't properly track. It didn't go missing like it was stolen. Undoubtedly much of it was wasted with the flagrant lack of fiscal responsibility the Pentagon and its private contractors routinely display, but that is a known issue which was hardly threatened by the investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The investigation into the Pentagon's accounting continued after 9/11.

       How can something be "missing" without being "misplaced or stolen"?  Explain that to me.  Where did the money go if it wasn't "misplaced" or "stolen"?  Just vanished into thin air in your opinion?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not realize that "We have absolutely no idea what happened to this 2.3 trillion dollars or how it was spent or even
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       it was spent" and "We lost 2.3 trillion dollars" are really two ways of saying the same thing?  In both cases, 2.3 trillion dollars did exist, and now it's gone, and no one knows where any of it went.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you possibly say that it wasn't lost or stolen?  Literally the least you can say is that it was lost.  Or wait, let's call it "misplaced" since newspeak sounds better...

       The Pentagon is, much like large corporations and other long standing bureaucracies, replete with waste and redundancies. It is the headquarters for 4 branches of the military, each of which have their own equipment, personnel, logistics, and special projects. Try to imagine how difficult it would be to audit the Pentagon if each project had its own bookkeeping formats and standards, if there are dozens of separate accounting software systems, some a decade or more old, none of which are able to communicate with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you wanted to investigate one project, you could do so, and the information would be available, if inconveniently arranged. If you wanted to investigate the entirety, the tangled mass would require more time and effort than each of the parts taken individually.

       So your argument here is that it's totally normal for 2.3 trillion dollars to be missing without a trace?  And not only is it normal but it's acceptable as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you saying that the Pentagon never has any idea how it's spending it's money and that there are probably trillions more in their budgets that are also unaccounted for?
      </p>
      <p>
       You also avoided my simple question of how "missing" is different from "misplaced or stolen".  Unless the money vanished into the ether, there are only so many ways it could've gone missing.

       Normal? Not amongst most corporations or government agencies, no. For the Pentagon, yes. It's an incredibly wasteful organization with a corrupt relationship with its suppliers. Acceptable? Certainly not.
      </p>
      <p>
       However there is a difference between arguing that the Pentagon is incompetent at tracking their expenditures and engages in an incestuous relationship with the manufacturing branch of the MIC, and suggesting that a lump sum of 2.3 trillion was missing &amp; they hijacked a plane/used a drone/fired a missile from a helicopter in order to assassinate the accountants investigating the loss.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Missing", "misplaced", or "stolen" all refer to the money itself, and are spins put on the situation by the media and conspiracists with an agenda. The money was spent, it wasn't missing. The issue was that they couldn't tell how all of it was spent without an intense investigation, which is what they were doing, and continued to do after the attacks
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine trying to get someone's finances in order. They have receipts everywhere, some in folders, some in boxes, some stuffed inside of books. At times they tried different accounting systems, even digitizing some of the invoices, but some of the computers are ancient and no longer used. They spent the money, you just can't figure out what they spent all of it on.

       I 100% believe it was not a plane, but I do not believe it was a helicopter either. If it WAS a missile, why couldn't they just shoot it in the sky/from a long distance away?

       Could have been,   but if you didn't want US radar techs or the pentagon missile defense to pick it up,   you might have thought about an alternative.   How many strings do you think Cheney wanted to have to be pulling?    He already had that one errand boy checking in every few minutes.

       If the pentagon or some other federal as opposed to commercially owned building had not been hit,   that would have changed the terms upon which the US could have entered into war.

       There would have probably been a murder trial if not for the pentagon.    Instead,   there was no murder trial/investigation,   and the 9/11 commission was much later and a cover up.

       It seems that there would have been witnesses and reports of such an event but you have to realize there was unprecedented commotion going on and that helicopters near the helipad would not be that unusual.

       Having contacted the infamous investigator about the image she said she didn't recall posting it. She has been put through hell and has lost faith in us all, mostly because she was loudly and publicly wrong about some now infamous theories.  She didn't interpret the images she just posted them and let others decide what they saw.

       If you watch Barbara Honegger's video on the Pentagon,  she talks about a helicopter that was dispatched from the White House that landed at the Pentagon right before the impact and then immediately took off again. There is radar data to back this up as well as witnesses who saw the helicopter. Except in her video,  she says that a small business class jet flew across the Pentagon lawn and exploded over the helipad without hitting the building.

       Works in corridor 5 E Ring ("1/4 down from impact") and is used to hearing helicopters flying. She remembers thinking it was unusual to hear one so close to the building. She goes on to say a helicopter was "very close" to the Pentagon BEFORE the Pentagon was struck. Official accounts have claimed that Park Police helicopters only took to the air after the Pentagon was hit.

       Her presentation stated that the helicopter was landing but then immediately took off again right as the jet flew across the lawn. The jet exploded over the helipad nearly killing two fire fighters that had just pulled the truck seen burned up in all of the pictures out of the garage.  You can see alot of very small debris all over the helipad which is quite a distance from the impact point. She believes the helicopter had something to do with it exploding and it may have been blown up because it was off target for where the Pre planted explosives are. The majority of the damage to the Pentagon was done with explosives.

       the U.S like every other country on the planet is made up of gangs , just because they don't wear a red handkerchief in their back pocket does not mean they aren't there in plain sight ..
      </p>
      <p>
       for years people have been giving information on who they are , what they own , what they control , their agenda ..
      </p>
      <p>
       freemasons , Illuminati, Rosicrucians, Jesuits, mafia , you name it , they are real and they all have power , the "united" states are not as united as one might think , they are after all individual states with self governing bodies , the government of the united states over sees all those smaller governments ..
      </p>
      <p>
       the biggest land owners are all connected to organisations like freemasons , Illuminati, Rosicrucians, Jesuits, mafia.. and even the church of Rome , Morons 9yes every church) can be seen as a gang  (please do not ignore what i am going to say next) it only takes one man who has had a family member fall ill and an organisation to come to their rescue when the "government" fails them .. this man may have a grudge against the government or business .. business man or men ... there is people like this all over the world , in gangs or not part of any thing at all ..
      </p>
      <p>
       there are powerful people in the world , some victims of wars in other countries , some with a grudge , they go to the u.s in search of a better life , they fall in with the wrong people , they learn the truth .
       <br/>
       the truth - within the government of the united states are gangs ..
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 was not an inside job , it was a job ..carried out by a gang who holds more power than the government of the united states . if they cant bring the people who did it to justice .. it is because their gang is not as big or powerful then the gang who did it ..
      </p>
      <p>
       remember that..

       You didn't mention the actual center of the plot., the Council on Foreign Relations, Bilderburg and the Bank for International Settlements,  all of whom had a lot to gain once they put their heads togethe over the plight of the trade center owners who were at the early stages, Henry Kissinger  Teachers Annuity,  The Blackstone Group The New York Port Authority and Peter G.

       my point was a gang is bigger than every one of those groups . the Council on Foreign Relations couldnt not have dont it by them selves and kept it hush hush , same for Bilderburgs or Bank for International Settlements , but one man from each of them in one big gang could pull it off , only takes one or 2 people within a group like those to be able to do it.

       Ah but you were right, they're all gangs. And they're gangs who found a central purpose that got all of their toughest problems solved and all of their greediest dreams fulfilled.

      <p>
       The agencies used such an approach. The head of each lettered government agency knew what was going on but the  plot was compartmentalized and the need to know list was as small as would be practicable.

       See this is where you fall down, it's the little things, It wasn't Cheney with that quote is was Bush 1 to a female reporter years before and it was uncorroborated and thus piffle. I'm obviously older than you and I was with you til this just out of respect for work done. But you've advanced hearsay by a decade and attributed it to entirely different people so I'm here to say that while you are good. You're also bullshit and get carried away.

       The people inside would need it more so they could preposition computers and personnel before the arrival of any helicopter. It wouldn't hurt that the heli. would have hard copy confirmation that he was absolutely in the right place and pointing in the right direction. Can't fuck this up just because of incorrect data.

"We have the resources to get the blueprints of any government building down to a single nail, track 50 different people at once and get them in the right spot, move thousand lb servers into one spot but where gunna need a line in the grass to spot a center office on the ground floor of a five sided building".

       And nothing is solid enough to leave a round circular hole  in a wall and  then instantly disappear, except a missile.

       Edit for  the promised stalkers.  It's actually good that you are here. Thanks. This is the inside of the Pentagon on 9/11

      <p>
       Something made an approximately 6 ft. circular hole as it came through the left was and  it didn't leave any mark to indicate it ever hit the right wall at all. so it was massive as it entered this alleyway and  apparently did not have the mass to mark the right wall by the time it got there.The commenter I'm replying to demanded a time stamp to prove when the photo was taken. The time stamp is the smoke in the air and that indication is  bolstered by the fire hoses.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question for this skeptical commenter   was 'which one is capable of disappearing instantly, an airliner or a missile?'.  see the full post here.

       Big, heavy (or explosive) things made round holes and yet did not hit the next ring. That's the point. You can see that by the lack of damage to the right wall in the picture I provided.

       The question I have honestly is has anyone questioned or have evidence/links as to why a plane that can seat 250+ people had only 60 something people onboard? I ask this only because I have flown on over 500 flights in the last 5 years alone and I have had maybe 3 flights, literally, that have not been close to capacity and my flights were to the midwest of all places, not very high demand. I am not a big conspiracy theorist other than its fun to question and a lot of the evidence and reasoning is somewhat plausible, but this to me is a very strange thing. Now maybe this was more common before 9/11 and the tight margins airlines are experiencing currently, so I do consider that because airlines really have changed the way they book flight capacity and available flights but, all things the same this is something that would raise a flag to me before a military style designated target scenario as is proposed here. Given the flight destination (LA) this to me would be a very unprofitable flight, something airlines do not do, again this is pre 9/11 so it's plausible that this was more the norm before, but this, financially and logistically speaking, is not something airlines do, nor would I think a flight from DC to LA have that low of demand in the first place that it would not fill up that flight.

       I can't answer for those particular flights or the state of airlines pre-911, but Airlines routinely fly partially or empty planes from one location to another. Even if that particular flight is unprofitable, they still need the aircraft at the new location for the next flight.

       It is my understanding that most of the flights that were involved had not been scheduled the previous day. 
One fact  you may not have been exposed to is the passenger lists which contained no Arabic names.

       That is fairly far-fetched. There isn't to my knowledge any conventional explosives that could be fired from a helicopter that would have that effect. If there were additional explosives inside, then why risk having a helicopter at all for more people to see?

       The spookiest aspect of this theory, if it is correct, is what happened to the flight that was supposed to have hit the Pentagon and the people on board?  The plane and the manifest existed so where did it/they go?  That's the part of the scenario that keeps me up at night.

       180+ witnesses describe a large jetliner crashing into the Pentagon. There is a massive amount of plane debris at the Pentagon which BS movies like Loose Change and In Plane Sight don't show you. The fact that so many people within the truth movement still don't know these basic facts is incredibly depressing. There is plenty of REAL evidence for government involvement in the attacks in the war games, financing and protection of the terrorists, suppressed warnings like Able Danger, etc. But no, let's just keep rehashing the same old debunked crap over and over again while acting smug and superior about it.

       My own opinion is that the parts (which were never verified as  coming from the correct plane) were simply hand carried out of the hole in the wall. Carrying them out by hand would look completely normal and appear to be making space for rescues. That's why every piece of  engine or landing gear or the wheel rim that they produced pictures of to bolster their story, you know, the heavier pieces, were barely transported out of the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was one piece of reasonably large aluminum on the lawn, easily hand carried and placed there.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will note that the lawn was covered three feet deep immediately after the event baring the accidental uncovering of forensic evidence.

       You guys voted this shit up?  Reread carefully, many simple fuck ups.  You don't use a camera to make a screen grab for one.  A chopper firing a missile at the Pentagon would be seen from the road way, no clue how he thinks it could fire from cover.

       You have to use a camera to make a screen grab of a blue screen because that means your computer isn't functioning. I was lucky in that  my computer was able to recover contrary to past experiences. Look at the satellite picture and you'll see that there is a ~20 / 30 ft bridge abutment for it to hide below which I clearly explained if you had read carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a circle at the outer end of the lawn marking. If it hovered there near ground level  or slightly farther towards the expressway it would have been completely out of sight from the roadway.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know from years and years of this kind of encounter to not waste too much time on these rebuttals and just present what I have. I think it's sufficient for anyone with eyes that can see.

       You apparently have never talked to anyone who has any flight experience and have just made this all up in your head.

       The lawn marking you are citing wasn't there as a trajectory... it' a path that people take to go to the site.... after 9/11. Do a google search of your own photo and check your date, dear.

       Nothing is going to hover near ground level OR be able to deliver that kind of firepower from a helicopter. Do you have a basic understanding of physics?

       Actually... do you have an understanding of what the Sailors in that wing did? Do you actually think they were looking into a missing 2.3 Trillion? Dude. This isn't NCIS... that's not their job. A missing 2.3 Trillion  was above their paygrade.

       US aircraft especially helicopters ha e had the abikity to do visual camoflauge since at least the 90's  .

       yahootie, a form of visual camoflauge using lights to match the sky color for ships on the horizon, was invented in world war 2.

      <p>
       They have had live background color matching  aircraft covers for decades. Point a camera from the other side. Electronically paint that image on the front of the aircraft. Simple.

       You couldnt have even  seen a regjalr painted military helicopter that wanted to hide 40 yards away in the tree line... Especially going 50 mph in traffic on a hwy.  That is an extremely busy and narrow funneling roadway.

       Using that logic, why not say the missile was fired from an invisible drone. Or maybe the missile was covered in a hologram to make it look like a plane. Who knows, you don't know what kind of technology the military has, so I don't think you can conclusively say that's not what happened.

       It's not a discussion when a person is blatantly and verifiably wrong, and clearly speaking far, far outside their area of knowledge. His articulation of his point made him look like a fool. That post is me correcting him and excusing him from continuing a conversation that he has no place being in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply put, I went into the conversation knowing that no one would be able to state a missile system capable of the type of damage seen at the Pentagon that could be fired from a helicopter. Anyone answering was bound to be wrong for one reason or another. This guy claiming that an air-to-air missile with only ~130lbs of explosives was going to create the gaping hole in a concrete reinforced structure was just the cherry on top.

       Well they got explosives into building 1, 2 and 7. Obviously the pentagon would be harder, but not necessarily impossible depending on who was actually involved in the plot.

       I'm actually trying to bring rational thought into this instead of some kind of "maybe it was a helicopter with a missile" nonsense to this discussion.

       Do this
       <em>
        bro

       figure out what kind of payload that helicopter would have to be carrying and how low it would have to be for only one old lady to see it... then test that theory with basic math. See what happens to the chopper. Then you may return to the discussion

       Ok I'm not sure about the helicopter part either. It could have been a helicopter flying away from the helipad situated right there before the attack. And something you said about the navy version of the FBI office seems accurate also - the pentagon is pretty damned secure by any standard. When people say why is there no footage of the attack on the pentagon? Its common knowledge that no one in Washington would want that footage out there. Here is the control center of the biggest military in the world and a passenger jet just flies into it. That's like mike Tyson getting knocked out by an old lady. It's an embarrassment. The problem I have is that I just don't see a hollow passenger jet punching the hole shown. The wings would shear off at the initial impact and be left outside. My question to you is, in your opinion sir, what would punch a hole like that in the pentagon?

       An airplane. It's not a hollow tube hitting a rock wall.... It's a hollow pressurized tube with a structure. Get off the conspiracy sites and look at actual photos from that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that a lot of people on this sub don't remember that day but there were real people who died FOR REAL on that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop trying to rethink what happened. Some nut jobs (who may or may not be planted for another reason) crashed some planes into some buildings. REAL PEOPLE DIED. THIS WAS NOT A VIDEO GAME. THESE PEOPLE DID NOT RESPAWN ELSEWHERE to live happy lives. The people in that office in the pentagon are DEAD.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a plane. The plane came in and no one could stop it. There are patriot missle launchers all around DC as a result. NO ONE thought it could happen but it DID.
      </p>
      <p>
       STOP turning this into a "maybe it was a helicopter" bullshit. It wasn't. It was a plane... of screaming horrified people. DEAL WITH IT
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you can look at why it happened and then look at the motives of who and why. Stop this BS about "maybe it was time travel" shit.

       It's a hollow pressurized tube of aluminum sir. I never said it was a time traveling, helicopter, video game. Airplanes are built to be strong enough to resist tearing themselves apart while being light enough to fly - NOT to punch through six walls of fucking concrete. There were missile launchers on top of the pentagon before 911 and Air Force bases minutes from the site that have any number of aircraft with the ability to be in the air in seconds that SHOULD have stopped whatever hit the pentagon. Whatever hit the building was allowed to hit the building, I thought from your replies you were in the position to realize this. Either you choose to be ignorant of what happened or you can't bring yourself to admit that no fucking way a passenger jet does that kind of damage. A missile launched from a helicopter would have a better chance of breaching every layer of concrete. If your answer is that a passenger jet did that much damage and left behind no evidence then I will cease to engage you further.

Have you ever seen the way a plane is constructed?
You have convinced me that you are unable to use your own reasoning and your calculator doesn't show enough force to punch through the pentagon as shown on the pictures. Good day to you sir.

       The video says 50 mph. I guess it doesn't matter because you won't watch it any way. The truck didn't make it through the barrier.  I tried to explain that the plane weighing twice as much going 5 times as fast still doesn't make the hole shown in the pictures of the pentagon.The math is not there. The plane is not designed to penetrate concrete - it's not a bunker buster. I shall leave you to you own devices.

       Not me. Here's a debunked approximation of what they would have seen  just for a hint at how long they would have to figure out what they were seeing, and remember the first of the trajectory would have not been visible.

       So in addition to the explosives in the pentagon that were set off by a helicopter that one crazy lady reported that you can't prove.... there was a path on the ground that was worn by people walking to the site that went back in time that the one of a kind helicopter that was custom built to be able to carry some kind of weaponry powerful enough to set off the explosives that no one knew were there just to hide 2.3 T $ in accounting issues?
      </p>

       In 2015 we are missing 8.5 Trillion from the pentagon budget... what's going to happen next Thursday as a result?

       And now you're a prophet dude wutt!@!! Based on you're theory of the pentagon, I would say that the government is going to send clock-boy and all of the illuminati aliens from area 51 to blow up the flat moon while altering the weather with chemtrails, causing massive floods, killing all of us, only for you to wake up seconds later connected to a machine deep in the matrix looking down at David Cameron sucking your little pink dick.

       I've been a long term subscriber. Just haven't seen something actually stupid enough to get involved in. There is conspiracy and then there is making a mockery of a discussion. OP did that. All I did was take out all the arguments OP said and put them into a statement... that you're defending along the way.

       The 9/11 tale isn't a classic. It is a reality. If it was something larger than an attack and was actually an excuse to go to war is something I will discuss with someone worthy of a debate and a conversation. I'm done playing with trolls.

       This entire thread is about eyewitness testimony. What evidence is there that it wasn't a jet besides the hole being slightly too small? Plane parts were found at the Pentagon (although I'm not asserting they were flight 77). The Plane damaged the generator. Jet fuel was all over the crash site. The only evidence of the light poles being planted is that Lloyd England is kind of a weirdo.

       There are two sets of witnesses. The ones who saw the airliner fly south of the naval annex and fly towards the Pentagon but did not see the impact and that Flight path would not account for the downed light poles and those that say it flew Noth of the Naval Annex and struck the building as the official story states. Guess which group of witnesses are made up primarily of government employees.

       Many different groups made separate billions  and or millions of dollars and the New York Port Authority saved billions they didn't have to spend on demolishing the trade center.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trade center had it's face about to fall off because the aluminum fascia was connected directly to the dis-similar steel frame which caused decades of galvanic corrosion. There was also 40 floors of asbestos in each of the two towers and in building 7.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would have taken years of political wrangling just to get a permit and then you could spend more than the property was worth to do a legal demolition so the building had an accident and then there would be the inevitable mountain of law suits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the asbestos in question.

       Here's a tale of the galvanic corrosion by a long term email acquaintance who was so afraid of the consequences he eventually fled the country.

        WTC already doomed.
       </p>
       <p>
        That grandiose Titanic called the World Trade Center, which had been planned to last for at least a century, soon revealed itself to be an engineering stupidity and technological embarrassment. The facade, made of cast aluminum, had been directly connected to the steel superstructure. This caused a battery-like electric flow between the two metals resulting in what's known as galvanic corrosion. This problem had been text-book predictable in the marine-air environment of lower Manhattan, hence the embarrassment.

       If you watch Barbara Honegger's video on the Pentagon,  she talks about a helicopter that was dispatched from the White House that landed at the Pentagon right before the impact and then immediately took off again. There is radar data to back this up as well as witnesses who saw the helicopter. Except in her video,  she says that a small business class jet flew across the Pentagon lawn and exploded over the helipad without hitting the building.

       So it's a discussion forum where one side can make unsupported assertions and you have no problem with it but somebody calls him on it and suddenly
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       have to present evidence? What kind of discussion is that?

       It's well documented that the DOD comptroller and the inspector general investigated these accounting transactions (not missing money).
