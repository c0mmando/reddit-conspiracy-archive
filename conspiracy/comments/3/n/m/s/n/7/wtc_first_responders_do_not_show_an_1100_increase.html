       The claim: First responders to 9/11 have had an 1100% increase in incidences of thyroid cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N7AgArSl-s">
        Here's the YouTube video.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       source for the claim that 9/11 first responders have an 1100% increased rate of thyroid cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is wrong. (Not only about this, but let's just focus on this one bit for now.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/jMJspGJ.png">
        Here is his math.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're not looking at that math and asking yourself "what the fuck is going on here?" then you should strongly consider taking some basic math courses at your local community college. Adding 2 percentages together, as he does at the bottom of his math there, should raise a big red flag in and of itself. If it does not, then please reread the first sentence of this paragraph and consider enrolling.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a math whiz, but let's try to break this down anyway:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/121/6/ehp.1205894.pdf">
        Here is the study he was talking about.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       First thing we need to look at is
       <strong>
        sample size
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The study from 2008 looked at 20,984 respondents, and only those respondents. This does not account for every single 9/11 first responder. That's important.
      </p>
      <p>
       We see from the study that 39 of these respondents had been diagnosed with thyroid cancer since 9/11. Generally, 16.3 cases in "regular" people would have been expected in a sample size of 20,984 people. But 39 is more than that, hence the 239% increase
       <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/23/911-first-responders-cancer-study_n_3136672.html">
        reported
       </a>
       in the
       <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/04/24/1908761/study-first-responders-cancer/">
        media
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So now we have this new number, from 2013, saying 97. So where did this number come from?
      </p>
      <p>
       I found
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2418385/One-thousand-9-11-Ground-Zero-responders-diagnosed-cancer.html">
        the article
       </a>
       that's on-screen during this part but the number isn't sourced. After an exhaustive search, I have not been able to locate the source of this figure; however, I have emailed a couple of places to see if I can find out where these numbers came from.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with this is: we have no idea what the sample size for this figure was. It almost certainly wasn't the exact 20,984 people that participated in the previous study. Since this number is not available,
       <strong>
        it is impossible to come up with an accurate figure based on the new data available.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So there alone, the 1100% figure is already wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's ignore that for a minute and work with the numbers that we do have. Let's assume for a moment that our sample size will remain constant and work the math that way. Maybe that'll give us the 1100% figure.
      </p>
      <p>
       So next, we need to look at
       <strong>
        rate of change over time.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       How did they get the original 239% increase number in the original study?
      </p>
      <p>
       In the YouTube video, the guy claims that we don't have the figures / formulas they used in the paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all right there in
       <a href="http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/121/6/ehp.1205894.pdf">
        the paper
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We also estimated statistically significant increases over expected registry based incidence rates for thyroid cancer (SIR = 2.39; 95% CI: 1.70, 3.27; 39 observed, 16.3 expected)...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's all the numbers and formulas we need. Or formulae if you want to be prissy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the long and short: these numbers mean that, during the course of the study period (about 7 years, 2001 to 2008), they would expect to see 16.3 diagnosed cases of thyroid cancer in the general population, but instead, they see 39 cases, resulting in a SIR of 2.39, or a 239% change. 39 divided by 16.3 = about 2.39. Math checks out.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we can just take our new number, 97, and divide it by 16.3, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        WRONG.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       (And even doing it wrong that way, you still get 595%, not 1100%)
      </p>
      <p>
       We've ignored a variable - time. 16.3 people are expected to get cancer
       <strong>
        over the 7 year period from 2001 to 2008
       </strong>
       .  That's an important distinction.
      </p>
      <p>
       If 16.3 "regular" people, out of 20,984, would have gotten cancer between 2001 and 2008, then the rate per year would be ~2.33 people (16.3 people divided by 7 years). If you cross-reference this figure with the data available
       <a href="http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/thyro.html">
        here
       </a>
       , it comes out about right -- as of 2012, 13.5 people out of every 100,000 people (works out to about 2.84 people out of 21,984) are diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Looking at the chart on that page, the rate between 2001-2008 (our study period) was a bit lower. If we were going to do this for realsies, we'd need to factor in the mean rate for the period 2001 to 2012, but since we don't even have an accurate sample size to begin with, the 2.33 figure should serve well enough for this exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we have 97 cases reported as of 2013. So over the period 2001 to 2013, the rate per year is ~8.08 people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Divide 8.08 (our rate) by 2.33 (expected rate) and we get.... about 3.47. So
       <strong>
        even using a sample size that we know is incorrect, we have an increase of 347%.
       </strong>
       That's much, much less than 1100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       An actual 1100% increase would have resulted in about 308 cases of thyroid cancer with this sample size.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the 1100% number is complete and utter bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        This is why you don't use YouTube, or any other dubious source that just happens to agree with you, as a primary source for information without double checking it for accuracy.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       (And if that same video poster also posts
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erdgVYg-D4I">
        shit like this
       </a>
       to YouTube... they should probably be triple and quadruple checked, at the very least.)

       Two things to say here.  The number still shows quite a significant jump in thyroid cancer.  Also thermite was detected.  Whether there was a nuclear explosion or not, it doesn't matter.  We know something happened beyond the official story.  Thank your gods for you tube people.  You will get more education there than in a lifetime of their standardized schools.  The Internet provides more information to people than has ever been possible in human history.  I am sick of people mocking it when it is to their advantage.

       It's considerably less of a significant jump when you consider the fact that firefighters already have an increased risk for thyroid (among other forms of) cancer just by being firefighters. I couldn't find an exact statistic for the inherent increase, and I was going to try to extrapolate one from some of the other papers I found that predate 9/11 (in order to establish a baseline that isn't biased due to any potential increase over normal that 9/11 may have caused), but I didn't have the time earlier. I might do that in the next day or two if I have time.
      </p>
      <p>
       My issue here isn't specifically with YouTubers, it's with the inherent tendency most people have to knee-jerk agree with any information that conforms to their existing beliefs. Whether that information comes from a YouTube video, a blog, the alternative media, or the mainstream media, there are disinformation agents out there that are willing and able to prey upon those tendencies we all have.
      </p>
      <p>
       The user here who posted the claims from this particular video claims to have an advanced college degree in some form of engineering. Yet he looked at the math used in this video and failed to see the incredibly obvious and egregious errors that were being made. There's really no excuse for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do especially distrust YouTube posts, for a number of reasons. Psychologically, it's far easier to push propaganda I'm video form. Video can be manipulated. Sources often are not properly cited making it difficult to verify information (note how, in the linked video, most of the URLs on the pages being viewed are conveniently off-screen). Many tend to prey on what you think or what you feel rather than presenting falsifiable evidence that can be reviewed and verified.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean that there aren't plenty of exceptions to this, as there are plenty of great videos and documentaries out there. But there's also plenty of bullshit out there as well. I find it easier and less time consuming to discern between the two in written form. Maybe others find it easier the other way.

       We just need to use our heads.  We all have the Internet and have the ability to check up on the issue if we wish.  YouTube is such a phenomenon because people simply cannot read well anymore.  The videos on YouTube have re-opened people's ability to educate themselves.  Look up John Dewey and his Rockefeller funded change in education from phonetic learning to sight based reading.  John d Rockefeller said "I want a nation of workers, not a nation of thinkers".

       That's not a solution to the problem though. If nothing else, it encourages people to continue to be too lazy to read primary sources and check up on stuff. We shouldn't need some dude in a video to read and summarize information for us (and inject their own spin and propaganda and thoughts and half-truths, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe people would be better at reading well if they were encouraged to read more rather than staring at moving pictures on a screen.
      </p>
      <p>
       But again, maybe it's just me. Different people learn better in different manners, I suppose.

       Look in to what I said about Dewey.  You are going to find spin in everything you read.  You have a spin In what you're telling me and I you.  The bottom line is we all believe in something and want to push that belief.

       Fucking stop saying this shit. What was detected was the byproducts of it's combustion, which are really common when you have a gigantic building on fire. It's like saying I found water and carbon dioxide therefore someone was burning a pile of leaves for the purpose of collapsing ghee world trade center.
