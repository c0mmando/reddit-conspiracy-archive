    <div class="md"><p>not sure I understand the question. as the theory goes Obama is on the same team as the zionists - who are still not the real bad guys - all roads lead to world bankers controlled by - rothscholds/rockefeller etc</p>

<p>Obama shifting focus to right wing &quot;extremists&quot; is a cut from the same cloth as the rest of it, so yes - I think that will happen but I don&#39;t think it will stop there - by a long shot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It already happened, remember when he used the IRS to shut down the Tea Party protests?  I was wondering why when Bush deposed a Mideastern dictator, destabilized the region and lost American lives, the media and protesters were in an uproar, but when our current POTUS did the exact same there was barely a whisper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>media is controlled. nothing is published in the news those who controll it don&#39;t want published, it&#39;s no surprise the tea party tax stuff was ignored, </p>

<p>I do remember the tea party stuff. I think the NWO team is coming for all of us eventually. but whoever stands in their way meanwhile is their focus for preliminary attack. I think they are after right wing and christians (neither of which i identify with, but I do believe in their right to freedom to express themselves as much as any other) because those are the strongest voices of opposition. but voices of opposition will permeate a lot more of America as people figure out what &quot;they&quot; are really after - by dumb luck the right wingers just found themselves the first victims of it - but it will spread - we are all in this together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it possible they are here to police the police?</p>

<p>The UN has had a keen eye on US police violence for quite some time.</p>

<p>There really isn&#39;t a lot of concrete proof as to why they are here, other then the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/launch-strong-cities-network-strengthen-community-resilience-against-violent-extremism">Strong Cities Network</a> which seems to be targeted at <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2015/10/obamas-u-n-plan-globalize-cops-against-violent-extremists/">&#39;Violent Extremists&#39;</a>  </p>

<p><strong>-Extremism</strong>  </p>

<p><em>the holding of extreme political or religious views; fanaticism.</em>  </p>

<p>Every article I find on this police force; use of UN Peacekeeping operations in the US, and any mention of the Strong Cities Network is all the same, it&#39;s politicians and government agents referring to &quot;Extremism&quot;.</p>

<p>But the word it&#39;s self is open to interpretation depending on what end of the stick you&#39;re standing on, one would argue that any thing you strongly believe in is a &quot;Extremist Belief&quot; if someone doesn&#39;t agree with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just think that &quot;violent extremists&quot; is double speak - for political adversaries - I mean we could be labeled violent extremists just for having this conversation on the internet  - all they have to start saying is &quot;wrong questions inspire wrong actions&quot; and everybody on here are the bad guys. it&#39;s a slippery slope, the UN are so corrupt, - frankly no - I do not think that it is possible they have a benevolent, non tyrannical intent. </p>
