       not sure I understand the question. as the theory goes Obama is on the same team as the zionists - who are still not the real bad guys - all roads lead to world bankers controlled by - rothscholds/rockefeller etc
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama shifting focus to right wing "extremists" is a cut from the same cloth as the rest of it, so yes - I think that will happen but I don't think it will stop there - by a long shot.

       It already happened, remember when he used the IRS to shut down the Tea Party protests?  I was wondering why when Bush deposed a Mideastern dictator, destabilized the region and lost American lives, the media and protesters were in an uproar, but when our current POTUS did the exact same there was barely a whisper.

       media is controlled. nothing is published in the news those who controll it don't want published, it's no surprise the tea party tax stuff was ignored,
      </p>
      <p>
       I do remember the tea party stuff. I think the NWO team is coming for all of us eventually. but whoever stands in their way meanwhile is their focus for preliminary attack. I think they are after right wing and christians (neither of which i identify with, but I do believe in their right to freedom to express themselves as much as any other) because those are the strongest voices of opposition. but voices of opposition will permeate a lot more of America as people figure out what "they" are really after - by dumb luck the right wingers just found themselves the first victims of it - but it will spread - we are all in this together.

       way to rub it in. btw are you MKultra'ed or are you totes lucid in all of this,  not that you would know if it was the former - but I still wanna know what you have to say about it. esp cause I wonder if your programming was going bad when you did that slow mo debate with Mit back when before your second term. you said you had cold but I never believed it.

       Is it possible they are here to police the police?
      </p>
      <p>
       The UN has had a keen eye on US police violence for quite some time.
      </p>
      <p>
       There really isn't a lot of concrete proof as to why they are here, other then the

       <em>
        the holding of extreme political or religious views; fanaticism.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Every article I find on this police force; use of UN Peacekeeping operations in the US, and any mention of the Strong Cities Network is all the same, it's politicians and government agents referring to "Extremism".
      </p>
      <p>
       But the word it's self is open to interpretation depending on what end of the stick you're standing on, one would argue that any thing you strongly believe in is a "Extremist Belief" if someone doesn't agree with you.

       I just think that "violent extremists" is double speak - for political adversaries - I mean we could be labeled violent extremists just for having this conversation on the internet  - all they have to start saying is "wrong questions inspire wrong actions" and everybody on here are the bad guys. it's a slippery slope, the UN are so corrupt, - frankly no - I do not think that it is possible they have a benevolent, non tyrannical intent.
