        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">52</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-10-06 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/RA2lover.html">RA2lover</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The 2 main news sources to be posted on reddit about the TPP being signed were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/business/trans-pacific-partnership-trade-deal-is-reached.html">The New York Times</a> (on <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> at 12:17:48 UTC) and the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-34444799">BBC</a> on <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> 12 minutes later(at 12:29:45 UTC).</p>

<h1><strong>Both sources link one way or another to october 6th (today) on their pages.</strong></h1>

<p>The New York Times&#39;s page is more obvious, with the URL being located at 2015/10/06 instead of 2015/10/05. 
The BBC page is listing the post date as october 6th currently (<a href="https://archive.is/kYhN0">archive.is proof</a>), although a past crawl of it uses relative timing, WHICH IS STILL WRONG. <a href="https://archive.is/eRnFT">https://archive.is/eRnFT</a> has the page listing as &quot;<strong>1 hour ago</strong>&quot; at 15:59:20 UTC, <strong>despite the page having existed for at least 3 hours and 30 minutes</strong>.</p>

<h4><strong>But <a href="/u/RA2lover">/u/RA2lover</a>, the article could be posted  at a different timezone making it appear as being posted on the next day</strong>!</h4>

<p>Bullshit. </p>

<p>AFAIK we only go to UTC+12h normally, with some islands that a reporter wouldn&#39;t post this kind of news from 14h ahead of UTC. An exception we currently have is New Zealand, at UTC+13 during DST. </p>

<p>The most likely place to post if that was the case would be Japan, 9 hours ahead of UTC and definitely not at october 6th at that time.</p>

<p>Assuming New Zealand, it&#39;d be a close call, but given the time someone takes to type the news, publish it, someone to read it and then post it on reddit, it&#39;s likely this was still made on october 5th.
The <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> post was posted on 12:17:48 UTC and was dated as october 6th. Assuming new zealand daylight time, the news be posted up to 1:15 NZDT at most - which is within october 6th!</p>

<h1><strong>However, both sources mention the deal was signed in Atlanta, which is at UTC-5 and therefore would be 5am into october 5th. It makes no sense to relay the news to some random person typing at new zealand during midnight, yet alone publish from there.</strong></h1>
