       Russia, China, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria's militaries are all amassing in Syria. Russia just took out ISIS' leadership in one fell swoop. I don't know how this will play out but it's big. We can expect one of two things; A) continual proxy maneuvers and cowardice displayed by the West, followed by an EMP attack and ritual sacrifice of the American people in order to bring about global governance, or B) direct military confrontation between the two sides and the eventual World War III. Fuck these people in charge, I mean seriously, what a world? I'm just gonna sit back, have a beer, and laugh at how stupid this whole thing got, and how amazing it could have been (and is, somewhere). Godspeed, and to anyone who survives this shitstorm; please, make a better world..

       Some people feel like WWIII is going to be like WWII x 1000. Bombs being dropped, EMPs going off, etc... I don't think that's the case (personal opinion). I feel like we've been in WWIII for quite some time. We'll see a different kind of war going forward. Economic war is a possibility (probably already in motion). Weather modification (cause draughts or extreme flooding). Technological warfare (this is already going on). And other groups like ISIS will pop up left and right.

       It's absolutely in motion, and has been for some time. The dollar is in a Chinese noose, just waiting for treasury bonds to be sold on the open market (which has already been happening). Markets all over the world are collapsing, and it won't take much to set off a fire in the US. If the dollar dips it runs the risk of losing reserve status, and the Chinese know this. If it loses reserve status, the US basically becomes a 3rd world country in 5 years.

       There'll be regular ground battles too. Though, a lot military strategy involves positioning soldiers not only for warfare, but for intimidation too. Bombs will be dropped, but it will be more localized to a specific region instead of total annihilation of a country like in WWII.

       -just take a look at pretty much any market in recent history, the DJI has dropped 3,000 in a period of 3 months. We are currently experiencing a "dead cat bounce", or rebound after the initial shock of a drop (which occurred a month ago).

       -due to Bretton Woods, oil is traded with $, which has provided tremendous stability for the $ since the 40's. The Fed knows this and has adopted a policy of runaway printing, largely due to this agreement. The US $ is also used for the vast amount of large transactions worldwide. There is a tipping point in which businesses, governments, and banking institutions decide that the $ isn't strong or stable enough to facilitate transactions. When this moment comes, the $ is in deep shit, and it will lose tremendous amounts of value. The primary reason that China has the capacity to break the US's neck with the click of a mouse is because they're the largest holder of treasury bonds, and if they dump all of them on the market at once, the dollar is almost instantly worthless and chaos ensues for Americans. Imagine you're trying to sell your house, and half of the houses on your block are all owned by the same guy who you're at war with. If you're trying to get 100k and he dumps all the houses on the market simultaneously for 75k a piece, what's the likelihood of your house selling? The US is in more debt than any country on earth by a long shot, and the reason we go to war is to maintain the value of the $, plain and simple.

       Except what they are saying is incredibly alarmist. China recently dumped a large amount of treasuries to prop up their currency and it didn't make a dent in the dollar. Now this is not to say that China dumping everything wouldn't hurt the dollar but it would by no means make it worthless.

       China holds 8% of American debt. 8%. Also China's economy would tank if they sold off all their American debt. They need it more than the US needs them too. China's economy would also tank if the US economy did. China relies on exports far far more than the US. If the world economy went to shit the US would be in a much better position to weather the storm. As far as reserve currency status goes, who would the world turn to? Certainly not China. Their economy is not doing so great and, just as important, no one trusts the numbers they publish.

       Anyway, don't believe me or the other poster. Read up on this from a variety of sources. And always remember, economics is a prime field for people to push their narratives. Be it political or trying to sell you something, an economic narrative about imminent destruction or golden times just round the corner should always make you wary.

       China is considered a growth nation (along with Brazil, Russia, India) meaning most portfolios have shares in said countries for high interest value. When China came out and had to do some currency protections by selling off US treasuries to relive market currency stress. countries that were leveraged to far in growth had to take a loss and it triggered a domino effect. (much like US did with bad mortgage bundles in 2008. the slippery slope people will always cry China holds our future and the sky is falling but the reality is that they only own 7% of our debt. Japan is the #2 holder of our treasuries along with a lot of europe rounding out the top 10. The US dollar in global trade is not easily replaced bc of the sheer mass of it and its reliability. if China did flood the market with its treasuries (and it would never do something that economically suicidal) our Allies and the US private side would simply buy them out bc they have always had good return. currencies reflect the nation's GDP not the other way around.

       Exactly.  The dollar is probably the strongest currency in the world at the moment. The Chinese market is in shambles and there is no other currency available besides the dollar that the world could adopt as the reserve currency.  Maybe the world could adopt a basket of currencies but the dollar would absolutely be included in it and would probably still remain the strongest.  The fear mongering in this sub is out of control.  So many here take people peddling gold online at their word when in reality they are just snake oil salesmen.

       “Based on this new information, we now estimate that Treasury is likely to exhaust its extraordinary measures on or about Thursday, November 5,” Lew wrote in a letter to Boehner. “At that point, we could be left to fund the government with only the cash we have on hand, which we currently forecast to be below $30 billion. This amount would be far short of net expenditures on certain days, which can be as high as $60 billion.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Lew said the date could still fluctuate somewhat from Nov. 5, but the letter makes clear that the situation is more urgent than anticipated by lawmakers and staffers who expected to be able to bundle a debt limit increase with an early-December spending package.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Without sufficient cash, it would be impossible for the United States of America to meet all of its obligations for the first time in our history,” Lew wrote.

       I feel like your sense of China's holdings of US debt are a bit off. They have about 8% of all our debt, and that's been trending downward. Japan hold more US debt than China, and they aren't about to do the Chinese any favors.

       I agree with you, however to indicate just how fragile markets are, consider that simply by China altering the value of the Yuan and simultaneously selling off treasury notes, it tremendously affected the US stock market and FX rates. I think the world is a tinder box right now, and many people are holding matches.

       You'd be correct. China owns about 8% of American debt. It also uses that debt to prop up their currency so they would be hitting the self destruct button on their own economy if they dumped that debt. Lastly, other countries would buy up that debt because the dollar is still the safest/most easily used/traded currency bet in the world

       Yes, exactly. We were taught that WWIII was going to be Soviet nukes. So now, with everyone looking for Soviet nukes still, nobody notices that it's on already. They didn't call WWI by that name when it was happening. We'll call this WWIII someday, but it is happening now.

       Okay, sorry. I am not on the right pages I guess. I get depressed easily and only delve into the real news on occasion. Nothing I can really do about any of it besides spreading fear, so I try to avoid it. Ignorance can be blissful. The best to you too.

       This war is being instigated, and funded, by one group... It is the incredibly complex world of Hegelian duality, and Order Out of Chaos. Afaic, Russia and the rest of the East have long been controlled opposition. Russia, China, etc, have long had embedded Rothschild agents, but they've gone to great lengths to hide it, as it is one of the greatest clues of all. You may be asking: if these nations are already controlled, why don't they simply align them all under one banner of global governance?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the people of these nations won't except it. They won't except it until they are brought to their knees. They won't except until all of their rights are stripped from them. Until all of their digital networks, and digital content are wiped out. Until the dissidents are all gone. Until all of our wise old sages are disappeared. If you ask me, they are attempting to hit the reset button because they see that at the rate this world is going, they only have so much time left until the world turns against them.

       Anyway, what is the point of destabilizing the middle east in your scenario? None of the last 20 years makes much sense in that regard if its just the Gnomes of Zurich. Adding the Israel angle would seem to accept Judaism as truth, making things quite a bit more com plicated.

       The point, I think, of destabilizing the Middle East is creating a global conflict that will eventually usher in world governance.

       Putin isn't playing chess. He's playing Othello.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, some background. For Iran to get the bomb doesn't mean Tel Aviv gets nuked. It means Tehran doesn't get nuked. And Tehran stays protected even if Iran launches its long-desired conventional war against Israel. In short, Iran getting the bomb means Israel gets invaded.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why Israel's neighbors had to get fresh puppets (Arab Spring et al). Syria was in the process of getting a fresh puppet (through the ISIS proxy).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that's out the window. Now Israel is cornered. After Putin grabs Syria, Israel just might do the Camp David with Russia. And after Israel, then Egypt. Three countries in a nice Othello row. And after Egypt, then Saudi Arabia. And after Saudi Arabia, then the U.S. economy tanks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia may reestablish its alliances with the countries that haven't joined NATO yet: Ukraine, the -stans, and India. Russia won't take over China, but it might economically ally with China and embargo rare earth metals. It might help China take over Taiwan. Russia won't touch NATO, but it'll take everything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without oil, without rare earth metals, without Foxconn, without U.S.-trained Indian software engineers, what has the U.S. got left? A drastically reduced standard of living, that's what. Which sets up a breakup of the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
       Texas will be the first to secede, as it's in their constitution. Then California, which might take as much as everything west of the Mississippi along with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's the best-case scenario. Worst case is U.S. sends massive troops to the Golan Heights, and the area becomes a nuclear powderkeg. Unlike with Germany and the Iron Curtain, the U.S. does not control Israel's nukes. While cooler heads in Israel wouldn't want to risk a nuclear exchange, elements in Israel are quick (too quick) to rush to Israel's "defense". Russia/Iran retaliate, with massive U.S. "collateral damage", meaning the U.S. has been attacked. Worldwide nuclear exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia has just today conscripted 150,000 soldiers. Putin isn't bluffing.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's that about the 7-year cycle? Maybe it's real, or maybe it's just a self-fulfilling prophecy. Either way, it's happening now.

       Actually these States splitting up and minding their own businesses and establishing little communities who sustain themselves would be the best thing ever, if there are no conflicts within the U.S.A. i think that would be the best solution for citizens. Everyone cares for another and isn't being convinced that they have to fight for freedom somewhere thousands of miles away.

       ) we're not as great of an agricultural force, and have severe water problems due to the fuckery that is LA/that whole fucking region that wouldn't exist without Mulholland et al literally stealing and swindling water from the rest of CA (there's a reason farmers blew up canals at one point. Watch "Mulholland's Dream" for a good history of the beginnings of LA. ) anyways we probably could not survive on our own, and you sure as hell won't be able to convince the bay and so-cal to agree with anything of the sort.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't think even Israel would risk a nuclear exchange, their country is too small to withstand it. Even if it weren't entirely destroyed the radioactive fallout would make the place uninhabitable for decades. If anything I think they would try to bring the US into a war with them and Iran.

       How about CNN? Or any news program... I'm on my phone and really don't give two shits about people's personal beliefs I just had to vent. All I know is as of the last 48 hours Al-Nusrah and ISIS leadership is TOAST courtesy of Russia's good ol' Air Force. You welcome, Assad.

       My take on this... The major News outlets, they all push an agenda of division. They are strategically setup to play news that is contradictory. Although not entirely unreliable. They are not outright making stuff up. They are just spinning and working it. As an example, about a year ago... Isis was in Iraq attacking whatever targets they were actually attacking. One side of the news coin (fox/cnn) painted the picture that Isis was gearing up for an all out assault on American troops. The other side (ABC/msnbc) downplayed it, minimizing what Isis was doing. The reality was, Isis was in Iraq. They were 3 miles outside of an American post. The threat level was upped and troops were put on stand by. The reality was somewhere in the middle. That's why I subscribe to all major news sources and avoid stuff that seems sensationalized. If you look for trigger words and just replace them with common simpleton speak its much closer to the truth. Kind of how we use awesome without actually using it correctly. That's what news stations do now. I'm not quite sure that will make sense to you. Its a little disjointed.

       I think your example makes sense, thanks. But I think their agendas make them inclined to predictably support or oppose certain matters with consistency... CNN &amp; war being one example. It sounds like you're watching with a critical mind but in my honest opinion, not watching CNN/FOX/ABC news at all would be even more beneficial. They are too powerful of propaganda machines for us to completely see through them, no matter how aware.

       I take everything with a grain of salt. Theres two contradictory ideas that I see popping up on reddit. Increasingly commonly, one is the trend to put down major news outlets, then when given an outside news outlet to put it down for not having the same far reaching fingers. Essentially people blatantly unwilling to believe anything from anyone at any given time, except for there own personal one website that perfectly panders to what they wish to hear. The truth often not being what anybody wants to hear. The other trend I see more and more of is the outright cries for violent revolution, immediately followed by an addendum being, I am no leader! Somebody else go first! I want to live to see the other side of the revolution! I'm not suggesting they're correlated. They both just piss me off. It really shows me how much TPTB have won. We will openly contradict ourselves in an effort to seem cutting edge without actually having to step onto that ledge. Anywho were boned all the way around Imo. We've been given the perfect amount of prepackaged choice to keep us simultaneous content but not prosperous. Everything is cookie cutter. Everything is owned by a global elite. The one world order is already a thing. It just wasn't the violent takeover that people were expecting. It was quite literally a war for the mind and we the general populace lost. Sorry 'bout the rambling diatribe. Stress and stuff.

       That was very well put. It annoys me immensely too. I don't post sources in discussions on reddit. Anyone replying to me can find sources that support my point and others that seem to negate it, so what's the point?

       It's not about the source it's about the facts, dumbass. I'm well aware that ALL news outlets are suspect; the fact remains I have seen video footage and have seen verbal confirmation from the Russian president, HIMSELF that Russia is "taking on ISIS". Not to mention it's all over the Internet and the deep web. This shit is real. You guys can keep waving your dicks in the wind all you want I'm jut teying to vent, and keep painting the target on my back so when they ineveibaly SILENCE US my people will know why. Your right, there is no Syrian war, no tension wth Russia and China, and we're all safe. Thank you for showing me the light.

       We're all aware of Russia's actions in Syria. But CNN news is not a valid source for the rest of your claims so it sounds like I get to go "wave my dick in the wind".

       That makes a lot of sense. I agree I get really frustrated too at times. We're all pretty frustrated I think. That's a big part of what brought us here. It sounded to me like OP was having a mild panic attack over world events. I feel like I've been there a time or two.

      <p>
       I feel like this sub has a ton of potential if we stop being so aggressive with each other. Shills and sheep will come and go, but they are pretty easy to identify and disregard. We need to be in the habit of supporting each other. We're all (most of us) after the same thing, the truth. It's in such short supply these days.

       I apologize, I'm upset. However, I didn't even watch it on CNN, I've simply been following this situation for too long and have too much invested in it to be scrutinized for "sources". Here's a fact, everything I learn of value these days comes from the Internet, whereas we used to be able to trust TV, newspaper, books, magazines, etc. I'm assuming the Internet is somewhat free, but really who knows. If your going to criticize one source, one side, one idea; then their all suspect. The point I'm making is, clearly something big is happening and its making me feel energized and alert. I'm not trying to spread fear or anything; I mentioned this in my government class today and the teacher and everyone in the class gave me deer in headlights looks. None of them even knew the air strikes happened! The government doesn't have to hide what's happening because no one even fucking cares! I'm sorry for projecting this onto you, but this is how I feel about the situation.

       Hey, I can really agree with you there. Now I understand why you got defensive and I'm sure I often do the same. Maybe next time I won't just say "source?" because it kind of seems like I'm trying to call out bullshit, when in reality it's meant as more of a "holy shit, I wonder where you read that?". Anyway sorry for being a dick back.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also agree that the situation in Syria could get more fucked up.. Unfortunately I kind of expect the US to make some crazy move, because right now I think they either have to connive some more bullshit or applaud Russia's actions. And I think they'll destroy the world before they praise anything related to Putin. Stay vigilant my friend

       Don't be afraid everyone. It's been bad and this is as bad as it's going to be. They would love us to fear things will become more nightmarish, but everything is going to be fine. It's up to us to take responsibility for our societies and stop fearing what could happen by the whim of these "powers that be". We are far more powerful than we often choose to believe. Just chill the f out everyone.

       Guys do some reading on Albert Pike.

      <p>
       This will be a global civil war between the people native to their countries and islam. No more and no less.
      </p>
      <p>
       This will be all religions against one another in a final showdown that, by Pike's account anyways, should bring about the destruction of all religions including athiesm.

       I personally think this war will thin people out, then the aliens will show themselves.

       That it doesn't matter. Kings rise and fall; legends are born. We all live, eat, shot, sleep and one day don't wake up. Dying is part of living. Living a life worthy of a good feat is all that I ask. I would never hurt anyone else; so much aggression is held within myself. I can't begin to explain how saddened I am for this planet and the BILLIONs of my brothers and sisters who have bled and died for "NOTHING". We had some good times, all the same. Energy is never destroyed, it only changes. I hope to be a tree in the next life :)

       Right?

       It's so sad to think that they were all (according to Pike,  anyways)  used to gain some sort of social control.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first world war was to remove the kings/czars of Russia  instate communism and use it to weaken surrounding empires ( see also Soviet unions emergence,  Japan, China, Korea, etc) as well as religious ideology in the area.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second world war was to make the Jews look like the good guys essentially (paraphrased from Pike's words), to use Zionism to quash Nazism in a triumph. Also to make Israel a state. That was essentially the gist of the war. To give the Jews back their land.
      </p>
      <p>
       The third world war is going to be all the religions against each other, the governments are supposed to come to our rescue once we have experienced a social cataclysm.

       took that info from here. Which took it from a letter that was hung in a UK museum for a while. It has since 'disappeared'.

       I'd be inclined to listen to this guy, as he had a tie to Otto von Bismarck and a direct role in bringing about WWI.

       What kills me, is that Pike divulged these plans in the 1800's. When Nazism and communism weren't words.

       Every time a warship is moved or a training exercise is carried out people declare that 'war is brewing'. It's almost as if they want it to transpire, so they can be proven right. It's macabre.

       I struggle with this every day. I understand where your coming from but understand that just because YOU haven't been drilled, dieted, shot at, pushed around, kicked, uniformed, body-bagged, etc DOESNT MEAN IF DOESNT HAPPEN. It WILL happen here someday, so people like myself, boys who cried wolf I suppose, always remain vigilant; always point out discrepancies. Stay frosty

       It's about your perception of what happens, and that its that the.."same" thing happens to "everyone" is an asuumption all of us make. I understand what your saying; we are on the precipice of a celestial, magnetic reversal where the unseen becomes seen, the unheard, heard. Truth is all that matters , no matter how frighteningly majestic it is.

       Amazing, because I've been meditating (out of curiosity)  with the purpose to understand and get a feel for what's coming through intuitive perception -  and I've also been getting a feeling that something big and positive (as much as that seems contrary to whats happening now)  will soon occur. I was shocked by that insight.

       I would be very curious to know what you and your friends' intuitive insight was if it was anything more specific.

       ISIS is the illegitimate love child of a long passionate affair involving Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Israel and the US. Russia cant kill ISIS in airstrikes because it is the love-child of the infamous four. Russia can fight itself into a Quagmire - a hint Obama offered to his buddy Putin recently. If ISIS leadership is killed, a new one will emerge overnight.

       We're already in a Cyber World War. I don't think there's really much question to that one with the way surveillance, technology, and hacking are in the world right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think we'll ever get into another global conventionally armed world conflict. We'll have brushfire proxy wars but nuclear weapons are too big a threat for any major powers to ever go head to head out in the open.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's really only one flashpoint that could be volatile enough to warrant war instead of diplomacy - two deeply held belief systems exterminating each other. It might be militant Islam vs the world ala ISIS, the liberal vs conservative culture war that Fox keeps trying to stir up, or some economic crap like communism vs liberalism again. It'll only come to blows if there's literally no room for reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make no mistake...this will be another brushfire war and then it'll die down after all the sides figure out the economic benefit of "winning" doesn't justify the cost of fighting and the human suffering Assad is causing as a pricktator is less than what we'd see in a prolonged war. It was the same stakes with the oil and blood in Iraq. And it'll be the same with ISIS. They'll piss the rest of the world off with their zealous beheadings and economic isolationism, and we'll all band together to knock their teeth out before going our separate ways once the loot and oil is flowing again.

       Haha I only ever played the third one, I don't play new games anymore :P I am, however, looking forward to the real thing in a strange way; I mean, I wish we lived in a utopia but we don't. We live in a mundane shithole full of economic espionage and misinformation coupled with "diversity" which is in reality "disunity". A radiated wasteland with pirates and government bunkers fighting each other sounds a lot cooler...

       No one would ever believe that the U.S. would nuke itself. If they wanted to propel us into ww3 that might be one of the simplest ways to do it. I don't think they would go that far thought. Even if it was self inflicted it would be used to fire nukes at the enemy as well. Mutually assured destruction.
