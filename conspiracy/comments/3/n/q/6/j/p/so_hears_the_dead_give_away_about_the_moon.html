       How did they know the conditions on the moon (temperature, atmosphere, gravity etc.) to be able to calculate the propulsion mechanism for the craft that landed there successfully for the first time and subsequently also took off and reattached itself to the lunar orbiter? And also to prepare their spacesuits to withstand the incredible temperature/radiation, long range communications, re-entry into atmosphere with escape velocity and even the propulsion to the moon. Like seriously, how could they have got it right the first time. It is near impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they failed a few times, its understandable as you can use the trial and error method to correct mistakes. But for them to pull off the feat the first time without knowing what conditions they are facing, and that too with 1969 technology is really impossible. Its like believing in coincidences.

       What do you think?

       PS: Apollo's computer was more basic than the electronics in some modern toasters. It had approximately 64Kbyte of memory and operated at 0.043MHz. This is what it looked like:

       .... which is pretty much just a gigantic pocket calculator.

       Some 1969 tech (microprocessors) was significantly more primitive than today's tech, but in other ways, what we have today is only incrementally better than 1969.

       They did a lot of testing.

       The first Saturn V launched with a crew was Apollo 8. On this mission, astronauts orbited the moon but did not land. On Apollo 9, the crew tested the Apollo moon lander by flying it in Earth orbit without landing. On Apollo 10, the Saturn V launched the lunar lander to the moon. The crew tested the lander in space but did not land it on the moon. In 1969, Apollo 11 was the first mission to land astronauts on the moon. Saturn V rockets also made it possible for astronauts to land on the moon on Apollo 12, 14, 15, 16 and 17. On Apollo 13, the Saturn V lifted the crew into space, but a problem prevented them from being able to land on the moon. That problem was not with the Saturn V, but with the Apollo spacecraft. The last Saturn V was launched in 1973, without a crew. It was used to launch the Skylab space station into Earth orbit.

       There is gravity outside the earth. There is gravity on the moon as well. You know this though.. right? It's the Sun's gravity that holds this planet in orbit.

       The apple is closer to the Earth so it gravitates towards the earth more than it does the sun.

       I'm not going to sit here and entertain your little checklist of arguing points from the flat earth sub. They've all been thoroughly debunked: At this point if you honestly believe it, you're just ignoring those who you don't agree with. You're not out looking to learn anything, you're looking to feel better about your belief. Or, you're a troll. Your call.

       Have you considered maybe taking some science classes at a local community college, or maybe looked in to The Great Courses? If you're really this interested about how we know all of these methods work, that might be a better way to learn how, rather than polling reddit.

       I like how you assume I don't know anything about science. I have a degree in Aerospace Engineering from Ryerson University, Toronto. They taught us nothing about these spectography calculations. As a matter of fact they completely skipped the Apollo missions. They don't teach that stuff in Universities at all. So please, tone down your condescending tone, you suck at discerning people's qualifications.

       You never learned about Fraunhofer lines? I learned about them in high school physics. No college required. I don't doubt your college didn't mention them: They likely didn't mention the basic machines (levers, pulleys, ramps, etc) either, did they? Because it's basic shit.

       Go get a prism and a telescope, you can see them for yourself.

       Further, the Apollo missions had little to nothing to do with Aerospace Engineering, despite the inclusion of 'space' in the title. We basically tossed a stone really fast and really accurately. It didn't ever 'fly' in the aerospace sense.

       Radiation - I suspect they just assumed there
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       radiation, lots,  since we know the moon doesn't have magnetic poles, we can assume it has no protective shield like Earth. We know of cosmic rays and space radiation from plenty of terrestrial observations. See: the auroras at the poles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Air Density / Chemical composition - this is just another term for  'atmosphere', which has been addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Temperature - Again, this is a question of 'atmosphere', though a bit more in-depth. Since there was very little atmosphere, we knew that temperatures would swing wildly (which they do) depending on the observer being in sunlight or shade. Temperature is fairly consistent on Earth because we have a lot of atmosphere to hold that energy. The moon doesn't. Remember temperature is a measure of kinetic energy, at the very tiny levels. If there's no or very little 'stuff' to move about (ie, atmosphere), the temperature can't sustain in one place for long. That's why you have the swings between shade and sunlight: The sun travelling to the ground isn't heating up the 'air' around it (there is none to heat), it's just heating the surface it finally comes to rest on.

       Distance -

       Sagan, while famous for the original Cosmos and his work on Voyager spacecrafts, really has his claim to fame in his study of atmospheres on other planetary objects. That's where his specialties laid.

       Yup. Manned orbit no less. Can you imagine being on Apollo 8, going all the way out there, only to swing around and come back?

       Jim Lovell especially: his second trip was Apollo 13 (which we all should know, didn't turn out according to plan). Dude was
       <em>
        this close

       to landing on the moon and had to abort, never to return. And oh, he was the backup for Apollo 11 (which did land). So he came
       <em>
        this close

       twice. Sucks to be that guy.

       There was a lot of testing to get those nukes to launch. OPs point is that there was very little testing. In fact there were only two unmanned test missions of the Saturn (the second partially failed) - before sending three astronauts all the way to the moon. They didnt bother testing long range communications, re-entry into atmosphere with escape velocity and even the propulsion to the moon. They also never tested the lunar landing or the lunar take off.

       Apollo 9 and 8 were in Low Earth Orbit and at much slower speeds. Escape velocity is when you completely break free of earth's gravity (at minimum) and once you are in deep space, your speeds are much higher. Re-entry at those speeds was allegedly first demonstrated with live crew in the capsule (Apollo 10). No prior testing (angle of attack to make sure you don't bounce off the atmosphere, heat shield robustness) was performed (including unmanned) prior to the manned crew on Apollo 10.

       How much money/time do you think the government had back when this was attempted? The whole idea was to get it done as quickly as possible, as they were in a race with the Russians. The NASA of today (which you are used to) would test everything to the Nth degree, but the NASA of the 60s didn't have that luxury. They had to take some risks. How hard of a concept is that to understand?

       Also - after taking such huge risks why give up the tech? Don't say costS because a) the tech was already developed (so you just need to incrementally improve) and b) the ruskie space program had unlimited resources themselves but couldn't get past LEO apparently. And those folks know a thing or two about getting into space - so much so that we embarrassingly have to use their engines to power our heavy lift Atlas V.

       It was an incredible risk. The first manned Saturn mission went straight to the moon. All prior tests were unmanned and in Low Earth Orbit. It's unbelievable and you have  to be suicidal to volunteer for that. Test pilots are not suicidal.

       You go from saying that the U.S. Outpaced the Ussr to saying it's cool if we use their engines for our heavy lift purposes (our only heavy lift rocket). Who is outpacing who here? You think the Russians are that retarded to be able to develop reliable orbital rockets but didn't bother getting past low earth orbit? In fact no one since Apollo has gone past low earth orbit (manned missions).  There is no other example of such disparity in any scientific field and it's been almost 43 years.

       The most famous test pilot in history broke the sound barrier for the first time with a shattered rib cage, holding the cockpit canopy closed with a broomstick becuase he couldn't properly close it.

       Every single person in Nasa (and the military) knows the risks.  Hell, a test pilot was killed
       <em>
        last year
       </em>
       in a private rocket test over the mojave.

       Yes, that's moronic. Iterative technology isn't the same as slapping

       Apollo 7 was the first manned Saturn mission (although to be fair it was on the Saturn IB rocket, not the full Saturn V). However, it still served to validate many of the procedures and hardware that they would use for future missions.

       We can "Revisit" the moon whenever the fuck we want, there's just no reason to. We've been, seen and come back, and there's no reason to send people again when between the manned missions, probes and orbital cameras we've learned everything we want to. It's a moon, there's not much to see. The reason we go to mars is that in all likelihood, it once could have looked like earth, and there is a metric ass-ton we don't yet know about it. The only benefit to going back to the moon is to mine Helium, which is basically useless for now, but in the future will likely be exploited for power generation.

       There is no reason to go to the moon?
      </p>
      <p>
       When Americans originally "set foot on the moon" they eventually wanted to set up a base there. If they kept their word about it, then the rest of the world would bow down in mad respect to the Americans. But guess what, they rather fight illegal wars and kill innocent people and destroy the environment here on earth. Nobody respects America anymore. We look at them as brainwashed sheep with a criminal leadership. Anyway on the point, no you can't go to the moon because we can see through the hoax with the advanced technology we have today... they wouldn't be able to pull it off like they did in 1969 where all you could see as proof was through a small grainy tv screen. Hence they give all kinds of excuses. Their time is running up because people are begining to doubt they never went in the first place and it is becoming ample clear because of all the phony pictures and videos they showed us. Also I can list you many reasons to go to the moon and you can't think of any? You must be either dumb or trolling.

       Reread what I said. There's no reason
       <em>
        to go back to
       </em>
       the moon. Going in the first place was a major milestone for mankind, and once we learned basically all we wanted to learn, we stopped going. It costs a lot of money to travel between planets, we're not going to waste money building a moon-base that serves literally no purpose at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now If you'd provide some evidence for me to debunk as to why we haven't gone to the moon, I'd love to see it. Shall we start on the Van Allen belt, get that misconception out of the way first?

       For real? It should be much easier today to do the same thing with much more advanced tech. It should require an even smaller budget. And budget doesn't seem to matter when it comes to other things for example War. So please don't ever use that as an excuse.

       Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two major components in getting to the moon:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         A rocket
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Rocket fuel
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Then there's RnD. But we can pretend that's already done with, despite the fact new tech would require new RnD.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's all the small stuff like controls for rocketry and whatnot but relatively... minor
      </p>
      <p>
       That shit costs a fuckton of money. Most of the rocket is fuel, so unless you've got a way to make fuel cheap - It's gonna cost an arm and a leg.

       The "rocket fuel" used in the Atlas V was kerosene and LOX (pulled from the oxygen in the air already)...so no, I'm sorry, that "shit don't cost a lot of money." At all.

       But they already did the R&amp;amp;D. They had the Saturn, a highly desirable design in the fact that they had a working (and super successful) model of a single chamber rocket. This design is desirable because it is a huge weight savings. But single chamber rockets are inherently unstable - which is why the Ruskies gave up and switched to a (heavier) 4 chamber model.
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA had perfected the single chamber design and then inexplicably gave it up. Ironically, America's largest heavy lift rocket currently in service - the Atlas V - uses the 4 chamber Russian engine (the RD-180). Did I say ironic, I meant its a god damn shame.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: where are you getting this idea that rocket fuel is prohibitively expensive? Its usually oxygen, hydrogen, kerosene etc. all easily available.

       You've got to give the eggheads at NASA more credit. There's a reason the engineers and scientists that designed and wrote up the program that the Apollo Missions followed were PhD's.

       OP is very much of the opinion that if he doesn't understand it, it isn't possible. He only learned of spectroscopy in the discussions to this post, and immediately started attacking a science that has been around for a couple centuries now.

       A lot of the details could be determined by simple math. The Moon's mass could be accurately estimated from its gravitational pull. From there, it's a simple calculation to determine surface escape velocity. A lot of the chemical composition had been determined by spectroscopy decades before the first landings.
      </p>
      <p>
       The remaining details were filled out by unmanned probes. The Soviets landed the first probe on the lunar surface in 1959 and NASA in 1962. By the time of Apollo 11, the Soviets and the US had made almost a dozen successful unmanned landings between them. In fact, a Soviet probe was in orbit around the Moon when the Apollo 11 crew landed.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the time that Armstrong walked on the surface, NASA already had a very good idea of what to expect.

       Are you really that incapable of doing any research outside of youtube videos and conspiracy blogs? I'll admit I wasn't aware of the sheer number of probes that pre-dated the apollo landings, but it wasn't that hard to find out.

       Let's start with the easy ones. There was no atmosphere, and we could verify that with spectroscopy. Gravity on the moon can be computed, especially as we had done flybys which makes this whole process very accurate (we know our vessel's speed and trajectory, so we can see what the moon does to it, and then you have the moon's mass).
      </p>
      <p>
       Temperature is a bit harder. Since there's no atmosphere, the only real source of heat will be the sun. We know the sun's intrinsic brightness, and since we know our distance from the sun, we can use the inverse square law to give us flux, and from flux calculate temperature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, space suits were tested. Not on the moon, but in vacuum chambers here on earth. In fact, in one test, they had either a tube or part of the suit rupture, exposing a poor worker to vacuum. I can try to find the video if you'd like, but it's a long documentary on space suit designs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now one small correction I need to make: the Apollo crafts weren't at escape velocity when they reentered the atmosphere. They were at orbital velocities. However, we had already tested reentry with the Mercury program and tons of other capsules, and long range communications with satellite comms and again, those other space programs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, we tested the moon landing out piece by piece in the years leading up to it. The only real wild card was the lander, but as long as you find a fairly flat spot it isn't too difficult to have a computer perform a burn to set you down softly.

       So the first time they tested this method of spectroscopy produced accurate results was on the moon mission.

       No, the first spectroscopy was done way earlier, for example helium was first discovered from spectral readings from the sun. So we knew it worked, and from the fundamental laws of physics being the same everywhere, we know it works everywhere. Edit: I believe I found it, you can see the video
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJbztthNrVQ">

       There were more than twenty unmanned lunar landings between 1959 and 1968. Plus, Apollo 8 circled the moon in 1968. Apollo 10 also circled the moon, and tested the lander. They pretty much did everything short of actually putting a human on the lunar surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would love for us to go back to the moon, but I'm not the one who pays the bills. The very first question would be "why?" What is there to see that hasn't already been seen? And even if there were something to see, unmanned missions are far cheaper and far more capable. There really just isn't any compelling reason to put humans back on the surface of the moon.

       There is gravity outside the earth. There is gravity on the moon as well. You know this though.. right? It's the Sun's gravity that holds this planet in orbit.

        It should require an even smaller budget.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two major components in getting to the moon:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         A rocket
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Rocket fuel
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Then there's RnD. But we can pretend that's already done with, despite the fact new tech would require new RnD.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's all the small stuff like controls for rocketry and whatnot but relatively... minor
      </p>
      <p>
       That shit costs a fuckton of money. Most of the rocket is fuel, so unless you've got a way to make fuel cheap - It's gonna cost an arm and a leg.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        And budget doesn't seem to matter when it comes to other things for example War
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Um... NASA's budget is quite a bit smaller than the war budget, sooooo....

       Try what again? Risking human lives via lack of testing is understandable? Get the fuck outta here Einstein. It's a nonsensical argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also - after taking such huge risks why give up the tech? Don't say costS because a) the tech was already developed (so you just need to incrementally improve) and b) the ruskie space program had unlimited resources themselves but couldn't get past LEO apparently. And those folks know a thing or two about getting into space - so much so that we embarrassingly have to use their engines to power our heavy lift Atlas V.
