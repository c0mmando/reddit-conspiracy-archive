<p>Regardless of what it looked like, it was (in fact) a very simple clock.</p>

<p>And a kid got arrested... because &quot;it looked liked a bomb&quot;.  (Aside from it&#39;s 007/Hollywood-imagined style, it wasn&#39;t even close to being &quot;a bomb&quot;.)</p>

<p>I support Ahmed.  And you should too ...or do you specifically WANT our teachers (and our police) to be sooooo stupid that they can&#39;t distinguish a cartoon bomb from a simple clock... ?</p>

<p>If anything, Ahmed (and his family&#39;s &quot;activism&quot;) is simply exposing a VERY SERIOUS FLAW is our system:  We are a bunch of fucking retards.  </p>

<p>[EITHER THAT, or it was yet another &quot;drill&quot;/false flag -- i.e., The teacher and the cops were &quot;in on it&quot;.  And I don&#39;t believe they were in on it:  I really think teacher and the cops were just dumb -- plain and simple.]</p>

<p><strong>Support Bernie Sanders.  Make higher education FREE FOR ALL!!</strong></p>

<p>i am just wondering if ahmed was placed under arrest.  </p>

<p>i&#39;ll do my own research.  thanks again for sourcing that texas law.</p>

<p><strong>edit/ps.  the fruits of my research:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q:  Was he arrested?</strong></p>

<p>A:  Yes.  &quot;They arrested me and they told me that I committed the crime of a hoax bomb, a fake bomb,&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/16/us/texas-student-ahmed-muslim-clock-bomb/">http://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/16/us/texas-student-ahmed-muslim-clock-bomb/</a></p>

<p><strong>Q:  Was he released?</strong></p>

<p>A:  Yes, he was released, and the charges of a fake bomb were dropped:</p>

<p>&quot;...after authorities released him.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Q: Was he charged?</strong></p>

<p>A:  No.</p>

<p>&quot;...police announced the teen will not be charged.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Q:  Did Ahmed intend to alarm anyone?</strong></p>

<p>A:  Not according to the police chief:</p>

<p>&quot;Chief Larry Boyd said... authorities determined that the teenager did not intend to alarm anyone and the device, which the chief called &#39;a homemade experiment,&#39; was innocuous.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/16/us/texas-student-ahmed-muslim-clock-bomb/">http://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/16/us/texas-student-ahmed-muslim-clock-bomb/</a></p>

<p><strong>Q:  Did Ahmed make the clock for a science fair?</strong></p>

<p>A:  No.</p>

<p>&quot;...said he created the clock over the weekend, and brought it to school to show an engineering teacher on Monday.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Q:  Did Ahmed bring the clock to English Class?</strong></p>

<p>A:  Yes.</p>

<p>&quot;Police said the student had the briefcase in his English class, where he plugged it into an electrical outlet and it started to make noise.  Ahmed told WFAA that his English teacher confiscated his case.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wfaa.com/story/news/local/dallas-county/2015/09/15/irving-isd-student-detained-for-device-resembling-bomb/72339246/">http://www.wfaa.com/story/news/local/dallas-county/2015/09/15/irving-isd-student-detained-for-device-resembling-bomb/72339246/</a></p>

<p><strong>Q:  For how long did police question Ahmed?</strong></p>

<p>A:  About 90 minutes.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahmed said he was pulled out of class at MacArthur High School by his principal and five police officers and taken to a room where he was questioned for about an hour and a half.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Q:  Was Ahmed allowed to call his parents?</strong></p>

<p>A:  No.</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;They told me &#39;No, you can&#39;t call your parents,&#39;&quot; Ahmed said. &quot;&#39;You&#39;re in the middle of an interrogation at the moment.&#39; They asked me a couple of times, &#39;Is it a bomb?&#39; and I answered a couple of times, &#39;It&#39;s a clock.&#39;&quot;&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Q:  Is Ahmed&#39;s dad a bit of a nutcase?</strong></p>

<p>A:  Yes.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahmed’s dad is ...prone to strange publicity stunts, such as running for president of Sudan (without ever leaving Texas) and declaring himself the “defense attorney” for a Koran that a crazy preacher in Florida was going to burn.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Q:  Did Ahmed ever get to show his clock to his engineering teacher, as he claimed?</strong></p>

<p>Y:  Yes.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahmed showed it to his engineering teacher, who reportedly told him, &quot;I would advise you not to show any other teachers,&quot; Ahmed told the Morning News.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ahmed-mohamed-boy-arrested-over-homemade-clock-withdraws-texas-school-n431671">http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ahmed-mohamed-boy-arrested-over-homemade-clock-withdraws-texas-school-n431671</a></p>

<p><strong>Q:  Did Ahmed ever claim it was a bomb, or a hoax bomb?</strong></p>

<p>A:  No.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I never said anything about, &#39;I have a bomb,&#39;&quot; he added. &quot;Never.&quot; He said the interrogation &quot;made me feel like I wasn&#39;t human — it made me feel like a criminal.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ahmed-mohamed-arrested-after-bringing-clock-to-high-school-2015-9">http://www.businessinsider.com/ahmed-mohamed-arrested-after-bringing-clock-to-high-school-2015-9</a></p>

<p><strong>Q:  Was Ahmed attempting to scare everyone?</strong></p>

<p>A:  No.</p>

<p>“We have no evidence to support that there was an intention to create alarm or cause people to be concerned,” Boyd [Police Chief] said during a news conference after news of Mohamed’s arrest prompted a national outcry.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/09/16/they-thought-it-was-a-bomb-ahmed-mohamed-texas-9th-grader-arrested-after-bringing-a-home-built-clock-to-school/">http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/09/16/they-thought-it-was-a-bomb-ahmed-mohamed-texas-9th-grader-arrested-after-bringing-a-home-built-clock-to-school/</a></p>

<p><strong>Q:  Was Ahmed attempting to race-bait everyone?</strong></p>

<p>A:  Maybe.  If so, the school fell for it (apparently).</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>The school (English teacher and principal) over reacted.</p>

<p>And the cops were placed in an awkward situation of having to appease a nut case school.  </p>

<p>Even though he was released w/o charge, Ahmed is now suspended from school -- which suits Ahmed just fine as he has withdrawn enrollment from the school, and will enroll in another school.</p>

<p>And I would too.  Fuck that school.  But in all seriously, if I were Ahmed, I would also lay off the Muslim stuff.  (As a science dork, he should recognize that God doesn&#39;t exist.  Just sayin&#39;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the school took the appropriate steps.  The kid and his SJW dad were being shitty little attention whores.  They got their attention.</p>

<p>Ahmed made a hoax bomb, and he brought the hoax bomb to school.  When he failed to raise an alarm with his first teacher, he just tried and tried again.  Then, when got the attention he&#39;d been begging for ran to the media crying &quot;islamophobia.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s like pretending to be a rape victim to &quot;bring awareness to rape.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s called being a twat.  Ahmed is a twat.  So are all the SJW now championing his cause.</p>

<p>P.S. as long as a criminal complaint was filed, the prosecutor has 2 yrs. to prosecute in Texas on a misdemeanor...</p>

<p>I am still confused.  Did everyone know it was NOT a bomb?  Or were they really that paranoid/retarded?</p>

<p>And if not retards (i.e., they knew it was not a bomb), then why did they call the cops?  That&#39;s the part I don&#39;t get ?</p>

<p>Perhaps there is a misunderstanding of the law.</p>

<p>the law doesn&#39;t state that toy guns / clock bombs are illegal.</p>

<p>it only restates the existing law of &quot;don&#39;t yell fire in a theatre&quot;.</p>

<p>did ahmed ever yell fire?</p>

<p>no -- which is why the cops let him go <strong>WITHOUT CHARGE</strong>.  </p>

<p>ahmed did nothing wrong.  the teachers didn&#39;t understand the law (at best) -- overreacted, clearly.</p>

<p>were the teachers right to report &quot;something suspicious&quot; ??  uhhh... only if they thought it was an actual bomb?!  did they???  this still isn&#39;t clear to me -- but everyone seems to acknowledge that everyone knew it wasn&#39;t a bomb.  is that yoru understanding, too ?</p>
