<p>I see many people saying how there was no plane hitting the Pentagon, but this is frankly untrue. I was there. I was across the river from the Pentagon building, and I watched the plane hit. It was the most traumatizing event of my life, and I know what I saw. There was no way that was a missile or anything but a plane. I know a lot of you guys won&#39;t like this post, but I just wanted to be clear that I know for a fact it was a plane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Boeing 757-200 is 155&#39; long---over half a football field.  It is 124&#39; from wingtip to wingtip.  It has two massive titanium engines and a huge landing gear. The tail stands 45&#39; feet tall.  There are over 200 seats, and many miles of wiring.</p>

<p>There were hundreds, perhaps thousands, of pictures and videos taken at the Pentagon that day.  None of them show a Boeing 757-200.</p>

<p>The only pix you are presenting that show (purported) plane parts <em>and</em> the Pentagon are the two pix with small scraps of aluminum.</p>

<p>You are trying to convince me that two pieces of aluminum are a Boeing 757-200.  You are either an idiot or a shill.  (Note: I&#39;m not ruling out idiot shill.)  I know how I have you tagged, and I won&#39;t feed you.</p>

<p>Well no shit they did... It&#39;s a fucking crime scene that&#39;s what you do WHEN it&#39;s a CRIME SCENE. What do you want everyone and the mom to walk through a crime scene picking up any piece of evidence thus ruining the chain of custody? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go to the spot where you claim to have witnessed &quot;the event&quot; and take a picture of the pentagon from there and post it.    That should not be too hard.    Then we can all share the perspective you had of the hit.</p>

<p>You have already offered to take a picture of a DC landmark.    Here is your chance.</p>

<p>ps.   I lived in DC.   There are not too many places from which your claimed point of view could have been obtained.</p>

<p>Lots of people saw and heard that something happened at the Pentagon.    Lots of people saw a  jet.    That a  jet actually did what you are claiming is yet another matter.    That it was a Boeing 757 that did the observed damage is yet another matter.</p>

<p>Lets see the pic of the Pentagon from where you were standing or sitting.    Lets see the portion of the Pentagon that was actually in your line of sight.    Do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing. What hit the Pentagon is irrelevant to me, just an unnecessary piece to quibble at.  Personally I think a plane flew towards the Pentagon before steering upwards and avoiding collision while a missile struck. But again, no reason to argue much over this.</p>

<p>I highly highly recommend watching &quot;National Security Alert&quot;. It is, by far, the best documentary regarding the events that went down at the Pentagon that morning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also know a plane hit the pentagon.  A friend of mine was there and he saw it.  He has been threatened and death threats sent against him because he&#39;s posted it in other forums.  Terrible.  And he&#39;s not a shill, he&#39;s a broke skateboarder.   Never made money off of it and still has the same story.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing this, of course it was a plane there was never any reason to think otherwise.</p>

<p>The 9/11 truth movement was sabotaged by the same people who knew about 9/11 from the very beginning creating all these false leads while they buried the real truth.</p>

<p>WTC 7 is the one thing they couldn&#39;t completely bury, follow the trail from that and everything will be revealed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The no-planes *<em>at the WTC</em> theory has very few proponents and some would even argue that they are well-poisoners.</p>

<p>Also, see <a href="/r/911Truth">/r/911Truth</a> for tons of great info.</p>

<p>Edit: *I misread your post. I was thinking about the Towers, not the Pentagon.</p>
