       This is still one of the craziest pieces of architecture ever built in my opinion.   Everything about this is weird and unusual, and it's mostly right in front of our faces for the past 20 years.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Funded by a company noone to this day still has ever heard of (New World Airport Commision)

        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         52sq miles covered yet less runways than the previous airport which was perfectly fine to begin with
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Murals dipicting the end of days, sickness, dead children and animals and genocide
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Gargolye statues

       </li>
       <li>

         Giant demonic looking blue horse with red eyes statue outside the airport.  Like wtf?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       and the best of all...
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        An entire underground tunnel system including 5 buildings constructed first, THEN the airport over top of it.  These tunnels stretch 88.5sq miles, way outside the airport circumference and into the Rocky Mountains

       When I told him about how I was flying through DIA and how creepy it was, he told me that a friend of his had been hired to do surveying and plotting for a new solar project. While he was in the shrub brush surrounding DIA, he came across multiple low profile air vents breaching the surface. Some were over a mile from the airport terminals.

       I don't think the previous airport was fine to begin with.  The runways were too close to each other and so in bad weather loads of the flights had to be delayed or cancelled.
      </p>
      <p>
       The current runway, despite looking like a swastika, clearly gets round the issue by having planes taking and landing off in completely different directions.  Sorry, but I think saying the old airport was "fine to begin with" is probably just wrong.
      </p>

       Sure there is loads of weird art in there, but it could just be weird art.  Yeah it could be the signs of a cult or conspiracy, but it could just be weird art.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is some other weird stuff that I can't pull off the top of my head that we just don't know much about, more of "hey this weird thing exists, it could be something sinister" but we just don't know.

       Do you live in Denver? Are you courageous? Go out about a mile from the airport and see if there are any air vents. Pop one open climb in and tell us what you find. If somebody wants to crowd fund me i'll check it out...Lets get this settled.

       Thinking about moving to Colorado myself. I love the nature. culture, and the people. However it is a very military heavy state with norad, the air force academy and DIA.

      <p>
       All things considered, would you say this is a safe location for the future, or a dangerous one?

       Its population is exploding and rents are flying through the roof. While there's some nice nature around, it's full of people and you'll be stuck in traffic trying to get to it. You want safety and isolation? Wyoming, Montana, Idaho are a better balance IMO.

       As a Colorado native... I would not advise you to move here at all. DIA is only the tip of the iceberg. It's really freaking crazy out here. At first it 'looks' nice and all from an outsider point of view. But... then you have to get use to all the masonic buildings that really make you question who the
       <em>
        hell
       </em>
       constructed this place,  and right when you think you can get over the creepiness... next thing you know, there's UFOs freakin' everywhere. (I will admit that I think some of these UFOs are coming from some of the military bases as some kind of tech development). So, if you really want creepy and just down right strange, c'mon down!

       Does anybody actually read or click links anymore?

      <p>
       That link noted that the entire thing was an april fool's joke.

      <p>
       Don't get me wrong - I think this is a pretty strange airport - but as a Freemason, I'll confirm the masonic plate is just that - a commemoration to local business leaders who helped with the planning, funding, etc.

       Colorado is the hub of the American redoubt. It's absolutely about continuity of government.

       This was the corporation that was created to oversee the funding sources, not the source of the funding. Every major development project has its own corporate entity.

       This is the cornerstone dedication. A sizeable number of public structures have a cornerstone dedication performed by the local Masons. It's done for hospitals, schools, and any sort of structure erected for the public good and has been for over 200 years. The cornerstone of the Massachusetts statehouse was just rededicated by the Grand Lodge of Masons in Massachusetts with 1,300 Masons in attendance, echoing the original dedication that was presided over by Grand Master of Masons in Massachusetts, Paul Revere and Governor Sam Adams.

       There's nothing unique about this airport in that respect.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        52sq miles covered yet less runways than the previous airport
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is expected. Since the advent of automated landing systems, the limiting factor for airports has not been runways as much as total area for planes to move to and get out of the way once they land. In 1995, this was just starting to become a clear concern for the near future.

       The artist has explained his vision and why he chose the themes he did. Basically, it's a depiction of the seed of hope in a variety of seemingly hopeless situations, where freedom is ultimately triumphing over oppression. He's a local too, and there are some great interviews with him.

      <p>
       What's "demonic looking" about it? Horses are a symbol of the region, so that's not shocking, is it?
