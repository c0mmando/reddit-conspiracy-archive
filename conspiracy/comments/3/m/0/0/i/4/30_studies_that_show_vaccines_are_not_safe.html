       This study found that when you compare the First World nations, the more vaccine a country gives to it's children, the worse the infant mortality rate.
      </p>

       There is evidence that the Hib vaccine (given to children) is causing a % to go down Diabetes Type 1, this is autoimmune and leaves you dependent on expensive medication for life.  The theoretical benefit of the vaccine is low.

       "the marginal advantages of the vaccine in children over one year of age have to be offset against adverse effects of the vaccine itself, which are very common indeed and may be followed occasionally by irreversible brain damage, paralysis and mental deficiency. Because of this danger, or for fear of it, many parents and doctors are reluctant to vaccinate their children."

       Because science is scary and people will literally believe anything they're told that's counter to whatever the mainstream thinks. And they expect medicine to be perfect, even though it never has been and most likely never will be. The anti-vax talking points are just logical fallacy after logical fallacy.

       The paper written by Jon S. Poling doesn't belong on this list.
      </p>
      <p>
       His daughter developed encephalopathic seizures and autism following vaccinations.  The paper is likely about her, and that's a pretty big conflict of interest if you're trying to make an argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, Dr. Poling isn't even against vaccinations.  His daughter's case was an unusual circumstance and he simply believes more research should be done to avoid similar situations.

       Issues with these articles by OP:
      </p>
      <p>
       1.This was a study that relied on parents and recall; thus the potential for recall bias. It also does not take into account confounders, such as alcoholism: a known cause of autism.
Found here:
       <a href="http://bit.ly/1ixJYe3">
        http://bit.ly/1ixJYe3
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       2.Same problem as 1. It is based on recall of the parent, nor does it provide all confounders. The issue of course in this study is when was Hep B introduced fully? 1996. And in this study it included ages of 17. If these kids had autism, how the fuck do you get it at 17 in 1996 from Hep B when you get autism diagnosis around age 3? No that's right, again it's weak study. The Op was kind enough to only provide the abstract so that you could only gleam the summary; which if you knew how scientific research goes, can not be used to fully gleam what the study shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.Not a scientific paper. This is a summary of other papers. This is of course biased as the authors can push what they want to summarize in each section by leaving out what's important. Found here:
       <a href="http://bit.ly/1G4bXrg">
        http://bit.ly/1G4bXrg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       4.This was a good study but limitations they point out, and if you get to read it will see that the confounder of parental baseline mercury levels were not ascertained. It also should be noted that if you know anything about volume in infants and preborns, they're different. So by saying a volume of mercury is different/higher in one over the other doesn't mean shit, because duh it is! Found here:

        http://bit.ly/1L7vSwX
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       5.Good study, and it should not even be in this list. The results showed it remained within safe values. Found here:
       <a href="http://bit.ly/1Kwvp3T">
        http://bit.ly/1Kwvp3T
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       6.This study just shows that mercurial values ranged from 4-21ng/mL. Yet again can't access this one, thanks OP. Not sure about limitations but if I were to surmise, the parent's mercurial levels were not taken and then because this was a retrospective chart review, it can be biased off of reliance on the nurse to record data accurately.
      </p>
      <p>
       7.Refer back to 1 and 2 for why this is a poor study.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.This study merely shows an association of porphyria and unknown toxins in the environment. A poor study to base mercury poisoning on. Found here:
       <a href="http://bit.ly/1WkiO9u">
        http://bit.ly/1WkiO9u
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       9.A review article, not research. It doesn't provide any evidence towards mercury poisoning. It only goes to say there may be an environmental factor. I didn't have access to this journal. I just used reading comprehension to get that result. Found here:
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21299355">
        http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21299355
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       10.This study was in mouse models. Although semi like humans in physiology, they are notorious for not being accurate to scaling to humans. Nevertheless this study was well done. I thorough enjoyed reading it. If anything you can say this is the only one that may point to some kind of issue with mercury; but, the major limitation is whether this actually does anything negative in mice. That's another study that I'm sure exists somewhere, likely the same authors. Study found here:
       <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1OvFoum">
        http://1.usa.gov/1OvFoum
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       11.Mice models again, and extremely high concentrations of 38.4–76.8 mg/kg. Let that sink in how much mercury that is in a human. The average human male is 70kg or 154lbs. That's 2.7g - 5.37g of mercury. (technically half that) That's a ridiculous and absurd amount. I don't have access to this journal either; but, reading comprehension is key.
      </p>
      <p>
       12.Monkey models, was comparing levels of mercury in brains of monkeys. Not reliable to say this is the same for humans. It doesn't go into detail of what toxic effects are seen as that wasn't the intent of this study.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's 12 of 30. I have refuted 12 of 30 of your studies that you are saying cause either autism or that vaccines are not safe. NONE of these studies have clear causation of damage associated with vaccines, NONE. The ones, such as 1 and 2, only show association. If you know anything whatsoever about bio statistics CAUSALITY =/ CAUSATION. You can show association between anything and say that x causes y off of it. For instance, I can say that because OP posts on the internet he is going to die; therefore the internet is going to kill OP. Does that make sense? No but you see that shit all the time with studies that try to use associations or look for associations. There can be a multitude of detrimental causes that are never reported in these studies that are the real causative agent for "X" Disease. Autism definetly cause be caused by chemicals, such as alcohol or drug abuse, but do you see that in these studies? No. Not at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing: number 29, by a Mr. DeLonga. Where is her degree from and what's it in? Oh shit she's a economics teacher, not even biologically related.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: The studies posted are refutable. Most do not have anything to do with toxicity. They are merely looking at levels of mercury or try to associate through use of poorly done studies to be definitive causation. Now you can down vote me to hell; but, the point I make remains. If you try to declare mercury causes autism, prove it through hard science. Not retrospective analysis of charts or surveys.

        2.Same problem as 1. It is based on recall of the parent, nor does it provide all confounders. The issue of course in this study is when was Hep B introduced fully? 1996. And in this study it included ages of 17. If these kids had autism, how the fuck do you get it at 17 in 1996 from Hep B when you get autism diagnosis around age 3? No that's right, again it's weak study. The Op was kind enough to only provide the abstract so that you could only gleam the summary; which if you knew how scientific research goes, can not be used to fully gleam what the study shows.

        4.This was a good study but limitations they point out, and if you get to read it will see that the confounder of parental baseline mercury levels were not ascertained. It also should be noted that if you know anything about volume in infants and preborns, they're different. So by saying a volume of mercury is different/higher in one over the other doesn't mean shit, because duh it is! Found here:

Not sure about limitations but if I were to surmise, the parent's mercurial levels were not taken and then because this was a retrospective chart review, it can be biased off of reliance on the nurse to record data accurately.

        10.This study was in mouse models. Although semi like humans in physiology, they are notorious for not being accurate to scaling to humans. Nevertheless this study was well done. I thorough enjoyed reading it. If anything you can say this is the only one that may point to some kind of issue with mercury; but, the major limitation is whether this actually does anything negative in mice. That's another study that I'm sure exists somewhere, likely the same authors. Study found here:

        11.Mice models again, and extremely high concentrations of 38.4–76.8 mg/kg. Let that sink in how much mercury that is in a human. The average human male is 70kg or 154lbs. That's 2.7g - 5.37g of mercury. (technically half that) That's a ridiculous and absurd amount. I don't have access to this journal either; but, reading comprehension is key.

       <p>
        12.Monkey models, was comparing levels of mercury in brains of monkeys. Not reliable to say this is the same for humans. It doesn't go into detail of what toxic effects are seen as that wasn't the intent of this study.

       <p>
        See above.

       <p>
        That's 12 of 30. I have refuted 12 of 30 of your studies that you are saying cause either autism or that vaccines are not safe. NONE of these studies have clear causation of damage associated with vaccines, NONE. The ones, such as 1 and 2, only show association. If you know anything whatsoever about bio statistics CAUSALITY =/ CAUSATION. You can show association between anything and say that x causes y off of it. For instance, I can say that because OP posts on the internet he is going to die; therefore the internet is going to kill OP. Does that make sense? No but you see that shit all the time with studies that try to use associations or look for associations. There can be a multitude of detrimental causes that are never reported in these studies that are the real causative agent for "X" Disease. Autism definetly cause be caused by chemicals, such as alcohol or drug abuse, but do you see that in these studies? No. Not at all.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now is a good time to talk about science. Science is hypothesis, observation and interpretation. What you are doing is applying your thesis, All Vaccines are Safe No matter What, to whatever data you can find.  This is not science in the pure sense, but it is what passes for corrupt science and is the reason Up to half of all medical studies in the most prominent peer reviewed journals, The New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet "may simply be untrue". Their chief editors have both publicly written that corruption is undermining science because the entire system is so corrupt.

       I forgot I was typing a response to a subreddit with no real scientific background. If a study had bias, as does survey studies tend to do. It doesn't make it a good study. Point 2 is not a "metastudy". That's not a word. You are referring to a meta-analysis, which that is not.

       As far as animal models go. They don't hold up until you do human research. There are tons of information and research with animals that look promising but don't hold on in humans.

       Common Mistakes in Applying the Scientific Method
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The scientific method attempts to minimize the influence of the scientist's bias on the outcome of an experiment.
       </strong>
       That is, when testing an hypothesis or a theory, the scientist may have a preference for one outcome or another, and it is important that this preference not bias the results or their interpretation. The most fundamental error is to mistake the hypothesis for an explanation of a phenomenon, without performing experimental tests. Sometimes "common sense" and "logic" tempt us into believing that no test is needed. There are numerous examples of this, dating from the Greek philosophers to the present day.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Another common mistake is to ignore or rule out data which do not support the hypothesis.
       </strong>
       Ideally, the experimenter is open to the possibility that the hypothesis is correct or incorrect. Sometimes, however, a scientist may have a strong belief that the hypothesis is true (or false), or feels internal or external pressure to get a specific result. In that case, there may be a psychological tendency to find "something wrong", such as systematic effects, with data which do not support the scientist's expectations, while data which do agree with those expectations may not be checked as carefully. The lesson is that all data must be handled in the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another common mistake arises from the failure to estimate quantitatively systematic errors (and all errors). There are many examples of discoveries which were missed by experimenters whose data contained a new phenomenon, but who explained it away as a systematic background. Conversely, there are many examples of alleged "new discoveries" which later proved to be due to systematic errors not accounted for by the "discoverers."
      </p>
      <p>
       In a field where there is active experimentation and open communication among members of the scientific community, the biases of individuals or groups may cancel out, because experimental tests are repeated by different scientists who may have different biases. In addition, different types of experimental setups have different sources of systematic errors. Over a period spanning a variety of experimental tests (usually at least several years), a consensus develops in the community as to which experimental results have stood the test of time.

       You obviously do not know what you are talking about. When we do science we make a hypothesis, do an experiment, observe the outcome and see if our hypothesis applies.

       You took a hypothesis and shoe-horned in all the data you can find.

       You don't even read any of these studies in depth. You accept what you see as fact and then claim after the fact that I'm the shill for blindly following? You probably don't even know what biases come about from retrospective studies. Nor do you know what the differences are in prospective and retrospective. I read papers daily, you? You don't. You see a title and immediately latch on like you have with all of those 100+ studies that put out there like their fact.

       That's what sucks about the internet; you can Google your opinion and find 20+ articles supporting it no matter what.  I'm all for conspiracy theories but the horse blinders in the anti-vax arguments are infuriating.

       When you are unable to find it, and you will be, then you can apologize for your bullshit response of "Anything can be found to be unsafe"

       The truth is when you have billions and billions of dollars, anything can be twisted to sound safe, which is what has happened with vaccines.

       A good amount of these articles claim mercury (thimerosal) is the cause of these issues. We no longer use mercury in our vaccines for children due to the health risk it posses for them and I also believe it is or almost is never used in adults vaccines (

        http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/

       You don't even read any of these studies in depth. You accept what you see as fact and then claim after the fact that I'm the shill for blindly following? You probably don't even know what biases come about from retrospective studies. Nor do you know what the differences are in prospective and retrospective. I read papers daily, you? You don't. You see a title and immediately latch on like you have with all of those 100+ studies that put out there like their fact.
