    <div class="md"><p>The material that the roof of the cave is made from does not look like ice and its certainly not rock.
It appears to have a metallic sheen to it, there are examples of what ice caves look like a few clicks to the east on google maps.</p>

<p>Also the roof appears to have a lip to it, you can get similar things occurring in ice/snow called cornices and they generally appear on mountain ridges in areas of high wind, they tend to hang over and do not form up in a bump. They are smooth one one side. The area its in appears to be nestled in a hollow and is likely to not be that windy. The only way I can think it could have been formed &#39;naturally&#39; is if there was a wind blowing out the tunnel with a liquid water content but that would raise the question of why there is a warm wet breeze coming out of the tunnel, its unlikely that area experiences temperatures higher freezing on a regular basis. I&#39;ve spent quite a bit of time on glaciers and seen a lot of ice structures, its nothing like anything I have seen.</p>

<p>Example of naturally occurring cornice, note that its smooth on one side, if this was not shaped artificially it would have a smooth underside but that defies gravity, it normally hangs down rather than up so it would need a warm wet and strong wind coming from inside:

<p>In my experience you can get winds coming from inside a deep ice cave but they are invariably freezing cold compared to outside temperatures. There are also no icicles which are present to the east and north, including on the mouth of the ice cave mentioned above.</p>

<p>All in all, rather strange...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone just posted a link to this Russian documentary yesterday:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwUpPwyyvLw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwUpPwyyvLw</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s subtitled so it&#39;s hard to watch and read at the same time but the video describes Nazi&#39;s interested in Antarctica and the US noticing. The US assumed that the Nazis had built some secret bases in Antarctica and so the US sent it&#39;s Navy to destroy it.</p>

<p>It was suppose to be a 6 month mission but it only lasted 2 months because of destroyed ships and casualties.  But this wasn&#39;t caused by the Nazis.  </p>

<p>The video claims it was UFOs and has footage of UFOs battling with US airplanes.  How true these videos are is unknown but it is an intriguing video to watch.</p>
