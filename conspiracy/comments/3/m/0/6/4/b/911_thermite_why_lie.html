TLDR version of the video is that Thermite could have been used to cut the beams.  But even if one were to believe this &quot;conspiracy&quot; that explosives were placed in/on/near the WTC&#39;s, why would the government/media lie about it?  What do they stand to gain?  We already believe that it was a terrorist attack, so what is so terribly disconcerting if the public knows that terrorists also placed explosives inside of the building in preparation for its collapse?  Educate me, please.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are several layers to this deception, several &quot;truths&quot; if you will:</p>

<ol>
<li>The first &quot;truth&quot; is that Muslim terrorists did it. NIST&#39;s mission is to support this. Many, if not most, Americans believe some version of this.</li>
<li>The second &quot;truth&quot; is that it was an inside job, a controlled demolition done with thermite. AE911Truth&#39;s mission is to support this truth, stopping people from researching further. Most of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> believes this truth and will, I&#39;ve learned, attack you if you look further. But it leaves many questions unanswered: What turned the buildings into dust? What caused the radiation?</li>
<li>The third truth is that it was a <a href="https://youtu.be/c9rbdVWLmac">nuclear demolition</a>. This truth must never, ever come out, as thousands of WTC first responders and recovery workers have needlessly contracted thyroid cancer, prostate cancer, leukemia, and many other cancers as a result of the radiation. And it demonstrates the <del>elites&#39;</del> parasites&#39; willingness to use nuclear devices for false flag operations. (The DEW, directed energy weapon, theory by Judy Woods is disinfo to try to steer people away from this.) Talk about this truth, and you&#39;ll get attacked from all angles, including the mods.</li>
<li>Is there a deeper truth? I suppose one has to keep that option open.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe nukes are more plausible than most of the explanations, though I don&#39;t rule any other possibilities like directed-energy weapons (DEWs) or other explanations out. In my view, however, controlled demolition by thermite seems highly unlikely considering that a demolition would have left much more physical debris than what we saw, which was tons of dust, pulverized material, and just <em>some</em> horrifically twisted pieces of metal. Additionally, <a href="https://youtu.be/M3ZkoNF2ybg">thermite causes a super-bright, fireball-like reaction</a>, and we definitely didn&#39;t see two pillars of fire falling. I feel as though controlled demolition was actually used on WTC7 in order to more easily spread the idea that the Twin Towers were brought down in the same way. That day is still too painful for most to keep investigating, so they&#39;ll usually stop searching once they hear of the easy explanation of controlled demolition. Never mind the fact that controlled demolitions do not act the way that the towers did when they fell. Even in saying all that, I&#39;m more than willing to be wrong.

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, there&#39;s probably a deeper truth.  If I were to speculate, I&#39;d lean more toward the notion that most of your 9/11 &quot;memories&quot; are composite sketches retraced from a made-for-televison movie complete with live commentary layered in like a DVD special feature.</p>

<p>That&#39;s pure speculation though.  Would also help explain the &quot;dustification&quot; in a non-nuke context.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was not a nuclear demolition.  There were no EMP effects or charged-particle radiation effects to the many on-scene video cameras.</p>

<p>Thermite could easily turn the building to dust.  Concrete turns to dust at those temperatures, and steel burns and turns to ash.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it was. </p>

<p>I actually found a great example of EMP effect from a helicopter. (Because the detonation was underground, most of the escaping EMF radiation was directed upwards -- picked up better by helicopter than a ground-based camera.) The nuclear detonation (and EMP pulse) is about 10-11 seconds before the collapse. So start a countdown from 10 when the interference first hits:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ-860hvBrk">EMP Evidence From Nuclear Detonation at 9/11 (about 10 seconds before collapse)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Thermite can&#39;t turn a building to dust. It&#39;s used as a cutting charge. Are you suggesting they slathered thermite all over every square inch of the WTC buildings? And even if they did.. What about the thousands of ceramic toilets and bathroom fixtures?</p>

<p>And what about the nuclear radiation that gave so many WTC first responders thyroid cancer and leukemia? Asbestos can give you lung cancer -- not leukemia.</p>

<p>Only nukes can explain all this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it wasn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>EMP is not EMF radiation.  It seems you do not know the first thing about EMP and nuclear weapons: what EMP is, what the timing of the pulse is relative to the blast (synchronized to the microsecond), what EMP would look like in a remote UHF TV broadcast, pretty much any single thing.</p>

<p>EMP radiates spherically because it is a magnetic field effect.  EMP from a nuclear blast occurs timed with the blast.  The interference you posted a video is nothing like what EMP would do, it looks like simple antenna misalignment or loss of line-of-sight for a UHF antenna.</p>

<p>Sorry, man, you&#39;re the one believing a crazy theory.  The evidence for thermite was already huge and keeps growing.  There are videos of steel beams rocketing away from the blast, accelerating <em>faster</em> than gravity, because thermite burning on one side of them is acting as a propellant. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to answer your strawman fallacies.  You&#39;re making a joke by describing EMPs and providing evidence that confirms you don&#39;t have any idea what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>&quot;Oooo completely different!!&quot; Same thing, silly. Stop confusing people, especially yourself.</p>

<p>For those having trouble visualizing an underground nuke and the timing of the collapse, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSjratvNGmo">here&#39;s an excellent video example</a>. </p>

<p>First, notice the detonation causing a ground-based blast wave -- i.e., earthquake. Then about 10 seconds later, the ground collapses. Imagine one of these under each WTC building. </p>

<p>So, with that in mind, watch the EMP video:</p>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ-860hvBrk">EMP Evidence From Nuclear Detonation at 9/11</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When the interference hits, that&#39;s detonation. Start the countdown...</p>

<p>Look up the difference between &quot;far field&quot; EM and &quot;near field&quot; EM.  One declines in power with 1/r<sup>2,</sup> the other 1/r<sup>3.</sup>  You don&#39;t know which is which.  </p>

<p>What is disconcerting is that, if the same terrorists who hijacked the planes sneaked into the building beforehand and also planted a bunch of synchronized explosives (sidebar: and if those explosives were going to knock down the building anyway, why roll the dice with the whole plane thing in the first place), well, to put it in layman&#39;s terms, someone fucked up.  People sneaking in here and bombing America is actually something the FBI, DoD, et. al. is supposed to prevent.  Especially given that target is the same one from 8 years earlier.  </p>

<p>Now, to be sure, most Americans wouldn&#39;t notice and/or care unless the whole episode somehow affected what was on TV or Kanye seemed forlorn, because as a nation we are concerned with important things like how much air is in a football and whether or not Jesus wants homosexuals to get married.  But there would be those few that would agitate for a rational explanation.  And there wouldn&#39;t be one.  </p>

It&#39;s not like the &quot;infiltration&quot; had to happen over night.   I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m just play devil&#39;s advocate, so to speak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In order for any of that to happen, they would need someone who has security clearance to give them security clearance. Security there was very high level, considering the residents who had office space. Infiltration would be on a 2% chance scale (imo). It&#39;s far more likely it was a CIA/MOSSAD black op.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Compartmentalization of the MIC. You think that black ops aren&#39;t going on in the world, that only those who &quot;need to know&quot; know about it? Also, you say that to their would be too many people who know. That&#39;s not true, it would only of taken a few black op agents (I personally think they were foreigners, most likely Mossad). Think of it this way. The general government had no idea, a small group knew about planes and were complicit, and an even smaller group knew about the demo plan. It&#39;s all speculation, but it makes sense to me, considering the events of that day.</p>

<p>It would have been more believable than the official story, &quot;no those two buildings didn&#39;t just blow up, they fell down. Then this other building fell down. No, we had no idea this was coming. Look over there while I destroy all physical evidence.&quot;</p>
