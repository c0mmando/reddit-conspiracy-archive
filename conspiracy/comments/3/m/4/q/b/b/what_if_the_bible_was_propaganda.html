        DISCLAIMER
       </strong>
       This is a religious and controversial topic, I have a different view than some other people have, please do not downvote the post due to your religious beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been thinking lately after skipping church a few times (I'm agnostic, leaning towards the atheist side, but my parents insist I go) and I started to think of possible ways the bible could be fake, and Jesus not existing.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if all of the stories were made up by an ancient civilization, or a secret society trying to take over some country a long long long time ago, what if they made it so the residence would read the book and then follow it because most of it is very agreeable when put in correct context.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, pushing them into good, and scaring them out of bad ("sin").
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, an overpopulation issue. The would just say it's a sin to have an intercourse with someone you aren't married to, and then when you do get married, tie god into it just to bring the ceremony closer to the propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know, just a thought I had.

       I think the Bible was originally intended to be a socio-political guide to defeating the legal fiction system of debt-slavery. I think this whole mess has happened before, in prior civilizations, and somebody (or a group of people) wrote us a book to help us avoid it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think "Jesus", whether real or imaginary, was intended to be an example of behavior that, if followed, would defeat the banker Beast system.
      </p>
      <p>
       "God", in this philosophy, is simply Nature.. Creation... Life. We, like Jesus, are "Sons of God" -- not "Sons of the State". That is, the State does not own us. Creation owns us. God created us. God authored us. God has authority over us -- not the State... the Beast. We have abandoned God, and embraced the Beast. So we're descending into Hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this philosophy was used to crack the State back in the day. So Rome pivoted from government... to religion. They perverted the idea of "Jesus" into an external savior, and God into an external master. And this philosophy explains why Christians have been so persecuted throughout history: The philosophy represents an existential threat to the State.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think, then, that Islam was attempt #2 -- culturally-hardened Christianity, if you will, but that's another story.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is actually a church that espouses this flavor of Christianity. Their #1 rule is you may not ever again use your Social Security Number. (Number of the Beast!) Anyhow here's their website; I'll link right to their list of sermons to give you some idea of what they're about:

       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       edit: I should say... I haven't joined this church or anything. So my endorsement ends at, "This looks interesting." Their

       While I'm not sure I agree with you, this is such an interesting take I've never heard before. Always have more research to do, as you and many other awake know, but I will have to include some of the ideas you've mentioned. 
Keep on going my friend.

       Absolutely. I do think the bible and other works like it are coded messages in a sense. Your theory posted here is "scratching that part of my brain"... So I gotta check that out.

       This whole thing was ratched up ans changed, and you need to go back to Westphalia in the 1648 and Worms in 1123 to see the

       My state-sponsored "history" wasn't great, and my real history is  really just me piecing together tactics and strategy into a cohesive narrative. Where's a good place to dig on this stuff?

       Best strategy I had was to look at old treaties (firstly I was interested in specifically how the monarchies of Europe had legitimacy) from then I knew, but
       <strong>
        didn't know
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you see that the monarchies of Europe were allowed to exist as long as they had an arrangement with the Vatican, and that the monarchies were
       <em>
        prince electors
       </em>
       of the HRE, you can see that they were vassal states (in a different sense than we may think). But once you see who
       <em>
        owns the land titles
       </em>
       ...

       When I got into reading the Bible as a young adult, it became clear fairly quick that Paul was destroying Jesus' version of Christianity to create a new version for Rome.

       Agreed. Paul was creating a jewish based Christian structure. Christ was mysticism, about Oneness, Enlightenment, Ego death, and came to crush and put an end to destructive Judaism.

       And its turned into watered down fundamentalism

       Yup, why is it that fundamentalist Christians believe meditation is of the devil when Jesus encourages us to quiet our minds and to meditate within. Jesus’s message encouraged openness, oneness, kindness, enlightenment, minimalism, and the death of the ego. Like magic3383 said, "Paul was destroying Jesus' version of Christianity to create a new version for Rome.”

       Agreed. There are still some gems in paul, but you have to dig for em. I die daily and not I but Christ in me are examples. There are more of course, just have to keep in mind Paul wasn't Christ

       There are many references made in the bible. I am not Christian, but I have read the book. Look up King Solomon, he was TAXING 666 talents of silver and thus was becoming disliked by God.
      </p>
      <p>
       With regards to secrecy and secret societies
Luke 12:3
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus rids God's house of the "money-changers". AKA bankers.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many MANY warnings in that book. Christianity and Islam are considered "bad" because they both stress the importance of serving "God" and not the state. I don't believe in a personified creator. If "God" is real, I imagine it as a perfect cuboctahedron. With vector equilibrium comes perfect balance and symmetry.

       There's a few indications that the Bible (or more specifically, old traditions) are echoes of past science, or some sort of wisdom that got lost, be it God's of Man's:
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't eat pork: Trichonosis was a dangerous disease in times before microbiology.  If the power went out today, you might warn your kids about this, and in a few years "don't eat pigs because of the muscle worms" might turn into "don't eat pigs because they're unclean."
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't eat shellfish: Same concept, except salmonella.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ban Homosexuality/Adultery/Fornication: Possible echoes of a STD like AIDs that existed in ancient times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Burnt Offerings: Cargo cultism trying to simulate "taxes" and "tributes."
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't go on and on, but in particular if you read Leviticus with an eye turned toward "why would they do this" you can discover all kinds of rational reasons that you wouldn't expect from a people who theoretically didn't know about microorganisms, psychology, or evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's even leaving out the parts of the Bible that explicitely states "there was a big progressive city where the people got corrupt and then it was nuked." :)

       Actually, sacrificial offerings were originally about crop fertility; returning nutrients to the soil. Blood meal fertilizer has high N (Blood sacrifice), Bone meal has high P (Grind your bones to make my bread), and Pot Ash (burned plant matter) has high K.

       I think the Bible was originally intended to be a socio-political guide to defeating the legal fiction system of debt-slavery. I think this whole mess has happened before, in prior civilizations, and somebody (or a group of people) wrote us a book to help us avoid it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think "Jesus", whether real or imaginary, was intended to be an example of behavior that, if followed, would defeat the banker Beast system.
      </p>
      <p>
       "God", in this philosophy, is simply Nature.. Creation... Life. We, like Jesus, are "Sons of God" -- not "Sons of the State". That is, the State does not own us. Creation owns us. God created us. God authored us. God has authority over us -- not the State... the Beast. We have abandoned God, and embraced the Beast. So we're descending into Hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this philosophy was used to crack the State back in the day. So Rome pivoted from government... to religion. They perverted the idea of "Jesus" into an external savior, and God into an external master. And this philosophy explains why Christians have been so persecuted throughout history: The philosophy represents an existential threat to the State.

       I'm not sure why I'm replying to this...so here goes nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I grew up forced to go to church. It was a church complete with the fainting and tongues thing. I've always had my doubts, its only human to have doubts. I'm 32 now and for the past 3 years I've been trying to educate myself by reading as much as I can about things that interest me (conspiracies, world history, alternative views...).
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what I have learned. History is written by the victors. Every culture has a flood story. Jesus DID exist, whether you believe he is the son of God or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder (daily) if the Bible is a form of control. The beauty of it is the CHOICE is up to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of pieces of evidence that support the Bible that never make it to the mainstream media. Such as giant skeletons found throughout the world (Evolution Killers).
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, plenty of things point to it being propaganda. Such as Israel pretty much running the entire world and the Bible saying "Don't talk bad about Israel". Obviously I paraphrase for simplicity's sake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do your research and come to your own conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish I could discuss more of what I have learned but I suck at typing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not a believer's duty to convert non-believers, only show love and respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have a good one.

       The Bible does
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       say we shouldn't criticize Israel.  Actually, the exact opposite.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God. (Romans 2:28-29)
       </p>
       <p>
        For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. (Romans 10:11-13)
       </p>
       <p>
        Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ?  He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. (1 John 2:22)
       </p>
       <p>
        Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. (Revelation 3:9)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The Bible is clear that Jesus died to make everyone, Jew and gentile, into God's chosen people should they believe on him.  He told the Pharisees that their father was the devil and the seed of Abraham is anyone that believes on the true God.  The Jews of today DENY Jesus is the Christ.  They are antichrist.  The Bible calls them the synagogue of Satan!  Jews left the teaching of the Torah and follow the Talmud, the word of the rabbis.  The word of man over that of God.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that most mega-churches are corrupt.  The junk they put on TV is preaching a false message that people don't even bother to verify.  I wonder if the message put on the media could be influenced by the people who control the media.  Hrrmmmm.  Then the smaller churches adopt it because they want attendance and money.  They don't want to alienate people or preach something "anti-Semitic".  I've heard that last verse I quoted is illegal to preach in some countries like Germany.

       Watch Zeitgeist and you'll never believe the Bible again.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Jesus" is a figure that existed in many cultures, which all have roots to the same astrological signs. God is just a convenient way to explain what man is incapable of explaining in the present day. The Bible is a collection of cultural stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion has, is, and will continue to be a convenient tool of the state to control others. First, they rely on an appeal to authority, saying their laws are God's laws, and the penalty for breaking them is eternal damnation. Then, they use the "only true Scotsmen" fallacy to further control/brainwash people, such as "Only true Christians would join the Crusades, or not drink alcohol, because of this misconstrued verse in the Bible." The rabbit hole goes down from there, but all along, the religious government is a constantly-evolving figment of man's imagination.

       The parts about Christianity / religion in Zeitgeist were what turned me off the rest of the movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially the part where it argues that all these Gods share the same etymology, that there are remarkable similarities in the spelling and phonetics, etc. What makes the claim completely ridiculous is these "similarities" only exist in modern English,  not Ancient Greek, Hebrew, Latin, Egyptian, etc. hell forget about the differences between Hebrew and Greek, Egyptian had multiple writing systems.

       Exactly, I can't even understand how somebody publishes something like that without realizing how stupid it is.  You'd figure at some point  the writer of the film would realize that english homonyms aren't the same in other languages.

       EDIT:
      </p>
      <p>
       I was too drunk last night to think to add this, but if anyone's interested, it seems to me like most of the religion section of Zeitgeist was taken from an extremely literal reading of
       <em>
        Secret Teachings of All The Ages
       </em>
       by Manly P Hall, who was a Christian priest.   The author of zeitgeist basically ran with the exoteric meaning of a book that's extremely esoteric.

       Yes, religion is a control system, for example the Vatican is advocating for a New World Order. Pope Francis stated, having a personal relationship with Jesus is dangerous. He wants people to never stray from the church so they can bring in a new world, one world religion.  However, you do not need to be religious to have a relationship with Jesus or God. The New Testament calls religions people whores.

       The bible and other religious texts are a prison for your mind. They have caused more blood to spill then your mind can ever imagine. Tortures only a disturbed mind could think up, to cleanse people's souls. Causing suffering and sorrow like nothing else on the planet.

       Just curious, what religions have you studied? Do you understand the history behind religions? Do you know what religions actually represent?
      </p>
      <p>
       To someone uneducated in religion, it may seem like a fairy tale. Religion as an institution attempts to codify spirituality in order to create a community of followers. The institutions have been infiltrated and perverted over time to create a highly politicized movement; spirituality, however, remains to be a misunderstood concept even up to today by scientists and educated scholars.

       Well first of all, I don't think whether or not the bible is fiction or non-fiction is relevant in regards to whether or not you believe in there being a god.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there are a lot of interesting things in the bible, and alternative ways in which to interpret them.  Just use your own brain and interpret things and pick what is good and what is not. . "do un to others as you would have them do un to you" is a pretty standard way of living and covers pretty much all the commandments to a degree.

       What do you mean "IF"?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a theory out there that state's that Jesus was a construct for social control by the Romans. That the bible points to this with such statements as "Render unto Cesar that which is Caesars ". 
If you look at history it makes alot of sense to think of it this way because prior to the appearance of Jesus,  every Jewish uprising until Jesus was a violent one. But after that the jewish population  ( with exceptions of course) did not have too many violent revolts after that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bible could've been seen as an extension of this control.

       The point about violent revolts is a valid one I hadn't considered before, thank you!  It also lines up with Christianity being promoted as a pacifist religion (turn the other cheek and all that).  Keep the masses thinking violence is an absolute sin and violent revolution becomes less of a worry.  Good point!

       I think it started as a rough guide on how to be a decent human, but then the powers-that-be saw how easily you can turn someones believes against them to do your bidding, they started to shape the bible to whatever political agenda desired of the time.

       A lot of the stories seem to predate the Bible so there is that. The other thing is that it is a form of social control. Do this. Don't do that. Whether the goals were good or bad, still a form of control. The intercourse thing is more about control of women as property and control of disease than overpopulation IMO. Note that once married they had 12 children etc.

       It's not even that complicated.  If you look at early human civilization, you'll notice that the prosperity of a people is very much proportional to the size of the society in which those people exist.  Larger societies pool resources more efficiently to a large degree.  Religion was essentially a catalyst which unified otherwise unrelated groups of humans, and allowed them to prosper through association.  However, the practical limits of that cooperation in the modern world are now abundantly clear, and we have generally developed "better" ways of getting people to associate peacefully.   That's the general consensus, at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;Dr - religion was like the twitter of early human civilization.

       The answer is of course!!  Historically, religion has been known to unify groups.  The group of people who made the bible during the council of Nicea all had their own reasons.  Some elements were taken out of the bible in order hide parts they didn't like or agree with.  Some books say different things about Jesus than what were written, and many books were burned or destroyed so that their independent sects of Christianity would be wrong.

      <p>
       To further explain - In other ancient religions, there were gods of the sea, sky, nature, love, and other hard to explain things. The people believed that these gods governed things like the tide (sea), wind (sky), plant growth (nature), etc.. because they couldn't reasonably explain them. Since that time, our sciences and knowledge have grown exponentially to the point that we can now rationally explain many (if not almost all) of these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that the Biblical God was similarly filling in one of these knowledge-gaps for the people - they were searching for explanations (how the world was created, why are we here, what happens when we die) and the Biblical God is what they came up with. The reason I think that it's still a relevant religion is because we don't really have answers to the latter 2 questions, and our theories on how we were created are nearly as far fetched as the Biblical creation story (we have some
       <em>
        proof
       </em>
       , but it's more of an educated guess IMO).
      </p>
      <p>
       Good thoughts though, I've been thinking a lot about these things and have considered the theory you put forward a few times.

       First let me say i respect that you have a different view. But are you really interested in the Bibles credibility? You said that, "I started to think of possible ways the bible could be fake, and Jesus not existing". But have you considered looking to see if there is any evidence that confirms what the Bible says? I ask that genuinely and not to offend you. It sounds like you are at a cross road. Also, although i don't agree with your view of what constitutes propaganda or in this case how the Bible has been used. Let me explain that the Bible has been misused purposefully and as a result discredited its value in the eyes of skeptics. And its okay to be skeptical. But we should be fair to ourselves and search for all the evidence surrounding the authenticity of the Bible. We don't do ourselves any favours by omitting evidence from one side or the other unless of course we want the outcome of our investigation to lean in the direction that we want it to.  Now to address the idea of pushing people to do good. The question we should ask is, do we want to live in a society that is good? This subreddit is responsible for bringing to light or exposing what is wrong,criminal or bad in society. I appreciate that. Its one of the reasons i continue to read it and participate here. I would hate to think that people are just posting here because they get off on it. So most of whats written here is to , i'll use the word encourage instead of "push", people into seeing what is wrong to make things right or good. In a similar sense the New Testament does the same. Another redditor commented on how Jesus drove out the bankers. See the similarity?Now to address the fear and scaring people out of whats bad. I personally see value in a certain amount or type of fear. For example, i will not touch a hot stove top for fear of being burned. I will not jump off the roof of my house because i fear breaking my legs. I also try to budget my money for fear of not having enough money for groceries at the end of the month. I try to teach my children these concepts, with a certain amount of fear so they will not have to experience the pain themselves. I tell them that they should fear what i have to say but its up to them if they listen. On the issue of overpopulation the Bible teaches quite the opposite people are to be fruitful and populate the earth. The reason that intercourse outside of marriage is wrong, and i didn't always believe that, is because it has consequences. I'll just mention one here. When i actually got married to the woman i love and we went to have sex for the first time it was then that i realized i had already given away something of myself that should have been a special gift for my wife. Now thats what i believe and many people wouldn't agree but thats for them to decide. On the issue of marriage, believe it or not, the Bible is not really specific on a religious ceremony. The ceremony is more of a traditional thing than definitively outlined in Scripture. There are different examples but dare i say nothing written in stone... I believe, and this is just my opinion that the Bible teaches that a man and woman are married when they make a commitment to be faithful to each other. Even if there is no public declaration or big party. And i didn't see anywhere in the Bible where it says that it has to be done a certain way. I would challenge a priest or a pastor to show me. For example when issac met rachel he took her into his tent and she became his wife. Anyway i'm not looking to argue with anyone i just thought i would genuinely try to answer your questions from a different perspective. I admit i firmly believe in Jesus. He is real and there is collaborating evidence for His life. But it was not the historical evidence that exists for His existence that won me over nor was it fear. Although i admit i did fear the consequences of living a bad life, the truth is it does have consequences. What won me over is when i read the New Testament for myself and looked at what Jesus was all about, what He lived for, what He did, what He taught, and how He died, I thought ya this is for me i want to live like Him and do good. So i turned away from being bad and accepted His offer to start over. I believed what He said, that he died for me, for my sins so i could be right with God and have peace. Not something everybody wants but i did. If Christ were running for president he would have my vote. I'm confident he'd deal with the bankers... Hope you find your way. Let every man be persuaded in their own mind.j

       the bible according to an alien who came and lived on the planet for a while to study humans --&gt; The Bible - a collection of works of fantasy and fiction by the planets most outlandish sci-fi writers in the past 5 thousand years all put together by members of a cult known as the catholic church of rome and used by them and other cult sects as a means of political corruption and economic (theft)corruption , social  slavery thru church governance of lands by papal decree .
      </p>
      <p>
       invention of a "god" and his workers (angels) who farm  souls of "good" humans for an ever lasting life ( the reason of said farming is unknown) casting the souls of "bad" humans into a mythical realm within the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       -side note-
      </p>
      <p>
       as a scientist i can tell you there is no realm within the planet only an iron core and magma....
      </p>
      <p>
       within this mythical realm within the planet there is also bad workers (angels) who rebelled against said "god" to over throw him and  take control of another mythical realm (heaven) the reason for this was because the "bad angel leader" and his workers did not want souls of humans in their home ..the depiction of said "god" is one of brutality and war mongering for another cult "jews" who do not even follow the teachings in the bible but have their own book to follow, the "jews" them selves are looked after by the followers of the bible who supply them with funding for weapons to keep an on going war against another cult of people that has been going on for thousands of years .
      </p>
      <p>
       -side note- the "god" of both cult works of fiction , the bibles of the catholic and jew holy books (bibles ) seems to be more a bad guy than the apparent bad angel who tried to over throw him ,
      </p>
      <p>
       i have to add at this point , the farming of souls leads me to believe if any of this was real i would have to question the farming of souls and what really happens in the mythical realm of "heaven" , do they have an ever lasting life waiting for them or is there something sinister going on ?  "god" in this work of fiction seems to have the best spin doctors and the "bad" angels  do not have an out let for their side of the story ..
      </p>
      <p>
       the writers have come up with the perfect template for a devious scheme to get rich too . as they set up a meeting hall or "church" where you can go on a sunday and sing songs and listen to a "priest" tell stories from the work of fiction and give money for the up keep of the church . i have to say they out shine any government with this get rich scheme as every church looks as old as the bible its self , not to mention the apparent "holy wars" where different cults fight over a piece of land where mystical beings were said to live .
       <br/>
       one even being the son of "god" but was actually "god" who fathered him self without engaging in the mating habit of sexual intercourse  and who was subsequently crucified and called upon himself while hung on a cross to help himself but ignored him self to sacrifice himself to save the souls of the "bad" humans who could redeem them selves and gain access to the mythical land of "heaven" and have an ever lasting life , i must say this is a great way to farm souls for what ever the real purpose is .
      </p>
      <p>
       my view on this is -&gt; there is a competition in heaven , another mysterious being the "holy spirit" may actually be a referee ,score keeper , judge in a mystical competition between "god" and his workers and "bad" angel and his workers
(who may or may not actually be an angel as this book seems to have more contradictions that you can shake a stick at) but whos name is "Satan" or "the Devil" what we may have here is as i said a  mythical competition to gather  souls for a grand prize of sorts and one of the competitors was smart enough or simply cheated at the start and set about a plot to discredit his opponent .. one may have to gain good souls and the other to gain bad souls and the winner will be decided at the end of the competition in what the bible calls the Apocalypse or Armageddon ..
      </p>
      <p>
       if you like works of fiction you should give it a read , for those who like their fantasy or science fiction a little less adult orientated  then the Lord of the Rings may be to your taste .

       Much of bible is propaganda. Except I believe Jesus was real and started a movement called Christianity, whose initial followers were the lowest members of society. He himself said he was a man and not a God to be worshipped. This movement had very few rules, 1 to be precise, love your neighbour as you love yourself. Everything else was abolished. He taught man the way to heaven is to follow the path of truth. This movement grew and both he Jews and Romans wanted to contain it. Constantine devised the Roman Catholic church as a way to curb the movement and give it a new direction... controlled opposition as you may call it. Hence the collapse of the small ray of hope for humanity that Jesus started. There were other such teachers or prophets who wanted to guide humanity in the right path, but humans always have a way of leaning towards evil more than good, the inherent flaw of being human. On cell, so pardon the typos and formatting.

       Nearly every single person in this thread is just blandly agreeing with OP, but the very simple fact of the matter is that this criticism essentially only originates from two parties: those who are ignorant, and those who are deliberately opposed to Christianity - which is sadly ironic, seeing as the powers that be are
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgtQxqHiXM4">
        deeply interested in ensuring people reject Christianity.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The bible is
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHWVWw9gJT8">
        one of the most, if not the most, reliable documents from antiquity
       </a>
       , and if we cannot rely on it, it is questionable that any documents from antiquity can be relied on. Furthermore, Christianity is the only religion I know of that has a easily testable claim at it's heart -
       <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A1-20&amp;amp;version=ESV">
        the resurrection of Christ
       </a>
       - and this claim, when tested, is
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocbtjLgUnQY&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">
        incredibly robust.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is without mentioning how the bible itself is structured in such a way that events in one
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Catacombs/comments/pk2wi/i_have_this_suspicion_that_the_life_of_christ/">
        verse or chapter can reflect the narrative theme of the entire bible as a whole
       </a>
       , in spite of the fact that the bible itself was composed by many different authors separated across time and space. And there are many examples of this - here is
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-y56DQsAFg">
        another
       </a>
       prominent one. When fully grasped, the unity of the old and new testaments, and the fulfillment of old testament prophecy in the new - here is
       <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+22%2C+matthew+27%3A32-55&amp;amp;version=ESV">
        another example
       </a>
       - effective rebukes the claim that the bible is no better than other religious texts, none of which have fulfilled prophecy in this manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore I would suggest that the reason this is not immediately obvious to the layperson is because these things I speak of are
       <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">
        spiritually discerned
       </a>
       , and can only be understood through the spirit of God, which can only be
       <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-2.htm">
        received by faith
       </a>
       - which is gained by hearing the
       <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-17.htm">
        message
       </a>
       . And that message has been mentioned already above: Jesus Christ, fully God and fully man, was crucified for our sins, buried, and resurrected, and those who
       <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011:25-27">
        believe in him will have eternal life
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not be deceived - because sin is separation from God, and
       <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A11-23&amp;amp;version=ESV">
        all men being sinful
       </a>
       , this separation includes what are called
       <em>
        noetic effects
       </em>
       , that is, this affects the
       <em>
        mind
       </em>
       , human beings are naturally inclined to disregard and dismiss this message, and this rejection, which is illegitimate, can appear perfectly justified to the person engaging in rejection. I encourage you all, therefore, to trust in this message,
       <em>
        in spite
       </em>
       of the fact that it may seem strange or even against your own intuitions. Please seriously consider that God, in fact, loves you, and a loving God would not, in fact, leave us without the means to determine his will - which is why he gave us the bible.

       I'm pretty sure the church is part of the powers that be, so I can't agree with you on that. Pretty sure the bible was tampered with a couple of times already, and it is missing some books. With the Vatican being the remnants of the roman empire, I don t understand how christianity even stands anymore.

       I'm sorry, man, but people reading from books will never be enough to convince me, even with the risk of going to 'hell'. I believe hell is life on earth. I also believe the early gnostics were right: this vengeful 'god' that is 'God' is actually the devil or some sort of propaganda of the elite to keep people indoctrinated. And if God was so good, why would he let me go to supposed hell because I did not believe in Jesus Christ just like the bible portrays him? It makes no sense. I believe in the wonders of the universe and that we have some sort of a creator. And in the power of love, although I don't quite practice it on a daily basis. It should be enough, given that every theory / religion out there is biased and incomplete. Blind faith cannot be what God intended for us, mate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I  will watch this video, as I can relate to the guy with what he's been through. It is also important to keep an open mind, so I try my best.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will leave you with some questions, though: why was the Book of Enoch rejected from the Bible, when in antiquity it was regarded as a sacred text, and taken ad literam as the bible is today? why does the Vatican have a secret knowledge vault that they are not making public? What does this point to for you? What knowledge is there (apart from the forbidden books of the bible)?
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe that christianity could be the way, if we found the actual true meaning of it from way way back. And that meaning I believe would be that we are all 'God', and should use this gift to do good and fix our planet and get rid of evil as best as we can. I believe this was Jesus's original message, that we have the divine spark within us and should use it to fix the world around us, not just wait until we die praying to who knows what entity. Now compare this to the bible, which separates God from creation, puts him on a pedestal, turns him into this strict omniscient being that punishes you if you stray from his law, but absolves all your sins if, for example, you have killed all your life but in the end repent? What?? Plus, there is this clue that I'm sure you are not quite aware of, the fact that God does not intervene. A lot of evil is running a mock, but there is no clear rule or timeline for when punishment actually comes for the evil people. To some, it happens immediately (instant karma), to others it might not even happen. Why? Well, I believe this is a strong clue to the existence of karma, which does not work the way God's justice is portrayed in the bible. That means that the creator is something much more complex, which makes a lot more sense given that the universe is as complex as it is.

       Wisdom, man, this is the end goal, abolishing all dogma within and waking up to the essence that is within us, which I think actually is God, just not the God in the bible.

       The point about violent revolts is a valid one I hadn't considered before, thank you!  It also lines up with Christianity being promoted as a pacifist religion (turn the other cheek and all that).  Keep the masses thinking violence is an absolute sin and violent revolution becomes less of a worry.  Good point!

       It appears to be the object of worship for those who corrupted Christianity. If you're considering worshiping it, perhaps you can fill in some gaps.
