<p>Insights or Experiments? Oh dear, such wording confuses the mind. </p>

<p>They didnt need a EO for &quot;Insights&quot; or just analyzing existing data. They already do that on a massive scale without warrant and without judicial oversight. Why would they need an executive order for something they have been doing for years? Riddle me that.  </p>

<p>Just watch the wording. The only thing backing up your beloved SNOPES is one word. Experiment or Insight? You dont need an executive order for &quot;Insights&quot;. This executive order is nothing short of hiring scientist to optimize government propaganda campaigns. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A growing body of evidence demonstrates that behavioral science insights -- research findings from fields such as behavioral economics and psychology about how people make decisions and act on them -- can be used to design government policies to better serve the American people.</p>

<p>Where Federal policies have been designed to reflect behavioral science insights, they have substantially improved outcomes for the individuals, families, communities, and businesses those policies serve. For example, automatic enrollment and automatic escalation in retirement savings plans have made it easier to save for the future, and have helped Americans accumulate billions of dollars in additional retirement savings. Similarly, streamlining the application process for Federal financial aid has made college more financially accessible for millions of students.</p>

<p>To more fully realize the benefits of behavioral insights and deliver better results at a lower cost for the American people, the Federal Government should design its policies and programs to reflect our best understanding of how people engage with, participate in, use, and respond to those policies and programs. By improving the effectiveness and efficiency of Government, behavioral science insights can support a range of national priorities, including helping workers to find better jobs; enabling Americans to lead longer, healthier lives; improving access to educational opportunities and support for success in school; and accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy.</p>

<p>NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, I hereby direct the following:</p>

<p>Section 1. Behavioral Science Insights Policy Directive.</p>

<p>(a) Executive departments and agencies (agencies) are encouraged to:</p>

<p>(i) identify policies, programs, and operations where applying behavioral science insights may yield substantial improvements in public welfare, program outcomes, and program cost effectiveness;</p>

<p>(ii) develop strategies for applying behavioral science insights to programs and, where possible, rigorously test and evaluate the impact of these insights;</p>

<p>(iii) recruit behavioral science experts to join the Federal Government as necessary to achieve the goals of this directive; and</p>

<p>(iv) strengthen agency relationships with the research community to better use empirical findings from the behavioral sciences.</p>

<p>(b) In implementing the policy directives in section (a), agencies shall:</p>

<p>(i) identify opportunities to help qualifying individuals, families, communities, and businesses access public programs and benefits by, as appropriate, streamlining processes that may otherwise limit or delay participation -- for example, removing administrative hurdles, shortening wait times, and simplifying forms;</p>

<p>(ii) improve how information is presented to consumers, borrowers, program beneficiaries, and other individuals, whether as directly conveyed by the agency, or in setting standards for the presentation of information, by considering how the content, format, timing, and medium by which information is conveyed affects comprehension and action by individuals, as appropriate;</p>

<p>(iii) identify programs that offer choices and carefully consider how the presentation and structure of those choices, including the order, number, and arrangement of options, can most effectively promote public welfare, as appropriate, giving particular consideration to the selection and setting of default options; and</p>

<p>(iv) review elements of their policies and programs that are designed to encourage or make it easier for Americans to take specific actions, such as saving for retirement or completing education programs. In doing so, agencies shall consider how the timing, frequency, presentation, and labeling of benefits, taxes, subsidies, and other incentives can more effectively and efficiently promote those actions, as appropriate. Particular attention should be paid to opportunities to use nonfinancial incentives.</p>

<p>(c) For policies with a regulatory component, agencies are encouraged to combine this behavioral science insights policy directive with their ongoing review of existing significant regulations to identify and reduce regulatory burdens, as appropriate and consistent with Executive Order 13563 of January 18, 2011 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review), and Executive Order 13610 of May 10, 2012 (Identifying and Reducing Regulatory Burdens).</p>

<p>Sec. 2. Implementation of the Behavioral Science Insights Policy Directive. (a) The Social and Behavioral Sciences Team (SBST), under the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) and chaired by the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, shall provide agencies with advice and policy guidance to help them execute the policy objectives outlined in section 1 of this order, as appropriate.</p>

<p>(b) The NSTC shall release a yearly report summarizing agency implementation of section 1 of this order each year until 2019. Member agencies of the SBST are expected to contribute to this report.</p>

<p>(c) To help execute the policy directive set forth in section 1 of this order, the Chair of the SBST shall, within 45 days of the date of this order and thereafter as necessary, issue guidance to assist agencies in implementing this order.</p>

<p>Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>

<p>(i) the authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head thereof; or</p>

<p>(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>

<p>(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>

<p>(c) Independent agencies are strongly encouraged to comply with the requirements of this order.</p>

<p>(d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>

<p>BARACK OBAMA</p>

<p>THE WHITE HOUSE,
September 15, 2015.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So uh ya. Its all in the wording. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The initiative draws on research from University of Chicago economist Richard Thaler and Harvard law school professor Cass Sunstein, who was also dubbed Obama’s regulatory czar. The two behavioral scientists argued in their 2008 book “Nudge” that government policies can be designed in a way that “nudges” citizens towards certain behaviors and choices.</p>

<p>The desired choices almost always advance the goals of the federal government, though they are often couched as ways to cut overall program spending.</p>

<p>In its 2013 memo, which was reported by Fox News at the time, the White House openly admitted that the initiative involved behavioral experimentation.</p>

<p>“The federal government is currently creating a new team that will help build federal capacity to experiment with these approaches, and to scale behavioral interventions that have been rigorously evaluated, using, where possible, randomized controlled trials,” the memo read. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a couple of good reads. Obama is modeling his ministry of propaganda after the UKs BIT and Nudge unit after they showed a massive increase in the effectiveness of their propaganda. </p>

<p>I did read it. But I&#39;m not sure you have. If you have, tell me what new authority you think has been given to government agencies. There is none.</p>

<p>You ask &quot;Why would they need an executive order for something they have been doing for years?&quot; They don&#39;t <em>need</em> an executive order. Most executive orders are directives to agencies on how to do their jobs and what problems to concentrate on. Obama has issued an executive order on average every 11 days. You seem to think that an executive order is some kind of nefarious thing.</p>

<p>If &quot;it&#39;s all in the wording&quot;, tell me what words you objects to.</p>

<p>Do you think that government agencies should ignore the results of research on human behavior? Do you think that government agencies should be forbidden from hiring consultants who can help them design better programs? Do you think that government agencies should stick with ineffective programs and not try to change their programs to make them better?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I switched to my work account to comment, but just so you know, Snopes isn&#39;t <em>just</em> two people. I work there. You can check that, and we have other writers. A lot of these ideas of the site being &quot;just a married couple&quot; are based on an outdated premise. </p>

<p>For all the objections continuously raised about whether Snopes is the barometer of truth, this never is articulated:</p>

<p><strong>Anyone is free to double-check anything on the site and propose corrections. It isn&#39;t like people can&#39;t double check any page and share their objection with us and/or the internet at large. Please do this. Accuracy is important.</strong></p>

<p>The way people go on, you&#39;d think that there is just no possible way to double check anything we&#39;ve written. People may disagree with particular conclusions, but we include any relevant sources and citations on any page to enable readers to verify a page&#39;s conclusions for themselves. And if new information comes to light that changes the status of a page, <em>we add it</em>. They&#39;re reference pages, constantly updated as needs be. </p>

<p>Basically, please bear in mind that any information we publish is held to the highest scrutiny by readers. It is is simply impossible for an outdated or inaccurate bit of information to survive long on the site (and sometimes information becomes outdated, we have a status for that). </p>

<p>Of course, some pages are perpetually contested. The Thompson/CDC page is the perfect example of that. But no additional data aside from the study in question supported that claim; we simply did not have any additional information (or the weight of scientific evidence) to further entertain it. </p>

<p>By and large, the majority of Snopes pages are not heavily disputed. As for seeking to &quot;influence the internet,&quot; that&#39;s not at all the site&#39;s purpose. The site exists simply to catalogue folklore and urban legends, a task that has since evolved to become more current and immediate. No page begins with a conclusion- we start with a blank slate based upon the emails, Facebook messages, and message board posts we receive asking whether something is true or false. We base that conclusion (where applicable) on what we find in research and I&#39;ve never been asked to change any of the hundreds of pages I&#39;ve written to suit any agenda or predetermined outcome. I&#39;ve also known Snopes since 2000, and I&#39;ve never known him to be heavily invested in any philosophy or belief. Folklorists require an open mind.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll answer any reasonable questions if you have any :) If I can&#39;t, I&#39;ll explain why. </p>

<p>As I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware, third party repetition of a claim does not equate to corroboration of that claim. Plenty of lawmakers repeat information they&#39;ve received from constituents, but that in no way provides evidence the repeated claim is true. </p>

<p>We reviewed it when it was current, but it did not provide any further support for the original assertion. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The <em>writing of the page</em> does not begin with a conclusion. The formulation of a truth status is generally something that occurs once the information is reviewed and the page is written. We don&#39;t start out by trying to prove or disprove anything. The truth status occurs AFTER the information is reviewed (not before). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have yet to be given a confirmed case of Snopes.com providing inaccurate information?</p>

<p>Get ready then!</p>

<p>Go look up Snopes.com&#39;s snarky article &quot;Flight of Fancy&quot; in which they claimed to have &quot;debunked&quot; Michael Moore&#39;s reporting that the Bin Laden family were flown out of the US after 9/11. Snopes believed a Pentagon press release over the investigative journalist (falling for propaganda over fact-checking) and got burned. They later had to apologize to Moore and concede that he was right and they were wrong.</p>

<p>Google it.</p>

<p>So your claim that Snopes hasn&#39;t been busted for peddling misinformation just got debunked.</p>

<p>There are numerous other cases, too.</p>

<p>But for starters, go Google &quot;Flight of Fancy&quot; and use the key phrases &quot;Snopes retracts&quot; and &quot;apologizes&quot;. The embarrassing thing for Snopes wasn&#39;t just that they were wrong. What was cringe-worthy about it is how arrogant and contemptuous they were of Moore. How they made every effort to belittle him . . . and then had to backtrack with egg on their face. It was pathetic.</p>

<p>(Odd how an investigative journalist with decades of experience was right, and non-professional arm-chair pseudo-detectives were wrong. Funny how that works!) Moral of the story: Don&#39;t get your medical advice from bus drivers. Don&#39;t get your legal counsel from a hotdog vendor. And don&#39;t get your fact-checking from people with no professional background in investigation, detective work, or research analytics.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m looking at it <a href="http://www.snopes.com/rumors/flights.asp">right now</a>. Looks solid to me. Where is this &quot;misinformation&quot; of which you speak?</p>

<p>Please note, I used the <em>present</em> tense in my comment. Let me repeat the relevant sections, with emphasis added, since you apparently misunderstood:</p>

<ul>
<li>how accurate <strong>is</strong> the content on their site</li>
<li>I have yet to be given a confirmed case of Snopes.com <strong>providing</strong> inaccurate information. </li>
</ul>

<p>Those are current tenses. An example from 12 years ago, of a piece which was then corrected, simply doesn&#39;t qualify. Your statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your claim that Snopes hasn&#39;t been busted for peddling misinformation just got debunked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is thus rated FALSE. :) </p>

<p>I don&#39;t demand or expect 100%, permanent accuracy from <em>any</em> source, as long as when new evidence is brought to light, they update their stance as appropriate. If only certain conspiracy theorist sources were as willing to change their positions in light of facts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Odd how an investigative journalist with decades of experience was right, and non-professional arm-chair pseudo-detectives were wrong. Funny how that works!) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You really think Michael Moore is some kind of bastion of truth and accuracy? LOL. There have been entire websites (the currently down moorelies.com) devoted to pointing out the lies, distortions and factual inaccuracies peddled in his pseudo-documentaries. Have a few mere web-pages, from sources both mainstream and alternative.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2004/06/unfairenheit_911.html">The lies of Michael Moore</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/Truth_About_Bowling.html">Truth about Bowling for Columbine</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/may/23/cannes2004.features">Michael Moore: A few awkward questions</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/1164856/posts">Fifty-six Deceits in Fahrenheit 911</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So I guess being &quot;an investigative journalist with decades of experience&quot; isn&#39;t any better. What are Moore&#39;s credentials? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moore">As far as I can tell</a>, he dropped out of university after a single year, so has no professional qualifications either. All he actually has is his &quot;decades of experience&quot; - in other words, the same as the Mikkelsons! LOL once again.</p>

<p>Really, if you wanted an example of an investigative journalist dedicated to the truth, he is about the <strong>last</strong> example you should be holding up. I&#39;ll believe the Mikkelsons over Moore every day and twice on Sundays. </p>

<p>Snopes dismisses the claims of CDC Whistleblower William Thompson (who said he participated in fraud at the CDC). Thompson proved with documentation that he committed fraud while part of the CDC. How does Snopes debunk him? By citing the EXACT STUDIES he has his name on and he says were done fraudulently. </p>

<p>Nope. The claim being investigated is NOT Thompson&#39;s fraud allegations. It&#39;s stated, right at the top: &quot;Data suppressed by the CDC proved that the MMR vaccine produces a 340% increased risk of autism in African-American boys.&quot; Snopes <em>does</em> conclude, &quot;What got lost in the brouhaha over Dr. Thompson&#39;s &quot;confession,&quot; allegations about a &quot;cover-up&quot; at the CDC, and threats of whistleblower lawsuits was what should have been the main point: <strong>Did collected data actually prove that the MMR vaccine produces a 340% increased risk of autism in African-American boys? The answer is no, it did not.</strong>&quot; </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not if there are &quot;giant put calls&quot; being made on all manner of stocks, all the time. Which there actually are. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>that cites the 911 Commission report which simply says &quot;nothing to see here.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t say anything of the kind, being a lot more detailed: &quot;A single U.S.-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda purchased 95 percent of the UAL puts on September 6 as part of a trading strategy that also included buying 115,000 shares of American on September 10. Similarly, much of the seemingly suspicious trading in American on September 10 was traced to a specific U.S.-based options trading newsletter, faxed to its subscribers on Sunday, September 9, which recommended these trades.&quot;</p>

<p>Your counter-evidence is that it &quot;obviously&quot; was insider trading. Yeah, I&#39;m going with Snopes here. You&#39;re 0-for-2. </p>

<p>Its circular because the ones that are accusing hooker and Thompson of fraud, are the ones who committed the fraud in the first place. A senior CDC scientist (who is STILL EMPLOYED there) comes out and says &quot;I participated in fraud. Here are the fake studies and here&#39;s the original data that proves what im saying&quot;. The media is dead silent and the journal (which published the fraudulent paper to begin with) says &quot;Nope. What he&#39;s saying is false.&quot; And how do they prove it? By pointing to the study <em>with his name on it</em>.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this, if at your job you lied and told everyone your company was committing fraud, how long would you remain employed there? Id be fired from my job yesterday if I ever did that. Now why do you think William Thompson is <em>still employed</em> by the CDC if what Snopes says is true and he&#39;s lying?</p>

<p>Conversely, if at your job you TOLD THE TRUTH and told everyone your company was committing fraud, how long would you remain employed there? </p>

<p>Rather than making any effort to follow up on his accusations, Thompson has said nothing of note or relevance for more than a year. Not even a rebuttal of the independent decision for his paper getting pulled. Hardly what you&#39;d expect from a true &quot;whistleblower&quot;, eh? </p>

<p>Again, &quot;Did collected data actually prove that the MMR vaccine produces a 340% increased risk of autism in African-American boys? The answer is no, it did not.&quot; The only evidence submitted to that end, has now been withdrawn by the journal that published it, with severe doubts regarding its validity.

<p>So the CDC is keeping him employed after he lied to &quot;Keep collecting a paycheck, to continue his career, to feed his family, etc.&quot; Are you retarded? This doesn&#39;t even make sense. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>No. No it doesn&#39;t. Not at all. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How does his continued employment prove a conspiracy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It proves that he has legal leverage to sue if he was terminated. If they did terminate for revealing the truth, he could sue them and then things would get deeper. The motivation not to fire him is legal. </p>

<p>No evidence? LOL. There&#39;s 100,000 pages of scientific data: <a href="http://truthinmedia.com/update-congressmans-office-in-possession-of-100000-cdc-whistleblower-documents/">http://truthinmedia.com/update-congressmans-office-in-possession-of-100000-cdc-whistleblower-documents/</a></p>

<p>Not one paragraph of which has been released in over a year since that statement. Claiming it as &quot;evidence&quot; for anything seems premature, to put it mildly. </p>

<p>LOL. That&#39;s all the information? He&#39;s basically doing nothing except reading Thomson&#39;s statement. Nothing from the 100,000 pages at all. Funny that: he&#39;s had them for a year, and still has found nothing of interest or relevance?</p>

<p>Until those documents are ACTUALLY released - and perhaps Thompson ceases his inexplicable, apparently happy continued employment at de ebil CDC - you&#39;ve got nothing. I&#39;m sure if something comes out, Snopes will update the page, as they&#39;ve done on other topics. But right now, there is just no such credible evidence. </p>

<p>ARTICLE UPDATE:</p>

<p>FreedomBrief.com readers have uncovered information that debunks the theories introduced by NaturalNews.com in this article. Google scans the web pages looking for dates and then applies anything it finds to the search results. Our own article appears to have the date ‘December 11, 2012′ in the search results, although it was published on ‘January 11, 2013,’ this is because the date ‘December 11, 2012′ is listed in the article. Although we have not been able to confirm this with Google, it appears to be accurate. Please keep this in mind as you read this article. Thank you.</p>

<p>Never mind there was never a history of this page at the internet archive until the 15th. If crawlers would get to it like they did </p>

<p>Ask yourself this, if at your job you lied and told everyone your company was committing fraud, how long would you remain employed there? Id be fired from my job yesterday if I ever did that. Now why do you think William Thompson is still employed by the CDC if what Snopes says is true and he&#39;s lying?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Conversely, if at your job you TOLD THE TRUTH and told everyone your company was committing fraud, how long would you remain employed there? </p>

<p>Rather than making any effort to follow up on his accusations, Thompson has said nothing of note or relevance for more than a year. Not even a rebuttal of the independent decision for his paper getting pulled. Hardly what you&#39;d expect from a true &quot;whistleblower&quot;, eh? </p>

<p>Again, &quot;Did collected data actually prove that the MMR vaccine produces a 340% increased risk of autism in African-American boys? The answer is no, it did not.&quot; The only evidence submitted to that end, has now been withdrawn by the journal that published it, with severe doubts regarding its validity. So the bottom line is, <strong>Snopes are right.</strong> </p>
