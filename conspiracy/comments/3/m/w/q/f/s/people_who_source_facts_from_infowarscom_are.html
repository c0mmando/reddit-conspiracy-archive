Google critical thinking skills and print it out and post it somewhere that after a month you will know it by heart.

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting advice-spiel ya got there, you&#39;re probably used to talking to a lot of teenagers. I&#39;ve watched the younger generation become weirdly obsessed with those logical fallacies as if there is no way to think without formal training. That can be dangerous, but despite that, every brainwashing technique they have used on us over the generations, can be used against them. The generation being forced into the &quot;formal thought or you&#39;re doing it wrong&quot; box are certainly victim to one of the more frightening brainwashing techniques I&#39;ve ever heard of, but it&#39;s not surprising: they have to create a way for atheists to believe in wrong-headedness, and this accomplishes that nicely. </p>

<p>You do realize we made thousands of years of human progress prior to telling ourselves we must think in these strict and small terms? Logic is helpful in most, if not all, situations, but to be super cheesy and quote something, logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end. I&#39;m not saying believe your gut, more like &quot;&#39;trust, but verify&#39;, can also apply to yourself.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s say it&#39;s possible that he&#39;s never said one way or anther. Is plausible deniability a respectable way to resolve that question, when he provides such a friendly mouthpiece for David Icke?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at two guests he has had on his show: Noam Chomsky and David Icke.</p>

<p>Noam Chomsky he starts a fight with and calls an NWO plant:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3naksKMtQHo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3naksKMtQHo</a></p>

<p>David Icke, on the other hand, he provides a constant mouthpiece for:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=david+icke+infowars.com">https://www.google.com/search?q=david+icke+infowars.com</a></p>

<p>Jones&#39;s own excuse why he allows Icke on his channel:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukAwBRDfHdI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukAwBRDfHdI</a></p>

<p>Yet he can&#39;t find a better source? </p>

<p>Like a politician pretending he didn&#39;t run the attack ad. Nobody will ever see the non-retraction of the politician disclaiming the attack ad, and near-nobody will ever see that third link above.</p>

<p>I could have picked on the Jade Helm 15 nonsense or any other flavor of nonsense. Infowars talks about useful idiots A LOT. They protest just enough for us to notice, but not enough for EVERYONE to notice.</p>

<p>Example of business as usual: Alex Jones treating Icke as the go-to credible witness on the topic of alien conspiracies:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMHO, David Icke is a British version of Infowars. A little more intellectual, a little more nuanced, but still crazy in its own way, and it never digs beyond th first layer of &#39;conspiracy&#39;</p>

<p>Noam Chomsky, as a highly respected linguist, is deeply involved in the process of culture control and depending on your personal views (like Jones) you might see him as a dangerous secular progressive thinker. </p>

<p>Alex Jones seems like a controlled shade of Bill Cooper, designed to appeal to Americans&#39; less savory nature, and that makes me sad. </p>

<p>David Icke talking about reptilians is also real as a metaphor, which can be traced back to the esoteric teaching of the two bloodlines of Cain and Abel. Elite/powerful people believe in those teachings. Which is why I said before, you are new to this. </p>

<p>Look into the esoteric story of Cain and Abel. Two brothers, with the same mother but different fathers (Serpent and God). This, could also be a metaphor for the reptilian part of the brain. Psychopaths. They have no remorse, no feeling. They only have predatory behavior and survival instincts. Hence, reptilian.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how many millennia it has been, since the last time a person who can&#39;t make proper distinctions between speaking poetically about aliens vs. exposing matters of life or death, was considered a sane person. And obviously neither does David Icke.</p>

<p>Yes. That is retarded. And yet it is still illustrative so that we don&#39;t forget what &quot;speaking in metaphor&quot; looks like. That is to say, teh congressman had a good point and still needed to sit down and shut up until he thought of a way to say it that could be respected.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s all pointlessly hash semantics as a way of deflecting criticism! Let&#39;s defend psychopaths who think that a shell-shocked soldier seeing secret coded messages talking to him in the flicker frequencies of filaments in lighbulbs during interviews, is proof of aliens!

    <div class="md"><p>Not aware of Bill Cooper but I don&#39;t make it my business to catalog morons.</p>

<p>Icke is a real piece of work, ironically for the exact reasons Jones himself states: such valuable information about the global finance conspiracy and yet he has to taint everything he says with the aliens nonsense. It is undoubtedly effective in inoculating a large number of people against ever believing any of the true things Icke says, and that is where I agree thousands and thousands of percent with you: Jones is the same. He is an intellectual vaccine against waking up. His mission is to make every shade of the revolution look stupid by pairing it with some cartoon-brained crap.</p>

<p>Nobody needs people like that. We have the FOIA and journalists and whistleblowers and even a few honest congress-critters (no, seriously! Al Franken! Jesse Ventura!)</p>

<p>Or, hey, maybe we do, but if you think it&#39;s a waste of time to talk about it, you really must not think it&#39;s at all important.</p>
