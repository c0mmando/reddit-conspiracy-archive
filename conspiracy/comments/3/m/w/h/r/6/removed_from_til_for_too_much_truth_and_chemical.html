       TIL mods removed this for "editorializing," despite the fact that I copy pasted the introductory paragraph into the title, from the New York Times.

        TIL the Safe Drinking Water Act is so out of date that the water Americans drink can pose what scientists say are serious health risks â€” and still be legal. Only 91 contaminants are regulated by the Act, yet more than 60,000 chemicals are used within the United States, according to EPA estimates.

       Aren't most "organic" products still filled with lots of the same crap as everything else? I'm probably wrong but I feel like the whole "organic" "gluten free" thing is just a way to convince people they're eating healthy when in reality they're still getting most of the garbage. That's why I'm so confused honestly. I don't feel like there's a right choice and it scares me.

       I'm talking about real organic,  not "organic".  grow your own food or buy it from a trusted source if you are concerned. do some research on self sustainable living and find a non - gmo seed source. I'm not an expert by any means, I am just making some suggestions based on logic and personal experience.

       In general the more processed the food, the more likely it is to have terrible things in it. This includes some stuff that's labeled "organic", because there are quite a few bad things that don't factor into the difference between organic and non-organic. And there are organic brands who use the absolute minimum standards to get the organic label, but cut corners when they can to make their products similar in price to the non-organic alternative. When possible it's best to find brands that are more clearly committed to healthy and sustainable practices all around.
      </p>
      <p>
       USDA organic does mean non-GMO, though they could be defining non-gmo in a loophole-ridden way, I don't know. There are many types of produce that are nearly all GMO if not organic (corn, soy), and there are other types which are really badly inundated with pesticides (apples, strawberries, lettuce and other greens come to mind). Local (and if possible organic) is preferable, there will be less chemicals in and on the produce and it will usually taste better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pesticides become a bigger worry with animal products, since the animals eat the pesticide-laden crops and therefore levels of those chemicals get really high in the meat and dairy products. I try to get organic butter, organic milk (and research the company - how do they feed their cows? vegetarian? organic? grass-fed? or do they not release the info?), organic or at least cage-free eggs from a trustworthy brand (I like Nellie's). I don't eat much meat, but we all know how problematic the meat industry is, so it's best to be careful there. Grass-fed beef tastes great.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Sorry this is so long. I just wanted to offer you some helpful advice in case it's not practical for you to produce all your own food as a previous commenter suggested. And if you don't produce all your own food, you will have to trust someone at some point. It is scary when you consider that the majority of food in the grocery store is full of
       <em>
        possibly
       </em>
       safe food dyes, artificial flavors, preservatives, GMOs (I know some of us are not worried about that but it's just one thing out of many), pesticides, hormones, etc.

       Thank you very much, reading this really eases my anxiety about making food decisions once I move out of my parents house. Its actually the main reason I want to move out, I feel like the constant cereal, frozen pizzas and junk food my family insists on eating daily is making me so tired and sick. I can't wait to see how I feel after trying to actually consistently eat things that are good for me for the first time in my life.

       I've been trying to tell my fiance this for years. His family orders pizza every other day, his two brothers hardly touch veggies or fruit AT ALL, their "nice dinners" are hamburger helper and their "special treats" are snack cakes. On one hand he recognizes that those things like white bread, process cheese, kool-aid, microwave dinners, and the like really shouldn't have a place in your diet at all, much less be staples. But on the other hand it's all he knows, and it's very difficult to change. He thinks "I've been alive this whole time so obviously it's not that bad." even though he knows that he's sick, exhausted, and feels way older than his years, and there's an obvious reason right there.

       Dude, even the foremost "expert" around here on 9/11 being an inside job was tearing you a new one in that thread.

       You can't post a TIL that is based on conjecture and present it as fact.  I bet if you would have made the title "TIL that there are people who believe the twin towers were brought down by a nuclear reaction"  you would have seen a more positive outcome.

       Do you think that differently-worded post would have gained the "the jews did this" tag? Do you think it would have been hidden from searches?

       I say "expert" because while I don't agree with most of what he says, he knows more about it than anyone else that posts here.

       You may still have gotten that tag, and I don't think it would be hidden from searches.

       Does he know how the buildings were reduced to billowing, fluffy clouds of microscopic dust? Because I've been asking that question for two weeks now, and all I get back is personal attacks, mocking, changing the subject, and literally dozens of brigading shills, across subreddits.

       Suspicious as fuck, whether or not it's from somebody you, yourself consider an "authority" on the subject.

       Well that's what you normally get here when you say anything against the status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sheer force of those buildings coming down would be more than enough to pulverize the concrete.  I mean, I can do it with sledgehammer so to think it can't be done with hundreds of thousands of tons of metal and concrete seems weird to me.

       First, I doubt you can pulverize concrete to microscopic dust, 10-100 microns thick, with a sledghammer -- unless you're Thor, in which case.. Hi, Thor! Big Fan!

       I don't think you're grasping the amount of energy and force those buildings produced when they fell.

       everything would be pulverized.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, you can find/see things that were found (cell phones, wallets, etc...) that were found at a museum or online.  A quick google search will yield results.  Pics of the rubble will also show chunks of concrete, so that proves that not all of it was pulverized.

       Aren't most "organic" products still filled with lots of the same crap as everything else? I'm probably wrong but I feel like the whole "organic" "gluten free" thing is just a way to convince people they're eating healthy when in reality they're still getting most of the garbage. That's why I'm so confused honestly. I don't feel like there's a right choice and it scares me.
