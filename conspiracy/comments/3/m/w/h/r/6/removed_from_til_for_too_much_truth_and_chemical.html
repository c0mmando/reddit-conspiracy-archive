<p>Removed for &quot;politics,&quot; despite the fact that political posts are always on the front page there, including one on the CIA and Bin Laden right now. &quot;Pick and choose moderation.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed that TIL likes to remove anything that would educate Americans about our toxic environment. Here&#39;s another example:</p>

<p>TIL mods removed this for &quot;editorializing,&quot; despite the fact that I copy pasted the introductory paragraph into the title, from the New York Times. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3is9k0/til_the_safe_drinking_water_act_is_so_out_of_date/">TIL the Safe Drinking Water Act is so out of date that the water Americans drink can pose what scientists say are serious health risks â€” and still be legal. Only 91 contaminants are regulated by the Act, yet more than 60,000 chemicals are used within the United States, according to EPA estimates.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>In general the more processed the food, the more likely it is to have terrible things in it. This includes some stuff that&#39;s labeled &quot;organic&quot;, because there are quite a few bad things that don&#39;t factor into the difference between organic and non-organic. And there are organic brands who use the absolute minimum standards to get the organic label, but cut corners when they can to make their products similar in price to the non-organic alternative. When possible it&#39;s best to find brands that are more clearly committed to healthy and sustainable practices all around. </p>

<p>USDA organic does mean non-GMO, though they could be defining non-gmo in a loophole-ridden way, I don&#39;t know. There are many types of produce that are nearly all GMO if not organic (corn, soy), and there are other types which are really badly inundated with pesticides (apples, strawberries, lettuce and other greens come to mind). Local (and if possible organic) is preferable, there will be less chemicals in and on the produce and it will usually taste better. </p>

<p>Pesticides become a bigger worry with animal products, since the animals eat the pesticide-laden crops and therefore levels of those chemicals get really high in the meat and dairy products. I try to get organic butter, organic milk (and research the company - how do they feed their cows? vegetarian? organic? grass-fed? or do they not release the info?), organic or at least cage-free eggs from a trustworthy brand (I like Nellie&#39;s). I don&#39;t eat much meat, but we all know how problematic the meat industry is, so it&#39;s best to be careful there. Grass-fed beef tastes great.</p>

<p>EDIT: Sorry this is so long. I just wanted to offer you some helpful advice in case it&#39;s not practical for you to produce all your own food as a previous commenter suggested. And if you don&#39;t produce all your own food, you will have to trust someone at some point. It is scary when you consider that the majority of food in the grocery store is full of <em>possibly</em> safe food dyes, artificial flavors, preservatives, GMOs (I know some of us are not worried about that but it&#39;s just one thing out of many), pesticides, hormones, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you very much, reading this really eases my anxiety about making food decisions once I move out of my parents house. Its actually the main reason I want to move out, I feel like the constant cereal, frozen pizzas and junk food my family insists on eating daily is making me so tired and sick. I can&#39;t wait to see how I feel after trying to actually consistently eat things that are good for me for the first time in my life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been trying to tell my fiance this for years. His family orders pizza every other day, his two brothers hardly touch veggies or fruit AT ALL, their &quot;nice dinners&quot; are hamburger helper and their &quot;special treats&quot; are snack cakes. On one hand he recognizes that those things like white bread, process cheese, kool-aid, microwave dinners, and the like really shouldn&#39;t have a place in your diet at all, much less be staples. But on the other hand it&#39;s all he knows, and it&#39;s very difficult to change. He thinks &quot;I&#39;ve been alive this whole time so obviously it&#39;s not that bad.&quot; even though he knows that he&#39;s sick, exhausted, and feels way older than his years, and there&#39;s an obvious reason right there.</p>

<p>But, you can find/see things that were found (cell phones, wallets, etc...) that were found at a museum or online.  A quick google search will yield results.  Pics of the rubble will also show chunks of concrete, so that proves that not all of it was pulverized.</p>
