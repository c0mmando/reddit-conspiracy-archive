<h1>PART ONE:  THE RISE OF ISIS</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/03/us-isis-syria-iraq">The US and partners fueled the rise of ISIS</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The war on terror, that campaign without end launched 14 years ago by George Bush, is tying itself up in ever more grotesque contortions. On Monday the trial in London of a Swedish man, Bherlin Gildo, accused of terrorism in Syria, collapsed after it became clear British intelligence had been arming the same rebel groups the defendant was charged with supporting.
The prosecution abandoned the case, apparently to avoid embarrassing the intelligence services. The defence argued that going ahead with the trial would have been an “affront to justice” when there was plenty of evidence the British state was itself providing “extensive support” to the armed Syrian opposition.
That didn’t only include the “non-lethal assistance” boasted of by the government (including body armour and military vehicles), but training, logistical support and the secret supply of “arms on a massive scale”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>terrorism is now squarely in the eye of the beholder</strong>. And nowhere is that more so than in the Middle East, where <strong>today’s terrorists are tomorrow’s fighters against tyranny</strong> – and allies are enemies – often at the bewildering whim of a western policymaker’s conference call.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/world/middleeast/isis-many-in-iran-believe-is-an-american-invention.html">In Iran, that the US is behind ISIS is &quot;common knowledge&quot;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Iranians are as obsessed as Americans these days with the black-clad gangs roaming Iraq and Syria and killing Shiites and other “infidels” in the name of Sunni Islam. At the supermarket, in a shared taxi or at a family gathering, conversations often turn to the mysterious group, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and how it came to be.</p>

<p>And for most Iranians, the answer is obvious: the United States.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Come on, you know who has created ISIS,” said the supermarket owner, winking his right eye.</p></li>
<li><p>“Admit it,” demanded the taxi driver, hitting his steering wheel to make his point. “</p></li>
<li><p>It is so obvious!” concluded the talkative uncle at the birthday party.</p></li>
<li><p>ISIS, Iranian leaders have been saying for a long time, is made-in-the-U.S.A., a tool of terror intended by the world’s superpower to divide and conquer the energy-rich Middle East and to counter the growing influence of Iran in the region. “</p></li>
<li><p>We have evidence, we know,” he told an audience of clerics last week, without elaborating.</p></li>
<li><p>Ayatollah Khamenei reminded them that Al Qaeda — a creation of the Central Intelligence Agency, Iran has said — and the Taliban were, in the eyes of Iranian intelligence, devised by the West as a counterweight to Iran. “There is no doubt that these movements are created by Western powers and their regional agents,” Mr. Khamenei has insisted.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Information gets pitched like <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/60-syrian-fighters-trained-us-military-falling-short/story?id=32273598">this:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Defense Secretary Ash Carter made a shocking admission today about just how slowly the strategy against ISIS is unfolding, saying that the U.S. is currently training only 60 Syrian fighters to combat ISIS.</p>

<p>When the strategy to defeat ISIS inside Syria was announced last year the Pentagon said it aimed to train 5,000 moderate Syrian rebels per year over three years. No Syrian forces have yet to graduate from any training program.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/price-for-syrian-rebels-4-million-each-119858#ixzz3n3rPje7N">this:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>How much has the United States spent to train that whopping force of 60 Syrian rebels to take on the Islamic State? Well, according to basic math, about $4 million for each of them. POLITICO has learned that of the $500 million requested last year for the train-and-equip program, roughly half has been spent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the truth is the US spent $500 million actually training ~5,000 soldiers, all but 60 of whom &quot;joined ISIS&quot;. 99% is a pretty high defection rate, wouldn&#39;t you think? Who was in charge of picking and incentivizing those guys? This is brushed off as gross incompetence, but seriously? This coupled with various reports that ISIS is a tool of western powers, and those 4,940 defections don&#39;t seem so &#39;accidental&#39;.</p>

<h1></h1>

<h1>SYRIA: &quot;REBEL GROUPS&quot;/TERRORISTS</h1>

<p>After a little digging, it looks like there are only 2 true &quot;Rebel&quot; groups in Syria (Jaysh al-Mujahaideen and Faylaq al-Sham). </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/XfQSnmc.jpg">The rest are backed by the US/&quot;Western powers&quot;.</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>Being a front man for a fabricated war is a job <a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-09-22/obama-s-islamic-state-war-czar-stepping-down">no one really wants</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>President Barack Obama is about to lose the man he hand-picked to build the war effort against the Islamic State. Retired General John Allen will be stepping down as envoy to the global coalition this fall, and the White House is searching for a replacement to be the face of America’s flailing effort to destroy the jihadist group in Syria and Iraq.</p>

<p>The timing of Allen’s departure could not be worse for the Obama administration. The incoming Marine Corps Commandant, Lieutenant General Robert Neller, testified last month that the war is at a “stalemate.” Last week, the head of the U.S. Central Command, General Lloyd Austin, testified that of the 54 Syrian rebels trained and equipped by the U.S. military, only “4 or 5” were still in the fight. And now the Pentagon is investigating allegations by <strong>dozens of intelligence analysts that their reporting on the progress in the war effort was altered before being given to top officials</strong>.</p>

<hr/>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2015/09/27/U-S-support-for-Syria-rebels-illegal-Putin-says-ahead-of-Obama-meeting.html">Putin is calling this stuff out openly.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday branded U.S. support for rebel forces in Syria as illegal and ineffective, saying U.S.-trained rebels were leaving to join Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) with weapons supplied by Washington. In my opinion, provision of military support to illegal structures runs counter to the principles of modern international law and the United Nations Charter, he said in an excerpt of an interview with U.S. television networks CBS and PBS released by the Kremlin. Putin also said he was seeking partners to set up a coordinated framework to fight the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. We have proposed to cooperate with the countries in the region. We are trying to establish some kind of coordinated framework, Putin said in the interview with CBS. We would welcome a common platform for collective action against the terrorists, he said. Putin said he had personally informed the kings of Saudi Arabia and Jordan of his plan and that he had also informed the United States.</p>

<hr/>
</blockquote>

<p>Things just got fucked with Putin calling the bluff and having Russia show up to start launching airstrikes on ISIS, with or without US coordination. It&#39;s getting real messy there, and Putin has a major stake in the game with Russia&#39;s port there. The addition of advanced <a href="http://breakingdefense.com/2015/09/russians-in-syria-building-a2ad-bubble-over-region-breedlove/">anti-aircraft weapons,</a> given that ISIS has no real airforce to speak of, is certainly curious.  </p>

<p>So... Russia will start bombing the people we are there ostensibly to fight, but aren&#39;t really. </p>

<p>... People we are giving weapons to, so they will depose Assad. Things will get interesting when/if Russian troops are involved in killing anti-Assad &quot;rebel forces&quot;. Things will get even more interesting if Assad <a href="http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/if-assad-asks-china-can-deploy-troops-to-syria/">accepts China&#39;s offer of troops and equipment.</a></p>

<p><strong>09/30 Update:</strong>  Things just got interesting.

<blockquote>
<p>Uniformed Russian soldiers are now guarding checkpoints on roads around three military bases on the Syrian Mediterranean coast as Moscow plans its first attacks on the enemies of President Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<p>Russian drones – more than half flown by Russian ground controllers inside Syria – are now flying regularly over Palmyra, which may be the first Islamist target to be attacked, according to Syrian military sources. The Syrian army is reporting a vastly improved intelligence capability around the old Roman city, captured by Isis in May and used as an execution yard for civilians and captured government soldiers. Drones are being flown at night over the Isis-controlled deserts of eastern Syria.</p>

<hr/>
</blockquote>

<p>Funding rebel groups is how nuclear armed states wage war in the present day. You won&#39;t see the funds utilized for supporting rebel groups in any GAO report.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The US government and Western Partners, in an effort to overthrow Assad, are &quot;allowing&quot; &quot;rebel groups&quot; they are supporting, to facilitate a massive drug trade out of Afghanistan. Precedent exists. The Iran Contra scandal (remember Gary Webb, and his double-tap &#39;suicide&#39;?) is a prior example of this type of thing taking place.</p></li>
<li><p>Countries currently approved for legal opium trade on the global market have a financial incentive to prevent Afghanistan&#39;s massive opium output from being certified for the legal market. That legal market consists of the companies who are approved to produce morphine and other opium based products such as oxycodone. Some of those countries just happen to be aligned with us in our mission in Afghanistan. Coincidence?</p></li>

<h1>PART FOUR: WAR!!!!!!!!!!  </h1>

<p>Syria right now has all the pieces in place to kick off WWIII if things go sideways. Why do I say that?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What was the cold war about? US vs. Russia/USSR on the world stage, and the imminent threat of MAD/mutually assured destruction. Has that threat been negated by current anti-ballistic counter measures including lasers and other? Potentially... Enough to openly pick fights with Russia?</p></li>
<li><p>Also, while the US is not &quot;on the ground&quot; in Syria other than through Special Forces, we are flying bombing runs in support of YPG and other US backed groups. If Russia is also flying bombing runs in Syria, but the US is not coordinating with Russia (and so far, we are not and maintain we will not), the risk of &quot;accidents&quot; is great. Because things are already so chaotic, there is greater chance of dynamics spiraling out of control. Russia is also bringing in advanced weapons for a ground war in terms of tanks and more, and not manning those systems openly, but is providing training and expertise.</p></li>
<li><p>The West is trying to remove Assad with F-22s and B-2 bombers acting as an airforce for a mercenary army disguised as &quot;rebels&quot; and &quot;terrorists&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Syria is a battle ground that Russia is gearing up to fight in, against the US/UK/Israel/Saudi Arabia/Turkey partnership, by backing Assad and increasing that support. Russia is now providing Assad with the means to counter and shoot down those same bombers, ostensibly to fight &quot;ISIS&quot;, which has no Air Force. Those advanced AA systems will be manned by Russian troops in Syria.</p></li>
<li><p>China has openly declared they will pull in troops/equipment to support Assad if they are asked.</p></li>
<li><p>Japan <em>just</em> changed their constitution to allow military aggression (vs. defense only) for the first time since WWII ended.</p></li>

<blockquote>
<p>President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin clashed publicly Monday over their divergent positions on some of the world&#39;s great crises, with Obama suggesting that Putin&#39;s involvement in Syria and Ukraine was harmful to international order and risks greater global instability.</p>

<p>&quot;... We see some major powers assert themselves in ways that contravene international law,&quot; Obama said at the annual meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations. &quot;We see an erosion of the democratic principles and human rights that are fundamental to this institution&#39;s mission.&quot;</p>

<p>In speeches on the same day, Obama and Putin chastised each other for their handling of the Syrian crisis. &quot;Nowhere is our commitment to international order more tested than in Syria. When a dictator slaughters tens of thousands of his own people, that is not just a matter of one nation&#39;s internal affairs,&quot; Obama said.</p>

<p>Putin, who spoke at the U.N. podium a couple of hours later, accused the United States of fostering violence in the Middle East. &quot;The export of revolutions, this time so-called democratic ones, Putin said, has resulted in violence and social disaster instead of democratic advances.</p>

<p><strong>I cannot help asking those who have forced this situation, do you realize now what you have done?</strong> Putin said in remarks that never mentioned, but were clearly directed at, the United States.</p>

<p>Putin  here for the first time in a decade  called for Western cooperation in supporting Assad, saying it was &quot;an enormous mistake&quot; and a violation of international law to try to oust him given the fact that Assad&#39;s military forces were best prepared to defeat the Islamic State.</p>

<p>The tensions between the United States and Russia were obvious Sunday, when Putin labeled U.S. support for rebels in Syria as illegal and mocked as ineffective a U.S. program that has been unable to train and arm rebels.</p>

<p><strong>Russia also just signed an intelligence-sharing agreement with Iraq, Iran and Syria aimed at countering the Islamic State, a pact that was negotiated without American involvement.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Putin called on the West to drop its demand and focus instead on fighting Islamic State, the militant group that has made major gains in Syria and Iraq.</p>

<p>&quot;We think it is an enormous mistake to not cooperate with the Syrian government,&quot; Putin said.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;We should finally acknowledge that no one but President Assad&#39;s armed forces and Kurdish militias are truly fighting the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations in Syria.&quot;</strong></p>

<h1>PART TWO: AFGHANISTAN</h1>

<p>In around March of 2001, the Taliban declared opium production to be &quot;un-Islamic&quot;. Within months, they completely, almost 100%, eradicated illegal opium production in Afghanistan, cutting off the world&#39;s pipeline for illegal opium/heroin. In late 2001, 9/11 hapened, and the UK and the US launched &quot;Operation Enduring Freedom&quot;, and invaded Afghanistan. In short months, opium production was back up to expected levels, and has climbed steadily up since, except for a bad crop year in ~2010.</p>

<p>So yeah, in the middle of war zone, in a region where the US has its main air base, and is launching predator drone fired missiles at every rabbit that blinks too fast, somehow illegal opium production and global distribution has gone through the fucking roof.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/KNNSC9s.jpg">Afghanistan Opium Cultivation</a></p>

<p>So, if not so accidental, is the opium fueled great jihad against the US and Western World really a thing? If those opium sales fuel our black budgets, which accomplish regional goals such as breaking down national borders in resource rich countries, deposing Assad to install a regime more friendly to the West, etc, and we protect that trade to make sure it both continues and grows, it&#39;s hard to agree with any statement that the US government is genuinely against any of this. In fact, there appears to be tacit support for it. </p>

<p>In NATO terms, they call it &quot;protecting the civilian population&quot;. But, guess what? If the civilian population spends their whole day harvesting and selling opium, that means NATO/US troops are guarding and protecting the illegal cultivation and sale of opium. You can call it whatever the hell you want. &quot;America&#39;s Civilian Sphere of Invulnerability&quot; sounds good too. But, if at the end of the day, you are protecting the people who are enacting an enormous illegal global drug trade, you are actively protecting that global trade as well... backed up by our modern weapons and ultimate threat of nuclear destruction. </p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://canadafreepress.com/article/12707">http://canadafreepress.com/article/12707</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Marines of Bravo’s Company 1st Platoon sleep beside groves of poppies Troops of the 2nd Platoon walk through the fields on strict orders not to swat the heavy opium bulbs. The Afghan farmers and laborers, who are engaged in scraping the resin from the bulbs, smile and wave at the passing soldiers.</p>

<p>The poppies fuel the great jihad against the United States and the Western world. More than 3,500 tons of raw opium is gleaned from the poppy crops every year, producing annual revenues for the Taliban and al Qaeda that range from $5 billion to $16 billion.</p>

<p>Destroying the fields could very well put an end to terrorist activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
But the Obama Administration remains intent upon protecting the poppies so that the Afghan farmers and local drug lords can reap the benefits of what purports to be a bumper crop.</p>

<p>Many Marines in the field are scratching their heads over the situation.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>All of this is going on. &quot;Protecting the civilian population&quot; is a thing.</p>

<p>Those opium Sales help fund &quot;rebel groups&quot;... who receive weapons and training from US Special Forces and other groups. Those rebel groups then destabilize regions, and do things like, try to depose Assad. They cast regions into civil wars, such as Sudan, Central Africa, Yemen, Libya, Darfur, Nigeria, Somalia, Turkey, etc. The money for such activities are paid for under classified black budgets, but it&#39;s up to your imagination where the funding for those budgets comes from. </p>

<p>One thing for sure, the US knows business. Again, illegal opium production and sales are climbing nearly every year since the US occupation began.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.rt.com/usa/afghanistan-us-drug-trafficking/">http://www.rt.com/usa/afghanistan-us-drug-trafficking/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The US is not going to stop the production of drugs in Afghanistan as it covers the costs of their military presence there, says Gen. Mahmut Gareev, a former commander during the USSR&#39;s operations in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><strong>RT: They mention decisive movements, quick actions and a large army presence but that is exactly what the US and the coalition forces did and they are still failing to accomplish their task, they are still stuck in the same battles that the Soviet troops were stuck in. Whats the difference, what is their mistake?</strong></p>

<p>M.G.: Theyre repeating our mistake. At the moment, the number of American, British and other troops in Afghanistan is almost equal to what we had in the 40th division, which is about 100 thousand. 42 countries are involved. But they&#39;re having great difficulties in solving problems. NATO forces are very difficult to manage. Six months ago they made a decision to move one squadron from the north of Afghanistan to the south where the British troops are stationed. It was discussed in Bundestag. Half a year later  the decision has been made, but the squadron still remains where they were before. </p>

<p>Actually, <strong>they themselves admit that if drugs were smuggled past them, they wouldnt interfere. Why?</strong> Thats another tough question. Now, what if Russia was to act selfishly and play in geopolitics  just like our opponents are used to doing? They got us involved in the war in Afghanistan and immediately began to provide help for those rebels, the Mujahideen. We could do the same now  we could support the rebels and fight against Americans. But its not even in our peoples minds. No one is going to do that.</p>

<p>When I was there in 1989 and 1990, the production of drugs almost ceased, apart from in certain areas. Since then, it has increased by 44 per cent. And all of the drug traffic goes through the city of Osh where we want to establish our base, Termes or other places.</p>

<p>90 per cent of drugs from Afghanistan go to former Soviet republics. 80 per cent of the worlds drugs are produced in Afghanistan. Theyve outdone the South American countries, such as Columbia. Thirty thousand young people in Russia die from drug use every year. And, sadly, some of the leaders of the CIS countries dont really want to interfere. In other words, there are too many people who make money on this.</p>

<p>I dont make anything up. <strong>Americans themselves admit that drugs are often transported out of Afghanistan on American planes. Drug trafficking in Afghanistan brings them about 50 billion dollars a year  which fully covers the expenses tied to keeping their troops there. Essentially, they are not going to interfere and stop the production of drugs. They engage in military action only when they are attacked. They dont have any planned military action to eliminate the Mujahideen.</strong> Rather, they want to make the situation more unstable and help the Taliban to be more active. They even started negotiations with them, trying to direct them to the Central-Asian republics, to destabilize the whole region and set up their bases there.</p>

<p>One would think  right now, Russia is interested in cooperation with America. During Obamas visit, there was talk about providing air and ground corridors for Americans to supply their troops in Afghanistan. And <strong>some journalists even say now that its good for Russia that Americans are in Afghanistan; that we need to help them because they are there to restrain the Mujahideen and keep them from attacking us. Thats right, its just that the problem is that they dont do anything of the kind.</strong></p>

<p>A new article reported that 3,500 Uyghurs are settling in a village near Jisr-al Shagour that was just taken from Assad, close to the stronghold of Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP) that is in the Turkey-backed Army of Conquest. They are allegedly under the supervision of Turkish intelligence that has been accused of supplying fake passports to recruit Chinese Uyghurs to wage jihad in Syria.</p>

<p>The news comes on the heels of TIP capturing a Syrian airbase and acquiring MIG fighter jets as well as other advanced weaponry, similar to ISIS capturing Iraqi armys advanced US weaponry.</p>

<p>It also comes on the heels of the Bangkok bombing at the shrine frequented by Chinese tourists, with Thai authorities now drawing a link to Uyghurs and the same gang that attacked the Thai Consulate in Turkey in reference to Turkeys Grey Wolves.</p>

<p>This seems to corroborate IHS Janes analyst Anthony Daviss assessment that Grey Wolves are the likely culprit, given their anti-Chinese protests and violent demonstration back in July.</p>

<p>Through Turkeys support for the Army of Conquest (named as a &quot;Rebel&quot; group on the Syria map), TIP has risen to prominence within the anti-Assad coalition (US and friends) and played a key role in defeating the Syrian army at Jisr al Shughour earlier this year.</p>

<p>The most prominent TIP fighter to emerge from the Jisr al Shughur videos was the spokesman for TIPs Syria branch since 2014, Abu Ridha al-Turkistani. In the videos he led fighters to take over a building, and climbed a clock tower to plant a black-and-white Jabhat al Nusra (named as a &quot;Rebel&quot; group on the Syria map) style flag on which Turkistan Islamic Party was written in Arabic.</p>

<p>These Uyghur militants have claimed a series of high-profile terrorists attacks in China in 2013 and 2014, with some Uyghurs calling for anintifada against the Chinese communist regime.</p>

<p>Now that TIP has established a base in Syria and is expanding its presence and recruitment courtesy of its Turkish sponsors, China will have to follow through with its 2013 recommendation Take fight to ETIM before threat grows and deploy troops to Syria.</p>

<p>Non-interference does not mean inaction on core interests</p>

<p>Some pundits may point to Chinas non-interference principle as an impasse to action. However, Chinas non-interference principle is more in reference to meddling in other countries domestics politics, such as US/western penchant for intervention and violating other countries sovereignty to overthrow autocratic regimes they dislike. Non-interference policy does not mean inaction when Chinas security and interests are threatened.</p>

<p>It is not difficult for China to take action when its core interests are threatened that means violation of its sovereignty, territorial integrity, economic development and regime survival.</p>

<p>At the 2011 IISS Asia Security Summit, Chinese Defense Minister Liang Guanglie spelled out Chinas core interests as the following: The core interests include anything related to sovereignty, stability and form of government. China is now pursuing socialism. If there is any attempt to reject this path, it will touch upon Chinas core interests. Or, if there is any attempt to encourage any part of China to secede, that also touches upon Chinas core interests related to our land, sea or air. Then, anything that is related to Chinas national economic and social development also touches upon China core interests.</p>

<p>If the TIP continues to gain power within the Army of Conquest that is a jihadi witches brew of various al Qaeda affiliates and salafist extremists, <strong>Xinjiang, CHINA may become the next Afghanistan and follow the pattern of Afpak, Syria/Iraq, with local militant forces/cross border havens attracting foreign fighters, and enjoying material and diplomatic support from Turkey and other outside powers</strong> with shared ideology/interests.</p>

<p><strong>Moreover, the Assad regime is currently still the legal and UN-recognized government of Syria, despite only holding 1/3 of its territory. If Assad asks and gives permission for Russia, China and other SCO members to assist him militarily, that would be in accordance with international law.</strong></p>

<p><strong>This differs from the current US-led anti-ISIS coalition airstrikes in Syria that is neither operating under a UN mandate nor permission from the sovereign government</strong>, although it enjoys implicit permission to some extent from the Assad regime to fight ISIS. In 2014 Britains David Cameron hesitated to participate in Syrian airstrikes precisely due to fears of violating international law.</p>

<p><em>Turkeys proxy war with China</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>With Erdogan waging an Islamist proxy waron 1) China, 2) Kurds, 3) Assad, 4) Sisi, and 5) Netanyahuvia Al Qaeda affiliates, Army of Conquest, Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, it is no wonder Syria and Egypt both applied to join the China-led SCO in June this year.</p>

<p>Thus Syria and China both share threats from the Army of Conquest that is attacking Assad and Chinas Xinjiang. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Translation: via &quot;Rebels&quot; and &quot;Terrorists&quot; controlled by Turkey primarily as the point of contact, western powers have begun a soft invasion of China, with the intention of turning Xinjiang, China into another &quot;Afghanistan&quot;. Imagine the US reaction if China was spending money and sending weapons to Mexican gangs so they would and could turn Texas into &quot;Afghanistan&quot;. Just, take a second, and imagine the US reaction. 
...
China won&#39;t give a fuck how ignorant the US masses are about actual US foreign policy.</strong> </p>

<h1>PART THREE: GLOBAL TRADE</h1>

<p>Controlling the source of production isn&#39;t enough. You&#39;d have to protect trade routes as well. The CIA World Factbook names Uzbekistan as just such a place, and says something similar about Turkmenistan. In both cases, you can find, &quot;transit country for Afghan narcotics bound for Russian and Western European markets; transit point for heroin precursor chemicals bound for Afghanistan&quot;</p>

<p>Ok.. search for Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and, hmmm... <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/turkmenistan-secret-u-s-base-for-afghanistan-iraq-iran-campaigns/20411">what is this?</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>U.S. freight transited through Ashgabat is in fact military in nature and even constitutes criminal contraband. Airport employees claim they saw armored vehicles, combat helicopters and crates of ammunition. These reports challenge both the notion of Turkmen neutrality and the supposed nature of the bilateral agreement between Turkmenistan and the U.S.</p></li>
<li><p>The U.S. has gained access to use almost all the military airfields of Turkmenistan, including the airport in Nebit-Dag near the Iranian border, which was reconstructed at American expense. In September 2004, at the Mary-2 airfield, U.S. military experts appeared and began reconstructing the facility with the help of Arab construction companies, which provoked the protest of Moscow .</p></li>
<li><p>Prudnikov claims to have reports that the transport of drugs from Afghanistan and the transport of prisoners to the secret prisons maintained by the U.S. in Eastern Europe were coming through these transit points in Turkmenistan.</p></li>
<li><p>An American military contingent is located in Ashgabat to oversee the operations related to refueling of military airplanes. NATO is also trying to open up a land corridor to bring freight by road and rail .</p></li>
<li><p>As EurasiaNet has reported about payments the U.S. made to Turkmenistan to use its airspace in violation of normal procedures, the Central Asian regional press has begun to ask questions about the U.S. relationship with the Central Asian countries assisting the Northern Distribution Network, and stories are beginning to surface that indicate more questions need to be asked.</p></li>
<li><p>In a special report in Russian for the Turkmen exile website gundogar.org, Viktor Prudnikov questions whether the Turkmen governments arrangement with the U.S. to allow goods to be transited across its territory to support troops in Afghanistan has in fact violated Turkmenistans much-publicized position of neutrality. Prudnikov is not identified on the website, but he appears to be the same retired army general and commander-in-chief of the Russian Air-Defense Forces who used to be in charge of relations with other CIS countries.</p></li>
<li><p>Prudnikov rightly asks whether the U.S. government has taken advantage of the fact that Turkmenistan is a closed and autocratic society to quietly get away with shipping more than just humanitarian goods to Afghanistan. He also cites reports of incidents involving U.S. planes flying from Afghanistan to Turkmenistan without dispatchers permission .</p></li>
<li><p>Americans quickly realized [that Turkmenistan creates] ideal conditions to conduct business in Central Asia for the sake of the war in Afghanistan.</p></li>

<p><a href="http://www.eurasianet.org/node/72761">also...</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The head of U.S. Central Command, General Lloyd Austin, testified before Congress this week and gave CENTCOM&#39;s annual &quot;posture statement,&quot; which includes rare public pronouncements of the U.S.&#39;s official military policy toward Central Asia. This year probably the most newsworthy statement was about Turkmenistan.</p>

<p>Austin also pointed to the growing military relationship with Uzbekistan, highlighted by the decision to give more than 300 armored vehicles to the country&#39;s armed forces. &quot;The U.S. military relationship with Uzbekistan has strengthened considerably over the past year,&quot; Austin testified. &quot;And, expanded U.S. Special Forces training will further improve the Uzbek militarys capacity to meet security challenges.&quot; </p>

<p>The U.S. military relationship with Uzbekistan has strengthened considerably over the past year with implementation of the first year of the five-year Plan for Military and Military Technical Cooperation. Mutual interests related to improving border security, CT, counter-narcotics, and countering the return of Uzbek fighters from Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, underpin our relationship. The provision of Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles through the Excess Defense Articles program improved protection provided to Uzbek security forces. And, expanded U.S. Special Forces training will further improve the Uzbek militarys capacity to meet security challenges. Uzbekistan remains committed to ensuring regional stability via continued support for our operations in Afghanistan by providing access to the Northern Distribution Network (NDN). </p>

<p>Meanwhile, there are very real ramifications.</p>

<p><a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/9/26/heroin-addiction-record-high.html">US sets record high for opioid abuse</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I prostituted my body and slept with anybody, anything to get what I needed to get high,” said Mary Woodward, candidly acknowledging the extent of her problem, as Kristian Cristello looked on.</p>

<p>“I would literally beg, borrow, and steal just get the money, manipulating people that I cared about … just to get the money to feed my addiction,” said the third inmate, Krystle Lightner. “I regret choosing heroin over my children. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Michigan doctor who prosecutors allege got at least two patients addicted to prescription drugs and then demanded they have sex with him to get refills, faces at least 5 years in prison when he is sentenced Wednesday.</p>

<p>Dr. John Verbovsky, 67, was originally charged with 14 criminal counts, including rape. But in a plea agreement reached earlier this month, he pleaded guilty to one count of running a criminal enterprise, two counts of medical fraud and two counts of criminal sexual conduct in the fourth degree, an admission that he coerced two of his women patients into having sex. Those crimes are five-year, 15-year and 20-year felonies.
Verbovsky, an osteopath, ran the Progressive Family Medicine clinic in Sterling Heights, and the Stout Family Medicine clinic in Detroit.</p>

<p>Investigators say he prescribed highly addictive drugs to at least two of his patients -- and perhaps more -- and that once they became dependent upon the drugs, he demanded sexual acts and money in exchange for new prescriptions. He wrote prescriptions for pain medications, prosecutors said, without proof of a medical condition.</p>

<p>When investigators raided his office and confiscated his computers, they found one image of a woman, on her knees, bound and gagged.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The rate of fatal overdoses quadrupled since 2000. Moreover, the number of Americans who said they’d used the drug in the last year went up by 65 percent; that means more than half a million people in the U.S. take heroin.</p>

<p>Notably, heroin use has been climbing among all demographic groups, including women, non-Hispanic whites, and the more affluent. Still, the growth in addiction has been most pronounced among white males between 18 and 25 years old.</p>

<p>“The heroin crisis we’re dealing with today is affecting suburbs and rural areas. It’s much more severe,” he added. “The worst drug epidemic in United States history.”</p>

<p>A massive surge in consumption of prescription painkillers took place between 1999 and 2010, as pharmaceutical sales for a wide range of synthetic opiates quadrupled.</p>

<p>Four out of five heroin addicts were previously hooked on another opioid substance. Prescription painkiller addicts are 40 times more likely than the general population to become addicted to heroin.</p>

<p>On the one hand, American doctors write over 250 million legal painkiller prescriptions per year, while
the illegal heroin industry is said to be worth $27 billion nationally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nationally. 27 Billion in <em>just</em> the US. MOST of Afghanistan&#39;s opium is going to Russia, and the EU. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the NSA was worth one shit it could document the creation of ISIS and all of they people involved. Then a Special Prosecutor should direct their arrests, including Joint Chiefs, up to and including the President and other officials, for treason, international law violations, war crimes, and conspiracy. While they&#39;re at it arrest those, including the prior administrations for the multiple violations of The Constitution effectively staging a coupe against We the People.  The creeps foreign and domestic who planned and executed the blowing up of the Twin Towers, caught. Finally public executions and severe sentences for the lot, including many high flying executives. There should also be mass arrests for foreign lobbyists as well, the banning of them from access to power, the reversal of Citizens United and other nefarious laws. Arrests should include Supreme Court Justices and underlings. Tight controls and in most cases banning of NGO&#39;s. Severe restrictions on tax exempt status and financial punishments for all tax cheats, especially international corporations. Reinstitute tariffs, rebuild infrastructure and make available honest work at wages that support a quality of life. Kick the United Nations out and dissolve all Agenda 21/2030 operations. This would be a good start.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is what is motivating him to constantly maneuver to preserve his power over the government and the parliament. Setting up a shadow government is one such method he has come up with.</p>

<p>He has increased the number of substantial directorates of the presidency from four to 13. New units include internal security, foreign relations, economy, defense, energy and investment monitoring. Previously there were only the directorates of administrative and financial affairs, institutional communications, information technology and human resources. The president, whose main function was to approve draft bills, used to sit around the table with his advisers and ask for their opinions.</p>

<p>Erdogan made the changes not through a usual procedural arrangement, but by resorting to a confidential decree. Article 107 of the current 1982 Constitution allows the president to manage the “General Secretariat of the Presidency.” This revision decree, which was not subject to judicial approval, was issued at a time when there was a heated debate raging on how the 1,150 rooms of the White Palace would be used. The new system crafted by Erdogan will function as a “big brother” and the Cabinet ministers will feel the presidency looking over their shoulders.</p>

<p>According to a report in the daily Hurriyet, Erdogan, with the Directorate of Internal Security, will monitor the fight against the members of the Fethullah Gulen faith community who have penetrated the state ranks and follow up the peace process with the Kurds.</p>

<p>With the Foreign Relations Directorate, Erdogan will keep tabs on foreign policy. This department will be under Deputy Secretary-General of the Presidency Ibrahim Kalin.</p>

<p>The Economy Directorate will keep an eye on the economy, while the Defense Directorate will be responsible for defense affairs, defense contracts and military issues. The Energy Directorate will be busy with mines, energy issues, oil and natural gas pipelines. The Investment Monitoring Directorate will focus on Erdogan’s favorite projects, such as bridges, roads and airports. All departments will monitor the work of the respective Cabinet ministries and report to the president.</p>
