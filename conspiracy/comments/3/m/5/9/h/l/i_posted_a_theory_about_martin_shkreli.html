<p>Something is up with <a href="/r/leagueoflegends">/r/leagueoflegends</a> censoring stories about Martin Shkreli&#39;s ownership of a low-key but top-tier amateur League Championship Series (LCS) team that lost its chance into the league by 2 games. Within weeks the team Martin lost to dissolves and is sold to a mysterious buyer. Mods have ignored my repeated requests for help reformatting my post to fit their subreddit guidelines. <a href="/r/Leagueofmeta">/r/Leagueofmeta</a> was created to discuss removed posts but they have also refused to acknowledge it. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, am I looking too hard or is something about this fishy? The only reasoning I could find behind their logic seemed flimsy:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueOfMeta/comments/3lrfr5/could_we_get_a_ruling_on_tuning_ceo_posts/cv8owr0">https://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueOfMeta/comments/3lrfr5/could_we_get_a_ruling_on_tuning_ceo_posts/cv8owr0</a></p>

<p>My &quot;removed&quot; <a href="/r/leagueoflegends">/r/leagueoflegends</a> post:</p>

<p>&quot;Martin Shkreli, currently infamous for an ongoing price gouging scandal over an AIDS symptom management drug, could be the new shadow owner for the now defunct Team8. Martin used to hang around this subreddit before the season started and chatted with random users about his seemingly random interest in getting himself into the LCS. Martin spoke openly about gutting his first pharmaceutical company as a teenager. Clearly entrepreneurial if nothing else.</p>

<p>Here is where things get interesting. Take a step back and think big picture. What young pharmaceutical CEO jumps from pushing overpriced pills to owning a video game franchise? My speculation is that Martin is actually a step ahead of us. From my brief, anecdotal, unprovable conversations with him before he got famous he came off as very mechanical but very gifted. Martin looks at systems and finds legal loopholes he can abuse to make a large sum of wealth very quickly. That&#39;s why he is the only pharmaceutical CEO on earth to care about owning an LCS a team on the side. Martin probably sees how without a players union and poor transparency/oversight from Riot he can get away with murder just like he did with the AIDS drug.</p>

<p>This is a guy who gamed Hillary Clinton into pushing generic drug pricing reform on twitter which caused biotech prices to plummet 20%. Martin probably made a fortune overnight. The feeling you get of him holding back his words in interview might be because he is Bond-villain status 10 steps ahead of us and just doing what he&#39;s done since he was a teenager: hustle to make bank.</p>

<p>Given Martin&#39;s history it&#39;s an odd coincide that his low key amateur team came 2 games from relegating Team8 and weeks later Team8 dissolves and is sold to a mysterious buyer. A guy like Martin would love the sweet irony of buying out his competitor, gutting them and abusing Rito&#39;s poor oversight to simply put in his players. Either Martin is an idiot or a masterful troll. Mainstream reporters are empirically horrible at finding esports dirt so time will tell. Also, take a step back. What other pharm CEO in the entire world has owned such a varied portfolio at such a young age? Bids for team slots were $1.2mil at the seasons start but have devalued to $500k. Keep your eyes peeled.</p>

<p>At the very least, keep an eye on this guy, pull up a chair and popcorn and enjoy the fireworks. I called Martin short selling 17 hours ago, and I called the Lewis meltdown a year in advance from talking to him on reddit as well. People get lazy here, but folks, always remember, the Internet never forgets.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Martin is smart. He might be up to something bigger than meets the eye.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong></p>

<p>A) <a href="http://imgur.com/CI1X4xj">http://imgur.com/CI1X4xj</a></p>

<p>B) <a href="http://imgur.com/923c8BK">http://imgur.com/923c8BK</a></p>

<p>Shouldn&#39;t a gag order on Martin be open to the public? Why did Chris Badawi get a pass and when did that policy change? That seems like the opposite of transparency.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/R6oQkAR">http://imgur.com/R6oQkAR</a></p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3:</strong> Mods refuse open discussion about censorship on <a href="/r/leagueoflegends">/r/leagueoflegends</a> but are more than willing to come here to drop insults out of the public&#39;s eye. <a href="/u/ReganDryke">/u/ReganDryke</a>, if you&#39;re really so comfortable opening your Martin gag to the public post it on the front page right now.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 4:</strong> Perhaps mod censorship is less a case of conspiracy and more a case of rigidly following poorly thought out rules. I didn&#39;t even have the intention of arguing with <a href="/r/leagueoflegends">/r/leagueoflegends</a> mods until they sandbagged my post and actively ignored me. Their argument is until we have 100% proof that Martin is involved we are not allowed to publicly speculate. Verdict: the mods&#39; logic is consistent, it just happens to be based on a childishly flawed premise.</p>

<p>However, my point about Martin stands. Why was Team8&#39;s spot dissolved and purchased silently? When was the last time that has happened in the history of the NALCS? Usually acquisitions are public so they can immediately begin plugging sponsors. Aberrant behavior is always at least worth a discussion.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 5:</strong> <a href="/r/leagueoflegends">/r/leagueoflegends</a> mods <a href="/u/ReganDryke">/u/ReganDryke</a> and <a href="/u/picflute">/u/picflute</a> still dicks, sky is blue, grass is green, study reports.</p>

<p>All joking aside, this guy is a really good example of how rich people think. His attitude isn&#39;t any different from any of his fellow 0.01% friends.
The only real difference here is how open he is about it. Most of them would hide behind a team of &quot;spokespeople&quot; and use spin teams to conceal their naked greed.</p>

<p><em>Shkreli is being unusually honest... and that&#39;s kind of weird</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, yesterday it comes out that he shorted his own stock or something like that. Apparently he made all those douchebag comments to make sure there was a shitstorm and then played it for his own financial benefit.</p>

<p>So, calculating and manipulative. He&#39;s also got a pretty good understanding of how people react... and how to push their buttons.</p>

<p>Well played young Shkreli, <a href="http://i1273.photobucket.com/albums/y418/karasakal_teach/StarWarsEpisodeI-ThePhantomMenacemp4_snapshot_020600_20150123_201054_zps6673950f.jpg">we will watch your career with great interest</a></p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but wonder how he got to where he is this fast. Don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s because he&#39;s so smart either. He must have had some connections.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a random internet guy talking on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> so obviously you can take what I say with a big grain of salt.</p>

<p>THAT SAID, I really did have a discussion with Martin about his aspirations to acquire a team before the season started. I&#39;m trying hard not to doxx myself but picking up on implicitly encoded secondary language and predicting it&#39;s meaning is what I get paid for. I called the Richard Lewis meltdown a year before it happened because he tried to doxx me for disagreeing with him like he did to the kid with suicidal ideations and I instantly deleted that account.</p>

<p>Check Martin&#39;s wiki page. He&#39;s been hustling from a very young age and has a clear pattern in his behaviors. I respect your ability to think critically and decide for yourself.</p>

<p>Knock on wood, life is good. Cheers!</p>

<p>Our reasoning about the Martin Shkreli story is public and you can find it <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/LeagueOfMeta/comments/3lrfr5/could_we_get_a_ruling_on_tuning_ceo_posts/">here</a></p>

<p>For the people too lazy to follow the link we enforce strict policy that every content linked on the subreddit must be linked directly to LoL/LoL fandom/LoL esport scene. Scandal in the pharmaceutical industry aren&#39;t related to League of Legends.</p>

<p>We allowed a discussion on the subject <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3lt02r/controversy_around_team_imagine_chairman/">here</a> because the discussion was oriented about League esports scene. Other discussion on the subject will be considered a repost (as per defined by the rules) and removed.</p>

<p>Next time you have that kind of issue you can ask us what&#39;s going on instead of going to cry on other subreddit.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t read my post, you didn&#39;t read the rules, and you don&#39;t even bother to challenge our argumentation.</p>

<p>I explained our stance on the situation. </p>

<p>And <a href="/r/LeagueOfMeta">/r/LeagueOfMeta</a> is to open discussion between the mods and the community. If you don&#39;t say anything no one will answer you.</p>

<p>Now, if you have nothing to bring to the table. I have other things to do.</p>

<p>TOP KEK</p>

<p>There is a discussion open. You just decided to not participate in it and then go to another subreddit to complain about it.</p>

<p>And I won&#39;t annoy the user with a useless front page post because a kid on the Internet refuse to engage in discussion and then go whine to another subreddit.</p>
