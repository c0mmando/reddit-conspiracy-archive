       NSA was started to make sure no Pearl Harbor went unforeseen again. It was started in absolute secrecy, and was referred to at inception as "no such agency". (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       I propose that its purpose was effective doublespeak from inception - it was not created for the purpose of preventing Pearl Harbors, but simply allowing leaders to act to use Pearl Harbors effectively in their plans for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, there have even been allegations that Pearl Harbor was foreseen as well, but allowed to happen to justify US war entry. (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor_advance-knowledge_conspiracy_theory">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor_advance-knowledge_conspiracy_theory
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       My observation is that the NSA has been very effective at its job. They knew about the Gulf of Tonkin, leading to the Vietnam War (
       <a href="http://www.outsiderclub.com/nsa-vietnam-war-gulf-of-tonkin-maddox/1096">
        http://www.outsiderclub.com/nsa-vietnam-war-gulf-of-tonkin-maddox/1096
       </a>
       ) and they knew about 9/11 (
       <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/washington-spectator/nsa-analyst-we-could-have_b_1513494.html">
        http://www.huffingtonpost.com/washington-spectator/nsa-analyst-we-could-have_b_1513494.html
       </a>
       ), leading to the never-ending War on Terror.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that the NSA is a planning tool for those who use false flags to manipulate public sentiment. Combine this with full surveillance and a database of individuals on which analytics on all communications can be run, and you have a micro-managed, fully implemented, soup-to-nuts propaganda machine complete with full insight into the target's psychology, and the option to pluck future events out of thin air to be held up as justification for whatever policy move the king wants to make.

       I think the NSA purpose is not to prevent foreign enemies attack but domestic enemies attack. And those domestic enemeis are simply the people. People think the US is a democracy whereas it's a mafia, some people got a grip on your nation and they are using any means necessary for them to keep it. Mass surveillance of everuyone, bribery, assassination, police, military and false flag attacks.

       Sounds right.  Pearl Harbor was almost certainly foreseen, so it's odd that they would cite that as a justification.  The double speak is a good observation.  Truth in plain sight.
      </p>
      <p>
       The outstanding success of Pearl Habor as a 180-shift propaganda tool cannot be understated.  Preparing policy for known future events that remain unknown to the world at large until their occurrence seems like a powerful tool.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NSA is ostensibly just signals intelligence.  But, if they're using secrets to craft future outcomes here's a very esoteric twist involved.  Very alchemical.  So, you may be right.

       As a non-US citizen I'd say NSA is partially  linked to having gun rights in the US. When I played Command&amp;Conquer I loved to Yuri all the US citizens and make them attack enemies for fun. Ineffective but an army of ill-intentioned citizens would be a pain in the ass for public security. So that's where the NSA comes in play.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it will be a coincidence that if the NSA goes down so will the gun rights in the US Constitution.

       Interesting theory; thing is that Roosevelt actively caused, and knew about, Pearl Harbor likely WEEKS before it happened.
