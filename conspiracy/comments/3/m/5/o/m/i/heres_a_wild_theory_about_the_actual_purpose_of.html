        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>NSA was started to make sure no Pearl Harbor went unforeseen again. It was started in absolute secrecy, and was referred to at inception as &quot;no such agency&quot;. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency</a>). </p>

<p>I propose that its purpose was effective doublespeak from inception - it was not created for the purpose of preventing Pearl Harbors, but simply allowing leaders to act to use Pearl Harbors effectively in their plans for us. </p>

<p>In fact, there have even been allegations that Pearl Harbor was foreseen as well, but allowed to happen to justify US war entry. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor_advance-knowledge_conspiracy_theory">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor_advance-knowledge_conspiracy_theory</a>).</p>

<p>My observation is that the NSA has been very effective at its job. They knew about the Gulf of Tonkin, leading to the Vietnam War (<a href="http://www.outsiderclub.com/nsa-vietnam-war-gulf-of-tonkin-maddox/1096">http://www.outsiderclub.com/nsa-vietnam-war-gulf-of-tonkin-maddox/1096</a>) and they knew about 9/11 (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/washington-spectator/nsa-analyst-we-could-have_b_1513494.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/washington-spectator/nsa-analyst-we-could-have_b_1513494.html</a>), leading to the never-ending War on Terror.</p>

<p>The truth is that the NSA is a planning tool for those who use false flags to manipulate public sentiment. Combine this with full surveillance and a database of individuals on which analytics on all communications can be run, and you have a micro-managed, fully implemented, soup-to-nuts propaganda machine complete with full insight into the target&#39;s psychology, and the option to pluck future events out of thin air to be held up as justification for whatever policy move the king wants to make.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the NSA purpose is not to prevent foreign enemies attack but domestic enemies attack. And those domestic enemeis are simply the people. People think the US is a democracy whereas it&#39;s a mafia, some people got a grip on your nation and they are using any means necessary for them to keep it. Mass surveillance of everuyone, bribery, assassination, police, military and false flag attacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds right.  Pearl Harbor was almost certainly foreseen, so it&#39;s odd that they would cite that as a justification.  The double speak is a good observation.  Truth in plain sight.</p>

<p>The outstanding success of Pearl Habor as a 180-shift propaganda tool cannot be understated.  Preparing policy for known future events that remain unknown to the world at large until their occurrence seems like a powerful tool.</p>

<p>The NSA is ostensibly just signals intelligence.  But, if they&#39;re using secrets to craft future outcomes here&#39;s a very esoteric twist involved.  Very alchemical.  So, you may be right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a non-US citizen I&#39;d say NSA is partially  linked to having gun rights in the US. When I played Command&amp;Conquer I loved to Yuri all the US citizens and make them attack enemies for fun. Ineffective but an army of ill-intentioned citizens would be a pain in the ass for public security. So that&#39;s where the NSA comes in play.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it will be a coincidence that if the NSA goes down so will the gun rights in the US Constitution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting theory; thing is that Roosevelt actively caused, and knew about, Pearl Harbor likely WEEKS before it happened.</p>

<p>He was trying HARD to get America involved in WWII (an immensely unpopular idea with Americans at the time) by any means possible.</p>
