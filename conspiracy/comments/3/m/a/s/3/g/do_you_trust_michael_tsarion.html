<p>Nah I wouldn&#39;t say an asshole buddy...but gullible comes to mind.  </p>

<p>A key thing you need to understand about Christianity (and I grew up a Lutheran) is that the old mystery schools and early religions (paganism, gnostics, druids, occult etc.) were all seen as a very serious threat to the rise of the new church.  This is <em>definitely</em> the reason why the early Christian church spent so much time demonizing the old religions and continued this throughout history.  Hence occult/zodiac all of that old mystery school stuff = SATAN.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I think the problem with some people who have christian beliefs is that they dont factor in all of the information about the history of Christianity. The fact is Christians where also involved in the mysteries, if you read the  Nag Hammadi works you would understand this. Not all mysteries are based on luciferian beliefs, thats a trick to make people fearful of their own inner spiritual potential. The bible was structure by people that wanted to control humans, so they left a lot out and altered a few things to suite their power interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the Nag Hammadi material is fundamentally Gnostic, aka Luciferian, its doctrines are universally refuted by the Bible, and its claims were universally rejected by early Christians. The writings also proceeded the manuscripts of the New Testament by at least a generation - though most of it literally proceeded those Christian texts by centuries. Your claims about the history of the Bible and Christian belief are just plain false. And if you had any understanding of the Bible you would also understand that it would make an absolutely miserable tool for controlling people in any nefarious way - rather, if successful, it would turn its believers into enemies of the state and the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gnosticism is not luciferian, if you look at the history behind it you will see its about knowing thyself and putting what you know into practice, unlike you who make wild claims about anything that goes against your belief system. There are many works out there that have more relevance than the bible because it shows you how to transcend your limitations where the bible, while it has a great many things to offer in terms of wisdom, doesn&#39;t go far enough in helping people understand that all suffering is an illusion that starts within. Negative external realities are created by people who haven&#39;t worked out there own internal struggles. Being christian doesnt mean shit if you dont understand the devices behind your behavior and action.
Instead of learning about this subject you chalk it up to so called Luciferian beliefs that you use to paint a large brush stroke over to hide what you are to lazy to understand about yourself because you are either afraid of punishment of doing something against god (which is just an illusion) or you have an agenda to wrap people back up in a religious mindset. </p>

<p>The bible is an enslavement tool because people (like you) that dont know yourself are able to take what it says out of context and use it against people to try and exploit or control their freewill and all they will do in return is resent you for it because deep down, we all have truth within us that needs to be uncovered not by religious dogma, but by love and awareness of truth and respect everyone&#39;s journey to that truth.. If you knew who you were you wouldn&#39;t be so quick to judge what you don&#39;t really understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re very silly for your generalizations. I won&#39;t bother making too big a presentation of my aptitude, as I&#39;m really not even feeling it and it&#39;s about as classy as my bragging about my IQ. But I&#39;ve definitely undergone my share of psychological development, and I&#39;m far from unobservant, be it of internal or external matters. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t speak reflexively of Gnosticism on the basis of its difference from my own beliefs. Rather, I have come to my present beliefs only in response to my own comprehensive dealings with the mysteries and my own illumination. As such, I understand the things you&#39;re saying; their meaning does not elude me by any means. But I testify that you are mistaken in your assumptions about my position and its contributing factors, and I testify I am qualified to discern that Gnosticism is indeed Luciferian in nature.</p>

<p>You can assume I am lying, if you like. But if you had a correction for me, I promise I would sooner accept it than argue against it. I mean, that&#39;s what I did for the Bible - and the Bible disgusted me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have found a simple test to determine knowledge is working against you. If it doesn&#39;t support your development into a spiritual being with love and compassion its from the Demiurge. If its a teaching that trys to get to subscribe to a hierarchical structure its Luciferian. If it supports your development as an spiritual individual its good. I&#39;m not afraid to study teachings because I can discern for myself what is right and wrong. I dont need someone&#39;s interpretation of what right and wrong because i know that doesn&#39;t support development.
Gnosticism is simply knowing who you are, that is not in any way shape or form luciferian. Now you may have an incorrect belief about it and that may be luciferain, but in its raw form its not anything other than knowledge of one self. The meaning of Gnosis is knowledge from experience. If I were you I would look at what you have learned about it or what incorrect beliefs you have made about it and work from that instead of making wild claims about something as I say again, you don&#39;t understand. I say that with compassion but im firm on the topic. It hurts you alone when you make statements that are clearly not true because of ignorance.
The problem is we have been lied to from the very beginning of our creation and we have so many messaged up beliefs that they really get in the way of our self-discovery. and when I say self, i dont mean ego or a worldly thing. I mean knowledge of who you are as a spiral individual or soul. Nobody should be afraid of discovering who you are. from a reasoned stand point that makes no sense, as the creator would not want to put restirctions on knowing who you are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, I understand the things you are saying. I maintained a position very similar to yours for a long time and I pursued it with enthusiasm and with a capable mind to great effect. </p>

<p>What I have learned since then is that knowledge facilitates evil except in the case that it is counterbalanced with humility, submission, and denial of the self, and that even meek ignorance is superior to knowledge in all other cases. I say this having the understanding that even one&#39;s experience of his self as a discrete entity has the intrinsic effect of necessitating that self experience is a foremost priority, predisposing a will that seeks to advantage that self.</p>

<p>Knowledge is an insufficient solution for a number of reasons. One reason is because knowledge, be it of the functionality of the self or of any other matter, has the effect of providing its bearer with a more precise degree of decision-making and a subsequent greater degree of agency over what occurs, which, ultimately, only leaves a greater number of outcomes at the behest of a self that is opportunistic at its core. Another reason is because the ideal of acting rightly according to knowledge is only possible in the case that we are sufficiently qualified to discern what is true, and, so long as we remain opportunistic and biased in favor of our own self experiences, our assessments of the truth will likewise be susceptible to all manner of compromise and selective application in favor of our own preferences. A third reason is simply that our knowledge and our pursuit of perfection through knowledge has the effect of compounding itself and further exacerbating our wrongdoing: conditioning us to act according to this compromised perception aforementioned and positively reinforcing that practice to the opportunistic self with the reward of its greater degree of agency. It thus leaves us a progressively greater likelihood of perceiving the truth according to our own desires by that conditioning, and, just the same, leaves us a progressively greater incentive to do it, as well, by that reward.</p>

<p>I speak to you this way because I recognize that you are competent, and that you have the ability to evaluate what I am saying and to understand it accurately. When I abandoned my former beliefs in favor of a belief in the biblical Christ, it wasn&#39;t as a result of my upbringing, it wasn&#39;t because I was scared of hell or scared of death, it wasn&#39;t because I had heard a clever argument, and it wasn&#39;t because I believed I had seen a miracle. It was simply because I began to read the Gospels one day and it immediately became clear to me that Jesus was speaking the truth, and that there was no other explanation for what he was saying. As one who underwent a vast amount of psychological development and had trained himself extensively to judge rightly up to that point, I could not argue against the truth of Christ for one second. And I took that very seriously, because that&#39;s what a person does when he cares what is true.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to preach to you, because I expect it will fall on deaf ears and it will not be received with favor. Instead, I appeal to your competence. Please, if you care what is true, do what I have done. The enemy has laid all manner of elaborate trap, and many of these traps are so well-devised as to ensnare even the most intelligent and capable of those who would seek truth and do good. We need soldiers on our side. I will be praying. Please do what I have done.</p>

<p>Take it easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said when I refer to self. I mean your true self, not ego. Who you were before you came into the body. not the opportunistic part of you. its the part that knows. Its really sad that you transitioned from knowledge to fear of it. You don&#39;t abandon Christ by having knowledge of self or soul. You cannot be deceived if you put love first in all things. Deception comes into being though lack of knowledge and fear.  All paths are the same: they lead nowhere. ... If the path has heart, the path is good; if it doesn&#39;t, it is of no use. Both paths lead nowhere; but one has a heart, the other doesn&#39;t. One makes for a joyful journey; as long as you follow it, you are one with it. The other will make you curse your life. One makes you strong; the other weakens you.</p>

<p>You have to take responsibility for your existence, not leave it to power structures that were built to enslave you (some of the interpretations of god and Jesus in the bible being one of them), Yes as you gain knowledge it becomes much harder to stay on a true path, but that is the price of being aware, being alive and having an existence. You are a reflection of the universe as it manifests itself. You have to face those challenges and move though them unscathed. We came into existence to face these challenges, not put our power onto religious structures that were meant to enslave us from the beginning. If you deny that you are just going to cause further suffering on your life because you wont be living up to your potential.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who said I was afraid? I would say I am not scared at all. I just understand I will cause harm by acting according to my own will and my own aptitude, and I have seen that God is good, so I try to abstain from doing those things for the sake of good, even though it is hard and a large part of me does not want to abstain. I do not shy away from any knowledge by any means - I just have little interest in pursuing avenues of belief I have already learned are unfruitful and counterproductive.</p>

<p>You make a lot of suppositions about where I&#39;m coming from, really. A lot of suppositions and a lot of generalizations. I&#39;m not afraid; I&#39;m not concerned I will be deceived; I&#39;m not following a path with no heart; I&#39;m not journeying joylessly; I don&#39;t curse my life; I am not weak. Rather, I am completely intellectually satisfied and I am more effectively enabled than I have ever been. I am strong enough to empty myself for other people and I am inspired enough to desire to do it even despite the costs. Maybe if you accurately assessed what I was even talking about, you would be in a better position to come to a dependable conclusion about it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said that you were living joylessly, that was a statement of truth for all of us, we are either on a path of heart or we are not.
Its not my place to assume where you are, but I do know that when one shys away from knowledge, its related to fear of power and one&#39;s own potential. We have been programmed from the beginning of time too follow someone else&#39;s thoughts and ideas. Once we start really thinking for ourselves and making our own choices free from control thats when things truly change. We align ourselves with the universe, or our designs are used against us by the universe. Thats really it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL, well one thing I know is when people get angry at what I say, and make personal attacks on my character I know i am getting closer to the truth. You just dont want to admit that what I am saying is truth. Thats ok I understand, I was like you at one time, coming to the same conclusions and expecting different results. Eventually I moved on a realized that my own conditioning and fear is preventing me from realizing my place in the universe. All will be revealed. </p>

<p>Also you will notice you use the word respect as a weapon, only people that are still conditioned do that because they have an ego to protect by believing that getting peoples respect is the only way to survive. That is part of conditioning. However learned you think you are, you still have much to learn as we all do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All you are communicating is you have a bigger ego than me by pointing out how intelligent you think you are by comparing yourself to me.</p>

<p>It&#39;s laughable and people will see right though it. Thats the problem with christian zelots, they thing that know everything an can never be wrong. and you just shown your true colors. waste of time.</p>

<p>The best advice I can give you is becoming aware that you know nothing, everything you have been taught is a lie. When you can do that and build knowledge from knowing that you know nothing, only then can you build a foundation of true knowledge, remember that.</p>

<p>Let me know how that &quot;person of intelligence&quot; identity works out for you. I&#39;m gussing its going to be your biggest stumbling block.</p>

<p>The sooner he realizes this the better.  Until that time he will self-righteously push the same brainwashed myths that were pushed on him.  It&#39;s a sad cycle really.  Swing on by <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> if you need a hand brother.</p>
