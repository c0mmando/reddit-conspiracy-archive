        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed that a majority of people calling climate change a myth are conservatives. I think I know why. </p>

<p>These people deny climate change in order to get rich off of higher energy bills. Think about it. The planet heating up will mean higher local temperatures which in turn means people will be using  their air conditioners more often and for longer. This causes them to use more energy to cool their homes. More energy use means higher bills. Higher bills means more money going into the pockets of those people who have stock in the energy companies, oil/natural gas companies, etc. Who generally owns stock in these companies? Conservatives. Can work with a climate shift into ice age conditions as well.</p>

<p>On the religious side of this. Many people, especially the fundamentalists wish to speed the apocalypse up so that they can be rapture as true believers in heaven. By denying climate change and therefore brushing any concern for the environment under the rug they are exacerbating the natural disasters as well as creating new ecological disasters in order to bring about the start of their own artificial tribulation. This would include the use and shrinking of fresh water supplies so that droughts and wars over water rights would be more frequent. They hope that, by doing this, they can push a global dictator as well as a World War III scenario into play more quickly than if they waited for something of this sort to happen naturally.</p>

<p>for one thing, air conditioners only use a fraction of the energy that home heating does, so its not ruining the damn environment.</p>

I don&#39;t have time for this, nor do I care what you leftist whackos believe or do on your own time, so if you want to go ahead and believe this crock of garbage, be my guest.

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that you are right on the money there with that post.  Pretty much everything the left does is predicated on meddling and control, under the guise of &#39;I&#39;m just trying to help, and you are evil if you question me&#39;  </p>

<p>One thing that always stuck with me about the environment was reading about the history of life on this planet.  At one point in history, there was an organism that is an ancestor to the &#39;red tide&#39; algae of today.  This organism lived in colonies, and there is some evidence that at one point, these algae released so much cyanide into the environment that it killed off every other living thing on the planet.</p>

<p>Humans could never even come close to polluting the environment like these humble algae did.  Even if we are the cause of &#39;global warming&#39;, it is doubly foolish to think that we could do anything to stop it without just messing things up worse than they already are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok here is one:  I note that, while the left sees the right as greedy, humorless, and having evil intent; the right tends to see the left as simply misguided and foolish.  I believe that leftists should be treated as a dangerously toxic ideology with a propensity towards mass-murder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there is a historical context for mass murder by the left.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve often been amused that the left distances themselves from national-socialism while they publicly promote socialism.  They often try to blame change NAZISM as a fascist government when the Nazi government was almost completely separate from the fascist economic system that existed within the socialist society of Nazi Germany.</p>

<p>Similarly capitalism isn&#39;t Democratic, its an economic system.  Its all very confusing with many flavors of overlap but the Nazis were socialists as far as how they governed the common man.  All we hear about now are the elite of the Nazi society which were fascist.</p>

<p>Just like the elite of our own society and every socialist society in the world today.</p>

<p>Even with the great communist countries of the past, the elite never live by the same rules as the common man.  It was communism and sacrifice for the common man, and wealth with extravagance for the elite.</p>

<p>For this reason I can not support the left or the right as I think those labels are misleading and perpetuate yet another generation of top down rule.</p>

<p>We should call it what it is, you&#39;re either top or bottom not left or right.  Once you define it that way then one side greatly outnumbers the other and there is no longer the need for such an abstract distribution of power.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;m wrong about a lot but repeating the same mistakes over and over again certainly isn&#39;t more correct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like we pick and choose our worldviews like a suit from our closet or something.  Well, I don&#39;t know about you, but I sure don&#39;t &#39;pick&#39; my worldview.  it was something that developed as I grew, like my shadow.  </p>

<p>And as far as &#39;narrow&#39;, just because all you lefty&#39;s think that the right wing consists primarily of KKK members and fundamentalist christians, doesn&#39;t make it a reality.  The &#39;right&#39; has been caricatured and &#39;alinskyd&#39; by the left in much the same way that the right caricatures the left as a bunch of goofy stoned college kids with birkenstocks and peace-sign glasses.</p>

<p>I happen to be so far right that my beliefs teeter on the edge of anarchism.  See, the real indicator of &#39;right&#39; and &#39;left&#39; is pretty much along an axis of collectivism and individualism.  And I believe in self determination, individual freedom, and minarchy.  </p>

<p>Progressives and climate change:</p>

<p>For the exact same reason that the science both for and against AGW is bogus, you will find that conservatives denounce and progressives support climate change science.</p>

<p>Its propaganda on both sides of the isle.  You&#39;re kidding yourself if you think that only conservatives stand to make money on this new hot button issue.  </p>

<p>The simple truth is fear through control. And its inverse is more control through fear.</p>

<p>You propose all these hypotheticals that by denying climate change the evil conservatives will bring about WWIII and install a dictator but you fail to even acknowledge that by supporting climate change we bring about a global authority and lay the foundations for a world order to save us from ourselves.</p>

<p>In my own humble opinion its a non issue.  A natural cycle that IS absolutely going to kill a lot of people.  It doesn&#39;t matter if the people die from rising ocean levels or glaciations creeping towards the equator.  Hot or cold the fossil records show that these transitional periods between interglacial and glacial periods dramatically effect the ecosystems and cause extinctions.</p>

<p>TPTB are simply harnessing this knowledge to place yet another yoke around our necks, keep us divided and extract wealth from us to help them prepare to survive the event themselves.</p>

<p>TPTB control both sides of the debate, they are the republicans and the democrats, the alpha and the omega.  All of this has happened before and all of it will happen again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The term &quot;climate change&quot; is completely meaningless. If you are talking about man-made global warming (AGW), then only a fool would accept the standard alarmist narrative. Fortunately for the world, most people know that AGW is a scam.</p>
