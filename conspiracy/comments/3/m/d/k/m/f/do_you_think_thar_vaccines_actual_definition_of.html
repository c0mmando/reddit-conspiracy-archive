    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Big Pharma get to profit when we&#39;re sick</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This gets repeated a lot, but isn&#39;t really true.  Old people are the ones who are worth huge amounts of money to the health care industry, not sick people.</p>

<p>The older a person gets the more healthcare they need, the primary goal of the healthcare industry is to keep people living as long as possible.  A 65 year old pays about 5 times as much annually for healthcare as a 20 year old, and it only increases from there.  Why would you deliberately make people sick when you can instead just keep them healthy and get them to be a nice old 90 year old paying hand over fist for healthcare?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is absolutely not true. Although the 65+ demographic buys the most drugs per person they are not the biggest demographic. In 2010, there were 40.3 million people aged 65 and above, comprising 13% of the overall population. </p>

<p>However, by 2007-2008, one-half of Americans use at least one or more prescription drugs; and 1 out of 10 used five or more. One out of every five children used at least one or more prescription drugs compared with 9 of every 10 adults aged 60 and over.</p>

<p>This means that about half of our entire population (as of 2010) has some form of ailment that is being treated. So we can assume that a very large percent of the population is not considered healthy.</p>

<p>The average life expectancy is 78 years in the US, so there are very few 90 year olds paying premium for healthcare. It is a shame there isn&#39;t any sources for this but: do you really think most 90 year olds are relying on prescriptions? I don&#39;t, or else they wouldn&#39;t be 90+. To add on to this, I find it disturbing that so many people 65+ are on medication and I am confident is has to do with how from a young age we are slowly developing sicknesses as a result of poor quality food, ignorant use of medications, environmental factors, etc.</p>

<p>Just to add, when I look around locally many people are not healthy. Obesity, breathing problems, low quality food plagues our society and it is all rather convenient for the drug companies.</p>

<p>Preventative medicine is basically not taught in medical school. Nutrition is neglected in medical school. There are very few incentives to prevent people from buying medication. </p>

<p>It couldn&#39;t be more obvious that we are encouraged to buy medication even when it comes to the most treatable &amp; preventable ailments that you absolutely do not need medication in the form of drugs for.</p>

<p>In conclusion, to say that Big Pharma doesn&#39;t profit off of the sick is absolutely ridiculous. U.S. spending on prescription medicines jumped 13 percent to $374 billion in 2014. The leading 500 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies sales are expected to reach over one trillion U.S. dollars by 2020.</p>

<p>Therefore, I think that vaccination &quot;effectiveness&quot; is based entirely on causing life-long infections in the recipient.</p>

<p>Therefore I think they are only good for people when the disease in question is epidemic and serious.  Conversely, they are bad for people when the disease is not a realistic threat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well... I generally think if you could make a vaccine with care, you could make a good and safe vaccine.  BUT:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It used to be a given that the way to give lab animals an allergy to something (for testing) is to inject it into the blood.  So maybe injected vaccines are not so smart.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;ve read a lot of evidence in old medical journals that children experience great mental jumps after having wild measles.  There is the danger that some of these diseases are symbiotic-- measles is considered to be a very, very ancient human disease, it&#39;s evolved alongside us for a very long time.  For all we know, losing wild measles is why the global IQ seems to be dropping.</p></li>
<li><p>Natures is a dynamic, moving thing.  What we did with vaccination was open up a huge niche.  People don&#39;t think of germs as predators, but what we did was remove the apex predators.  Something is going to fill the niche.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So there&#39;s a lot of factors to consider.  It was very rash to say &quot;we know everything, let&#39;s go inject everybody&quot; but anyone who expects anything different from government is probably just suffering from the aforementioned declining world IQ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s a gray area. I get DTAP every decade or so, but the Flu shot and Gardasi l can DIAF. I regret ever getting a Flu shot to begin with. And I hate that I have no choice but to be exposed to the live virus in FluMist. Years from now, if we&#39;re still around, we&#39;re going to wonder what the hell we were thinking.</p>

<p>And as a PSA for anyone who has weird dizziness, heart issues, vestibular problems, anxiety, etc. within a year or so of getting a Flu shot, catching the honest-to-god-Flu, or being exposed to a kid who got that vile FluMist, you&#39;re not crazy - don&#39;t take crazy meds - research &quot;neuronitis&quot; or &quot;neuritis&quot; and boost your immune system. Your body may be freaking out because you have a <em>physical</em> and not a <em>mental</em> problem. Docs like to blame it on &quot;stress&quot; or &quot;anxiety&quot; when actually the stress and anxiety is caused by the fact that some virus is attacking your nerves!</p>

<p>BTW, you&#39;re going to get downvoted with &quot;vaccine&quot; in the title as there are users who do keyword searches and downvote/troll. I&#39;m surprised it&#39;s not lower.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The belief that injecting a normal, healthy child with disease will bring health is as insane as a pagan ritual to bring about a bountiful harvest. The claim that it is scientific is not substantial without real experimental evidence. No real experiment has been done because it would be unethical. If an experiment is not practical, unethical, or impossible you can&#39;t just skip the experiment and form a conclusion based on &#39;evidence&#39;. There are grades of evidence. Unscientific evidence can be interpreted wrong and is not conducive to modal forms of logical inquiry and thus it is unscientific to call the conclusion fact. The simple question to ask is if the conclusion in an induction or a deduction. Vaccine theory is an induction at best, wishful flim flam thinking at worst.</p>

<p>The fact that people cannot see this is unsurprising. Even amongst so called educated peoples I find a disturbing gap in logic education and comprehension. People believe the fictional character Sherlock Holmes deduces things with deductive reasoning when he actually is using inductive logic 99% of the time. If you are familiar with Sherlock Holmes books and think you know the first thing about logic and never realized he rarely deduces then you need to take a step back and consider if you&#39;re a &#39;science cheerleader&#39; or a serious thinker.</p>

<p>If you have ever said the phrase &#39;I believe in Science&#39; then you might be a cheerleader. Science is not a supposed to be a religion you believe in.</p>

<p>But what about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_immunity">acquired immunity?</a> And how all biological systems of varying complexities show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunological_memory#Naturally_acquired_active_immunity">immunological memory</a> when exposed to pathogens, naturally occurring or otherwise. It is also believed that survivors of the black plague through exposure were able to pass on required antigens to future generations that made us more resistant and helped famously with European colonization against those civilizations that did not have such widespread exposure to the <em>Y. pestis</em> plague bacterium.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m giving you the benefit of the doubt that you don&#39;t understand why a leading question like that is intellectually dishonest when the entire point of my post (which you left out of the quoted section) already covers the question, but I&#39;ll respond with a reiteration that those concepts coupled with conclusions about vaccines are inductions and not deductions; therefore they do not hold the weight of a &#39;fact&#39;. As you say, it is &quot;believed&quot; that black plague immunity was passed through cause &#39;x&#39;, where cause &#39;x&#39; was derived from retroductive logic. It is a case, once again, of confirming the consequent and as it is not deductive it is not scientific fact. </p>

<p>Of course the next step is to drudge out the tried and true method of silencing dissenting opinions with our old pal &#39;peer review study&#39;. Of course the phrase means nothing, it might as well be renamed to &#39;peer collusion and fraud study&#39;. Take a good look at the methodology of any paper you think validates whatever you think you should believe and ask if it constitutes a valid controlled experiment that only relies on deductions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I do not understand why inductive reasoning is dishonest? Doesn&#39;t inductive reasoning give us almost all of modern technology? For example, the discovery of electricity and the unification of electromagnetism was inductive, as was the concept of a semiconductor which led to the very medium we communicate in. Can&#39;t we apply it to treat illnesses and increase lifespan?</p>

<p>And speaking of leading questions, I also disagree with your statement:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Peer review has its flaws and is far from perfect but I don&#39;t think it is done with the intent of silencing opinions. And dissent makes it sound like there&#39;s an official scientific position from authority; the government might have official positions, but the wider scientific community often doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>This gets repeated a lot, but isn&#39;t really true.  Old people are the ones who are worth huge amounts of money to the health care industry, not sick people.</p>

<p>The older a person gets the more healthcare they need, the primary goal of the healthcare industry is to keep people living as long as possible.  A 65 year old pays about 5 times as much annually for healthcare as a 20 year old, and it only increases from there.  Why would you deliberately make people sick when you can instead just keep them healthy and get them to be a nice old 90 year old paying hand over fist for healthcare?</p>
