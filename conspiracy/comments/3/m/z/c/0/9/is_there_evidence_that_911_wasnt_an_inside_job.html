       Absolutely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of planes crashing into buildings, phone calls from planes describing hijackers, hijackers on planes connected to plot that included flight training, etc. Admission from the alleged perpetrators themselves. Engineering report explaining collapse widely accepted by major American Engineering organizations. Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is also some evidence, as many here will be quick to point out, that may point to an inside job. They may also have issues with evidence presented by the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real question is not whether the evidence exists, but how valid and relevant it is to the truth. That is where the debate is. For example, evidence from firefighter testimony indicates explosions prior to WTC7 collapse. Inside job proponents will say these are explosive charges, others may point to the fact that there are other things that may be explosive in large buildings.

       Not sure why you guys are asking me about this. I specifically noted that people have issues with the evidence put forward by non-inside job advocates, and that this rift is central to the issue. I was simply listing evidence that side puts forward (almost unanimous support from major academic organizations)

       I am fully aware that 911 truth advocates have these problems with the evidence put forward and advocated by "outside jobbers" (I despise the term "official story", if my avoidance of the term wasn't enough evidence for that! I think it panders to an anti-authoritian mindset and primes these types of people before facts/evidence are even discussed, but this is way off topic). You have just stated quite a few of those concerns. That said, it could still be reasoned that the near uniform professional support for the "official story" is viable evidence for layman such as myself. To back this up and respond to this:

       . Lots of sources finding similar results, and plenty of support from major academic organizations. Pretty indisputable that academic support far favors one side of the argument, no matter what you happen to believe on the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I lack the qualifications (Not an engineer, much less a civil/structural engineer) to properly assess an engineering report like the NIST report. Therefore, for laymen such as myself and most other interested people, this widespread support exists as evidence for an "outside job". Should it be enough to convince anyone? I certainly don't think so. But when I see that, I can't help but favor the side held by most academics, especially considering the low output of any model or peer reviewable paper from the 911 truth movement. So, it exists as evidence for me that supports the "official story" and plays into my thoughts on the matter.

       Interesting point you're raising here, I'd enjoy an in-depth discussion about that angle - here or at a later point. It seems more like a hen-egg problem to me... do you doubt the outside job narrative because you're antiauthoritarian or do you become antiauthoritarian because you doubt the outside job narrative?

       I see what you mean. What, do you suggest, would be a good, strong argument against it? Other than pointing out that there is not really such a professional support, more of a pact of silence not to address the collapse mode itself, as if it is enough to fabricate one hypotheses for the initiation after the other until nobody asks about the collapse mode itself anymore?
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried the "seventy years ago, there was professional support for the idea that it is obvious from the cranial features of Mongols, apes and Africans that the Aryan race is destined to rule the world" and "five hundred years ago, there was professional support for the hypothesis that the earth is the center of the universe" angles. Experts can be wrong. The expert consensus has been wrong. Science has been politicized before (see: Wikipedia:Lysenko). Does the argument boil down to "butbut not in OUR free and democratic country"?
      </p>
      <p>
       ("Our" country including me, as a German, too, chancellor Gerhard Schröder declared me American after 9/11, so if you're Canadian, that includes you as well as subject of the "free world"/Natoland).

       Not just that; I repeatedly challenged both the author of the list and others who reposted/referred to it to pick one article/paper they understand. The author, btw, stated that comparing the structure to a spring is "dumber than dogshit" - he clearly never read even the first paper on his list, which features, prominently, an illustration of a mass m dropping from height h on a spring with stiffness C. Not just that, I went through the whole list and cleaned it up to feature only those items which explain the collapse mode itself (and are not paywalled). Not just that, I emailed the authors of the first three items on the list and asked them for clarification on a few issues.

       It does seem so, I agree, at a cursory glance. Once you start digging deeper and refuse to be blindsided by the many attempts at explaining how hot the fires were, how collapse initiated and concentrate on the question how science explains that a tower falls straight down through and out of itself when its top 1/4 falls on its lower 3/4, you'll basically end up with the Bazant/Zhou/Verdure/Le/Greening series of papers, which make no secret of the fact that they were explicitly written with
       <em>
        the stated aim
       </em>
       to prove that the towers must have collapsed under assumptions most favorable towards survival of the structure and do so in the way seen. The whole trick? W[g] &gt; W[p]: the towers, on every millimeter height on average, were heavier than they could support by an order of magnitude (ü=g-F/m), hence, global collapse was "inevitable".

       That's it, basically. You don't have to be an expert for that, high school physics should suffice.

Would respectable journals not be less respectable once they began peddling "conspiracy theories"? How would laypeople, who never questioned or studied the "official science", and stick to it merely due to "gut feeling" and appeal to majority (or like me, for the first ten (!!) years, just don't want to be lunatic paranoid conspiracy theorists), be motivated to actually understand and compare the arguments put forth by both sides of the debate - and assess their veracity, reason and logic?

       What I meant by that comment is that the term is an appeal to an idealogy (anti-authoritian) that essentially draws the discussion away from a fact based one and into an idealogical realm. Essentially, people don't want to think of themselves as "sheep" or "followers", so by referring to the academically agreed upon explanation of events as the official story, the term is priming individuals against believing it. Of course, language use can go the other way as well, by referring to the "unofficial story" as a crazy conspiracy theory etc.

        I see what you mean. What, do you suggest, would be a good, strong argument against it?

Scientists and engineers are often pretty fact obsessed people, I have a hard time believing that of the hundreds of thousands of civil engineers in this country, only a small handful (most of AE911's experts are not civil engineers, and even if they were, the number is still extremely small) would speak out about such an important surpression of knowledge. Until you have proof of such a "pact", all you really have is speculation in service of preserving a narrative.

       I don't agree. I think you have simplified a complex engineering question to such a degree that you feel comfortable reaching a conclusion without having to refer to actual experts. Boiling the construction of a building down to "its top 1/4 falls on its lower 3/4", you are ignoring some many aspects of the collapse it renders itself meaningless. You are essentially throwing out the fact that buildings are a massive series of connections and support beams and referring to the towers as homogenous masses. You can't do that and expect engineers to listen to you.

       When evidence is strong enough to prove the prevailing theory incorrect, it ceases to be a fringe or conspiracy theory and becomes the prevailing theory itself. I know it is common to accuse basically the entire academic system of being corrupt, but the fact is that there are millions of structural engineers around the world and likely hundreds of thousands in countries that aren't exactly sympathetic to the wants or needs of the United States government. Real science wins out when you can effectively convince honest scientists of the conclusions. I refuse to believe that only a fraction of a fraction of a percent of the engineering community is honest and not willing to ignore bad science. I think that rather 911 truth theories are not strong enough (yet, that may change, and this is when I find myself a 911 truther again).

       I'm sorry, but that experiment literally proves nothing. Believe it or not, washers and cardboard circles don't have the same structural makeup as a 110 story building. I mean, the square-cube law alone makes it invalid. It also technically invalidates your assertions earlier. If we are to take your assertions that the upper quarter of an object cannot destroy a larger mass below it, why were those washers able to squish more than 50% more than their own mass. 4 washers and supports destroy 7 levels below. Its almost as if physics is more complicated than originally asserted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't go through the last bit piece by piece. I understand that the NIST report covers until collapse is deemed inevitable. I don't have an issue with this, personally, because I've yet to see any convincing evidence that explosives would be needed for the falling section of building to break the connections and crush the supports of the floors directly below it, continuing until complete destruction.

If after 14 years I am unable to prove this, I may have to face reality that maybe it wasn't piss and instead just a Pabst.

       You can't account for them. That's all you needed to say. The rest is useless filler. And there have actually been 0 peer reviewed refutations to the published paper showing that the official story combustion cannot account for the VOCs. So no. No experts have accomplished the task.

       The journal in which the paper is published is not listed in your article. A weak attempt at a refutation. Following the standard MO of attempting to attack the journal rather than the information. And you didn't even succeed at that.

       Looks like Springer dealt with the issue. The journal the paper is published in was never on the original list. And the paper remains published. Don't tell me you also don't understand how the peer review process works? You do know that each journal has a separate board, correct? Weak.

       The people with qualifications have already deemed the paper to be valid. Sorry. The official story combustion cannot account for the VOCs present at Ground Zero. And yet, you're "more confident" in the official story. I'm more confident in the science. So again, if you come here with an argument, I'll be sure to accommodate you.

       Hello. I'll upvote both of you. As there is partial evidence of down voting even though both of you are contributing. Both of you exhibits reasons for downvoted, but I don't think either one of you are down voting for any reason other then you both think the other is wrong. Such as him being aggressive.

       I followed and notice some flaws. If you mean you have a peer reviewedtu published paper, you do not mean AE9/11T? Because if it is, I would advice to not say that or use it as a source. The people behind it are very shady. (Disclaimer: This doesn't mean I do not believe in the conspiracy.) They have lied repeatedly. The little peer reviews they have is gained from unfair methods such as choosing the reviewers or doing the reviews for the peers. They also faked evidence. The major contributors alone sadly do not have any credibility such as Steve.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not trying to argue, I'm just warning you next time if you use it as a source. If you want me to go into detail, feel free to ask.

       That is a lot of response. I am going to try to be brief, both because I commented on this thread not intending to get into this type of discussion, and because I simply don't have the time to respond too indepth/research claims/etc.

        Interesting point you're raising here, I'd enjoy an in-depth discussion about that angle - here or at a later point. It seems more like a hen-egg problem to me... do you doubt the outside job narrative because you're antiauthoritarian or do you become antiauthoritarian because you doubt the outside job narrative?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What I meant by that comment is that the term is an appeal to an idealogy (anti-authoritian) that essentially draws the discussion away from a fact based one and into an idealogical realm. Essentially, people don't want to think of themselves as "sheep" or "followers", so by referring to the academically agreed upon explanation of events as the official story, the term is priming individuals against believing it. Of course, language use can go the other way as well, by referring to the "unofficial story" as a crazy conspiracy theory etc.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I see what you mean. What, do you suggest, would be a good, strong argument against it? Other than pointing out that there is not really such a professional support, more of a pact of silence not to address the collapse mode itself, as if it is enough to fabricate one hypotheses for the initiation after the other until nobody asks about the collapse mode itself anymore?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The way to fight against it would be to actually provide evidence of a "pact of silence", or give these people who are supposedly covering it up the incentive or motivation to reveal themselves. Scientists and engineers are often pretty fact obsessed people, I have a hard time believing that of the hundreds of thousands of civil engineers in this country, only a small handful (most of AE911's experts are not civil engineers, and even if they were, the number is still extremely small) would speak out about such an important surpression of knowledge. Until you have proof of such a "pact", all you really have is speculation in service of preserving a narrative.

      <p>
       And what proved the old science wrong? Newer, better science. That is what the 911 truth movement has failed to produce. There have been a tonne of assertions, but very little actual scientific literature. There has been essentially zero scientific literature related to the engineering side of the issue. You can't even claim that efforts are being blackballed, because no comprehensive engineering report has even been developed to be rejected yet.

        That's it, basically. You don't have to be an expert for that, high school physics should suffice.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't agree. I think you have simplified a complex engineering question to such a degree that you feel comfortable reaching a conclusion without having to refer to actual experts. Boiling the construction of a building down to "its top 1/4 falls on its lower 3/4", you are ignoring some many aspects of the collapse it renders itself meaningless. You are essentially throwing out the fact that buildings are a massive series of connections and support beams and referring to the towers as homogenous masses. You can't do that and expect engineers to listen to you.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        Would 9/11 Truth be more true if the movement managed to smuggle more papers into "respectable journals"? Would respectable journals not be less respectable once they began peddling "conspiracy theories"?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       When evidence is strong enough to prove the prevailing theory incorrect, it ceases to be a fringe or conspiracy theory and becomes the prevailing theory itself. I know it is common to accuse basically the entire academic system of being corrupt, but the fact is that there are millions of structural engineers around the world and likely hundreds of thousands in countries that aren't exactly sympathetic to the wants or needs of the United States government. Real science wins out when you can effectively convince honest scientists of the conclusions. I refuse to believe that only a fraction of a fraction of a percent of the engineering community is honest and not willing to ignore bad science. I think that rather 911 truth theories are not strong enough (yet, that may change, and this is when I find myself a 911 truther again).

      <p>
       I'm sorry, but that experiment literally proves nothing. Believe it or not, washers and cardboard circles don't have the same structural makeup as a 110 story building. I mean, the square-cube law alone makes it invalid. It also technically invalidates your assertions earlier. If we are to take your assertions that the upper quarter of an object cannot destroy a larger mass below it, why were those washers able to squish more than 50% more than their own mass. 4 washers and supports destroy 7 levels below. Its almost as if physics is more complicated than originally asserted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't go through the last bit piece by piece. I understand that the NIST report covers until collapse is deemed inevitable. I don't have an issue with this, personally, because I've yet to see any convincing evidence that explosives would be needed for the falling section of building to break the connections and crush the supports of the floors directly below it, continuing until complete destruction.
