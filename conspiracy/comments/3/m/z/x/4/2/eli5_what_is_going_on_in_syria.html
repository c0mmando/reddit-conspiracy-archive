       It is what you would call a "Proxy War".
      </p>
      <p>
       We ( The US and Israel ) planned to remove Assad in advance of any claims of him committing attrocities against his people.  Supposedly those actions were taken because he was defending against a coup de tat started by the US and Israel ( Source wikileaks documents)
      </p>
      <p>
       The " Rebels " we were arming 2-3 years ago either completely or in part turned into ISIS.  We gave them cash and weapons and sent them on their way to fight Assad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, Russia and China are stepping in to fight ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US now has their pants around their ankles as they try to figure out how to explain why we would have issues w\ anybody attacking ISIS since they're our current boogeyman.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is apparently bombing the Syrian government and what that means with Russia and China in Syria is that if they start killing russians we ( the US ) could get pulled in.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then yes, you're looking at WW3.

       Just think, all those Russian (and Chinese?!!) forces deployed in the Middle East... so close to all that oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the force levels go too high, the US will face the nightmare scenario. Namely, massive miltary forces from nations hostile to US interests deployed a few hundred kilometers away from half the world's oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there anyone who thinks the US won't get in a war over that much oil?

       This isn't about how WWIII might happen. This is now at the point where steps need to be taken so that WWIII

       I'm starting to freak out. When I relocated from Poland 6 months ago, I told my family it's not unthinkable to assume that there will be a war breaking out and Poland will be involved within the next 12 months.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fucking hoped that I was wrong, but by the looks of it, it might be unavoidable at this point.

       We don't have troops on the ground and thus far over the last what?  2-3 years we've relied on "rebels" to fight assad, and a wild propaganda campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       It actually shows how ignorant alot of americans are since they can simply keep using the same tactics and in the media pretend they're doing something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all know the war in Iraq was a farce.. There were no WMD.  The intel is proven, PROVEN to have been forged and exaggerated in order to goto war.  This is common knowledge we all have now.
      </p>
      <p>
       But guess what?  Even with that knowledge you still have a majority of people considering the war to have been fine because at least we got rid of Sadaam.  Which in turn helped kick off much of the destabilization in the region.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the kicker to that?  THEY FUCKING KNEW.  Dick Cheney is on video in '94 giving an interview describing why we can't invade iraq and showing he and the rest of them knew full well what would happen w\ sadaam's removal.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the motherfucker because you can see that 20 years ago they knew exactly what would happen... then they lied in order to get support for an illegal war and here are today.

       If you're using sarcasm, you should probably add tags.  Peace and democracy will not come from this.  Just control of the world's oil reserves, the beginnings of Arab genocide, and the slow, painful death of the world itself.

       the fact that we don't want Russia bombing ISIS isn't proof US are supporting ISIS. The fact is U.S doesn't want Russia using military force anywhere on the face of the planet. 
There could be proof elsewhere, but this is more of a correlation.

       Don't take my word for it.  Here's Dick Cheney in 1994 talking about why we can't just invade iraq.  This is actually where some of the shit gets scary.  Because with this you have to accept that we knew full well what would happen and we said FUCK IT.

       You're talking about a government that is so powerful that they can invade whatever country they want with little to no actual backlash that effects it's own people or economy. You think they just let something like the, "WMD scandal" happen? You're the fool. It is engineered to confuse you about what is actually happening in the region.

       You think a superpower like the U.S just lets it come out that Saddam Hussein had no WMDs? No, obviously not, they could have easily planted their own WMDs in Iraq to prove that he had WMDs but they didn't, because there were WMDs and they didn't want the international world, especially the middle east to know of their existence after the fact in such a destabilized region. We already know that many of the WMDs were actually funneled into Iran.

       The west has been supporting ISIS, using them to help overthrow the Syrian president Assad. (This would put them in a good position to attack Iran, which would put them in a good position to attack Russia.) Russia waltzed in and said "Here let me help you with that War on Terror" and started bombing ISIS. The US can't really say shit about it without revealing that they're supporting ISIS.

       It's too late.  As soon as the Federal Reserve came to life, the world became endangered.  When we failed to recognize that it was just another central bank like the last two, simply overlooking it because it had been christened "Federal," we failed.

       If I may borrow some of the words of my favorite band, it's like they gathered up the world, they sold it to the devil, then it all went to hell and we wonder how.

       Humanity is lost.  The planet is dying, and it'll take us with it.  Heroes might could stop this, but there are no heroes.  They're all gone.  The parasites who control the world, who would rather destroy it than sustain it for the good of all, have seen to it that no one will come.

       World War III is coming, but what does it matter?  The world's already dead.

       About Syria, there are different sides all saying the other guys are the enemies.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_deployments#Africa_and_Southwest_Asia">
        Now if you take a look at US military bases near the region
       </a>
       it becomes quite clear who is being the agressor.

      <p>
       To me it looks like Israel has foreign forces fighting proxy wars for her in the region.

       This has become extremely common of late. You can hang around in /new or /rising and see examples of it in almost any sub.

        In 2009 - the same year former French foreign minister Dumas alleges the British began planning operations in Syria - Assad refused to sign a proposed agreement with Qatar that would run a pipeline from the latter's North field, contiguous with Iran's South Pars field, through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria and on to Turkey, with a view to supply European markets - albeit crucially bypassing Russia.
        <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2013/aug/30/syria-chemical-attack-war-intervention-oil-gas-energy-pipelines">
         Assad's rationale was "to protect the interests of [his] Russian ally, which is Europe's top supplier of natural gas."
