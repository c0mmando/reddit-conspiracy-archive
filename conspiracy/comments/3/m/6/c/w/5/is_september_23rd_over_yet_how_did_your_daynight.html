       It's only in the past year that I've woken up to how much corruption there really is in the world, and that brought me here looking for answers as to why... and while there has been plenty of good info and interesting theories on this sub I'm so glad September 23 is over because that means I can finally feel confident that all of this doomsday talk is bullshit. It's not that I believed anything too serious would happen, but I was too fresh to this nonsense to completely wipe it as being a possibility... now I feel like I can.

       things have always been corrupt, we are a greedy/violent species.  don't get too caught up in this sub, a lot of what you read is BS without evidence.  However, it's entertaining.

       I don't think we are a greedy or violent species, I think we have been conditioned to feel/act that way. I'm not saying those things aren't in our nature, I'm just saying they are not the traits that define us even if they are the traits that define the world we live in. Most people are pretty decent

       I feel the same exact way. First with Jade Helm, and now with September 23rd. They hype it up and then when it comes down to it they're just on to the next conspiracy. I can't believe I let myself be bothered by these insane theories. Some of them have some shred of truth, but I'm done letting it affect how I live my life.

       The only benefit to come from this doomsday stuff is that it has helped me realise that life as we know it could actually end at any moment, and so I've made great effort to change the way I live to pursue what makes me happy all while being prepared to survive the worst if it ever does come. I'll probably hang around here for a few more days and see the 28th come and go as a 3rd strike for bullshit, then move on.

       That's a good way to look at it. The problem is, I took the opposite approach and it made me paranoid and depressed. Yes my eyes are open, but what can I do about it? But I like your perspective.

       This is the norm now.  I got caught up in all the 2012 stuff, then nothing happened.  The next year they said Planet X was coming in September, nothing happened.  I think every year someone predicts something bad will happen in September, like it's a conspiracy apocalypse holiday.  Nothing will happen, again.

       Actually seems like everything is happening in a small subtle way, and the disappointment here is people's hope for something extraodinary. Asteroids or some extinction level chaos. I will say that the stock market looks horrible, and Russia is one to watch as well as China. But the boy can only cry wolf so many times. Even if something does occur, we wont be prepared at this point anyway.

       I wasn't thinking something

       happen, so I definitely wouldn't include myself in the "people's hope for something extraordinary" part.

       I thought that it was supposed to be a financial crisis that would begin on the 23

       Something to do with the Jews manipulating the market so that they can begin their new cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sell off all their holding when the market is artificially high, then buy the artificially low gold and silver with their earnings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then wait a few months until PM's go nuts and stocks drop, sell off the now artificially high PM's and put all that "new" money into the market buying corporations at pennies on the dollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then do it all over again in 7 years.

       Even though nobody can predict when shit will hit the fan...I'm still pretty creeped out about events in syria. If ww3 will be starting soon. It's pretty much #1 on my list for information to look for on this sub. That and economic collapse. But time will tell.
