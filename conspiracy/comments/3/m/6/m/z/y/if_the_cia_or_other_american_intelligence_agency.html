<p>&quot;Training files of the CIA&#39;s covert &quot;Operation PBSUCCESS,&quot; for the 1954 coup in Guatemala. According to the National Security Archive: &quot;Among the documents found in the training files of Operation PBSUCCESS and declassified by the Agency is a CIA document titled &#39;A Study of Assassination.&#39; A how-to guide book in the art of political killing, the 19-page manual offers detailed descriptions of the procedures, instruments, and implementation of assassination.&quot; The manual states that to provide plausible denial, &quot;no assassination instructions should ever be written or recorded.&quot;[14]&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the C.I.A. did assassinate J.F.K., I&#39;m sure any documents directly linking the C.I.A. to the assassination would have been destroyed a long time ago. </p>

<p>In fact, say that the C.I.A. did in fact orchestrate the assassination, I don&#39;t think anything would have been documented in the run up to the assassination. </p>

<p>Similarly, if 9/11 was a demolition job orchestrated by the U.S. government, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to find any email exchanges between Donald Rumsfeld (or any other official figure) and a demolition company detailing Rumsfeld&#39;s request that the towers be destroyed in a massive clandestine operation. Same goes for any financial transaction that may have taken place associated with the individuals or organisation responsible for the alleged demolition job.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, the CIA is very top-down. &quot;The CIA killed Kennedy,&quot; imo, is essentially accurate. Or &quot;the intelligence community&quot; killed him. And, indeed, they&#39;re the only ones who had and have the power to cover it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree it was the good ole&#39; boys at the very top that conspired, but it is not accurate to lay the blame upon the entire agency. In doing so, your claims are reflexively dismissed by those who lack understanding of what you&#39;re getting at:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent point. CIA is not one entity, it is a number of groups of people who have various degrees of trust for each other. Not everyone in CIA came from Skull &amp; Bones. Further, not everyone from S&amp;B went on to be part of these groups. Further, not everyone involved with CIA has blatant ties to them.</p>

<p>That being said, it&#39;s a little difficult not to paint &#39;who did it&#39; as &quot;the CIA&quot;, considering everyone allegedly involved in the JFK plot was apart of the CIA in some fashion or another, and given the motives the CIA had (JFK had literally said he wanted to shatter the CIA into a 1000 pieces and scatter it to the wind). </p>

<p>Further, it&#39;s hard not to see the CIA as at least the gateway to the top, being that (damn near) every president we&#39;ve had since JFK has had CIA connections. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll be honest: I do believe America suffered a serious coup on Nov 22, 1963, and it&#39;s one we&#39;ve been struggling against ever since, and I think the people who put that coup in motion are still in power (or in power by proxy) today. </p>

<p>It&#39;s Kerry/Bush all over again: It doesn&#39;t matter who wins. Here&#39;s how I see it playing out:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Trump came in to distract the republicans and cause disarray. He isn&#39;t a &#39;Democrat plant&#39;, he&#39;s part of the system. He&#39;ll bow out when he&#39;s told to. Fiorina or Bush will take his place, both have strong CIA ties. </p></li>
<li><p>Bernie is there but no one is going to vote for him; DNC will put Hilary up. We all know Bernie doesn&#39;t even plan on winning, he&#39;s just rallying support for the future.</p></li>
<li><p>We now have a stacked ticket, either Bush v Clinton or more likely, Fiorina v Clinton. Two women on the ticket (hooray! History!<sup>™</sup> ) Two CIA-backed candidates on &#39;opposing sides&#39; (hooray! Business As Usual!). Queue 8 more years of dark wars.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. The Saudis would be a convenient new scapegoat for war when the defense contractors call for it. And it will probably be released when anyone who still questions what happened on 9/11 is too old.</p>

<p>Might even wait until <a href="http://www.trueactivist.com/dick-cheney-says-that-a-new-terrorist-attack-worse-than-911-coming-to-america/">Cheney&#39;s nuclear &quot;prediction&quot;</a> comes to fruition and &quot;find out&quot; the Saudis helped smuggle it in it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to think they&#39;ll be anything of use to 9/11 truth in there</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just for context, FTA:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Undermines the ability of 9/11 family members to achieve courtroom justice against governments who aided and abetted the deaths of their loved ones</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it too optimistic to suggest that if the families knew what their Government was and is still concealing, it might open them up to wonder what else and why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What theory? I just said that I suspect there would not be any official paper work detailing a C.I.A. conspiracy to assassinate the president. And in a similar vain, there wouldn&#39;t be any paperwork that shows a link between any U.S. government officials and the alleged demolition company that may have rigged the World Trade Centre.</p>

<p>I&#39;m basically saying that I doubt whoever may have been involved in an alleged plot to demolish the WTC would have schemed via email or any other unsecured communications. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Somebody in the comments referenced the wikipedia article on assassination which references: National Security Archive, CIA and Assassinations: The Guatemala 1954 Documents, Document 2: &quot;A Study of Assassination&quot;, Unsigned, Undated. <a href="http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB4/docs/doc02.pdf">Link</a></p>

<p>I read through the transcription which is dull as you imagine a document written by a government employee could possibly be. Has anybody read the photocopied typewritten document which is much harder to read to verify the accuracy of the transcription? On page ten of that sucker you could bury almost anything and nearly all readers&#39; eyes will be totally glazed by the time they get to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CIA <em>did</em> fabricate other documents, e.g. a letter supposedly written by Oswald in relation to the JFK murder. I can&#39;t remember the specific details, unfortunately, but the book in which I read about it, I mean the letter sounded like an obvious forgery. The book, for reference, was <em>JFK and the Unspeakable</em> by James W. Douglass. </p>

<p>Uh, as to why it wouldn&#39;t declassify those documents, as <a href="/u/TheVents">/u/TheVents</a> pointed out, it&#39;s sensible not to write down instructions which order an assassination. If you write it down, you&#39;re culpable. It&#39;s reasonable to assume that basic protocols applying to one covert operation would apply to other, similar operations. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m confused when people like Noam Chomsky seriously argue that there&#39;d be an &quot;internal record&quot; showcasing JFK&#39;s murder at the hands of CIA, if they were truly behind it. No, there wouldn&#39;t. Our limited knowledge of recognized covert operations mostly comes from heavily redacted, declassified and/or &quot;leaked&quot; documents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couple of things. 1. I don&#39;t know that anyone has actually made a good case that the CIA proper assassinated John Kennedy.  When people say CIA they mean people associated with, or still contracted by the CIA at that time.  That may mean people who were high up in the agency, but there is no way that there was a directive that would have been put down on paper, for example.  2.  Why would anyone ever put it in writing, and, if so, why wouldn&#39;t they just destroy them?  I know that there are documents that haven&#39;t been released yet, but there isn&#39;t a smoking gun in what hasn&#39;t been released, IMO.  Chances are that everything we would have had has already been destroyed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two things. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Documentation = Leverage. If documents are destroyed then leverage is lost. Think of it like how the creation of debt by Central Banks is the &quot;same thing&quot; as the creation of money. Evidence is currency that buys both silence and cooperation, mutual complicity becomes insurance. For further reading on this topic, there&#39;s a PBS Frontline Documentary on the Vatican Sex Scandals which outlines how &quot;Documentation = Leverage&quot; makes perfect sense in the halls of power. </p></li>
<li><p>CIA <em>had already been involved with covert regime change and assassination</em> by the time Kennedy was murdered, and in fact Kennedy made it clear how much he disapproved of what they were doing. <em>If</em> we look at Kennedy as a potentially &quot;Ultimate Whistleblower,&quot; then it doesn&#39;t seem out of the question for a covert agency, with a history of targetting prominent leaders who were bad for business, to have been involved with his murder.  </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent point. CIA is not one entity, it is a number of groups of people who have various degrees of trust for each other. Not everyone in CIA came from Skull &amp; Bones. Further, not everyone from S&amp;B went on to be part of these groups. Further, not everyone involved with CIA has blatant ties to them.</p>

<p>That being said, it&#39;s a little difficult not to paint &#39;who did it&#39; as &quot;the CIA&quot;, considering everyone allegedly involved in the JFK plot was apart of the CIA in some fashion or another, and given the motives the CIA had (JFK had literally said he wanted to shatter the CIA into a 1000 pieces and scatter it to the wind). </p>

<p>Further, it&#39;s hard not to see the CIA as at least the gateway to the top, being that (damn near) every president we&#39;ve had since JFK has had CIA connections. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll be honest: I do believe America suffered a serious coup on Nov 22, 1963, and it&#39;s one we&#39;ve been struggling against ever since, and I think the people who put that coup in motion are still in power (or in power by proxy) today. </p>

<p>It&#39;s Kerry/Bush all over again: It doesn&#39;t matter who wins. Here&#39;s how I see it playing out:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Trump came in to distract the republicans and cause disarray. He isn&#39;t a &#39;Democrat plant&#39;, he&#39;s part of the system. He&#39;ll bow out when he&#39;s told to. Fiorina or Bush will take his place, both have strong CIA ties. </p></li>
<li><p>Bernie is there but no one is going to vote for him; DNC will put Hilary up. We all know Bernie doesn&#39;t even plan on winning, he&#39;s just rallying support for the future.</p></li>
<li><p>We now have a stacked ticket, either Bush v Clinton or more likely, Fiorina v Clinton. Two women on the ticket (hooray! History!<sup>™</sup> ) Two CIA-backed candidates on &#39;opposing sides&#39; (hooray! Business As Usual!). Queue 8 more years of dark wars.</p></li>

<p>Also, why would the FBI know about Hitler in Argentina? Don&#39;t they operate within the US on domestic activities. Seems like skeptics would have a field day critiquing this evidence.</p>
