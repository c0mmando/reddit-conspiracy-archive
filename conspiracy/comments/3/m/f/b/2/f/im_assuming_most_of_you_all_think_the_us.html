        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>WARNING: I do not know exactly what I am talking about and I am willing to admit that.</p>

<p>Why do we not create nationwide panic that the Govt. has done something so unbelievably terrible that it causes a civil uproar and the people turn against the government? This is merely a very brief idea that needs to be worked out a lot more obviously. And this may be a stupid question to you all, but why not try it? I&#39;m still sort of new to Reddit but I do know that the people here are fantastic at organizing things. I mean if we don&#39;t do it, who else will? are we all just going to sit around and complain about all this bad shit or are we going to do something about it? Because I want to do something about it. I know this is my first post here and I know that I&#39;m ranting but there is nobody else to talk to about this. Everybody thinks I&#39;m nuts and that I just need to &quot;chill&quot;. But this is not something to &quot;chill&quot; about. I&#39;m 19, my future is at hand, My future childs future is at hand. There is no possible way that voting for anyone is going to fix anything. Voting in a corrupt system will only cause more corruption. We need a revolution. Thomas Jefferson said,&quot; Every generation needs a new revolution.&quot; Now is our time, more than ever. We need to stop being scared of losing and nothing happening, and just do it. Just think of other countries that might join the people of the US just because they realize as well the impending doom that we face. </p>

<p>I know this isn&#39;t really a conspiracy but it is a result of many. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>By using our actual voice. We all feel inclined to use the internet and media. We need to physically get up and make a change. We need to talk to people around us in our communities and inform them. Then at the community level, reach out to other communities. It&#39;s easy for them to control media and internet, why do you think its legal and &quot;free&quot;? But it&#39;s a bit harder to control when communities are joining and joining outside of the internet. We need to be creative with communication. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah there are all types of media too. The goal is to reach as many people as possible. </p>

<p>I think internet is part of it, but I could see graffiti (done right!) reaching a lot of people too. Esp with a QR code that goes to a webpage with more info. Or bumper stickers. T-shirts.</p>

<p>Or just a red/white/blue stripe to catch people&#39;s minds and draw them together. Use the &quot;color revolution&quot; idea against them for once.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll tell you why no one does anything about it....because the government has endless amounts of money and resources to use to pay off anyone who you trust, co-opt any movement that you start, and if necessary, concoct a reason or method to ruin your life or get rid of you.  All the major &#39;organizations&#39; out there today, the KKK, the black panthers, biker gangs, anarchist groups, they are all riddled with informants, so much so that I bet that they are constantly tripping over each other.  It&#39;s easy pickings for law enforcement, and they get extra attention when it comes time for funding if they step on your group a little extra at the behest of the feds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me you&#39;re not saying anything I don&#39;t already now. But If you stay low for a while while you bring the people together to fight. If you can raise enough awareness on the subject. Theres no point in fighting it because if you do there is no one to govern over and take money from. Like I said in another comment it&#39;s not going to happen over night. You can just wake up one day and beat the shit out of your mayor. You have to play your cards smart and know when to time yourself. The People are ready for a revolution. But not everyone is a leader. People need influence to help get them going.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are movements like this happening all over the country. To me it&#39;s just a sign, a sign WE are coming, taking back OUR country. It takes time. As I talk to more people from day to day I realize more are catching on..waking up. More government disdain, less trust in government. Media, right now, is the biggest obstacle. So many people are still eating that garbage. Another problem we will see is when anything revolutionary does form, naturally the government will do anything in their power to suppress it. </p>

<p>All I can say to you is patience, our time will come. Don&#39;t devote your entire life to &#39;expediting a revolution, as backwards as that may sound. Unless you have unique connections or skills, just wait and be ready. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would literally and honestly give my life for a cause I believe in. For something bigger than me, and bigger than just my family. The US covert diplomatic operations and foreign policy is an outrage and is killing millions of innocent people around the world. We are stripping countries of their natural resources, assassinating brave civil rights leaders, good political leaders, and installing puppet Governments in other nations. I think we need to wake up as a nation and unite. We need to realize that death is inevitable. When we confront the inevitability of death, all our superficial fears vanish. Fear of inadequacy, fear of failure, fear of what others think of us, all shrivel up when confronted with our irreversible mortality. I would rather sail and sink then to just stare at the ocean and wonder what kind of voyage I could make.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Yeah neoliberalism and multiculturalism is good in theory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People put these political labels on the idea of putting our problems aside and then use those labels as some sort of reason to knock down the concept when the fact of the matter is that this is nothing but a straw man fallacy and “neoliberalism” or whatever isn’t even what the real point is here.  It’s <em>way</em> more than anything like that alone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ive lost faith in the average person having more intelligence then the average monkey</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough, but stratifying the human race is about the LAST thing that will have any hope whatsoever of actually helping the human species.  If you really have “lost hope”, then don’t turn around and entertain any hope that we won’t continue being manipulated like slaves by TPTB.  The <em>only</em> way that we can overcome that heavy manipulation on us is if we all put down the racism and prejudice that has been indoctrinated in us and COME TOGETHER AS ONE SPECIES.  Otherwise, we need to just STFU and keep taking that gubmint boot up the ass.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>my only hope is a huge revolution where many die but possibly we can come out of it free. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How the heck can ANYONE possibly come out of it “free” if, as you said, “the average person is no more intelligent than the average monkey”?  That’s like…not making <em>any</em> sense whatsoever…you understand that, right?  I mean…if the average person is no more intelligent than the average monkey, then the people who would survive a war would be yet MORE monkeys that would be pissed off at each other for having fought and killed so many members of their family!  I mean come on.  And then they would simply keep the enmity between them of the crimes each committed during the long war together they had…and wait for the opportunity to simply continue fighting again.</p>

<p>The BEST way to deal with things is <em>internally</em>.  It’s by the population finding the way to put aside their faux differences - and those differences ARE very much faux.  And while I understand your reticence in considering “the average person as being nor more intelligent than the average monkey”, I myself personally DON’T think I’m any more intelligent than “the average person”, yet the fact that even <strong><em>I</em></strong> can come up with and think about these possibilities of togetherness lets me know that we <em>all</em> can.  If I can think about it and imagine it and visualize the possibility of us coming together, then I don’t think it’s beyond too many other people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Coming together as one&quot; didnt work for Jesus, didnt work for John Lennon, didnt work for Ghandi, didnt work for JFK or RFK, didnt work for MLK.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect.  It <em>did</em> work for them.  It just didn’t work for many of their followers, and there were clandestine forces that infiltrated and disrupted their teachings on top of it all - cointelpro was at work even then.  THAT’S what happened.</p>

<p>But you’re right enough in the sense that their ultimate plans didn’t work out.</p>

<p>So what’s the solution then?  To simply keep taking TPTB sausage up the poop shoot and remain separated, stratified, and manipulated like we have been?  Attempting to fight them like stupid animals certainly won’t work or solve our problems.</p>

<p>I’m <em>all</em> for fighting, mind you, but only if it is actually for a reason THAT WILL WORK - and unless the human race puts its problems aside FIRST, then any type of fighting ultimately <em>won’t</em> work.  That’s my point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The time for peaceful, non violent civil disobedience is past, it&#39;s time to go to some politicians houses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could not be more wrong about that.  What it’s REALLY time for is for people simply coming together and HELPING EACH OTHER INDEPENDENT OF THE SYSTEM.  <em>That’s</em> what will work.  And if enough people come together to do that, then the attempts that the politicians, etc will make to <em>stop</em> that WILL NOT WORK.</p>

<p>If the population wants to resort to defending itself against PTB attack with arms at that point, then I can understand that.  However, what you’re advocating is a dumb, mindless, brainless, chaotic attack, and the very reason you site for having lost faith (“humanity’s too stupid”) is the EXACT same reason why some sort of dumb ass, violent attack like this will absolutely NOT work.</p>

<p>Something better and more intelligent is what will be needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That does not seem certain. We are just limited in our thoughts of how country&#39;s have to run. But even if this repeated pattern is to occur once more, it wouldn&#39;t happen immediately. That is partially why I included Thomas Jefferson&#39;s quote. It seems about right that every generation should include a revolution. It would take a generations time for a corrupt government to come back around. But even with all of that being said are we just supposed to sit back and let this shit happen? It&#39;s only going to get worse and that is apparent.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am atheist but I do understand the power of belief. I don&#39;t begrudge anyone who believes in a higher power. I think that is amazing that you can devote your life to something like that. And whether you are theist or atheist the power of belief goes a long way. If you believe a revolution will not do anything, than it won&#39;t but it you take that leap of faith it makes a huge difference. And maybe it won&#39;t do anything.But how are you going to know %100 that it won&#39;t? I know it&#39;s more of the elite than anything else. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t, but i&#39;m wrapping the elite and government together as just the government. They&#39;re working hand in hand.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, if you&#39;re a social darwinism idiot, this is the perfect system for you. Get a desk job and some stock and have children in other countries make all your shit. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re actually interested in &quot;revolution&quot;, why? What are the things you really want changed? Find a country that already offers those things and attempt expatriation (you&#39;ll probably have to renounce citizenship though). </p>

<p>The US is an empire in decline. You can&#39;t &quot;coup&quot; an empire; they perpetrate all the coups. You can&#39;t successfully rebel without serious strategic help from world powers, either; and at present not even the combined militaries of the rest of the world can challenge US military might.  It&#39;s a waiting game as to how long it takes to fall apart and how bad things get before a new governing entity emerges. Collapse of an empire is a massive tidal wave, and it crushes any beaver dams of resistance. Best hope (if you can&#39;t evacuate) is to get a dingy and pray you can ride it out. </p>

<p>Watch some docs/read some books about past empires and you will notice some repeating themes. Rome is the commonest comparison to the world dominance of the US, and it took them centuries to collapse. Much of what we perceive as corruption is just the inevitable pillaging of resources from a dying empire.</p>
