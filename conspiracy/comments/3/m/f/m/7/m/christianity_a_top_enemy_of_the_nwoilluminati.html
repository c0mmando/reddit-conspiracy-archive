        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Before I sound like a Christian shill, let me clarify that I am a gay man in his 20s from the northeastern US who had always been liberal and &quot;religious but spiritual.&quot; I hated conservatism and anything religious because I saw it as close-minded and not with the times and illogic. (They often still are in my current view but let me get on with it.)</p>

<p>Earlier this month after being impressed with Ann Coulter&#39;s new book &quot;Adios America&quot; (I should also clarify that I am hispanic and son of immigrants who were illegal for a time but that it&#39;s nonetheless an important read for Americans), I started reading long snippets online of one of her earlier books called &quot;Godless: The Church of Liberalism.&quot;</p>

<p>In this book, Coulter posits that liberalism and Western secular humanism is a state-enforced religion, reaching from schools to the media and Hollywood, and that its founding belief is that there is no god; man is an accident on earth, and there are no &quot;morals,&quot; so, YOLO until you&#39;re dead. She says it&#39;s dogmatic in that it&#39;s not based in fact but arbitrariness that it defends sacrilegiously, citing evolution (more on that in the next sentence). She points out that Christianity is the butt of jokes (she&#39;s not wrong) due to its worship of a higher being, that evolution has been state-sanctioned despite not being wholly proven (I disagree to the extent that <em>natural selection</em> is an observable fact, but even Richard Dawkins in &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; says that man&#39;s appearance on earth is miraculous and basically could not have happened so soon), etc. She also points out sexual health classes and the separation of sex and reproduction for the sake of pleasure happening in the last few decades: whereas I had always seen it as simply a technological advance, she says it&#39;s at once arbitrary and ideological as it&#39;s in line with being immoral. In the spirit of &quot;the rich have secret society orgies&quot; this also is a parallel: we&#39;re naturally more sex- and pleasure-obsessed and less heart-centered as a result of our itching to fuck and access to sex.</p>

<p><strong>From the perspective of the elite&#39;s interests, what purpose does flaming Christianity serve?</strong> In the US it is not PC to criticize other religions such as Islam. Muslims aren&#39;t ridiculed for how they pray, what they believe, chant etc in movies like Christians are. It&#39;s okay and even PC to laugh at Christianity. Is it simply because it&#39;s the religion at home in the US? we have more experience with them? Or is it the very idea of there being a god, morals, a higher example to imitate, that are not on the elites&#39; schedule? Is the cross as powerful a symbol as earlier entertainment made it out to be?</p>

<p>If Coulter is onto something then this will be a new phase for my understanding of the world; my previous ones were (which you may have in common): 1) Elites are bad satanic masons like Icke says!, 2) actually maybe they are just part of a natural power structure and 666 and the baphomet are just the way of life and they are acting in their best occult interests and Lucifer is Apollo is God, 3) JK back to phase 1, now with rosaries!</p>

<p>In the spirit of going against dem bad guys, I just might go to church on Sunday. Take that, satan/baphomet/NWO!</p>

<p>Bonus: <a href="http://secretsun.blogspot.com/2008/01/clown-show-2008-whatever-happened-to.html">Here&#39;s</a> a cool article on Coulter involving secret society symbology: on the cover of Godless she makes an Egyptian goddess gesture, and on the cover of Time she imitates the pose of a pagan deity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your sentiment, and I agree with you. I must say that the variations of &quot;Christianity&quot; are broad (which is like the result of what I&#39;ll talk about in this comment), and that by your description in the post, that might only identify a specific type of Christian, which can be confusing in definition to some in this thread. I don&#39;t think TPTB have an issue with Christians that are obsessed with commercialism, as they do their part to buy things, burn gasoline, and consume. </p>

<p>I do believe that they have issue with the core message of Christianity, and when it&#39;s lived out according to the Bible, Christians. Christianity by its nature is actually very subversive to the status quo. I personally believe that there is a strong desire from powerful people to divide and conquer, to create war and division, that these ideas and the implementation of them, as well as debt and addictions to behavior or substance is important to maintain a public that is enslaved. Jesus came to set us free, and to be more free than anything or anyone on earth can offer- to be eternally free. When someone believes their soul is free, this life is temporary, and because they know Jesus they will live in eternal freedom, it is impossible to enslave that person.</p>

<p>I do believe that there is a strong occultic influence on the very powerful, and we know that overarching policy towards or against a philosophy or group trickles down from that. I also tend to believe that the active worship of many false gods found in the Bible still takes place today, and can be found in modern media quite often, and that events such as 9/11 are sacrifices to those gods. I even tend to believe that there is contact between the demonic world and very powerful people, and that a false version of eternal life has been offered to them, which is what drives them to execute their plan.</p>

<p>I believe that it will become increasingly difficult to live as a Christian in terms of pressure from society, and likely at some point, governmental systems themselves. This has happened many times in the past, is happening currently in some countries, and will happen on a larger scale eventually in western nations as well.</p>

<p>Edit: if I may, I have a couple suggestions in terms of speakers to listen to. Ravi Zacharias is a fantastic speaker that addresses postmodernism and how Christianity measures against other philosophies, and Terry Bennett is a speaker that is very aware of conspiratorial notions and speaks the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your post and references! I&#39;ve read most of David Icke&#39;s &quot;The Biggest Secret&quot; and found most of what you were saying very congruent to him, but something he mentions is that there are in fact gods and that&#39;s what the Bible is actually referring to but it&#39;s been translated incorrectly. Not sure if you&#39;ve heard that or what your thoughts are (you mentioned the false gods, not sure if you think they&#39;re real or not); looking forward to checking out the sources you mentioned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t read The Biggest Secret, but I am familiar with David Icke&#39;s work. I don&#39;t want to speak for him in reference to what he says in his book as I haven&#39;t read it, but the Bible is full of references to &quot;powers and principalities&quot; and a hierarchy of demons and demonic operatives that have limited supernatural power. I personally believe that they are capable of offering a counterfeit of something (wealth, virility, wisdom, whatever it is the god offers) but that the consequences are not only heavily weighted in their favor, but that by taking part in relationship with them, you miss out on having a relationship with the true God who provides so much more, and truly loves us, and created us so that we can know Him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The church has been a sellout for a good while at large. But aside the institution, the christian values are pretty toxic to the elite ones.</p>

<p>&quot;Satan&quot; ( as: those ready to compromize with them for their desires, in a degree scale ) is easily manipulated.
&quot;God&quot; ( as: those who don&#39;t want to compromize with the &quot;devil&quot; and live a moral life ) is easily neutralized/silenced.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not religious, but these 2 concepts are very central to society and not to miss. The enemy of satan is god ( aka: the enemy of the elite is social order which they can&#39;t sneak in and break ) </p>

<p>This won&#39;t be possible following god ways alone. Would just get ridiculed and silenced as naive.</p>

<p>Refuse the goal of the enemies, but understand that in the process of challenging them, it will eventually be necessary to adopt their means ( trickery ). </p>

<p>I&#39;m  a harsh critic of secular humanism myself (I view it as intellectually dishonest), but that&#39;s hardly the philosophy behind it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Whereas the left is brainwashed to make laws, the right is brainwashed to fight the wars. Christianity is a very powerful tool for the Elites. Any institutions with enough people, a hierarchical power structure, and a dogmatic ideology-nearly all religions qualify- are powerful tools. Infiltrate the power structure and the subservient followers are corrupted.   </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a Christian, I am not a fan of victim complexes, and I mentioned that other religions like Islam are <em>not</em> PC to mock, who also worship a higher being. I should&#39;ve been more specific in that phrasing, but I think we can all agree that The Simpsons can make a run on the funny Christian neighbors, but not That Silly-Ridiculous Muslim Next Door. (Yes there are foreigners with their own faiths in that show but it&#39;s not their faiths they&#39;re mocking.) I&#39;m doing just fine with Christianity being made fun of, I&#39;m just wondering why particularly that religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t mean that you had a victim complex, I was referring to the Christian victim complex, as demonstrated by Ann Coulter. I should have made that more clear. </p>

<p>Remember, the president claims to be christian. nearly all of congress, probably most judges, most of mainstream media, they&#39;re all christian. There aren&#39;t as many Muslims in America as Christians and it&#39;s not even close. </p>

<p>There isn&#39;t any other religion in America that has close to the cultural impact and influence as Christianity. It&#39;s just the most pervasive. It makes sense that Christianity should be attacked more in America because it&#39;s by far the biggest target to aim at. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with what you say, and I had almost forgotten that presidents basically &#39;have&#39; to say they&#39;re Christian, which leads me to this realization: perhaps the &#39;attacks&#39; on Christianity are actually more from young people.</p>

<p>But why is it being attacked so much? It&#39;s almost attacked as much as many Americans attack the American flag. I might be in a very liberal part of the country now but I don&#39;t see that it&#39;s the sanest thing to do socially to out yourself as a Christian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well Christians haven&#39;t nuked anyone (that we know of) since &#39;45 (possibly 2001). This is a very short span of time in the history of Christianity. It&#39;s noteworthy that Christians are the <em>only</em> religious group that has adherents who have used nuclear attacks thus far in history (that we know of) </p>

<p>If you&#39;re asking about Christians that do beheadings in the modern day? Ever heard of the <a href="http://www.irinnews.org/report/81486/uganda-alice-i-saw-my-friend-being-beheaded-and-his-body-cut-up">Lord&#39;s Resistance Army</a>? #kony2012</p>

<p>Pretty sure the Ku Klux Klan explicitly self-identify as a Kristian group. Also The Army of God, Eastern Lightning, The Phineas Brotherhood, etc.</p>

<p>I guess the most obvious example would be the United States government, which- while legally a secular body- is in reality a Christian one (97% of congress christian = christian congress; &gt;70% of military christian,  commander-in-chief christian= christian military)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Harry Truman was a Christian and he ordered the nuclear strike, the crew of the Enola Gay that actually dropped the bomb (and are on record as having not regretted) were Christians, and as for the KKK: NTS fallacy. if you&#39;re allowed to say that the kkk isn&#39;t christian than muslims are allowed to say that ISIS isn&#39;t Islamic. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t been speaking in circles, I&#39;ve been speaking in facts. You think you&#39;re debating me, but you&#39;re really just debating facts. I know that&#39;s frustrating for some people.</p>

<p>If my claims are idiotic then prove it. Shouldn&#39;t be hard to prove me wrong, genius. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well then i guess u have everything u need to hate christians, i hope it works out for u. and as for thinking you have facts, the fact is ur going on what people think is fact but the truth is that neither u or i have actually known these people on a personal level to know if they were true christians or not, but im sure that will mean nothing to u
 i get that what these people did is fact but ur talking circles around what this debate started on which is people being true christians or not, remember? there is no way for u to truly know if they are christians but u will persecute christians anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said I hate christians. And lmao @ me persecuting them. How have I persecuted christians? All I did was point out that christians don&#39;t have the moral high ground over muslims. You read too far into things my friend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not talking about Jews so that&#39;s irrelevant. </p>

<p>And who makes christians the butt of jokes? Is there some official tally of jokes made and christians were mocked the most by far? How did you determine that? pray tell.</p>

<p>You are also reading too much into what I said. All I said was that christians are not less dangerous than muslims. And they&#39;re not.</p>

<p>100% of terrorist attacks on the US, whether embassies, our two attacks on the World Trace Center (&#39;93 and &#39;01), or other airline-related terrorist attacks were by Muslims.</p>

<p>&quot;One hundred percent of terrorist attacks on commercial airlines based in America for 20 years have been committed by Muslims. When there is a 100 percent chance, it ceases to be a profile. It&#39;s called a &#39;description of the suspect.&#39;&quot;</p>
