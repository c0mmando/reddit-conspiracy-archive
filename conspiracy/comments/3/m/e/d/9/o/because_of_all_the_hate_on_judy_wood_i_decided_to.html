<li><p>She is extremely careful not  to make statements that are not heavily backed up. The seismic data is a good example.

<p>Point is simple, she checks out as legit. Again, i am not saying she is right, but there is no god damn way she is controlled opposition or any of that horseshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Her <em>approach</em> is the only one that covers <strong>all</strong> of the <em>field of destruction and debris</em>. She doesn&#39;t say No nukes or No Thermite. She presents as, thoughtful, steady and gracious, simply not knowing what to <em>name</em> what she <em>observes</em>.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve often thought, never vocalized my concern that she&#39;s discounted because she&#39;s nerdy, frumpy and female. Her web-site isn&#39;t <em>tight</em> but it&#39;s navigable. </p>

<p>Found her presentation some years back while searching for an explanation to pyroclastic flow. Then too, the cylindrical holes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not stuck in any one <em>theory</em>. For those of you that hold out for the DEW being years out before 9/11 do your own research and add your bits to the discussion!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe nukes are more plausible than most of the explanations, though I don&#39;t rule any other possibilities like directed-energy weapons (DEWs) or other explanations out. In my view, however, controlled demolition by thermite seems highly unlikely considering that a demolition would have left much more physical debris than what we saw, which was tons of dust, pulverized material, and just <em>some</em> horrifically twisted pieces of metal. Additionally, <a href="https://youtu.be/M3ZkoNF2ybg">thermite causes a super-bright, fireball-like reaction</a>, and we definitely didn&#39;t see two pillars of fire falling. I feel as though controlled demolition was actually used on WTC7 in order to more easily spread the idea that the Twin Towers were brought down in the same way. That day is still too painful for most to keep investigating, so they&#39;ll usually stop searching once they hear of the easy explanation of controlled demolition. Never mind the fact that controlled demolitions do not act the way that the towers did when they fell. Even in saying all that, I&#39;m more than willing to be wrong.

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t get to it, actually. Spent the weekend with my family. But I have read a few discussions recently on nuclear/energy weapons on 9/11 and it seems like total bullshit. When people present these ideas, they ignore a lot of the confirmed evidence (like thermite presence). It seems like a thing pushed by shills to discredit legitimate 9/11 theories (so they can associate &quot;9/11 truthers&quot; with this and make us seem even crazier to blue pills).</p>

<p>The nuclear thing is total, total bullshit. I can go into it if you want. The use of energy weapons seems completely implausible, at a glance, but I have to look into it so I can know <em>why</em>.</p>

<p>The only reason I read her book was so many people seemed irrationally and vehemently opposed to her research that it piqued my interest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are videos on YouTube and howtos in the web of homemade DIY induction forges, </p>

<p>and there are people who say it is utterly impossible/improbable that technology not advertised on TV played a role in the &quot;collapse&quot; of the Twin Towers. </p>

<p>There are videos on YouTube of a guy concocting his own thermate and shaped charges in his backyard and cuts steel columns apart, </p>

<p>and there are people who say it is utterly impossible that some skunk works lab invented a way to swiftly and silently rig a skyscraper with thermitic charges. </p>

<p>Do we interpret the &quot;truth&quot; in &quot;truth movement&quot; as &quot;we know the truth&quot; or as &quot;we would like to know the truth about what happened on 9/11 because it is clear that the official investigation was a farce, a cover-up, and blatant crime in itself&quot;?</p>

<p>I think the latter is the better interpretation, from a standpoint of intellectual honesty, and the best approach is to look at <em>all</em> the facts and evidence, whether they endorse our favourite pet theory or not, and that includes the evidence as presented by Judy Wood AND the evidence as presented by A&amp;E AND the evidence as presented by the nook guy AND the evidence as presented by NIST. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every theory can be judged on objective criteria. A &quot;DEW&quot; explanation is no different. The nice thing about Dr. Judy Wood&#39;s theory is that it is purportedly falsifiable. </p>

<p>That is, in concept her claim that some kind of &quot;Directed Energy Weapon&quot; was used to destroy the towers is a testable claim. The very first thing a scientist would do to test that claim is pull out a pencil, paper, calculator, spreadsheet and run the energy equation to see if it is indeed possible.</p>

<p>This is where Dr. Wood&#39;s theory first fails. Now keep in mind, she fails because she won&#39;t do the calculation, not because the calculation is impossible to do.</p>

<p>She claims, and has not budged, that she doesn&#39;t need to do any stinking calculations, because that would be ascribing assumptions to her claim, and she bounds her claims by saying she doesn&#39;t make assumptions. In other words, &quot;quit asking questions about my theory.&quot; That is the primary sign of a bullshit theory: unable or unwilling to test it in the most basic, inexpensive way possible, by running some numbers through known equations to get some kind of approximation of the energy requirements of a &quot;DEW&quot;.</p>

<p>Dr. Wood fights this process and the suggestion of it at every opportunity. Why would that be? Why would a materials engineer or any kind of rational human being looking into this theory avoid even attempting that calculation? Why does she become defensive every time someone suggests this simple step in the analysis?</p>

<p>Her examples of evidence include the photograph of WTC1 (I believe) which upon collapse at the very top of the building is somehow indicative of a &quot;snowball&quot; to her.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the orange-red metal being pulled out of the wreckage which she refers to as a &quot;cheeto.&quot; The purpose of that seems only as an attempt to un-know the fact that there&#39;s a very hot piece of metal in the picture. When asked what she thinks it really is, she says &quot;we can&#39;t make assumptions.&quot; Well isn&#39;t that a convenient place to draw that arbitrary distinction? The fact of molten metal is not in doubt by any serious investigator. The amount of evidence for the existence of copious amounts of molten metal is insurmountable. </p>

<p>She introduces the term &quot;dustification&quot; to describe the &quot;possible&quot; effects of a DEW device, but refuses to give any kind of operational definition of that process. She is also not interested in any kind of test to see if &quot;dustification&quot; is possible even in concept. I thought she didn&#39;t want to make any assumptions? However, positing the existence of &quot;dustification&quot; is a major assumption with no precedent and not even a theoretical definition. Why is that OK, when she doesn&#39;t even want to introduce the possibility of molten metal? </p>

<p>That&#39;s not just an arbitrary distinction, it is willfully dismissive of verifiable evidence. That&#39;s not just bad science, it&#39;s anti-scientific.</p>

<p>So in essence, Dr. Wood has made a suggestion on the level with Young Earth Creationism. There&#39;s no good explanation for it; it doesn&#39;t comport with the overall mass of evidence; no one else has come to any similar conclusions; she avoids making the strongest case for her suggestion; and ultimately there isn&#39;t enough harnessable energy to break so many strong bonds with any kind of beam weapon known to man.</p>

<p>On another note, her initial analysis of the speed of the collapses is a great piece of work, (which incidentally is no where to be found on her website), and it gave me hope that the scientific community would not accept the official explanation. After that work, who knows what exactly happened, but likely she was shown a big stick and a big carrot and given a choice. </p>

<p>As an observation, there are a metric shit-tonne of analysis videos on yt, we all know. What&#39;s interesting is how the DEW videos became much more high-production value than most others over the last 6 or 7 years. Just an observation.</p>

<p>Then I just shook my head in disbelief. The buildings collapsed under the stress of their own weight after TH3 was used to cut through the main support columns. You say that &quot;thermite doesn&#39;t do that&quot; so perhaps you&#39;d better explain that to the military, who have for decades been using it to blow holes through tank armour.</p>

<p>Not only was the thermite discovered by independent scientists (who published a peer-reviewed paper about it), but NIST specifically did not check for any type of explosives residue. If it was a cover up (which obviously it was), then there would be no reason not to test for explosives residue unless explosives had been used.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying NIST didn&#39;t look for evidence of explosives because there wasn&#39;t any evidence of explosives?</p>

<p>In fact, it&#39;s much worse than that, because you seem to be saying that hundreds of eye witness reports of explosives and three exploding buildings is not &quot;corroborating evidence of explosives&quot;.</p>

<p>Please explain in your next reply why you believe you are not a complete intellectual retard. Explain your answer in depth.</p>

<p>Actually, they did discover thermite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can the &quot;official story&quot; combustion (fire / jet fuel) account for the VOCs measured at Ground Zero? No.</p>

<p>Can thermite? Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4</a></p>

<p>&quot;The occurrence of such extreme, sharp spikes in VOCs in air at GZ indicate something other than the behavior of a typical structure fire. Oxygen influx as a result of shifting of materials within the pile might have created an increase in combustion of material in localized areas. But these spikes in VOCs, at levels thousands of times higher than seen in other structure fires, suggest extremely violent but short-lived fire events. Probably the most striking spike in toxic air emissions, found in EPA monitoring data, occurred on 9th February, 2002. Note (Table 1 ) that this was nearly 5 months after 9/11, and after nearly all the debris had been cleared from GZ. In fact, the levels of some species, like toluene and styrene, were some of the highest observed at the site. But the levels of benzene and propylene detected on that day were far above previous measurements, at 610,000 and 990,000 ppb, respectively. Other VOCs were measured at their peak levels on this date, including 1,3-butadiene at 400,000 ppb.&quot; &quot;EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion. Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite&quot;</p>

<p>LOL.</p>

<p>I remember watching a supposed video &quot;debate&quot; between Gage and some lying idiot who tried to &quot;debunk&quot; him by claiming he&#39;d only found paint. Gage was patient for a while, but pretty soon he realised the other guy was a plant. That&#39;s when Gage asked him if paint is usually highly explosive. Lol.</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;m familiar with his &quot;criticisms&quot; of the Harrit paper from previous discussions I&#39;ve had with faithers. I remember being amazed at how dishonest his comments were. He accused Harrit of not having a verifiable chain of custody for his samples despite him releasing the names and addresses of the people who provided them as part of his paper. He even discounted a fifth sample with identical results to the other four because the person who sent it to his lab declined to have his personal details published.</p>

<p>No, they didnt. </p>

<p>They discovered powered aluminum and iron oxide. They then explained that those elements are what is used to make thermite. They did not discover any thermite compound that was mixed together. They didnt find any containment devices needed to hold the thermite at an angle that could cut the heavy steel, they didnt find any control wires, initiating incendiaries or anything else needed to make thermite reactive.

    <div class="md"><p>Instead of blindly swallowing and spitting out obvious talking points that have been put out by the government trying to justify their version, why don&#39;t you let science do the the talking.   The questions you have left off your list is...</p>

<p>Has the NIST report (the version you are trying to say is reality) been peer reviewed by academia and the scientific community?  I will save you the trouble of looking up the answer.  It is  &quot;NO&quot;, it has not.</p>

<p>Ok, now I&#39;m sure you would follow up with, &quot;what evidence was there of controlled demolition&quot;, and &quot;how many papers on controlled demolition have been peer reviewed?&quot;</p>

<p>Good question, I&#39;m glad you asked that and gave the obvious soft ball and easy questions for the independent investigator to totally obliterate your initial argument....</p>

<p>First off, the signs of controlled demolition are....</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Rapid onset of the building destruction and the fact they came down at nearly free fall speed.</p></li>
<li><p>Mid-air pulverization of concrete, metal, and everything for that matter.  That does not occur during a &quot;collapse.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>The total destruction of the towers including the majority undamaged portion of the building, including beams like <a href="http://i.imgur.com/mLvSnmp.jpg">this.</a>  Explain how office fires caused beams like that to fail.</p></li>
<li><p>Office fires do not explain the <a href="http://www.bollyn.com/public/Molten_Metal_Cascading_from_South_Tower_small.jpg">molten metal</a> found weeks after the event.  NIST does not attempt to explain or acknowledge that fact.  In fact, they actually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcqf5tL887o">bold face lie about it.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Despite your claims, there were iron sphere&#39;s found all through the dust. That <strong><em>IS</em></strong> evidence of thermite or thermate, or some combination of them.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple ton sections and beams were ejected laterally, which requires much more energy than a gravity driven collapse.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4mDzgSP.jpg">slightly upwards and outwards direction</a> of the debris during the &quot;collapse&quot;.  Gravity works pulling down, not outward last time I checked.</p></li>
<li><p>The demolition waves or &quot;dust puffs&quot; 20 to 40 stories below the demolition line.  The argument that those are compressed air have been thoroughly debunked and a total joke.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8oXH9TdDuc">Here is a video of what appears to be a person ejected</a> through one of the &quot;dust puffs&quot; that was totally before the &quot;collapse&quot;.  And totally destroys the compressed air argument. </p></li>
<li><p>Massive volume of expanding pyroclastic flows.</p></li>
<li><p>Everything was turned to dust with the exception of the steel and paper.</p></li>
<li><p>The destruction went through the greatest path of resistance.</p></li>
<li><p>Over 100 reports by first responders of explosions and flashes going off in the buildings.  Including reports from William Rodrogiuez who stated there was an explosion just prior to the first plane impact below him when he was in the basement.</p></li>
<li><p>Look at the following <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/mirrors/guardian2/wtc/north-tower.gif">gif.</a>  Notice that the top part has turned to dust by the time it reaches the demolition wave.   With that being said, what could possibly pile drive its way through 80+ floors of undamaged building?  Organized dust that turned the rest of the building to dust?  That is the argument you are making.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Gee, I wonder why main stream scientists have yet to jump on board NIST&#39;s version of the destruction of the towers.</p>

<p>Finally, to address your other question, how many papers on controlled demolition of the towers have been peer reviewed.... Last time I checked, there were MANY.  Not one, two, or three.. MANY.  NIST&#39;s report should have been the first to be peer reviewed or peer reviewed before it was released.  You can&#39;t peer review junk science.  Or duplicate anything NIST states with experiment or scientific method.</p>

<p>I do like the way you have played the antithesis to the truth movement and presented easy to almost idiotic points to address.  That is brilliant move as far bringing people into the truth movement, and I like the way you think.</p>

<p>Only through exposing how idiotic the official theory is with the points you brought up can we expose and prosecute the ones responsible.  You sir are a patriot and a champion of the truth movement.  Well played.</p>

<p>**EDIT The fact that no steel framed structure had ever collapsed due to fire, and given that knowledge the fact that NIST did not even test for explosives of any type speaks to intelligence or lack there of during their investigation process.  Actually the destruction of the evidence was criminal.  <a href="https://youtu.be/kxGB2YoGV-I?t=58s">Here a former FDNY speaks to the credibility of the investigation.</a></p>

<p><strong>But intriguingly, his evidence will also include a sample of dust.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The dust evidence is crucial to understand why the World Trade Center 7 (WTC7) imploded seven hours after the 9/11 attacks on New York City in 2001, according to Niels Harrit.</strong></p>

<p><strong>“I will bring in a dust sample, and drag a magnet along the plastic bag. The little black rim around the rim of the magnet, these are the iron spheres with iron content, and this is specific for WTC dust, “ he says.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The dust thereby shows traces of the use of thermite, an incendiary whose chemical reaction ramps up temperatures to 2500 centigrade, enough to cut thorugh steel columns.

<p>So why exactly did they conclude that they&#39;d found evidence of nano-thermite? How did their paper pass scientific peer-review if it was wrong? Powdered aluminium, iron oxide and sulphur (which they also found) are the chemical components of nano-thermite. </p>

<p>It&#39;s exactly the same as me finding cake and you claiming that there is no cake, only the ingredients for cake, and that this disproves cake.</p>

<p>That&#39;s quite the claim. Do you have any evidence?</p>

<p>Oh wait. Of course you don&#39;t. Lol. You&#39;re only here to tell lies and throw as much mud as you can at people, hoping that some of it might stick. </p>

<p>Except iron spheres can occur whenever two pieces of iron are scraped together - like when a 110 story building collapses. Or when TWO 110 story buildings collapse. You can also produce iron spheres by putting steel in a fire. Not very conclusive evidence there!</p>

<p><strong>The reviewer&#39;s name is Prof. David L. Griscom.   Among his impressive credentials, Prof. Griscom is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and a Fellow of the AAAS.  I quote a brief excerpt from his blog and encourage you to read all of it:......</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;The 2009 publication in The Open Chemical Physics Journal (TOCPJ) of a fabulous paper by Harrit et al. entitled “Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe” Some disparagers of the 9/11 Truth movement have alleged that TOCPJ is a place on the web where anybody can buy a publication without peer review. Absolutely false! I know this because I was one of the referees of the Harrit et al. paper. The editors asked for my opinion. And after about two weeks of studying what the authors had written, checking relevant references, and gathering my thoughts, I finally provided my advice to authors in 12 single-spaced pages, together with my recommendation to the Editors that they publish the paper after the authors had considered my suggestions. Still, some skeptical readers may ask how anyone can rate a scientific paper as “fabulous.” Well, I am the principal author of 109 papers (and a co-author of an additional 81) in peer-review journals. And have refereed a least 600, and possibly as many as 1000, manuscripts. So you would be right in calling me an aficionado of articles published in scientific journals. And I found absolutely nothing to criticize in the final version of the Harrit et al. paper! Apropos, twelve of my own publications have appeared in the American Institute of Physics’ Journal of Chemical Physics (an old fashioned paper journal), so it is accurate to say that chemical physics (of inorganic materials) is my main specialty.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Please explain why you ignored that I just pointed out she was proven to have been lying. She claimed the paper was &quot;not her field of expertise&quot; and Professor Harrit proved she was lying by doing nothing more complicated than listing her bibliography contained on her own website:-</p>

<p><strong>After the paper entitled &quot;Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center
Catastrophe,&quot; which I along with eight colleagues co-authored, was published in the Open Chemical Physics
Journal, its editor-in-chief, Professor Marie-Paule Pileni, abruptly resigned. It has been suggested that this
resignation casts doubt on the scientific soundness of our paper.</strong></p>

<p><strong>However, Professor Pileni did the only thing she could do, if she wanted to save her career. After resigning, she
did not criticize our paper. Rather, she said that she could not read and evaluate it, because, she claimed, it lies
outside the areas of her expertise.</strong></p>

<p><strong>But that is not true, as shown by information contained on her own website (<a href="http://www.sri.jussieu.fr/pileni.htm">http://www.sri.jussieu.fr/pileni.htm</a>).
Her List of Publications reveals that Professor Pileni has published hundreds of articles in the field of nanoscience
and nanotechnology. She is, in fact, recognized as one of the leaders in the field. Her statement about her ”major
advanced research” points out that, already by 2003, she was ”the 25th highest cited scientist on nanotechnology” (<a href="http://www.sri.jussieu.fr/pileni.htm">http://www.sri.jussieu.fr/pileni.htm</a>).</strong></p>

It&#39;s pretty clear the tornadoes pick up the trailers. 
And she talks about experiments that no one has ever been able to replicate. and the &quot;facts&quot; she uses aren&#39;t even indicative a nuclear reactions or anything. like her holes in windows and peeling paint and ratios of zinc and copper and how some aluminum that got blown the fuck up doesn&#39;t look quite right.

    <div class="md"><p>I see her as limited hangout, intended to catch the folks who see beyond AE911Truth (thermite alone, nevermind the dust/radiation), but haven&#39;t figured out the nuclear demolition yet. (Hello &quot;ground zero&quot;...) Of course somebody in such a role is going to need a legit back story -- the folks running the show are <em>at least</em> as smart as you or me.</p>

<p>I mean I guess it&#39;s <em>possible</em> that DEW were used, but they don&#39;t account for the huge craters, the hotspots for months, the ground shaking just prior to building collapse, or the radiation poisoning of WTC first responders.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t hurt to look into it though; I checked it out myself. She does have one of the best collections of photos out there, so it&#39;s worth exploring just for that.</p>

<p>You know what&#39;d be cool is to have a big chart, with various aspects that this or that theory explains or doesn&#39;t explain.</p>

<p>What&#39;d be cooler is to move beyond the &quot;how&quot; and get to the &quot;who&quot;...  arrest the known suspects and hold very public trials. Might be the only thing to save this country.</p>

<p>edit: OP, so you saw the hate on Judy Wood and dug deeper, right? Check out the hate on nuclear demolition.</p>

<p>I have not formed a theory at all but my guess, and it is just a guess, is it was probably a mix of all of them. That is why they found thermite, that is why there were &quot;bombs&quot; going off, that is why the cars were &#39;toasted&#39;, that is why people were jumping to their deaths from floors that were unaffected by fires and rescue personnel were saying &quot;stay put, we are on the way&quot;.</p>

<p>That is why the fires were burning for weeks.</p>

<p>Here is a totally unsubstantiated theory...</p>

<p>Remote Controlled Planes + Directed Energy Weapons + a final Nuclear Explosion =  No more buildings</p>

<p>IMHO, you are stuck on the Nuke Theory much like Gage is stuck on Nano.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was actually pretty content with nanothermite (or just thermite) until Judy Woods&#39;s videos came along and.. she&#39;s right: the whole damned building turned to dust. WTF? I thought the DEW idea was pretty far-fetched, but it was clear there was something unexplained going on. I was in a sort of &quot;I&#39;m really not sure what happened&quot; limbo.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until I just mentioned, in passing, that &quot;hey who knows maybe the &#39;93 bombing gave an opportunity to plant nukes in the basements...&quot; and I just got <em>bombarded</em> with downvotes and a mocking TopMinds thread was immediately spawned... that I looked into it farther. It wasn&#39;t a &quot;meh, dumb idea&quot; downvote -- it was a &quot;<strong>shut him up! Counter-attack!!</strong>&quot; response. And that response, like OP, spurred me to look forward. And I found some fantastic information, which I&#39;ve been sharing over the past week or two.</p>

<p>I mean, take this thread: 18 comments, 32 upvotes. Really not that bad. I literally had threads with 90+ comments, 0 upvotes. They <strong>Do Not Want</strong> us talking about nuclear demolition. I reckon there&#39;s a reason for that.</p>

<p>But Reddit dynamics aside, nukes explain things that are missing with the DEW theory and with the thermite or nanothermite theory -- and the reverse is not true. I&#39;m not seeing any major holes in it beside being called nasty names if you post about it.</p>

<p>Of course I can&#39;t totally rule out microwave DEW or nanothermite or whatever; I just don&#39;t see anything at 9/11 that conventional explosives + nuclear devices doesn&#39;t explain.</p>

<p>FWIW, there&#39;s reports down here in Central America of people being reduced to <em>puddles</em> when the US invaded Panama back in the day. I don&#39;t even know what that would be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you place food in your microwave and cover it with a paper towel or paper plate those items do not burn/ignite but the food gets piping hot. </p>

<p>r/timo1200 is pointing out the people that were stripping off their clothing not from fire induced heat but that they were being <em>micro-waved</em> internally.  </p>

<p>Same thing was claimed in Fallujah. People were burnt, shrunk, metals toasted but the clothing didn&#39;t burn, nor paper or flora/fauna.</p>

<p>In high rise fires, you wet down cloth, get low and cover yourself. The woman on the 9/11 call was burning up, no smoke, no acrid smells... She was being micro-waved or nuked, semantics at this point, because TPTB bastards destroyed the crime scene!</p>

<p>In support of mini-nukes, shadows were burned into the ground... </p>

<p>Honestly, I posit all three theories and hope to encourage open discussion as opposed to the PHD prima-donna aspects of 9/11 <strong>TRUTH</strong>. </p>

<p>Perhaps you and I can discuss the premise that large structures are built and designed, pre-wired for eventual demolition...</p>

<p>That is a theory.</p>

<p>We can include mini-nukes as part of that design-build. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t get to it, actually. Spent the weekend with my family. But I have read a few discussions recently on nuclear/energy weapons on 9/11 and it seems like total bullshit. When people present these ideas, they ignore a lot of the confirmed evidence (like thermite presence). It seems like a thing pushed by shills to discredit legitimate 9/11 theories (so they can associate &quot;9/11 truthers&quot; with this and make us seem even crazier to blue pills).</p>

<p>The nuclear thing is total, total bullshit. I can go into it if you want. The use of energy weapons seems completely implausible, at a glance, but I have to look into it so I can know <em>why</em>.</p>
