    <div class="md"><p>Nothing major. </p>

<p>But something majorly minor enough that some people will still try to insist that the prophecy was fulfilled. In the last week or so, I&#39;ve noticed many of the prophets moving away from &quot;major financial meltdown / severe doom and gloom&quot; and towards &quot;something bad&quot; happening today. Or this week. Or before the end of the month. </p>

<p>Yaaaaay, goalposts on wheels. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I think most of them have been careful to say it is something that will happen <em>around</em> this time ,or that it will be the start of the downfall and not necessarily something that you can pinpoint to one day.</p>

<p>I think the market dip last month was enough for most of them to consider their prediction right though.</p>

And I fucking love how people&#39;s defense to others saying nothing will happen is &quot;ITS NOT GONNA HAPPEN SPECIFICALLY ON THE 23RD BUT UHH ITS GONNA BE THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly what it is. They don&#39;t want to have to drive to their shitty ass jobs or pay bills anymore so they constantly hope something will happen which will grind society to a halt so they can &quot;bug out&quot;.  Now don&#39;t get me wrong I believe in preparedness and having a bit of food stock, water and firewood put away in case the power goes out in mid-February for a week, or some other disaster. But the sick assholes that HOPE for calamity so they can &quot;grab their mags&quot; and head to the wooded hills for their 3-day apocalypse adventure weekend can fuck right off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you be so pissed at preppers? They see a volatile, unsustainable situation in world, and they&#39;re preparing accordingly. </p>

<p>There are so many reasons to prepare for future disaster. Don&#39;t assume everyone is doing it to get out of their day jobs and to bring more excitement into their lives. Reddit and the internet are not as good a gauge of reality as you think. </p>

<p>Having said that, there are definitely those out there who are hoping for disaster to strike, I get that. But again, don&#39;t assume they&#39;re saying that because they are bored with life. There are many out there who genuinely believe that not only is disaster inevitable, but it&#39;s necessary if we are to have any hope for real change. </p>

<p>But hey, just my opinion.  </p>

That has not been my experience and I watch it religiously, gold, oil, and the sp500 like its my own personal religious experience.

I believe the markets are going farther but I always wait for confirmation of my thoughts and don&#39;t pick tops or bottoms. You are dead on with your comment about the fed.</p>

As I type this, they are meeting now for 45 minutes behind closed doors after a welcoming ceremony. </p>

<p>Oh such a happy day, such happy speeches.</p>

<p>What today symbolizes, is not &quot;doomsday&quot;. </p>

<p>What today is, is the beginning of the end. The &quot;end&quot; being the world and society as we knew it.</p>

<p>The presence of the pope, the Jesuit, and the United Nations meetings, (Putin, Xi from China) all in play in the US this week are no coincidence.</p>

<p>They are capping these monumental meetings and plans off with the &quot;blood moon&quot; on Sept. 27-28.</p>

<p>This day, is the day they begin their next phase of the plan. </p>

<p>&quot;Climate Change&quot;. &quot;Economic instability&quot;. &quot;War torn regions&quot;.</p>

<p>Wake up people. They&#39;re controlling our futures right in front of our eyes. They&#39;re going to make decisions this week that will impact our lives and our future generations lives immensely. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the day the world ends.
It&#39;s the day the ending begins. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly correct.
For someone reading this, with no prior knowledge or research into the occult, and the true powers who run our world, it sounds like a description of a Divine Utopia!!!</p>

<p>You cannot believe that this agenda can be accomplished to this magnitude without culling the population into a manageable size.
I&#39;m not trying to be doom and gloom.</p>

<p>What they are discussing in this publishing of their agenda is &quot;Framework&quot; and &quot;Foundation&quot; for their DIS-topian society to be in effect... By 2033.</p>

<p>The threat of &quot;asteroids&quot; or &quot;near-earth&quot; objects is very real for the 2020&#39;s. Whether man made or already planned, it doesn&#39;t matter. </p>

<p>A real world catastrophic event will need to occur for these &quot;PUBLISHED&quot; plans to be implemented.</p>

<p>Be vigilant everyone. 
And keep your eyes and mind open. 
...but not too open so that your brain falls out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There has been LOTS of occult sources speaking of lowering the human population, pre dating the guide stones, but yes. The guide stones refer to a manageable size of population.</p>

<p>I hate to recommend his work, but watch the documentary &quot;End Game&quot;. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all tied into the one world unification/one world government.</p>

<p>Basically the world stage is being set, and paying attention to what is said from today until the 27-28, from the Pope, Congress, world leaders, and UN meeting (I&#39;m really eager to hear Obama, Putin, and Xi make their speeches in succession) as they are pushing the agenda. </p>

<p>Look around.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve done a mighty fine job of keeping the masses asleep. Dumbed down. Weakened. Believing every word they say. Kept in fear. Removing critical thinking and asking questions. </p>

<p>If you ask questions or doubt the words of &quot;scientism&quot; your just a crazy. Conspiracy theorist. </p>

<p>I believe we can revolt, and we can seek the truth. </p>

<p>We need to reach as many eyes and ears as possible with these &quot;theories&quot;.</p>

<p>This in turn will unite any individuals on the precipice of being awakened, who may work within an organization that has hidden information and truths from the general public.</p>

<p>Like a Snowden. </p>

<p>Our revolution will be through information. And sharing this information freely.</p>

<p>Why do you think the governments are working so hard to control and police our medium for sharing information?</p>

<p>We are in the time of revolution, but they don&#39;t believe we can achieve it. And if we begin to believe that they are right, and that we can&#39;t achieve it.... Then they have won.</p>

<p>So yes.
We can win.
We are winning.
We are seeking the truth, and forever shall do so. </p>
