       When he replays the footage of the "ball" going back and forth, pause the video and replay as fast as you can over and over until you can see the wing on the left side. The footage is very blurry, but in a few frames, you can still see a wing clearly appear for a short time.
      </p>
      <p>
       You would expect that a person who analyses video so closely to have noticed this, therefore this man must be deliberately trying to deceive. This is what disinformation looks like.

       I fully belive that it was an inside job, but I don't understand the no plane theory. Do you think they were holograms? What was projecting the holograms?

       I think no holograms (rather, CGI composited planes), no ball, no planes at all. Just planted explosives in the shape of a Wile E Coyote airplane outline in each tower. The "Israeli art students" did it in WTC1; still not sure about WTC2.

       It's an interesting theory, but what about the witnesses that saw the planes?  I remember sitting at my computer with my friend in the afternoon of 9/11. We were watching replays on CNN.com. In one of the clips, you could clearly see a fighter jet tailing one of the planes, and turning off right before it hit. I think it was the second plane. I remember thinking that they didn't shoot it down because the collateral damage from debris would be devastating. Watching the clips now though, you won't see a fighter jet. And no one ever talks about it.

       There are actually hardly any witnesses who saw planes. There's a whole lot of people in the field saying it was a bomb or just an explosion, and the studio people jump in and say it was a plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still leave an open possibility that a drone was flown into WTC2, but the footage is just so fucky I can't see it. At least some of the footage is CGI, for sure. And if some of it is faked, I don't see the point in using a drone.
      </p>

       Never saw the fighter jet footage -- first I've heard of that -- though I'd love to.

       , you always post stuff about how a nuclear bomb demolished the WTC and now you're talking about no planes. Your posts alone make the mini-nuke theory seem like it's gaining in popularity on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       , but it's 99% you posting these links. Someone might get the wrong idea about it's plausibility but It's all disinformation. Why do you deny the thermite evidence? Do you think the plane wreckage and spilled jet fuel was planted too?

       Yeah I ran upon some new info a couple weeks ago and feel compelled to share. (Quick correction, I wouldn't say "mini-nuke" anymore -- it appears to have been 150 kt devices.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see thermite being used, but it doesn't explain how the buildings turned to fluffy clouds of microscopic dust -- nor the nearly 4000 cases of radiogenic cancer among WTC recovery workers. Honestly, the big thing that tipped me off is the viciousness and irrationality with which nuclear demolition is attacked here and in other subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only plane wreckage I know of is a planted engine of the wrong manufacturer oops. And there's a piece on the Pentagon lawn with a non-native vine stuck in it for some reason.

       I'm not saying the aircraft that hit the WTC was controlled by the official story's hijacker pilots, though. Depends on if and how an airliner can be hacked. Pilots for 9/11 Truth hasn't released their analysis of
       <em>
        9/11: Identified
       </em>
       to digital download/Youtube, so I'm not too sure if the airliners were swapped with lookalike drones.

       Wrong manufacturer engine. 767-200 use Pratt-Whitney -- not Rolls Royce. And yeah that's a landing gear and a piece of fuselage skin. No matching serial numbers, and nobody seems to care. Real easy to plant a few parts nearby, but they didn't get the details right.

       Again, I don't advocate a mini-nuke theory. I think they were much bigger.

       Naahhh the whole building turned into a fluffy cloud of microscopic dust. No way thermite alone could do that. And don't forget the radiogenic cancer -- asbestos dust can't cause leukemia, thyroid cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer...

       I don't. I think there's plenty enough evidence to at least arrest a number of people and hold them for questioning. I mean, if this were handled like a criminal case and not some weird made-for-TV drama.

       Let's hear it. Give me the top 2 people you think you have enough "evidence" on that would allow you to legally detain them. Remember, it has to point
       <em>
        at them specifically

       If you smash a plane with a huge baseball bat,  swung at 500 mph,   I wonder how  it
       <strong>
        would handle a hit from a steel bat the size and weight of a 110 story building?
       </strong>
       Physics says that this is the same thing that would happen to a plane hitting the WTC,  it would be decimated upon impact,  inevitably  being at least partially shredded and bouncing off  at least one floor truss system (floor trusses 13 feet apart,  plane 44 feet tall at the tail).    Yet we have "video" of the plane pretty much flying right into the building,   not even slowing down on impact,  penetrating intact,  an aluminum tube not even crumpling the way a steel truck would,  and then passing into and through the building,  evidently tearing out massive interior steel columns.   No way.    Much of the fuselage would break apart and fall to the ground without penetrating (with passengers,  luggage,  part serial numbers etc then being on the ground,  visible to all),  the fuselage in no way would appear as shown in the "entrance" videos.    Look again!   Also,  planes that were speeding at 700 feet a second,  155 feet wide,  steered into the middle of a 208 foot width building,   twice.   At sea level.    By untrained pilots.   Try driving through a bank drive through at 500 mph.  Sorry.    Could not have happened.    Can no longer suspend that much of my own common sense.   Listen to the Pilots for Truth.    Commercial aircraft can't do this,  even when professionally piloted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Credible witnesses saw plane hit in person?   None.  By the way,   this was not live video.   No one saw plane hit on live video.   Nada.    So,   how many credible witnesses really did see planes hit,   really?     Even the explosion that is shown is coming from within the building to make the "entrance hole".     The plane seems to have been edited in.   We were duped,   me too,  for years,   even when I knew the government version was a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a psy-op.    We were being told what to see.    Now with a little time,   we can take another look,   if we have the guts.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many people want to venture that the media has not been a puppet even throughout Okhlahoma City or Waco?     Boston marathon,  Sandyhook,   etc.,    the media experience has been a calculated mind fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can think of only one media operation recently that failed in its mission with a lot of people.    And that was when Kerry was leading the charge of claiming Assad had gassed his own people with sarin.     The wizard behind the curtain was being revealed.    Boy did Kerry back off quick when the media tricks began to be exposed!    They don't want their secrets to be
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       obvious to
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       many people!
      </p>
      <p>
       The boob tube has never been more nefarious.    Look at how the public attention has been manipulated in regards to the Ukraine or recently in Syria,  as if it was Assad that was responsible for the majority of refugees leaving Syria.   Who armed the "rebels" who are really mercenaries?    How much Syrian territory does Assad really control.    And is this the part of Syria where the majority of refugees are coming from?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sure there are older media case studies before 9/11.    But the 9/11 media event was an act of war against the American psyche.    Electronic lobotomization.    Pixelated surgery,   where the verbal narrative is implanted directly into the psyche with images that violate common sense.     It leaves a mark on the psyche.     It provides a fertile ground for certain social illnesses and malaise to infect the society.    The society is rendered immobile in the face of psychopathic atrocities of its leaders.    Until there is a crack,  until people start waking up,  develop an immunity.    Accountability doesn't seem to apply.    Yet this kind of mass hypnosis never ends well.   Germany,  1933 to 1945.

       yes.  coupled with the presence of E4B air command at the crime scenes, and the manner of penetration and explosion, it points towards air to surface missile attack.   I guess JASSM, but I could be wrong.

       Planes or plane shaped objects hit the towers.  There's so much evidence that this happened.  This vid is disinformation to keep us off of what matters.

       I think that "plane", might be a flying object that cloaks after it smashes through the WTC.

       Upvoting just to see a rebuttal in the comments. No-plane evidence is ridiculous but it's interesting to at least look at sometimes. It teases your critical thinking skills, which is fun.

       The plane looks like a ball because it's very low quality footage. The colors around the plane bleed together.

        The nose of the plane did NOT exit out of the other side of the tower.

       The background looks different in both shots because they probably come from two separate cameras close together. A difference of a few feet probably wouldn't show up when filming a city skyline. One of which probably had it's settings incomparable with filming landscapes, which caused the background to appear almost blank.

       Can you have your shit "debunking" (see: Disinfo) site use slightly higher quality footage when attempting to explain away a fuckup so massive, they had to use their live buffer to cut the video feed as the video helicopter drifted slightly too far off the center mark.
