<p>You&#39;re exaggerating my point deliberately. You know that I am not suggesting that you circlejerk with every post here. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>For starters, you called me a liar for the reason I put &quot;skeptic&quot; in quotes. That&#39;s just stupid and unnecessary. Not everyone thinks you are a shill. Persecution complex? </p>

<p>But I&#39;ll answer your question with a question. Which conspiracies do you believe are plausible, probable, or 50/50? There are so many to choose from. </p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing that very few, if any will be considered, most likely because you are cut from the same cloth as other &quot;skeptics.&quot; By that I mean conspiracy theories are automatically implausible if they have not been proven 100 percent or admitted to by the entities which have committed them. Any other theories are spoken of normally. I&#39;ve seen much of your material, and it&#39;s got the same cookie-cutter, pick and choose skepticism tone that they all have. I don&#39;t feel like diving down through your history, so I feel that simply admitting which conspiracies you consider would be more fruitful here.  </p>

<p>Some guesses: You probably think only Russia has shills in this forum. You probably believe only neo-nazi groups are targeting this forum, etc. Basically, the only conspiracies a &quot;skeptic&quot; would consider would be those which further their worldview. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t feel persecuted. I didn&#39;t make a thread about it. You iniated this with me. So I asked YOU to tell me what YOU think I&#39;m overly skeptical about, because you apparently remember my name enough to question my motives/reasons for being here.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say you said I circlejerk with everything here. My point was that I DONT circlejerk with every post here.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t want me projecting, but you don&#39;t follow that yourself.</p>

<p>Edit: shit, I&#39;ll bite. It would be easier to list things I&#39;m skeptical of and participate in the discussions of here. Recently I&#39;ve been extremely skeptical of the user who has been posting the 9/11 nuke theory. I&#39;ve been extremely skeptical of the flat earth theory and the users that post about it. I&#39;ve been skeptical of the &quot;crisis actors&quot; theory. And oftentimes I ask users for sources behind claims they make. Is that really questionable behavior?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not what I said either. I said I didn&#39;t suggest that you should circlejerk with every post. Normal skepticism is...well, normal. You exaggerated by saying this: &quot;I don&#39;t immediately circlejerk with every post here. Sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>Whatever. We can move on. So, do you think any conspiracy theories are plausible, probable, or 50/50? We only have to look at the last 70 years of history to find out that conspiracies are normal and extremely common, so surely there must be quite a few today which will be proven in 10 or 20 years. Which ones do you think? </p>

<p>Ok, you actually changed my mind on this one. I&#39;ll have to give you the benefit of the doubt. I didn&#39;t really think this would be a thing, but I suppose it is.

    <div class="md"><p>Why haven&#39;t you told me what topics I shill it up for yet? Why do you insist im a Jew/Zionist? I don&#39;t even know a single Jew in real life.</p>

<p>Lol, you&#39;re so irrationally angry. Tell me what I shill for. Look at the three long posts you just wrote me. You feel strongly about me. You obviously know what I think about things, right? It should be easy for you to tell me what I shill for. What topics do I support Israel/the zionists on? Get me banned for my shill behavior here. Download RES, scroll through my comments, search for keywords or topics with ctrl+f, and end this. Tell me what I shill for here. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t step up to the plate I will report all of these shill accusations and follow through. Step up to the plate.</p>

<p>While I&#39;ve yet to outright call you a shill, it appears as though I need to remind you that it&#39;s been established that there are only a small fraction of people who will proactively bitch and moan about being ID publicly.  Normal people couldn&#39;t care less.  Yet certain other types just can&#39;t seem to stop talking about it at every opportunity.  Which are you again?</p>

<p>Since when do shills get banned?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care about you. What&#39;s wrong with defending myself? </p>

<p>For the last time, I&#39;ll offer to never comment here again if you an provide any evidence to what you&#39;ve claimed. Provide evidence of me being a Jew, as you decided to call me Goldstein. Provide evidence of me being a Zionist, as you&#39;ve called me earlier, and supporting Israel. And provide evidence of me being too &quot;skeptical,&quot; since you don&#39;t have to balls to call me a shill. With RES this should take ten minutes. I know you&#39;ve got the time.</p>

Sure. They&#39;re great to discuss. But when I ask questions and people go with &quot;ITS TRUE YOU SHILL HOW MUCH DO THEY PAY YOU&quot; when the discussion involves a theory, it goes downhill quick. Notice I didn&#39;t say it was a fact. Thanks for your fandom, though.</p>

<p>Although Mars had rivers, lakes and maybe even an ocean a few billion years ago, the modern moisture is modest — small patches of damp soil, not pools of standing water.</p>

<p>“That’s a direct detection of water in the form of hydration of salts,” said Alfred S. McEwen, a professor of planetary geology at the University of Arizona, the principal investigator of images from a high-resolution camera on NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and one of the authors of the new paper. “<strong>There pretty much has to have been liquid water recently present to produce the hydrated salt.</strong>”</p>

<p>Looking at the evidence they&#39;ve presented, I too would assume that some briny water seeps out of the rocks and leaves a visible trail, but they&#39;re making everyone believe they have &quot;found&quot; liquid water on Mars, when really they&#39;ve found evidence suggestive that liquid water was once (recently) present on Mars. But, everyone is so desperate to celebrate that they ignore the phrase &quot;evidence of&quot;.</p>

Look at this post that&#39;s almost got 5000 points where they say that America was great with high taxation and all that: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3mow3q/when_america_was_great_taxes_were_high_unions/">https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3mow3q/when_america_was_great_taxes_were_high_unions/</a></p>

<p>People jump to all sorts of conclusions like raising minimum wage... Getting paid more does NOT make life cost less. There are many factors involved and there&#39;s lots of things for anyone considerate to find.</p>

<p>This is 2015 and it feels like the world is devolving. People live off of other peoples&#39; money, and especially, ours. We&#39;re forced by the US Government to give our money away to corporations because <em>XYZ</em> person might need to use it for themselves. And once we stop paying our own contribution is entirely gone and doesn&#39;t account for our own care hence - Not really any incentive to keep working for the absolute nothing that the US Government is letting us attain. &quot;<strong>Pay away your prosperity because one day you&#39;ll be in dire health</strong>!!!&quot; FUCK YOU US GOVERNMENT!!!</p>
