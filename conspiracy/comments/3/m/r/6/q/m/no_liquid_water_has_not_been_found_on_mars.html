       They found streaks on rocks that contain hydrated minerals; i.e., evidence that water once touched those rocks. It's not like they came across a lake or a stream or anything like that.

      <p>
       They have not yet found liquid water on Mars. This is just bullshit.

       The hydrates they found cannot exist unless they've been in contact with water within the past few days. You're right that they didn't literally fill a bucket with water, but they found nearly irrefutable evidence that water was present in the soils they examined. It's proof that water is present and flowing in the subsurface.

       water could arrive from comet impacts.  there's no good evidence of water reserves of any significance on mars, let alone flowing ones.

       until I see someone drink a glass of it, I won't believe it.   water in methane clathrates, sure, water as chemical part of rock and crystal - sure.

       Sure. They're great to discuss. But when I ask questions and people go with "ITS TRUE YOU SHILL HOW MUCH DO THEY PAY YOU" when the discussion involves a theory, it goes downhill quick. Notice I didn't say it was a fact. Thanks for your fandom, though.

       Skeptics was in quotes because the skeptics here seem to be overly skeptical of claims they don't agree with, and seem to speak normally about topics such as the one we are discussing. To me, that isn't true skepticism. I've heard other users call this "pick and choose skepticism." That seems accurate.

      <p>
       For starters, you called me a liar for the reason I put "skeptic" in quotes. That's just stupid and unnecessary. Not everyone thinks you are a shill. Persecution complex?
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'll answer your question with a question. Which conspiracies do you believe are plausible, probable, or 50/50? There are so many to choose from.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm guessing that very few, if any will be considered, most likely because you are cut from the same cloth as other "skeptics." By that I mean conspiracy theories are automatically implausible if they have not been proven 100 percent or admitted to by the entities which have committed them. Any other theories are spoken of normally. I've seen much of your material, and it's got the same cookie-cutter, pick and choose skepticism tone that they all have. I don't feel like diving down through your history, so I feel that simply admitting which conspiracies you consider would be more fruitful here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some guesses: You probably think only Russia has shills in this forum. You probably believe only neo-nazi groups are targeting this forum, etc. Basically, the only conspiracies a "skeptic" would consider would be those which further their worldview.

       I don't feel persecuted. I didn't make a thread about it. You iniated this with me. So I asked YOU to tell me what YOU think I'm overly skeptical about, because you apparently remember my name enough to question my motives/reasons for being here.

       I didn't say you said I circlejerk with everything here. My point was that I DONT circlejerk with every post here.

       You don't want me projecting, but you don't follow that yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: shit, I'll bite. It would be easier to list things I'm skeptical of and participate in the discussions of here. Recently I've been extremely skeptical of the user who has been posting the 9/11 nuke theory. I've been extremely skeptical of the flat earth theory and the users that post about it. I've been skeptical of the "crisis actors" theory. And oftentimes I ask users for sources behind claims they make. Is that really questionable behavior?

       That's not what I said either. I said I didn't suggest that you should circlejerk with every post. Normal skepticism is...well, normal. You exaggerated by saying this: "I don't immediately circlejerk with every post here. Sorry."
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever. We can move on. So, do you think any conspiracy theories are plausible, probable, or 50/50? We only have to look at the last 70 years of history to find out that conspiracies are normal and extremely common, so surely there must be quite a few today which will be proven in 10 or 20 years. Which ones do you think?

       I answered with an edit in the last comment with the content in this sub that I've been incredibly skeptical of, as there is plenty here that I can agree with/believe in the possibility of/entertain the thought of. I don't feel like spending my time listing everything I believe. You can list/ask about an event or topic and I'll answer,.I tend to post more, if not solely, in the threads I am skeptical of.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to sit here and try to prove myself to you. Like I said, ask about an event/topic if you want, and I'll answer. I'm sure there are many things we would agree on. But you called me out, in a way, so finish the job or piss off.

       Ok, you actually changed my mind on this one. I'll have to give you the benefit of the doubt. I didn't really think this would be a thing, but I suppose it is. I guess I just find it odd that a person would have an account dedicated solely to conspiracy skepticism and not have conversations otherwise, but I'm not going to judge you for it!

       ask about this. Cause I have no clue what the fuck in my post history shows I support anything Israel does. It's idiots like this that think I shill around here and spread it around. I've asked them, including iamagod tell me what I shill for and I've never gotten a straight answer. Just more shill accusations and personal attacks, because that's all they're capable of.

       You're so adept at playing the victim.  Poor you.

      <p>
       The most fitting analogy here always seems to go right back to the unbelievable One Direction anti-fan.  He hates the band.  He hates their music.  He hates everything about them.  He ridicules their fans.  He spends hours every single day watching their videos, reading all he can find about them, all the while he sits on their sub arguing with anyone foolish to waste their time with him.

       You're little more than a near constant apologist pushing the "official," state sanctioned, propaganda blasted, bs conspiracy.

      <p>
       Keep playing that victim card while attempting to push that no conspiracies exist.  Yeah, those in power really lie, cheat, steal, and kill...basically do anything they can to secure and expand said power.

       Lol, you're so irrationally angry. Tell me what I shill for. Look at the three long posts you just wrote me. You feel strongly about me. You obviously know what I think about things, right? It should be easy for you to tell me what I shill for. What topics do I support Israel/the zionists on? Get me banned for my shill behavior here. Download RES, scroll through my comments, search for keywords or topics with ctrl+f, and end this. Tell me what I shill for here.

Provide evidence of me being a Zionist, as you've called me earlier, and supporting Israel. And provide evidence of me being too "skeptical," since you don't have to balls to call me a shill.

Sure. They're great to discuss. But when I ask questions and people go with "ITS TRUE YOU SHILL HOW MUCH DO THEY PAY YOU" when the discussion involves a theory, it goes downhill quick. Notice I didn't say it was a fact. Thanks for your fandom, though.

       Wrong. Those streams you're talking about come and go, depending on the temperature. It's water. It was obvious to me that water had been found years ago, when I saw some clear photographs showing the streams.

        Although Mars had rivers, lakes and maybe even an ocean a few billion years ago, the modern moisture is modest — small patches of damp soil, not pools of standing water.
       </p>
       <p>
        “That’s a direct detection of water in the form of hydration of salts,” said Alfred S. McEwen, a professor of planetary geology at the University of Arizona, the principal investigator of images from a high-resolution camera on NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and one of the authors of the new paper. “
        <strong>
         There pretty much has to have been liquid water recently present to produce the hydrated salt.

       Looking at the evidence they've presented, I too would assume that some briny water seeps out of the rocks and leaves a visible trail, but they're making everyone believe they have "found" liquid water on Mars, when really they've found evidence suggestive that liquid water was once (recently) present on Mars. But, everyone is so desperate to celebrate that they ignore the phrase "evidence of".

       The point is that what you visually see isn't evidence. You don't have to see water to proof it's water.

       People jump to all sorts of conclusions like raising minimum wage... Getting paid more does NOT make life cost less. There are many factors involved and there's lots of things for anyone considerate to find.

       This is 2015 and it feels like the world is devolving. People live off of other peoples' money, and especially, ours. We're forced by the US Government to give our money away to corporations because
       <em>
        XYZ
       </em>
       person might need to use it for themselves. And once we stop paying our own contribution is entirely gone and doesn't account for our own care hence - Not really any incentive to keep working for the absolute nothing that the US Government is letting us attain. "

       ask about this. Cause I have no clue what the fuck in my post history shows I support anything Israel does. It's idiots like this that think I shill around here and spread it around. I've asked them, including iamagod tell me what I shill for and I've never gotten a straight answer. Just more shill accusations and personal attacks, because that's all they're capable of.
