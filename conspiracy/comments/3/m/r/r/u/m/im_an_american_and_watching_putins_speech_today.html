       It's an older meme about calling diamonds "the hardest metal" in the world, then the meme response is to say that Dragonforce is a harder metal, then make scientific hypotheses over which material would be harder under what circumstances. Like I said, older meme.

       The moment when Russia and China pull the rug out from under the U.S. Neo-Nazi cabal is nearing. Putin intends to methodically build the case that the United States government is fueling the War on Terror in order to sow chaos and grow in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       When he makes his case public--probably after the U.S. inevitably escalates its presence in Ukraine and Syria--all hell will surely break loose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Explain to your loved ones what is happening now. You will be ignored or mocked now, but the pay off is a slight chance of gaining enough credibility when the time finally comes to build a resistance with those whom you care for.

      <p>
       It looks like Syria is providing the perfect opportunity for Putin to seize control of the terrible power and momentum of the War on Terror meme -- and re-cast the US (and Israel, I should think) as terrorist states, which of course they are.

       My thoughts exactly. I think the strategy is an obvious one, and the odds are that Washington has been wary of it for some time now. Putin doesn't hide his true feelings, if one is listening to him with a reality-based mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Washington has no idea HOW he will execute the transfer. That's why the leaked state department cables sound like a scared, manipulative child throwing a tantrum.

       I will always believe in Utopia-like Earth that human kind can achieve in the (hope near one) future but for that to happen we as humans MUST stay true to our good, honest, understanding, emphatic, trustful, ethical, common sense ways where literally ANYTHING is possible an we treat each other as someone we love and respect EVEN if we have different opinions and ideas. The fact is that there will always be evil people but same goes for good one the difference is evil ones will do anything or stop at nothing to achieve their goal on the other side good ones will do complete opposite and that will never change. We have huge potential but it looks like "something" in the shadows with great power have different plans or there is some bigger picture we are not seeing.

       I like your optimism. The reality of the situation is that living in a world where we were all clothed and fed and housed and free to pursue education and the arts; there will come a fundamental dissatisfaction with the material world that will never be overcome. Often this manifests as greed, the thinking that just a little bit more will cure the dissatisfaction once and for all.  It does, for a short time. The dissatisfaction re-occurs and then you have a repeat of the cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe this to be fundamental to human nature. There is an egocentric reward system encoded into the DNA of our species as a result of natural selection.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can be rational human beings but ignoring the influence our emotions, especially DNA-based reward systems, have on human behavior is to ignore the reality: the power structures in place are there because they are intrinsic to human nature. All we can do is change who takes the reigns.

       I'm sorry but your comment is absolutely absurd. Empirical evidence and observations demonstrate that there are just a small minority of humans with these dominant traits. They have secured and held onto authority for millennia through fear. The rest of us are catching up to them because we were born outside of their group. We react in ways that at times mirror them because it is how we learned to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted to curse you out and belittle your comments but I realize that would not get my message to your mind. Please do not box in the majority of humanity with the parasitic sociopaths that occupy positions of authority. The rest of us are counting on people who think like you to recognize the inherent goodness and strength inside of yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't let them win by thinking yourself a monster. You are not a monster and neither is the overwhelming majority of humanity.

       My brother and I were talking about this.  I said it seems like everyone is either crazy or stupid, but I know that can't be right.  He laid down the heavy and told me we're Ill.  People acting irrationally or as monsters as you describe makes so much more sense now.  And it's easier to not be mad at the world in this light.

       I'm on mobile so I don't have access or the patience to copy and paste several sources for you. The article in the above link has .edu links from Princeton, university of Wisconsin, and Emory to point you in the right direction.

       I like to think of it in terms of who benefits from everyone believing it's in their nature to be assholes. The answer I come up with is, the assholes. If you aren't a natural asshole but think you should be then you're off balance and easily manipulated by a small minority of assholes who find it natural.

       He has a point. It's naive to think that you can just remove the scumbags and everything will be fine. I think it's inevitable that even if we miraculously started from new, we would regress back to the same shit we have today.

       Removal? How could that be done? Rockets to Mars lol. No we don't remove them. We defend against their tricks, educate our children to do the same and ignore their ambitions.

       They operate on the benefit of the doubt. Do not give them that benefit. Ignore rhetoric and look at their actions. Then get vocal and point that shit out offline. Say the stuff you think or write online out loud in public to peoples faces. You'd be surprised at the type of response you'll get.

       I think this statement is misleading. Humans have evolved many mutually exclusive, very complex and elaborate social strategies for survival, the world over, across millennia.

       We are in the midst of a revolution, in all senses of the word. Technological, biological, astronomical. Why not political?

       I would think that a utopia would be a akin to living in a world dominated by open source values, products and economies.

       also B.O. came right out and said our mission in Syria was to oust Assad.  That statement alone in front of the UN is CRAY CRAY!  It also seemed like he was saying "We are the best, strongest, most successful nation in the world, therefore, nothing we do could be anything other than the right decision for the rest of the world".  I think that we saw a very interesting side of B.O. during this speech.  As others have said, he seemed to be angry during this speech.  I had some reflection on it, and found myself thinking back to his announcement of gay marriage being legal in the US.  If you watch that announcement (regardless of how you feel about gay marriage), I feel that was the real B.O., and he seemed genuinely proud and happy of what he was announcing to the world.  During this speech he seemed to be hating every word which he was, I think, made to say by the powers that be.  I think his anger was not for those countries or groups he was saying need changes, but rather the people making him come out so aggressively in such a world forum.  I still for some reason believe that B.O. is a good man.  I thought the same of G.B.  I think these men are lured by power and prestige, just to be put under the thumb of terrible people with terrible motives.

       People always went to the richer countries that have destroyed their own ones. Just look at all the Pakistani in Britain. Or Africans in France. And now the Syrians are coming to Europe and to America because of the destruction the West caused in Syria by working together with Saudi Arabia and other extremists. I'm not saying that every immigrant is or was coming to the USA while hating it but a lot of people just came because they had no other choice.

       Russia helped destroy Germany in WW2.  Germans were not fleeing to Russia and Soviet states in the generations afterwards.  People inundate the west because it offers them opportunity to improve their quality of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Victor Hanson:
Millions flee their homes to enter Europe — not Russia, China, or India. Ten percent of Mexico lives in the United States. Polls in Mexico suggest that half the remaining Mexican population would prefer to head north into the U.S., a nation to which, polls also suggest, they of course are hostile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Immigration is a one-way Western street. Those who, in the abstract, damn the West — as much as elite Westerners themselves do — want very much to live inside it. The loudest anti-Western voices in the Middle East are usually housed in Western universities, not in Gaza. Jorge Ramos is a fierce critic of supposed American cruelty to illegal immigrants — so much so that he fled Mexico for America, became a citizen (how is that possible, given American bias against immigrants?), landed a multimillion-dollar salary working for the non-Latino-owned Spanish-language network Univision, and then put his kids in private school to shield them from hoi polloi of the sort he champions each evening. Now that’s the power of the West.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alternatives are uninviting. Mohammad Javad Zarif, Pervez Musharraf, and Mohamed Morsi all resided in the West for long periods of time until political power beckoned at home. Putin’s Russia is a geriatric and unhealthy kleptocracy. China will never square the circle of free-market capitalist consumerism and Communist state autocracy. India, like Brazil, is always corrupt and always said to be full of potential. Neo-Communism has all but wrecked Latin America. The African nations are still tribal societies beneath a thin statist veneer. The Middle East is now mostly pre-civilized. (The Asian Tigers have escaped these fates by becoming mostly Westernized.) And, in our wired age, the maladies of the Third World are all instantly known and contrasted with the civilized alternative in the West.

       Why bring race into it? Everyone is like this. Whether your drug of choice is caffeine, nicotine, crack, etc. it matters not. White men working in offices amped up on red bull and amphetamines are just as much addicts as the crackheads living on the street.

       Similar to how the Mujahideen was created, they don't want their new pet project to fail so soon. Then ISIS will be the new Al-Qaeda, and then we'll have another 9/11 sometime down the road in a warzone near you.

       I've been working in Germany for a few years now, and listen to the bfbs, a British military radio station, last year they were talking without end about the drawdown in Afghanistan and how it would be fine to leave and all will be well and good because it's so stable and everyone involved did a great job and it will be rainbows and unicorns everywhere, today I heared mention that the entire Kunduz area is now back under Taliban rule, literally all they said, then quickly  moved on to talk about another one of the endless fucking charity events for wounded soldiers.. I feel like I'm going insane.. for days they talk about how the region won't fall back under Taliban rule, 2 months later it did happen and suddenly
       <em>
        nothing

       to fucking say about it.. yet spend a good five minutes on Jeremy corben's speech and how pieces were recycled from a different speech... nobody fucking cares... wtf

       Israel is the sole reason why the US is involved in the ME. The American people are not going to stand for putting boots on the ground out there again. So ISIS was created to go to war for Israel in Americas place.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are waking up to the fact that Americans have been fighting and dying for Israel. It's obvious. Putin doesn't have to reference Israel for it to be understood why the US/Israel/ISIS is now in Syria...because that is how it is playing out.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's all the US is doing over there...taking out legit governments and installing Zionist Israel friendly puppets.

       I think that is a pretty bold claim saying that Israel is the SOLE reason the US is involved in the middle east.  While you seem to have the right intentions, making such a bold claim invalidates the rest of your argument and shows a lack of understand of geopolitical motivators.

       The US took out muammar gaddafi because he was ditching the US petro dollar and was actively switching to the Gold Dinar currency to trade oil. A similar fate met Saddam Hussein. Both of these leaders were not Israel friendly on top of upsetting the US oil kingdom.
      </p>

       You would be correct, Israel being the sole reason is a bit of an exaggeration, however, it is common denominator.

       Zionism has metastasized throughout US government. The US foreign policy in the Middle East, pre-empting wars that are destroying the Arab nations surrounding Israel, supporting and funding a  mercenary terrorist militant group to do the dirty work...is in of itself, Un-American.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an American who has been paying attention to what is going on in the ME, It became obvious rather quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       ISIS is a fake Islamist terror group made up of mercenary soldiers, CIA and Mossad. They have not threatened Israel because they are not Islamic or Muslim. Everything ISIS is doing is benefitting the Zionist cause. The fake beheadings, burning people in a cage are all theater to plant the seed that ISIS is to evil to be us...the "good guys". All the while US gov't fakes a war against ISIS to further the impression that we are against ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, Israel is giving medical care to fallen ISIS soldiers who have been injured by legitimate Syrian gov,t army. Doesn't take a genius to figure out who ISIS is really working for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin is absolutely right and he's calling out US gov'ts role in Syria.

       Israel treats anyone who comes to their border hospitals: The Israeli government has been providing medical assistance to Syria’s wounded for more than a year. In February, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu paid a visit to a military field hospital in the Golan Heights in a tour aimed at contrasting Israel’s humanitarianism with that of Iran, one of Syria’s military backers, claiming it was arming, financing, and training Syrian forces responsible for killing and wounding Syrian civilians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the IDF, said the Israeli government has provided medical assistance to more than 1,000 Syrians over the past 14 months. "We give medical aid to people who are in dire need," he said in a telephone interview. "We don’t do any vetting or check where they are from or which group they are fighting for, or whether they are civilians."
      </p>
      <p>
       Lerner said that Israeli forces have a kind of "gentleman’s agreement" with Syrians across the border to alert Israeli forces that they intend to deliver their wounded. But he said that Israel’s cooperation with Syrians is strictly medical and humanitarian. "The Israeli policy of noninvolvement in Syria is what binds us," he said. "Our primary mission is to defend the border from potential spillover of the civil war into Israel from the Syrian Golan Heights."

       “The difference between the current Israeli situation and...[old] South Africa is emphasized at a very human level: Jewish and Arab babies are born in the same delivery room, with the same facilities, attended by the same doctors and nurses, with the mothers recovering in adjoining beds in a ward. Two years ago I had major surgery in a Jerusalem hospital: the surgeon was Jewish, the anaesthetist was Arab, the doctors and nurses who looked after me were Jews and Arabs. Jews and Arabs share meals in restaurants and travel on the same trains, buses and taxis, and visit each other’s homes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could any of this possibly have happened under apartheid? Of course not.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel isn't some divided state like you think it is. Arabs from Gaza and the west bank work in Israel in many cases.

       Me too. So long as the maniacs who run shit don't ruin the survivability of human beings on this planet via war or whatever, yeah, I'm optimistic. But we need to really collapse the idea that we need government and governments know this. They are all dividing us. Too much tension to not be a strategy.

       Now although that's a nice idea the reality is if America didn't act as the world police someone else would, world domination has been around since man's inception. Just be glad you were born in the country that is winning.

       and at the heart of if is the thought that one culture can be "winning" at anything other than the expense of the rest of the world population.  We have created a system where winning means killing and oppressing the losers.  I would rather just be tied.

       I've heard that argument before, and it's a very poor one at that. That's not the point! The fact is that NO ONE should be the World Police (or Global Cop -&gt; coming to a warzone near you). Wake-up!

       I agree, it would be nice if no one was or acted as such, but history shows that if a country has the ability to do so the will try their best to achieve global domination.

       My brother and I were talking about this.  I said it seems like everyone is either crazy or stupid, but I know that can't be right.  He laid down the heavy and told me we're Ill.  People acting irrationally or as monsters as you describe makes so much more sense now.  And it's easier to not be mad at the world in this light.

       He has a point. It's naive to think that you can just remove the scumbags and everything will be fine. I think it's inevitable that even if we miraculously started from new, we would regress back to the same shit we have today.
