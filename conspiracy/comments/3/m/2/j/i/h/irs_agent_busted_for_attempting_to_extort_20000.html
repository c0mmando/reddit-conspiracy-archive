       An IRS agent was arrested this week after he was caught attempting to con a Seattle marijuana shop owner out of $20,000.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 42-year-old agent, Paul G. Hurley, reportedly demanded a $20,000 bribe from the shop owner, in exchange for a break on an audit. In fact, Hurley had said that he saved the business owner over a million dollars on his tax return, and that his current tax bill was just under $300,000.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shop owner was not even concerned with getting a break, so when the agent left he contacted federal authorities who set up a sting operation wherein the shop owner gave the IRS agent money for the bribe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hurley met with the owner on several occasions during an audit and mentioned how he was unhappy with his job at the IRS and that he was living paycheck to paycheck. The two met at a nearby Starbucks on several different occasions to discuss the deal and each time the shop owner wore a wire and was followed by undercover police.
      </p>
      <p>
       The agent allegedly threatened the owner with a massive tax bill, saying that he owed an obnoxious amount because he was involved in the marijuana industry which is illegal on the federal level. The agent asked for $20,000 up front, and at one point in the negotiation asked the owner to help him pay his student loans over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hurley is currently facing up to 15 years in jail for charges of soliciting and agreeing to receive a bribe and two counts of receiving a bribe by a public official.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hurley has been an IRS revenue agent since 2009, according to court documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       The irony in this situation is that IRS agents legally demand money from people all the time and no one bats an eye.

       Seeing stories like these give strength to what Im doing.  I just moved from TX to CO to do bookkeeping for cannabis companies.  I feel that many of the companies are good people, trying to do the right thing, and if they had someone to help them with the numbers, that they could run a successful business that helps more people than I could ever do alone.  Win win

       In a time when there are zero banks that will even take the money of a legal company, we have crooked tax people, trying to take even more...crooks working for crooks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good for that business owner to turn in the evil tax man.

       Just FYI, I happen to know one guy who works as a tax auditor. He's one of the most honest people you could meet. And from what I hear, most of them are just really lazy. This one dude from the article above is just a shit head. And stupid.

       Love how this is framed as if the
       <em>
        entire
       </em>
       system wasn't based on banking cartels shaking down the entire US population.
      </p>
      <p>
       While your local state income taxes are lawful, the entire
       <em>
        federal
       </em>
       income tax (as applied to people within the 50 states) is un-Constitutional and illegitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       As Aaron Russo exposes in his documentary "America: Freedom to Fascism," the US Supreme Court ruled that the 16th Amendment did NOT expand the government's taxation authority. It merely allowed them to apportion collected taxes in a new way. It did NOT give them new powers to tax new swathes of people. Meaning: If you were not taxable BEFORE the 16th Amendment, you were not taxable AFTER it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Peck &amp; Co. v. Lowe 247 U.S. 165, 172 (1918) "The Sixteenth Amendment . . . does not extend the taxing power to new or excepted subjects, but merely removes all occasion, which might otherwise exist, for an apportionment among the states of taxes laid on income, whether it be derived from one source or another.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       So when people tell you, "True, average people in the 50 states were not taxed on the federal level before the 16th Amendment, but the 16th Amendment makes them taxable," they're committing fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       The federal income tax was a privilege tax on the ultra-wealthy. It was never a tax on average, working people. If you read Title 26 of the IRS code it's very clear who is taxable on the federal level: 1) People who live in federal jurisdiction, like the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, etc. In other words, people who do NOT live in the 50 states. State taxes pay for state roads, state parks, state schools, etc. Since federal territory doesn't exist in any of the states, they needed to raise money to pay for services there: hence
       <em>
        federal
       </em>
       income taxes. But if you don't live on federal territory, you're not taxable on the federal level. 2) Millionaires, who derive most of their income from stocks, bonds, and dividends on rental properties, 3) Foreign nationals, 4) Employees on the federal level, such as federal judges, senators, Congressmen, etc., 5) Firearms manufacturers, 6) Alcohol distillers, 7) Tobacco manufacturers, 8) Corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're not any of these groups, you're not mentioned in Title 26. (Meaning: You're not liable for a federal income tax.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The banking cartels have gone to great pains to make average Americans think that they're within federal jurisdiction [when they're not] and to think that the 16th Amendment applies to them [when it never did].
      </p>
      <p>
       So this IRS agent is going to jail over $20,000 when the organization for which he works has shaken down the public for $20 trillion.
