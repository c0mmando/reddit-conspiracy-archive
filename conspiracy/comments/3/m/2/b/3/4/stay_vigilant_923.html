        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Today is the big day: 9/23. There&#39;s been a huge clutter of talk coming from both sides of this conspiracy. 
I don&#39;t post often. Actually, I&#39;ve never posted at all.  I just wanted to express that, no matter what side of the argument you&#39;re on—whether you believe or you don&#39;t—please don&#39;t let this divide this wonderful subreddit. 
There has been thorough research through vigilant efforts in regards to the Shemitah and the date 9/23/15. Well researched material. There has also been the needed skepticism, too. We need the duality to bring about more well-researched posts. 
Again, regardless of what happens today, stay vigilant. I really love this subreddit, as it&#39;s my sanctuary from the everyday routine that I subscribe to. I don&#39;t want to see the needed duality divide. </p>

<p>I do believe &quot;the jews&quot; once controlled global markets, but now I believe they&#39;re part of a larger organization, and they could still have some power over it, so that seems plausible.</p>

.....
yep i&#39;m still here.</p>

<p>honestly I consider myself a skeptic with a conspiracy bent. business IS conspiracy. conspiracy is just good business. There is a small group of people who hold most of the power; Bilderberg secrets are not good for the people. False flags do happen. CIA involved in drugs, al Qaeda, rat line into Syria no problem. But i have a problem with this sort of new agey specific date &quot;the world is ending&quot; shite: OK the world IS ending, the financial /economic house of cards has gone global. it can&#39;t last forever; climate change is accelerating but fuck off with the attempts at picking a single date and saying: &quot;this is THE day when it ends&quot; or some such bullshite. It sort of gets people sucked into a panic if they BELIEVE and distracts from the real issues. </p>

<p>Be able to earn a living in the world as it is today; learn some practical skills like how to grow your own food, or catch and clean a fish, or find water in the woods. Don&#39;t waste your time on bullshit. Question everything yes, but don&#39;t waste your life going down rabbit holes</p>

<p>Basically whenever you watch cnn money matters telling you to buy certain stock, you should sell it and vice versa... or hear ads to &quot;buy gold&quot;, do the opposite of what they are telling you.  Historically the &#39;buy gold&#39; or &#39;gold is terrible now&#39; have been the best times to do the opposite of what they are telling you to do.

    <div class="md"><p>No, you are wrong.  Not a majority.  There are random evangelical blogs that range from batty to silly.  Kabbalists / Judaists pretty much accept shmita cycles as having to do with agriculture (&#39;God told them to leave the earth to be fallow for 7 yrs&quot;), but these real batshit are the rightwing extremists evangelicals--like those kinds of nutty christians that fly to jerusalem to wail on the wall with people they think they understand but don&#39;t.  I&#39;ve not really understood what&#39;s going on there, other than they are a bunch of fucktards who aren&#39;t studious of their own history, let alone that of Judaism generally, or even prechristianity and/or gnosticism...yet their primary drivers <em>are</em> some gnostic in nature (christian mysticism), unbeknownst to them.  </p>

<p>Essentially I&#39;m calling them jewfetish dilletantes who don&#39;t have any historical or anthropoloigical context for understanding what and why they fly to Jerusalem; what they get out of it; and why they so staunchly defend zionism and the state of israel so much.  You ask them and they start talking in stories, lesser-known quotes, and allegory.  Halfway through their prostyletizing you realize it&#39;s like they just read the bible that you read when you were little instead of going to church and repeating after me.  But they do fall into the blood moon thing that was an astronomical phenomenon that ultimately resulted in nothing; and this will likely be the same.  They want the end times to happen because they are deeply invested in their imperialistic, dominant worldview being validated as <em>right</em>.</p>

<p>To my mind, whether intentional or not, it&#39;s all just more distraction from the fact that psychos run the world and make money on our fears, confusion and doubts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say some conspiracies are real, such as the American Revolution. Some are mis or dis-information. Most are clickbait. Amidst it all, for whatever reason, there are glimpses of forces moving things in certain directions, some pure evil, some for greed, some for misguided moldy science projects, and tons of creepy military activities.</p>

<p>The thirst for knowledge is a very human trait. Wouldn&#39;t you agree that 98% of television is bullshit? Thus we seek outside the lines and we yearn to exercise our inference engines we were built with.</p>

<p>To blanket everyone, as is evidence in your comments here, to use abusive language and to overgeneralize makes you look unwilling, perhaps by your TV and/or education, or see beneath the surface which is your right as a finite human being. I for one don&#39;t like being used by bankers, medical insurance, governments, monopolies.

    <div class="md"><p>Although I agree that the long tail ones are clickbait  (my neighbor is making explosives out of food), but of the most popular ones (popular in terms of evidence, public interest in the subject matter), they turn out to be about 40% of the time validated as true.  In other words, most of the time it&#39;s people talking shit about nothing, but an alarmingly high amount of time, people are talking about something real and we should therefore treat conspiracy theories with more merit than they are getting, which is practically none in the court of public opinion.</p>

<p>When you treat conpsiracy theories as a valid subject matter instead of dismissing them, then you are allowed to study them in a historical context.  This leads you down a very dark rabbit hole as you start to find all sorts of ways in which your governments, your groups and associations, your institutions, your causes, all lied very deeply to you.  Perhaps that&#39;s the reason why you slough off conspiracy theories. It&#39;s a head in the sand type thing.  Now go on and enjoy your happy ignorance type of thing.</p>
