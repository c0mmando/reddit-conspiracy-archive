<p>He went on, and on about how it seemed that nobody went to work today, and a lot were instructed to telecommute, just today. You could hear the concern and surprise in his voice. </p>

<p>I&#39;m looking for a podcast of it now to post here.  It was a very thought provoking opening monologue for sure.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to hijack this post and make it about God and religion,  but I have to bite here.  To argue against intelligent design,  is admitting that humanity is here, right now,  as we communicate over the Internet,  by a complete and incredible mistake.  It doesn&#39;t add up. </p>

<p>It&#39;s actually more then that.  It&#39;s an incredibly dangerous position to take as well.  If you don&#39;t believe in a higher power,  the state can easily fill that void,  and become your religion.  I&#39;m not saying you do personally,  I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s natural progression for a lot of people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There could also be another explanation. &#39;God&#39; may be in everything in the Universe, or everything made of &#39;god&#39;, like that saying: &#39;everything must be made of god because what else is there to make everything of&#39; (forgot where i read this). So we may have the divine spark so to speak inside us, capable of both destruction and creation, corruption and honesty, etc. How the world got in such a mess, ruled by an evil elite that have altered humanitys perception about what right or wrong is, acceptable or unacceptable, is another matter of debate. It might just be human nature. I believe humanity was hijavked, either by humans or some sort of alien / demon shit. Again, a matter of debate. So in conclusion, the creator could have made all this with good intentions, but it got corrupted along the way. Or he nade it and intended it to be exactly like this, for our souls to experience and learn from all. Either way, the creator would still be the creator, i.e. everything there is, all powerful and all expanding</p>

When the Pope came to DC 10 years ago, telework wasn&#39;t a big thing so most people came to work as usual and the traffic and metro crowding was a nightmare because hundreds of thousands of extra people were flocking around the city to follow the Pope wherever he went. It&#39;s inefficient to ask workers to sit in their cars for an extra hour or two so most companies told their workers they could work from home today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like you&#39;re mad they closed the roads. So what? Move on with your life. </p>

<p>There were parts where there were many people, and other parts of no people. Maybe those places were blocked off? Honestly, who cares? If you can&#39;t understand that a visit from the Pope is a big deal, then there&#39;s no reasoning with you. </p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m 110% positive those other deals you speak of aren&#39;t as big as the Pope. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No on &quot;instructed&quot; people to work from home. <a href="https://www.chcoc.gov/content/impact-2015-visit-his-holiness-pope-francis-washington-dc-commuters">Here is the official Office of Personnel Management memo</a> about the Pope&#39;s visit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>agencies are urged to permit employees to use their workplace flexibility options</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone who <em>wanted</em> to come to work as usual was fully permitted to do so. Turns out almost everyone took advantage of telework. I&#39;m in the private sector and we were offered the same thing. Nearly 50% of employees worked from home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Generally speaking many people that live in the area probably don&#39;t give a damn when a VIP comes here. The King of Saudi Arabia came to DC a few weeks ago, he had a humongous fleet of cars, and rented out the entire Embassy Suites Hotel (a fancy hotel in Georgetown). I did not get the sense people were half as hyped about him as they are about the Pope. The local news has been talking about this for three weeks or so.</p>
