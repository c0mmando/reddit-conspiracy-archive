        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know how much flak I am going to get just for talking about this but I don&#39;t care anymore. You people can be very short-sighted and bigoted, and it does not phase me whatsoever.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just going to drop some statements that may or may not resonate with you; you can accept them as truth or disbelieve them; that is your choice.</p>

<p>We are being lied to on every level; physically, medically, spiritually, mentally, socially, sexually, strategically, politically, etc etc. </p>

<p>The world is run by a series of under the radar, inter-connected cults and secret societies who have various goals and projects all culminating in one thing; the extraction of human energy.</p>

<p>This world is a soul farm. I do not fully understand HOW they are doing these things but I do now see WHY. </p>

<p>We are the most powerful, most important most influential piece of this whole puzzle. Our minds are the key and that is where the battle resides. They have all the land, all the money.</p>

<p>They control the material world fully. Absolutely. Our victory comes from within. Every religion tries to seek this principle out but falls short, likely a purposeful result of centuries of adaptation and (mis-)interpretation.</p>

<p>I think we all get the sense that something is very, very wrong with this world. Yet, cannot put our finger on it. </p>

<p>I think I could best describe it as &quot;amnesia&quot;</p>

<p>In other words, not understanding who we are, or what we are. </p>

<p>I have done the research; I am aware of the scope of our species&#39; experimentation on itself and our environment. Look into the Deep Web; you will see humanity at its darkest.</p>

<p>Consider the fact that the Deep Web accounts for 96% of the internet; child pornography, sex trafficking, drug trafficking, contract killing, intelligence chat rooms, cannibalism, satanism, conspiracy limited hangouts, malware training grounds, hacking job openings, etc.</p>

<p>The Earth is the center of the universe.
The sun isn&#39;t the center of the universe.
The world isn&#39;t round and the world is flat. 
The world is MAN</p>

<p>Man is the center of the universe.</p>

<p>The point I want my fellow, true guardians of Earth to realize is,</p>

<p>we get to decide WHAT Earth is.</p>

<p>I want Earth to be free. </p>

<p>Because it truly is up to you the manner in which you are affected, but you have little choice in terms of how you are effected.  You&#39;re just a bag of blood and bones.  If you pop, you pop.  How you feel about it isn&#39;t a question about &quot;reality.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now I understand your perspective fully on this and can speak knowingly. You are NOT just a bag of blood and bones, whoever told you that throughout your life was tragically skewed. Modern &quot;Science&quot; pushes this worldview onto children and it is truly sickening. You are the universe experiencing itself. You are NOT a drop in the ocean, you are in fact, the ocean in a drop. If the car hits me, and I&#39;m thinking &quot;I&#39;m nothing but a pathetic ant on a hill of human industry&quot;, wow what a world. If I get hit thinking &quot;I love my neighbor, I have loved this life, I appreciate it..ouch my spleen&quot; that&#39;s a whole different mindset. Knowing that life is indeed truly trivial is where your power, spiritual power resides. DO SOMETHING WITH THE TIME YOU HAVE </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really disagree with you.  But I also don&#39;t think there is any practically consequence with regard to reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was a typo, I meant to say that both the Earth and the sun are not the center, which have both been common beliefs throughout history. I also meant to say that it is neither flat, nor round, but that of an illusion. </p>

<p>I am not what you would call &quot;humanocentric&quot;</p>

<p>I AM a humanist, but I believe our place as &quot;intelligent&quot; living creatures is that of a steward of this world. </p>

<p>We are no more important than the bees who pollinate flowers we enjoy, or the birds who fly over head. We are all the same Great Being watching itself.</p>

<p>Think of humanity as the pilot or the conductor. </p>

<p>I do not doubt the existence of other worlds, endless possibility, and or the possible reality of a space/time cosmos model contrived by NASA and the scientific community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can definitely understand your suspicion but I can promise you I am a young, passive college student who simply cares THAT much about my fellow man. Call me a revolutionary, call me an anarchist, call me what you wish; but please, don&#39;t put me in the same boat as those who have sold their souls to the worldwide brotherhood of violence known as the U.S military. I actually almost joined the military for selfish reasons; I had to really forgive myself when I came to and realized that that is essentially spiritual suicide. In reference to the flat earth, you clearly have not fully understood my position or what I have been saying here in the comments. My view is more of one of a simulation or a computer program, not necessarily a flat or round earth question. What your saying is not really on the same wavelength. </p>

<p>Take heart, for I am NOT a member of their New Age. </p>

<p>I believe that the world is a lot weirder and more wondrous than we can ever fully comprehend. It doesn&#39;t take just thoughts to change something, it requires ACTION.</p>

<p>Putting the thoughts into action is the hardest thing anyone can do.</p>

<p>Equally hard, is understanding how our thoughts are affected by outside influences. </p>

<p>We have to work together to eliminate these, assumptions.</p>

<p>You are right to question me, but I swear I am not of their New Age. </p>

<p>If I can put it in perspective for you, I believe they created Satanism AND Christianity (our ideas of good and evil) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Geography was a study of the Earth&#39;s surface, divided into four metrics.
Climate,
Topography (Mineral studies),
Vegetation (Vegetable Studies),
Population (Animate Life Studies),</p>

<p>&quot;World&quot; was a germanic word to distinguish Human Affairs and their impact on those, as a principle aspect of the category &quot;Populations&quot;.</p>

<p>It is not until the 12th Century Rennaissance which brought a resurgance of Hellenist and Neo Platonic ideas back, infused with early Jewish Cabala, and hints of Asian Thought that we see &quot;World&quot; used in a greater, universal context, or even a planetary one.</p>

<p>Now the word &quot;World&quot; is so ambiguous, of course there are worlds that are flat.  And there is nonconscikus mind that can encompass every aspect of the planet into one composite idea of any useful detail...  so saying &quot;the world is flat&quot; is a useless statement.  It is made true by turning on Super Mario Brothers and start, entering World 1-1.</p>

<p>So, instead of speaking what you do, simply declare what you hope to convey.  And better yet, do so in a way that has the desired impact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of your ideas here expounded are new age, nor unique.</p>

<p>What you are stating, effectively, is that mankind are Gods, as Gods were defined by Hellenism.  This comes from Post-Babylonian Stoicism, where Man as Universe emerged.  His &quot;pneuma&quot; or soul consists of a relic of the divine, as the ruach elohim, or breath of God, to the early Afro-Semites.  To the stoic, it was more seen as Fire in literary sense.  This is capable of God is capable of, and is pinnacle to the emergence of religion as a philosophical discipline.</p>

<p>However, this is not so easy to follow.  Nor is this subreddit where it should be done.  In a phiolosophy forum or subreddit, you will do well to find more people willing to engage this or even find help yomlearn how mankind collectively and individually came to contemplate this and whose works are supportive and contrary to such ideas.</p>

<p>the extraction of human energy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sounds funny, but that&#39;s exactly what it is. The only thing that has any economic value is human labor. Every resource is something that previously took some labor. It&#39;s not just energy, but energy that is applied to achieve a goal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This world is a soul farm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More like Labor farm. I would agree if soul just means &quot;stored energy,&quot; which is sort of what most religions imply.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The world isn&#39;t round and the world is flat</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The planet Earth is round. The world is where people live; a non-material concept. It&#39;s like asking what shape the economy is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Man is the center of the universe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only if you&#39;re using the term universe as some concept like world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said you know why. This why represents for you the medieval concept of anthropocentrism.</p>

<p>Look up Fermi&#39;s Paradox. You have absolutely no proof in affirming, neither contesting the fact that humankind is the center of existence. As such, you are as worse as those who you think &quot;lie&quot; to you about our position and meaning.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I am convinced that humans exploit humans, but not so much on the fact that many of them know why aside from prejudice, &quot;right to rule&quot; and confirmation bias.</p>

<p>There is a higher plan. And as a knife cannot cut itself, so humans cannot fully comprehend their meaning and coordinates. But as a child who has his ego inflated, we often risk to see ourselves as a vital plan of everything that surrounds us. That may be true, but until the curtain falls, we are only a vital part to our own well being.</p>

<p>You are the guardian of your own self - nothing else Don&#39;t take the weight of Devachaic planes on your shoulders - you are not build for it. You have an even greater burden: the paradox between your role and your relative insignificance. Refrain from zelous behaviour and watch out for not becoming that which you hate. Society is in it&#39;s state just because people who thought that they were the center of everything got to power. Do not fight fire with fire - you will only reap ashes.</p>

<p>If you want Earth to be free - free yourself. From anger, from hatred, from &quot;hero&quot; complexes. Stray your own path.</p>

<p>The wheels of Harvest never end their grinding. But remember the the waters flow as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoyed reading this. You have my attention. In reference to the two different camps on anthrocentrism, I will say this again; I am not a humanocentric person. We either are the center of the universe, or we aren&#39;t. I&#39;m very, very aware of the Fermi Paradox, and accept each of its possibie explanations equally; do humans come from another planet? Is this a prison world? Did we evolve from earlier hominids? Did we mate with these hominids? Were extraterrestrial civilizations involved? Our origins are COMPLELETY up for grabs. Did they create us, gene splice us? Something like that? Is this a game? All of these questions and more, come to me; because I am not the kind of person who puts humanity on a pedestal. On the flip side, I have seen what humans are capable of, and it is eye opening. It is just as likely that ancient human priests discovered significant scientific and esoteric knowledge and were able to contrive this whole extraterresidtral/anglers and demons story up to control the masses. The question for me is not &quot;do aliens exist&quot; it is &quot;do aliens exist outside of the human consciousness&quot;, which I believe in some of many ways, they do. I HAVE freed myself, I am trying my very best to help others let go of their fear and BE OBJECTIVE </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which is why you should adopt a different attitude, which better reflects your convictions - or rather - lack of conviction as you well expressed in this reply. Voltaire said in an elegant way, &#39;It is difficult to free people from the chains that they venerate&#39;.</p>

<p>So the direct conclusions which you have - the ones that take an angle shot towards simulation theory, gnosticism (I hope you read material on this by the way; it&#39;s right up your alley. And mine, don&#39;t worry), alien/demonic possibilities (remember Crowley&#39;s sketch on his encounter), and many many more - you are offering the direct spoiler to people who just float on some internet memes and on vague references.</p>

<p>This lack of patience and mental resilience is actually what degraded knowledge and made if laughable in the eyes of the masses. The fact that most people lack education (epistemology, basic scientifical and philosophical concepts to slowly grasp the completely relative nature of our existence in regard to our perceptions,etc) turns people against the concept. </p>

<p>So let me exemplify: when you go around telling people, on the internet on irl, that the world is flat - or that we are in a prison - or anything else of the sorts - they will REBUKE you violently. Maybe not explicitly, but inside a vicious reaction will occur: you are endangering their comfort zone. They start to tell themselves about you: &quot;Who the fuck is this guy to pretend to know these things? Is he for real or is he high?&quot;. In the meantime, as you se them unconvinced on the exterior, you continue to try and offer arguments. In their minds goes &quot;what a load of bullshit&quot;. Why? Because they are not you and you are not they. As far as we are now one from each other (even blood kin), we are living each in his own prison of arrogance and self-indulgence. This is what must be worked upon, to find the cracks in these self-imposed walls. </p>

<p>The problem is that most mainstream forces on this planet work, some with intent, other out of inertia (they are on the right path for those who have set them, and now rule themselves in their ignorance by the means of the system; ex: media, social currents, institutions, justice, etc) towards ENFORCING these walls.</p>

<p>What we need may be as you speak between your lines of grief: re-evolution. That does not mean involution to a backwards society of rape and murder (not that the current one is not as this), it means just stepping - sometimes on our own - a few steps back to look at the mess we got ourselves into.</p>

<p>Remember - you cannot force freedom. Force brings force. If a man enjoys being a slave to pride - my dear fellow, you will fall so hardly with him. Because the light sometimes shines too bright for some that are in the dark, and the blindness that it concurs only makes them go even moreso deep in their muddy, sugar-coated pool of oblivion.</p>

<p>I may have went too far with some ideas. This is a difficult subject, very vast - and I now realize that I did not reply to most of your (competent yet difficult to tackle) questions about our origin and meaning. I could reply later if you like about some of the convictions I personally uphold regarding these question - all of them possibilities and nothing more.</p>

<p>The truth is not ours to have. We are only it&#39;s result.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, thank you. I&#39;m thinking very hard about what you said. It brings up a few very deep questions I have; &quot;is it even my place to tell someone else what is true?&quot; &quot;Does humanity deserve to be saved at all?&quot; &quot;Does it even matter?&quot; &quot;Will the universe bat an eye if we all go ka-boom&quot;? I honestly don&#39;t know, man. I sure hope with every fiber of my being that we can escape the prison WE have built. On the other hand, it really wouldn&#39;t phase me (or the universe) if this all ended. There are just SO many possibilities. We could be gods, we could be amnesiacs about to wake up.. We could be spiritual beings of immense power and honor. We could create life, we could take it away. It is all the power of the universe at our fingertips, in our minds and here we are arguing with each other on a website about the shape of the &quot;planet&quot;. We don&#39;t need planets when we have our minds. The point is, I understand what your saying; I get the message. Arrogance, hubris, and bloodlust; all bad things (all things I struggle with spiritually). It may be that we&#39;re too far gone to help these poor, ignorant savages. But they are MY savages; and I will cut and bleed and rot and die with them in this cesspool of radiated trash and tidal waves; whatever nasty things we have to experience; I am with them. They are my people. We have A chance. One chance. </p>
