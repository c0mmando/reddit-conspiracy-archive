<p>The difference between Obama and Trump are the campaign contributions.  </p>

<p>For Trump, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/donald-trump-president-2016-donors-213102">these are the kinds of people</a> that are contributing to his campaign.  </p>

<p>For Trump, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/contrib.php?cycle=2016&amp;amp;id=N00023864&amp;amp;type=f">these are the companies or corporations</a> that are contributing to his campaign. </p>

<p>For Obama&#39;s 2012 campaign, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/contrib.php?id=N00009638">these were the companies and corporations</a> that <strong>heavily</strong> contributed to his re-election campaign.  And it&#39;s been reported that Obama took close to $1 million dollars from Goldman Sachs for his 2012 campaign.</p>

<p>Do you see the difference in cash amounts between Obama and Trump?</p>

<p>The contributors to Trump want him to win because of his policies.</p>

<p>The contributors to Obama wanted him to win because the contributors wanted their &quot;favors&quot; paid back once Obama got into office.</p>

<p>Trump isn&#39;t going to owe anyone when he gets into office.</p>

<p>Its the last 10 seconds that are most mind blowingly  now that wages in america for so many of these jobs have dropped to $6 an hour just as he predicted. Wow.</p>

<p>Too bad he was short and had a funny voice and that america was so easily diswayed by that.</p>

<p>Actually i think one thing that killed Perot was when he said he wanted to have police storm everyones houses for drugs. That scared people bad.  That and the fact that he quit to avoid some scrutiny he was getting about some past business with the nixon  government  hoping he could get back in and win and avoid the scrutiny.  It didnt work when he tried to get back in. He wasnt trusted anymore.</p>

<p>But he sure was right aboit NAFTA.</p>

<p>THANKS FOR THAT BRILLIANT CLIP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just discussing this with my father. Here is how i see it.. Trump may be popular, but I doubt he would be considered an insider. I really think that if Trump were to win, the Fed would raise the interest rate the moment he took over. The economy would falter, and Trump would get the blame. I think the &#39;insiders&#39; are kicking the can down the road, not addressing the deficit, hell, almost tripling it under Obama, and a non-insider would then be tasked with reducing it, even though there really hasn&#39;t been a peep lately about it. I really liked most of things Trump said last night.. he said the fund managers bilking the system and not paying their share was great, and that we really need to stick to companies who sell shit here, but move out of country for the labor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His idea is that corporate taxes are too high (35%), and lobbyists don&#39;t want to fight taxes directly because it&#39;s too hard, so instead they bribe people to introduce loopholes that the general public doesn&#39;t care about. That&#39;s why Apple is financially an Irish company and is holding $70 billion overseas, and together the 8 largest US tech companies are hiding $420 billion from the IRS. </p>

<p>Trump would lower the tax rate and negotiate with companies to bring the cash back to the US, and probably give an even bigger tax break if they spent it here on new jobs. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;ll work, but at least there&#39;s some sense to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s not how business works.  Businesses hire people to make their products when there is a strong market for that product.  They always seek the lowest priced worker.  Unfortunately that worker is in China and India.  China literally has slave prison labor which works for their daily meals.  We will never be able to compete with that.  </p>

<p>Giving corporations tax breaks simply puts more money in their pockets or should I say in their offshore accounts.  Why would they move money to the US?  It&#39;s not going to be spent on building factories, the US interest rates are way too low so what do it?</p>

<p>These schemes do nothing but increase profitability for corporations and do absolutely nothing to create jobs.  </p>

<p>Give a small business a million dollars and it will put a million dollars in the bank.  Having a good profit coming in means you&#39;re at your most efficient operating point.  Hiring more workers would destroy that efficiency.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually when you boost MIDDLE CLASS income it DOES stimulate the economy.</p>

<p>That was proven by FDR when he did it and pulled the USA back to pre depression GDP in 1 year and two years BEFORE the out break of WW2.</p>

<p>What failed was giving more wealth to the 1%who dont spend enough to stimulate the overall economy.</p>

<p>Also if you curtail the monopolistic practices in the health care system you can get full coverage FOR CRIITICAL CARE  (life threatening injury and sickness) and still SAVE much more than we spend. (maybe not recurring mental health and every other endless treatment but critical care for everyone)</p>

<p>If you just allow the government to negotiate for drug prices which they are now needlessly prohibited from doing they can save hundreds of millions.</p>
