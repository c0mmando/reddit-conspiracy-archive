        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwvXw7Ck7Y">Here is the video</a></strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.whale.to/b/greenbaum.html">Primer to MK Ultra</a></strong></p>

<p>I was interested in learning more about the case of Sirhan Sirhan, which seems to be the most documented and obvious case of MK Ultra that we have to date. That&#39;s when I found this video.</p>

<p>This video sent me down a major rabbit hole on MK Ultra research. Jonestown was a revelation, for example. </p>

<p><strong>What really interested me, however, was the bit about Sirhan Sirhan&#39;s hypnosis while in custody and the connection to Albert DeSalvo (The Boston Strangler). STRANGE!</strong></p>

<p>I then found an entire series called <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUrqLhbfjeo">&quot;Programmed to Kill&quot;</a>.</strong> You will have to conduct research while watching this series, as most of the information isn&#39;t properly sourced. </p>

<p>I have been on the fence about the Occult and its relation to MK Ultra, but am more convinced now that there does, in fact, seem to be a connection between MK Ultra, ritual abuse and some factions of the Occult, as well as military and police collusion. </p>

<p>More interesting, possibly, is the fact that many of these serial killers have a military background and have spent time at military hospitals (sometimes the same exact ones).</p>

<p>Join me in the rabbit hole search for the truth. There seems to be something to this. </p>

<p><strong>My Hypothesis is this: 1) The Occult is used to recruit low-level, &quot;white trash&quot;, or very poor people from severely abusive families into committing the most depraved acts on humanity for payment of video or picture evidence of torture and snuff for higher level deviants who will pay big money for such things. MK Ultra may be used to influence/control said, poor individuals whom already have fractured identities. 2) The military are recruiting grounds for CIA/MK Ultra to program killers for specific political/business hits or agendas.</strong></p>

<p><strong>What do you think about it all?</strong></p>

<p>Edit: The Occult is not a religion. My bad. I&#39;m still looking for a better term than Satanism. However, those who take part seem to worship the devil....so....I don&#39;t have a working term yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/like-a-duck-in-a-noose/">Police chief reads hypnoprogramming phrase to D.C. sniper (2002):  &quot;We understand that hearing us say this is important to you:  Like A Duck In A Noose&quot;</a></p>

<p>The <em>Programmed To Kill</em> series you found on YouTube is from a <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/like-a-duck-in-a-noose/">book by Dave McGowan</a>, a conspiracy author who is now <a href="http://www.davesweb.cnchost.com/cancer.html">dying of cancer that someone warned him he would &quot;get&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>McGowan&#39;s premise in <em>Programmed To Kill</em> is that MKUltra is used to program serial killers -- but also that <em>serial killers are tools of the elite for political murders</em>.</p>

<p>McGowan&#39;s book does not mention this, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Julius_Gumbel">German author E. J. Gumbel wrote the exact same thing in 1922 when Nazis were taking over Germany with political assassinations</a>.  Gumbel&#39;s 1922 book <em>Four Years of Political Murders</em> is not available in the U.S. and references to Gumbel are mostly scrubbed from the Internet and search engines.</p>

<p>In Germany during the post-WW1 Weimar Republic, there was a decade like the 1970s in the U.S. in which the rise of &quot;serial killers&quot;  corresponded to a series of 400 political assassinations across Germany.  Gumbel pointed the finger at the Nazis and their Brown Shirts army.</p>

<p>Hypnoprogramming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Mesmer">dates back to the 1700s at minimum</a>, and is a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;biw=&amp;amp;bih=&amp;amp;q=youtube+hypnosis+chicken&amp;amp;gbv=2&amp;amp;oq=youtube+hypnosis+chicken&amp;amp;gs_l=heirloom-hp.3..0i22i30.429.4515.0.4716.24.19.0.2.2.0.228.1830.12j5j1.18.0....0...1ac.1.34.heirloom-hp..4.20.1840.tQkJ5o-x9pU">well-known phenomenon that can be learned with farm animals on YouTube.</a></p>

<p>In 1894, one of the top five best-selling novels of all time in the U.S. was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilby_(novel"><em>Trilby</em></a>), about a hypnotist.</p>

<p>Political assassinations in the U.S. which may be connected to individuals who were hypnotized include the assassinations of President Garfield, President McKinley, and Senator Huey Long.</p>

<p>In 2014, in the state of Washington, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;biw=&amp;amp;bih=&amp;amp;q=hypnosis+pharmacist+washington&amp;amp;gbv=2&amp;amp;oq=hypnosis+pharmacist+washington&amp;amp;gs_l=heirloom-hp.3...16813.23260.0.24126.32.13.1.17.17.0.258.1443.9j3j1.13.0....0...1ac.1.34.heirloom-hp..15.17.1460.DkkDkp9QMW0">an assistant pharmacist had his license revoked by the state for amateur hypnosis in which he hypnotized and raped a woman</a>.  </p>

<p>When somebody tells you that they don&#39;t believe in hypnosis, tell them that hypnosis is recognized by the state in criminal prosecutions.</p>

<p>Recommended:  if you don&#39;t read the book <em>Programmed To Kill</em> then at least <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;biw=&amp;amp;bih=&amp;amp;q=dave+mcgowan+programmed+youtube&amp;amp;gbv=2&amp;amp;oq=dave+mcgowan+programmed+youtube&amp;amp;gs_l=heirloom-hp.3...3044.8332.0.8529.35.14.2.19.19.0.230.709.11j2j1.14.0....0...1ac.1.34.heirloom-hp..18.17.577.NyLYgxxsQ0Q">listen to the interviews with McGowan on YouTube</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To transcend certain &quot;ranks&quot; in the occult, it is sometimes required of them to make a blood sacrifice. Often the victim is required to be the person&#39;s child as they are required to give up the most precious thing to them in exchange for more occultic power from Satan or an increase into the higher &quot;ranks&quot; of the occult . The decision to throw his son to the hypothetical wolves would&#39;ve been made long before the occurrence and thus the father is most likely in on it and had come to terms with his decision a time before it needed to happen. That would be my initial guess in any case. There are other similar cases, such as that of Miley Cyrus, where the parents let their child undergo monarch mind control in exchange for money and fame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post overall, although I think your definition of the occult is a little off. It&#39;s not technically a religion as there isn&#39;t one god or entity that is worshiped or one code of conduct. </p>

<p>The occult is by definition hidden knowledge. It&#39;s more a way of unlocking the mysteries of the universe more than a religious doctrine.</p>

<p>This is why freemasons and other occult organizations are so powerful because they are working with a cheat sheet to life so to speak while everyone else that doesn&#39;t know this &quot;hidden&quot; knowledge is pretty much just winging it. Not much competition when you&#39;re cheating. Not that it&#39;s really cheating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So rather then calling what you are talking about satanism, as <a href="/u/Alcorr">/u/Alcorr</a> says it is a misnomer, speaking about it as <em>Occult Practitioners.</em>  Occult Practitioners practice ritualistic magic. satanist are born from christian belief system and they fail to understand what they are reading just like satanists.  It says in the bible that Christ says everything he says is in parable, so they go right ahead and take it all literally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I prefer the definition of the occult as; that which is hidden.</p>

<p>The &#39;occult&#39; is simply then a catch all for those groups who work in secret to control others. So then Freemasonry, Khabbala, Satanism are just a few of the these &#39;occult&#39; groups.</p>

<p>Satanism might best be described as trauma based mind control. Ritual sacrifice is a tool of trauma, hence control.</p>

<p>And all of these Occult groups are ultimately Religious. As that is a critical element of the control system.</p>

<p>That would be a misnomer though. The occult does not necessarily need to be about control, although it often is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting. MK Ultra and the programming of individuals is fascinating. </p>

<p>Personally I feel that I was being programmed last time I took drugs, long story, maybe I was just fucked up but nothing would really surprise me at this point. </p>

<p>Ultimately it is about control. I think for these elite groups their thinking is , &quot; if you are weak enough to be controlled, you deserve it.&quot;</p>

<p>I know that&#39;s fucked up to say but I think it&#39;s how they rationalize it. Kind of like with televangelism, if you&#39;re stupid enough to believe miracle water on the tv will cure you how can you blame someone else for exploiting that?</p>

<p>Either way its fucked up for sure. But is there any escaping it or fighting back? That&#39;s the real question. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lsd, and then mdma. The short version is I thought I was being programmed to be gay, which is odd because I&#39;ve never felt that way before. </p>

<p>This spiraled into a further paranoia and ultimately I was up for 4 days straight. I still can barely seem to sleep and it&#39;s 3 weeks later. I just want to be normal again but it&#39;s freaking me out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are ALL being programmed. Drugs just make the programming more effective, in some cases much more effective. TV, Radio, Internet, School. All used constantly to &#39;program&#39; the populace. You are not somehow &#39;immune&#39;
because you understand this fact. There are many methods of mind control just as there are many layers of consciousness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the short end of the story is I tried to resist the programming last time I took a psychedelic drug at a large rock concert. Now I have extreme insomnia and moments where I feel schizophrenic/psychotic. </p>

<p>I&#39;m praying that I come back to normal again but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;ll happen. Just trying to avoid suicide at this point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay OP, you&#39;re closer to the truth than you know. The elite do indeed dwell in the occult. Specifically, the Illuminati are all Luciferians, they worship, get their power and knowledge from Lucifer himself, and this differs from Satanism. </p>

<p>This has been going on for decades now and you should be careful how far you dig. A good portion of it goes beyond the physical realms. The spirits the occult world is sending towards their victims have much influence in the matter. Child sacrifices, cannibalism, death in general pleases the &quot;enemy&quot; like nothing else, so he uses his power to aid the elite with their plans, for they are aligned with his will as well.</p>

<p>MK Ultra is the physical aspect of total people/mind control, while the occult deals with the spiritual. With the two of them together, the power is immense. </p>
