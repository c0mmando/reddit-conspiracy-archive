       Then they're not alpha males, are they? The fallacy you're falling victim to is the assumption that physical states are he only determination of worth. This is simply not the case, as it takes brains to understand that, no matter how muscular you get, you cannot take down a wooly mammoth (or whatever large feat you'd consider primitively man to have accomplished).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, look at leaders. Are they big buff men? No. Smarts rule in the real world, thanks to technology and ingenuity. Always has, always will.

       What's there to be insecure about? Humans use technology to get ahead of competition. It's evolution. I'd say the "insecure" ones are the meatheads who played high school sports and didn't make college or professional level and are now pawns in the military. Total betas!

       The neo cortex is evolving.  The rest of our bodies are being rejected.  It is the social memes that are replicating and evolving.  These are all extensions of the cortex.  all of technology and culture represents a materialistic representation of the cortex.  Religious thought that the sou will escape the body after death is representative of the cortexs desire to escape the rotting piece of meat we call a body.  Ai, virtual reality and robotics will bring this about.  It will no longer be human just the side of critical data processing no longer will emotions be in the way.

       You can think whatever you want but I suggest you hear what Ray kurzweil has to say, it's not pseudo science.  Alpha males are necessary to maintain our genetic significance, their behaviors increase our physical relevance and dependence on the body.  Society is increasingly feminine.

       I'm not talking about physical appearance.  For example when we medically save lives and those people should have died, if they then go on to reproduce the gene pool is potentially weakened.  Alpha males don't seek to save lives they promote strength not weakness.  The Spartans practiced infanticide, that is eugenics while we practice malgenics.

       Do you believe sucker berg or bill gates or Rothschild's are alpha males?  These are the people who lead us.  There are alphas who are not deceived but the game is dependent on brutal deception and true alphas do not need to be deceptive because they are legit and secure with who they are.  Only yes men make it to the top.

       Well I think the entire paradigm of darwinism isn't really relevant anymore. Evolution got us this far and it's now time for us to evolve as individuals. People at the top of the $ game are no more or less alpha than the plebs at the bottom of the pyramid. The real alphas are those who carve out their own inner existence separate from the bullshit and/or who fight against it. It sounds like you'd be happier if our leaders were swole?

       The number one threat to humanity is tech.  The reason I focused on alphas in the post is because the break down of humanity's physical and genetic integrity.  Alphas play a critical role in that by putting higher physical stresses into their environments and by dominating sexual control through harems.  The more civilized we become the less sexual selection occurs.  Whenever the medical field saves lives of those who have genetic weakness and then they go on to reproduce we have weakened our genes.  This attrition will increase our dependence on tech and it will continue to evolve at an exponential rate while we do not.  Check out Ray kurzweil.

       I don't believe oil comes from dead Dino's.  Global warming is a communist plot to spread the wealth globally and prevent third world countries from reproducing out of control.  We are continuing to move away from oil based products everyday.  Even gmo food is all about moving away from oil based pesticides.  Most things are going water or plant based now.  I believe tesla found a way transfer energy wirelessly and extract it from the earths ionosphere.  His research was stopped by jp Morgan and he died in poverty.  Free energy is something that cannot be allowed by the hierarch because it would collapse.

       I believe in in the electric universe theory which involves plans as in space.  There is energy in space and they have just found the plasma rings around the earth.  These are charged by the sun.  And who are you kidding?  The only thing that was deemed dangerous from tesla was his threat to the hierarchy.  Oil come from the earth.  Why do you think they can drill down below the fossil record.

       They haven't just found this, we've known about radiation belts, plasma belts, and many other bands of energy that come spooling off the sun and become trapped in our magnetic field.

       Tesla wasn't deemed a threat by anybody. He was a lab researcher who came up with some interesting patents that supported modern progress. He was also a bit mad and had some crazy ideas that didn't pan out.

       This sentence is nonsensical. Whether or not they can drill beneath the fossil record (which I'm fairly sure they can't), doesn't speak to how oil is created. So, how is oil 'created by the Earth'?

       Auto correct is a bitch.  I meant to say plasma.  And yes new there exists new evidence of plasma rings that they DID NOT know we're there just recently.  Tessa's ideas didn't pan out because they destroyed his research.  And no the final sentence means they drill far beyond the fossil layers.  Oil may just be created from pressure and heat inside the earth.

      <p>
       That's not true.  In any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that we name formations based on the age of life?  Ordovician, Devonian, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       In the process of drilling, we use mud to wash the pulverized material uphole to the surface.  That mud is re-used, and sent back downhole.  BEFORE it is sent back downhole, though, it goes through the 'Shakers' that shake out all sediment.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can go to the shakers and get cuttings, and they very often contain fossils.
      </p>
      <p>
       It IS possible to find hydrocarbons in non-fossil formations, but those are generally ABOVE the fossil formation.
      </p>
      <p>
       You won't find oil below the fossil record.  Period.

       A few things.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         A 30k foot well as advertised is rare, but not very rare.  The deepest TVD ever reached is actually
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole">
          40.2k feet
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You know that formations have different thicknesses in different parts of the world right?  Where I'm from you can reach Cretaceous era formations in just a few thousand feet, but in areas of Russia you can't even break the Miocene without going far deeper.  This is why we use Age of Life  or age of formation instead of depth across the world as a comparison.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The figure you quoted is Measured Depth.  This is different from True Vertical Depth.  To put it simply, Measured Depth is how much pipe we put in the ground.  When we drill, though, we don't end up drilling in a straight line, so the MD very often deviates from TVD.  We do this intentionally to drill horizontals.     The deepest oil-producing wells I am aware of are about 30,000 feet in MD, but not TVD.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Kola borehole actually found fossils even that deep.  Plankton, to be precise.  From 2.7 billion years ago, at 22.7k feet/
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       So, the deepest well ever drilled found fossils.
      </p>
      <p>
       That means no oil has been retrieved from below the fossil record, because it would have to go even deeper.

       Gold achieved fame for his 1992 paper "The Deep Hot Biosphere" in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which presented a controversial view of the origin of coal, oil, and gas deposits, a theory of an abiogenic petroleum origin. The theory suggests coal and crude oil deposits have their origins in natural gas flows which feed bacteria living at extreme depths under the surface of the Earth; in other words, oil and coal are produced through tectonic forces, rather than from the decomposition of fossils. At the beginning of his 1992 paper Gold also referred to ocean vents that pump bacteria from the depth of the earth towards the ocean floor in support of his views. A number of new such hydrothermal vents have since been discovered, as recently as 2007.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gold also published a book of the same title in 1999, which expanded on the arguments in his 1992 paper and included speculations on the origin of life. He has been accused of stealing the abiogenic theory outright from Soviet geologists who first published it in the 1950s.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Gold and the Soviet geologists who originated the abiogenic theory, bacteria feeding on the oil accounts for the presence of biological debris in hydrocarbon fuels, obviating the need to resort to a biogenic theory for the origin of the latter. The flows of underground hydrocarbons may also explain oddities in the concentration of other mineral deposits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most geologists do recognize the geologic carbon cycle includes subducted carbon, which returns to the surface, with studies showing the carbon does rise in various ways. Gold and geology experts point out the biogenic theories do not explain phenomena such as helium in oil fields and oil fields associated with deep geologic features.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, recent discoveries have shown that bacteria live at depths far greater than previously believed. Though this does not prove Gold's theory, it may lend support to its arguments. A thermal depolymerization process which converts animal waste to carbon fuels does show some processes can be done without bacterial action, but does not explain details of natural oil deposits such as magnetite production.
      </p>
      <p>
       An article on abiogenic hydrocarbon production in the February 2008 issue of Science Magazine reported how the abiotic synthesis of hydrocarbons in nature may occur in the presence of ultramafic rocks, water, and moderate amounts of heat.

       Gold tested his hypothesis several times, each time resulting in failure to prove his hypothesis. His work on this actually dates back to the 50's back when he was a proponent of the 'Steady State' Hypothesis of the Universe.

       And I don't know what you think your image proves.  It's hilarious that you seem to be a professional at this.  Definitely appropriate for the title of this post.  A sexually insecure male who embraces technology so much that he is a professional "debunker" with pictures and everything.  Ha.  What a joke.

       You mean someone proved the theoretical plasma rings that we've known of for over 60 years. This isn't news, it's a proof for a well supported theory.

      <p>
       Absolutely false. We've never drilled past the fossil record. Oil cannot be created merely by heat and pressure inside the Earth. The Russians tried to prove out an abiotic origin for oil and failed in the 50's. There's a reason why almost no one thinks it is a possibility. Abiotic oil would be found almost everywhere. Actual oil is not found everywhere. Abiotic hypotheses cannot predict where one would find oil, all current biotic theory is incredibly good at predicting where oil will be found.

       When a hypothesis fails to predict the way the world is, the world isn't wrong, the hypothesis is.

       You've ad hoc'd a lot of crap into this. I'd like to see your source that says Goldman Sachs is pushing global government via cap and trade. Bonus points if it is actually somewhat reputable.

      <p>
       That's not accurate. The best way to do it would be to enable them to create wealth, and create infrastructure that can educate and increase their average health. Health and welfare are key to preventing catastrophic overpopulation. What you're saying here is Goldman Sachs is trying to protect you and the rest of the human race. I'm sure that isn't what you're trying to say, so try again with evidence this time.

       Oil and hydrocarbons are not necessarily the same things. Oil is made of hydrocarbons, but not all hydrocarbons are from oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hydrocarbons are anything containing Hydrogen and Carbon. You can have a short chain hydrocarbon, like methane, CH4 (in abundance on Titan), or a long chain like Octane C8H18 (not found anywhere other than on Earth, and a primary component of petroleum).

       I agree. The slave rediculous hours ... taking trains in and out of the cities later and earlier than the white collar men.. or they sit and rot in jails for being pushed around by beta-police..slaves for the 1%...which yes -- wants to keep alpha males oppressed. Along with women.

       The number one threat to humanity is tech.  The reason I focused on alphas in the post is because the break down of humanity's physical and genetic integrity.  Alphas play a critical role in that by putting higher physical stresses into their environments and by dominating sexual control through harems.  The more civilized we become the less sexual selection occurs.  Whenever the medical field saves lives of those who have genetic weakness and then they go on to reproduce we have weakened our genes.  This attrition will increase our dependence on tech and it will continue to evolve at an exponential rate while we do not.  Check out Ray kurzweil.
