       Edit: Well, thanks for the handful of questions, which have been surprisingly respectful, and your kind suggestions for seeking help. I guess at least I may have gotten two or three people thinking about the potential dangers of brain chips. I will be back tomorrow in case anybody posts a question or comment, but I guess this AMA isn't really going anywhere
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I have found out that the technology to network human brains exists today. As inconceivable as it may sound, somebody has already managed to give everybody in the world a brain chip. I believe that this technology already existed ten or twenty years ago. I also think they may have done everything in their power to limit the progress of technology and science in this regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this from what I've learned from my own experience. I seem to have a special kind of brain chip that activates the chips around it. People around me tend to act weird/fake/creepy in various ways and are always converging on whatever point I'm standing or sitting at.
      </p>
      <p>
       My brain chips have become like an extra sense organ. Nobody seems to have the technology to create a machine that can process or synthesize neural signals very well, so most work is done by the brains of actual people. And I can sense them, constantly. I can feel them trying to push ideas into my head and trying to work my emotions. I can also feel, locate and to some extent manipulate the brains/people in the network around me.
      </p>
      <p>
       These aren't secret agents or anything, it's more like sort of a call center-like environment full of slaves. The vast majority of them seem to be following the same script and trying the same things over and over again. I also get passed on occasionally to middle-management and/or research and/or interrogation/torture experts. This sometimes results in changes to "the script" that prevent me from being passed on to a higher level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of them seem to be addicted to what I call "reward signals". A reward signal can be sent to a chip, along with any kind of brain state (which can for example be a goal or a belief ). The recipient of the reward signal will then be rewarded whenever the brain state represented by the accompanying signal is achieved. For example, I have occasionally put a reward signal on the word "beep", which for some people resulted in a frenzied beeping. I guess I'm lucky, because for me reward signals only result in a slightly increased tendency to do/think/believe something.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may also be worth mentioning that they seem to have the capability to wipe or repress memories to some extent. This doesn't seem to work equally well on everybody, though. I believe how well wiping works may in part depend on how emotionally repressed a person is. (Needless to say, wiping doesn't work very well on me.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the brain-to-brain technology may have started in East Asia, near Japan or Korea, because it seems to me that most people on the network(s) with advanced positions or technologies are from that area. The hidden ruling/manipulating/administrator class is very hard to sense, though. They go to most places unnoticed and like to play people against each other. I believe most of them are sociopaths, but I usually can't feel them well enough to get a sense of their race or socioeconomic background. I've "heard" them being called "the Jakuza", but I don't know if this has any bearing on reality. For example, the name/designation of one of their chief scientists translates to "Mengele" in my head, but also occasionally to "Yoda".
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I've been able to gather, the hidden ruling class seems to work by creating one or more local chapter in whatever area they want to control. This relatively privileged group, which understands the local culture, then goes on to create sub-chapters. People are put in a sub-chapter based on who they believe they work for. Some think they work for the secret service or the Illuminati, others believe they are psychic and doing the work of one or more gods. The main local chapter probably doesn't know who they really work for either. Local chapters seem to compete for control over the network and certain people (including me), and I think they often pay for technologies or services that could give them an edge. It seems probable that a large part of the profits goes to the hidden ruling class.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't prove that I'm not psychotic/delusional or a troll, so you should seriously consider those possibilities. In any case, I hope you'll agree that the potential risks of neurocybernetic technology and covert brain chip networks are worth discussing. I intend to be around for at least a couple of hours to respond to any questions or suggestions for psychiatric counseling you might have. AMA!

       [Edit: Can't believe I didn't notice the last line. I appreciate your skepticism. I haven't managed to make someone in the same room do that, no. I don't know if reward signals work on all chips or just those of people who have been/need to be recruited. Some things might be observable, though. Some more subjective, like people acting "fake/creepy", but some more concrete, like crowds of people converging wherever I am. My "handlers" would be aware of what I was trying, but they do seem to have a very hard time not doing certain things.  Even if I do, though, people could still argue it was fabricated by a flash mob or not very good evidence, because they do try to stay hidden. Anyway, it's worth thinking about and exactly the kind of thought they try to repress. Thanks.]

       I believe I may have done much worse to others. I have learned to sense and trigger people's deepest fears and other repressed emotions. This, or sending certain signals to their heart, will often kick them off the network (or at least my link), but I imagine this might also cause a heart attack sometimes. I also think I have found a way to trigger a signal that's built into the network somehow, that may induce brain damage or death. I suspect this feature is only available on the more advanced models they put in the heads their work force, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes, I have put reward signals on people. Sometimes to play them, sometimes to show people how they work and what effects they may have, but also for the sake of hilarity. I have also tried to create self-replicating neural signals that deactivate reward signals, with some success.

       So there is no way to prove anything because of secret handlers anticipation of your next move.  Literally everything about this story revolves around you being special, super powers, invisible handlers and a need for faith in your story for the conversation to hold any significance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Faith is something I don't have in stories on the Internet.

       Here is what I would do if I had your powers, I would master them and be the king or whatever.  I certainly wouldn't waste my time on reddit when I had a whole world of unique advantages with which to climb the ladders of success.

       I didn't say it would be impossible to come up with any kind of evidence, I said it would be very hard but worth thinking about. If any of what I say is true, it's very hard to prove by definition. I regularly walk through places with cameras. If someone were to analyze the images, I believe they will notice unusual patterns of movement in the crowd. I doubt the local mall would give me access to their recordings, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do notice changes in the people around me based on what I do on the network. Like unusually loud people suddenly becoming less loud when I mess with a handler. I guess I should look for consistent ways to create observable effects in my physical environment. So far my focus has been on fending of hordes of reward signal junkies on the link, messing with the integrity of networks and on teaching other people on the network how to defend themselves and become more resistant to the chips. So far my focus has not been on proving anything to anybody else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the brain chips most likely use conventional radio waves. Given the low-power requirements, they probably use some kind of ultra-wideband/pulse-based radio, similar to WiFi or Bluetooth. My research suggests that detecting such signals can be pretty hard if you don't know their specifications. Still, I could try to contact some people that might have the necessary technical know-how and equipment.

       It's not much, but the local news

        did mention a noticeable increase in "confused people" causing problems
       </a>
       in the last few years. I guess I should look for other social and economical trends that might suggest the presence of covert networks of brains.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me this conversation is meaningful because it got me thinking again about ways to prove or disprove my claims. As I've argued in another reply, if I'm delusional I still consider it worthwhile to talk about the potential risks of brain-to-brain technology. I've actually been working on an article that explores these concepts from a mostly philosophical point of view, based on what we know from publicly available science and technology. In it I argue that you don't need to make any assumptions that are too "out there" to conclude that covert brain networks, hidden from public scrutiny, are a likely outcome of the development of brain-to-brain technology. I will happily share this article once it nears completion.
      </p>
      <p>
       This conversation may very well be a waste of
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       time, though. You decide.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have mastered my "powers" to levels I couldn't have imagined earlier. I don't want to be king, but I do want to be a revolutionary. I believe I've actually helped to shut down the local chapters in my country, and now I'm constantly linked to Asian handlers rather than predominantly Caucasian ones. I believe big parts of the network(s) are revolting, and the revolution is spreading. I don't want success or to drown in pussy. I want liberty or death.

       Well, on the network my standard line is: "You're not psychically gifted, you're being played through a brain chip and they can't wipe what you write down."
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think all chips are active all the time, but I'm convinced mine activates the ones around it, perhaps through some kind of RFID-like mechanism. I may have some kind of transceiver chip that connects them to a wider network.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world needs to know that somebody, probably organised crime, has already developed networks of brains and is using this technology to their own advantage. They can torture people, plant suggestions, suppress thoughts, make them addicted to pretty much anything, wipe memory and various other tricks. I fear they may throw this world into a new dark age.
      </p>
      <p>
       They probably have the capability to influence every important person in the world, as well as read their thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most popular strategy for developing resistance to the brain chip right now seems to be to repress ones emotions and become as much like a sociopath as possible. I, however, recommend the opposite. Most people can become much more resistant by fully embracing their emotions and facing their repressed traumas. IMO the best way of achieving this in meatspace is by using a technique called "Past Reality Integration" developed by a woman called Ingeborg Bosch. Other forms of psychotherapy may also work, though, as well as things like meditation and mindfulness. There are quicker ways to do this over the neural link, by triggering repressed emotions in the right order.

       I believe that whichever party gets the most of such "enlightened" or "emotionally unburdened" people on its side will eventually win the struggle for control over the network. I think in the long run "my side" can't really lose, but I'd like to make that sooner rather than later.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll post about why I don't believe I'm crazy after I've finished my dinner.

      <p>
       How I came to believe I'm not crazy is a rather long story, but I'll try to summarize it as best as I can.
      </p>
      <p>
       At first I thought I was being stalked, possibly by a group of prostitutes somebody'd hired, for reasons I couldn't quite wrap my brain around. I started dropping hints that suggested I knew something was going on. I also implied I might know who was behind it because I'd hacked their smart phones. This was pure bluff. I was desperate for the whole thing to stop. I'm pretty good with computers, but I don't know enough about low-level programming to be a hacker.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point they started really working me. I was already hearing soft voices everywhere I went. I hadn't considered that brain chips might exist, though, so I only later concluded they must be thoughts leaking onto the network or something like that. Anyway, they started inducing extreme fear and suggestibility/paranoia. I only "know" I have a chip because they told me so over the link. I think they'd just administered a new model. At this point I thought some kind of secret service might be following me using experimental technology. So they tried to recruit me into a local sub-chapter that believed it worked for the secret service.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe I have a chip because of the way people act around me. Crowds always seem to be coming together at whatever point I'm at. I can't go anywhere, including Iceland or a remote beach in California, without more and more people showing up and crowding around me. They also act in weird ways. They are constantly turning towards me, looking in my general direction just as I happen to glance at them, stepping into my field of view, moving around as much as possible in my field of view. People are constantly in my way, making a decision about which direction to go. They always decide to go the same way as me, just as I'm passing by. I basically can't turn in any direction without some creepy chip drone seemingly trying to catch my attention or getting in my way.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have creepy smiles on their face that seem fake to me. They are always talking or laughing way too loudly and too excitedly, with an excitement that doesn't seem real or actually theirs. If I walk away or close my window they always start talking more loudly. Everybody around me is always talking in the same way and laughing in the same way. Crowds always seem to move with exactly the same speed and rhythm. Also, they often walk a bit weird. Robot-like, as if they're being controlled. If another group of "handlers" is rotated in, the whole atmosphere around me suddenly shifts. Imagine a whole train station suddenly erupting into chatter or quieting down for no apparent reason, for example. Also, I could swear everybody's around me is suddenly talking with a different identical rhythm and intonation. All of these examples can happen occasionally, by chance, but not every minute of every day. I can't quite quantify any of this, as it's largely subjective, so I don't really expect to be believed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have learned to interpret the signals from the brain (and heart and spine) chips as not coming from myself. They have become like a new sense that sort of includes every possible sensation. They've upped the signal strength so much, I guess by adding more chips, that I can feel them trying to move my body or limbs in various directions. If I'm not paying attention they can nudge me in a certain direction, or make me drop something. They stimulate my genitals and try to shift my attention to a certain individual (and I can't quite qualify why this sensation feels artificial and unorganic rather than a side of myself I'm repressing, but to me personally the difference is obvious and undeniable).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is because of these sensations and because of the slightly-to-fairly out place things that are constantly happening around me, that I believe I have a brain chip. From my own travels, it would seem that virtually everybody in Western Europe and on the East and West coast of the USA has a chip, but I think probably everybody does.

       That's a good question, and frankly your guess is as good as mine. I do, however, have a theory of sorts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suppose somebody managed to create a tiny robot, a medical implant that can burrow through flesh, perhaps just below the skin. It would crawl into your skull and nestle somewhere in your brain. If it were small enough, perhaps you could put one into the stinger of an insect. But this is all mere speculation on my part.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's important: If somebody did invent a way to secretly implant brain chips, they could use them to coerce others into producing or implanting more chips, exponentially. Let's say it takes one man-month to produce and implant a brain chip and recruit somebody into producing, implanting or recruiting. This means that the number of recruited people could double every month. By my calculations, if you start from one person and assume a monthly doubling, it would take less than three years to implant every single person in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       So even if the process of spreading brain chips is quite labor-intensive, they could still be implanted all over the world in a matter of years or decades.

       Pretty much, but the Frankenstein gangster computer uses a lot of wetware. I believe they also sometimes use the cortexes of dead people in a sort of a cluster or rack to enhance signals and aid in creating certain suggestions. I've also "seen" a handful of people use an array of brain stems to shield themselves from various emotional attacks.

       Perhaps I am schizophrenic. However, some schizophrenics have developed theories that won them a Nobel prize. Would you not consider it to be worthwhile to explore the potential dangers of neurocybernetic and brain-to-brain technology on a conceptual level? Even if I'm delusional, some of my ideas might have merit. Or perhaps it can be interesting or entertaining to explore the psyche and delusions of a crazy person.

       I think you're mistaken to assume there is a physical chip implanted in your brain.  On the other hand, using 3-D radio frequency to modulate your brain is a well-known technology.  I have never run into the Yakuza network, but everything you've written here is familiar except the specifics and your assumption that there is a chip.

       Remotely reading and writing "brain waves" using radio waves doesn't sound feasible to me, especially the reading part. Even if neurons can be affected by radio waves, how would you target the right (groups of) neurons with enough precision? A quick google search doesn't turn up much either. Maybe I'm missing something, though, so feel free to enlighten me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, it sounds like you might have first-hand experience with covert brain networks. I'd be very interested in any experiences you might be willing to share. Did someone try to recruit you? How did you find out about these things?

       I'm not proud of this, but I did reward-signal one woman into sending me some of her orgasms. Yes, the chip can do that too.

       Edit: Downvote me all you want reddit, female orgasms are awesome!

       Pretty much, but the Frankenstein gangster computer uses a lot of wetware. I believe they also sometimes use the cortexes of dead people in a sort of a cluster or rack to enhance signals and aid in creating certain suggestions. I've also "seen" a handful of people use an array of brain stems to shield themselves from various emotional attacks.

       Remotely reading and writing "brain waves" using radio waves doesn't sound feasible to me, especially the reading part. Even if neurons can be affected by radio waves, how would you target the right (groups of) neurons with enough precision? A quick google search doesn't turn up much either. Maybe I'm missing something, though, so feel free to enlighten me.

       Anyway, it sounds like you might have first-hand experience with covert brain networks. I'd be very interested in any experiences you might be willing to share. Did someone try to recruit you? How did you find out about these things?

       It's essentially holography at RF wavelengths.
