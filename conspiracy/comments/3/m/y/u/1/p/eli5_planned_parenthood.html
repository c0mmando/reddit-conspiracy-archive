       So from my understanding they:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Fund abortions
       </li>
       <li>
        Teach kids about sex (a questionable organisation teaching about sex).
       </li>
       <li>
        Harvest organs of fetus' (???)

       I initially wasn't following this story much, but when I saw people posting "This is debunked," I was like, OH THANK GAWD, let me read the debunking and so I go read what they tell me to read and it's all...just semantics..."It's not baby parts, it's fetal
       <em>
        tissue
       </em>
       !" Uh...guys and gals...
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing that bothers me is that what they are doing is 100% legal. And it will continue to be legal and prevalent after defunding. Should it be legal? We should have a discussion, as a nation, about this. But we're not, instead we're all flinging poo re:funding and no one's doing anything to debate whether this thing that offends our sensibilities
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be legal and if it shouldn't, how do we stop it and if it should be legal, how do we ensure that it's done in a way to ensure that women aren't pressured into donation (and I honestly believe, as a woman, that the father should have to consent to the donation as well; that brings up some logistical issues, but when you get to complications like the fact that a girl's eggs are mature very early in fetal development and the parents have no say as to how their "donation" is used...it's not outside the realm of possibility that down the road, you could be a grandmother or grandfather and never know it, crazy stuff).

       No. They violated many different laws throughout the video, including advising a patient not to say she was terminating because of the sex of the baby (illegal). They broke a lot of laws.

       What I am telling you is that neither the Left nor the Right is trying to stop the damned process. They just want you to fight, while they both pocket campaign donations from the companies PP gives the babies to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Call people morons on the Internet all you want if it makes you feel better, but you both sides are throwing shit at each other, refusing to see the issue or do anything, absolutely ANYTHING to stop or regulate the practice of fetus trafficking. It's disgusting.

       (Also, I upvoted your above comment re: the videos, but I guess that was a mistake since you also don't appear to care to stop the baby trafficking and coersion, just riling up political shit-fights that ultimately achieve nothing...)

       I think defunding PP is a great start. And yeah, they want people to fight. And it works because people spout dumb, ignorant shit they don't seem to know anything about but act like they do.

      <p>
       Meanwhile, the left loves slicing up babies for parts and somehow the people pointing out the practice are evil woman haters.

       I am telling you Republicans and Democrats are pro-tissue donation. Defunding PP won't stop the baby trafficking, it will likely accelerate it. I don't hear ANY politician, left or right, talking about adding more regulation or banning the trafficking of aborted fetuses. And no one will confront them on this, they just fight amongst themselves over stupid shit.

       When funding is cut, Planned Parenthood will still perform abortions (government funding doesn't go to abortions, patients pay for them using a sliding scale) and they'll still hand the fetuses over to the third party "brokers."
      </p>
      <p>
       These third party companies have lavish parties where they brag about what it is they're doing. I can't believe you would trust (and SUPPORT! What the ever-loving fuck?) these chop-shops.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess it's true, you yourself don't care about the baby trafficking at all and are happy to allow it to continue unabated and unregulated.

       "The ethics of it all" - What ethics when you're perfectly happy to advocate allowing the practice to continue and even accelerate?

       These companies you're supporting are making 24k on a fetal liver. Call me a maniac if you want, I'm just trying to tell you that the companies you want to support are the ones you should be going after, to do otherwise is being a political puppet.

       Abortion is legal and there is medical benefit to utilizing them. We should oppose the liars at PP who say they are doing everything legally and that they aren't profiting from this. That's the issue. You're in la la land.

       Profiting off the sale of fetal tissue is

       If you love stem cell donation so much, why are you against PP, who provides the cells to the chop-shop companies you love so much? After all, they'll continue to provide those aborted fetuses, even after the government defunds them so that your dear chop shops can keep on profiting illegally from the trafficking of tissue from women in hard times.

       I think you're overreacting.  Even if you believe abortion as birth control is immoral (which I do).  Planned Parenthood prevents abortion by preventing pregnancy. They give people access to contraception and STD testing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unwanted children are a huge source of society's problems.  Before we ever outlaw abortion we need to have social structures in place that can raise an orphan to be a productive member of society.  Or provide mothers with enough resources to adequately raise their child (spend time with them).
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't live in such a society.  Tackling the roots of economic injustice will go much farther toward preventing abortion than ending Planned Parenthood, and without all the negative repercussions.

       PP also provides information on how to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are referring to is called a "welfare state", and it creates massive dependence upon government economy to provide for individuals.   Girls and women who don't want to / don't feel like working have the option of getting pregnant, and using that pregnancy as a way to not have to contribute anything to the community and society. More babies = more money.

       We need Planned Parenthood, desperately, if for no other reason than to prevent people from intentionally gaming the system and being a financial drain on the rest of us. I just wish more people would take advantage of it. I'll give you an example.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Rachel is a young girl who made a mistake and can neither afford to take care of a child nor does she have the time to do so, given that she is currently working through law school. She does the responsible thing and has an abortion, finishes school, gets a well-paying job, gets married, and goes on to have an average of 2.5 children.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Shaniqua is a young, irresponsible woman of twenty and is currently pregnant with her fourth offspring. She knows the government will
         <del>
          pay for
         </del>
         blindly hand her money for her offspring, so she has been popping them out since she was seventeen and collecting welfare and child support. She does not support herself, she is a drain on society and
         <em>
          plans
         </em>
         to continue to be so for as long as she can manage.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       There are no checks and balances on the system. The current system, as it stands, only encourages irresponsibility and unchecked reproduction outside a woman's means. I say 'a woman's means' because men are thrown under the bus given the current state of affairs in child custody and child support. Either way you go, however, it is a
       <em>
        massive
       </em>
       drain on the economy that we can live without.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I want to see some reforms. Tax breaks and assistance (free or subsidized higher education, anyone?) for people who have between 0 and 2 children, no breaks or penalties on those who produce more than 3.

       My issue with Planned Parenthood right now:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         They're not being straight with us on the "tissue donation" and consent involved in the donation process, nor their "transportation costs."
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Their President (half a million in salary, by the way) lied about providing mammograms - they do referrals, not mammograms. For what reason? It's just stupid. Not only that, but they're allowing people to keep repeating this stuff that's not true, which completely undermines their credibility.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       However, Planned Parenthood does provide health services to men and women - STD testing (for men and women), birth control, pregnancy care, abortions (let's not lie - abortions are just as much demanded by men as by women; women don't abort in a vacuum, it's often a joint decision or a decision made to protect a man). I think most of these services you could get at your local health clinic, but not the abortions (which is why this is like 86% of PP's income).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, PP claims they're only making transportation costs on the "tissue donation" and not receiving kickbacks. So we give them the benefit of the doubt and we suppose that is true, there's still big business and big money going to companies like StemExpress who traffick in fetal cells for researchers and biotech companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       So - the Democrats claim to see no issue with "tissue donation." However, the Republicans are
       <em>
        disgusted
       </em>
       by fetal cell trafficking (don't believe them, many of them voted to make what PP is doing legal!) - they are so disgusted that they're going to defund PP such that PP is tempted to do more "donation" to recoup funds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pay attention to that: No one is doing a damned thing to stop the practice and it will just accelerate after defunding. No one cares about women's or poor people's health, it's all politics and cold, hard cash and we're once again just the squabbling armies, fighting battles for these assholes, barefoot and ration-less.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's another conversation to be had that is
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       related the the conspiracy of eugenics behind this stuff, but that's probably for another time.
