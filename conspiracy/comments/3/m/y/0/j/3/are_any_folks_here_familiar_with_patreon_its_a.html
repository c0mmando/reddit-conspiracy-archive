       I am just wondering if I could get the support how I might manage something like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am currently writing a script for a graphic novel and planned to draw it myself but if I do it that way it could take a long time and I may never finish because eventually I am going to need to make money to survive. If I got funding I could possibly commission someone to help with the project.
      </p>
      <p>
       This project is about very important things I feel I have discovered.

       It's about things I feel I have discovered based on something that happened to a family member of mine. I have to be careful about what I say before I go public with it but I feel if I can figure out a way to get people to take this seriously they will see how important it is. But getting people to understand that is not easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a preview story I could do though as a teaser to get people interested and I think it will make a big impact. So if I could get support that way I am wondering how I could manage to get funding and work out the financial aspects and figure out how to deliver the content in a way that makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically the story is about how I have discovered things that I feel will truly change the world. But it's tricky because all the pieces are out there. People just have to put them together which is no small task.

       I understand, but this is a part of the process. Everyone has ideas, but most lack the ability to bring the ideas to fruition (afraid to let others in). Ideas are nothing and should not be held as sacred, especially if you plan on getting people to invest in you. You do not have to tell me or us, I just want you to think about this little piece of advice, this simple question, that you didn't answer. How can you get anyone on board, if you're afraid to let it fly? Think about that, and think about what you want to actually do with your idea.

       That's the catch 22... but I think I could put a teaser out that shows what I have discovered. But I planned to do that when I had the script complete. Which should be done in the near future. Then once I have that I will make some teaser videos like a preview. Then hopefully people will be intrigued and come on board and help me get the project done somehow. Or I will be forced to do it all myself and it could take a long time.

       Well then, get a teaser made. Post it here, if it's relevant and other places. Do a kickstarter and/or that site you mentioned in OP, maybe a website and see where it goes? If it tickles my fancy, I'd crowd fund it as I'm sure others would. The last thing you should be thinking about is where you will showcase, you need to be focusing on what you are showcasing. I wish you luck. I guess my point is, don't be afraid to let outsiders in on your ideas, more times than not, that is how things come to be. From one entrepreneur to another :) .

       If it's someone that I strongly feel can help me and I trust I would definitely open up. Just not in public. Especially because the first draft isn't complete yet. When I have a more finished script and take some steps to copyright it I think I will feel more comfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other reasons I need to be careful what I say though. People who have done work along the same lines as I have, have disappeared or died mysteriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, right now I am more in the gathering info phase still trying to determine how I can proceed with getting this out safely.

       That, with a small teaser is enough to gather help. Marketing is the key to successful products. As much as I despise the marketing world, it's true. However, if what you say is true, how can you ever copyright it? Those same people control the copyright office.... Are you from the US?

       You need to think about this differently and how you explained it to me in another comment to me (imo). Giving out a little info, not the whole story can go a long way. I'm not saying give up the meat and potatoes, but give some away to people, who may be interested. You can copyright a script, but you cannot copyright an idea. Copyrighting takes money that I presume you do not have.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are asking for advice, I presume. I'm just offering what I know.

       A poor/dead man's copyright will not hold up in court and is certainly not a copyright. It can work in other cases, but not the one you are seeking.

       The situation I am in is really tricky because most of the story I am presenting is not unique at all.. it's the details that are important. So it makes it incredibly difficult to get interest based on a short pitch. This is not an accident by the way.... this is how the secret has been kept.

       Not working and doing this full time. I have never done anything like this so it's a big process of teaching myself as I go. I used to be part of a group of friends who were all obsessed with making movies so that gave me a tiny bit of help I guess.

       Ok, not sure if you have savings, if you do, great! If not, the first step (imo) would be a 3 min teaser of your idea, condensed. Not the whole thing, but enough to get people in. Doesn't have to be high quality, but something to draw people in. You could seek an angel investor to present to and/or an indie studio. This is not my field, I do web work (websites/Apps). If you have some family/friends, ask for an investment. Proper copyright is no more than $1,000 in the US, most likely less in this sense, patents are more expensive. Try and get that, then present (if you are worried), if not, take a risk. Develop it into something people can see/watch and jump both feet in. Present, present and don't stop. Who cares if people know your idea,
       <strong>
        only you
       </strong>
       know the full idea and how to bring it to life. Either way you are taking a risk, we all do.

       You're welcome. Yes, I am, but sadly, no, not my specialty. I work with developing websites and graphic/web design. I write code people cant, and design interfaces coders/designers cannot. If I did, I'd offer to help, but like I said, advice/ideas is the only thing I can offer. Good luck, mate.

       No offense, but in my experience, I have found that people very rarely steal ideas in their infancy. They steal (quite brazenly, the fooks!) after you've gotten something out there that's making money or otherwise getting attention. I am never afraid of sharing my ideas - bouncing them off others only firms them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never met a "I can't tell you my idea because you might steal it" type that ever successfully birthed their big secret idea. Or worse, those guys that want you to sign an NDA before you have a coffee, what the heck. I'm not going to steal your idea, I have enough to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean send your script around (or in tech circles, show your code), but you gotta divulge a little in order to ensure you're going in the right direction.

       I explained this a bit in other posts but the situation I am in is very unique.. most the info in my story isn't unique one iota.. but it's all factual info. There are only a few bits of info I have that are unique but even they aren't that unique.. they are only unique because they are true really.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if I give the only unique things I have away and people do use them then I have nothing.. and it will make my task even more difficult. But as I said in another post.. this isn't by accident. The people trying to keep this secret have crafted a maybe impossible scenario to get out of.

       I'm not really prepared to go about that just yet. I am still trying to figure out how I want to proceed with things. If there was someone here who had a lot of experience, was someone I knew I could trust and was curious about what this was I would give them details. But right now I'm just not ready to go into too much detail.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can say that this is about me having someone in my family who witnessed something which sent me on a journey of discovery and I feel the things I have put together could blow the lid off major major things in the conspiracy world if I can find a way to convey the info properly so people understand and believe it. That's a huge huge challenge though.

       I just mean copyrighting the story in the script so if I do give info out someone won't do the same story and possibly steal my thunder. That could be the people in control or just some random person desperate for interesting ideas to make money.
      </p>
      <p>
       By copyrighting I was under the impression you can send yourself a sealed postmarked copy of the script as proof you wrote the story. That kind of thing.
