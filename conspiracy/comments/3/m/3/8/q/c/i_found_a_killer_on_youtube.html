       I think I found a serial killer on YouTube:

       This is a video of a guy showing off a hidden dungeon that he found in his new apartment. He goes on to show the various rooms hidden in this “dungeon”. One of the room has the letters “CCFC” painted in blue on the wall. No big deal, right? The guy found a hidden room, its pretty cool, but there isn’t really anything more to it, but wait.

       (6:24)
This is a top 5 countdown called “5 Disturbing Deep Web Stories”. #3 on the list (starts at 6:24) is a website that offers Live killings of innocent victims, for online currency called BitCoins. I’ve never visited any of this stuff and don’t plan on it, but that is just about the worst thing I’ve ever heard in my life. Anyways, about a minute into #3 on the list, thumbnails to these live videos become visible and one of the thumbnails is the EXACT same room from the first video.

       Think what you want of this, there are many possibilities…
(I respect all conspiracies)
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: a little bit more information I found. The creator of the first video "demc7", has confirmed that he didn't take the picture of the man standing in the room. (

       ) This is the picture I'm talking about, which demc7 later uploaded to imgur after finding it.

       A user by the name of "5mifamilia" states that he lived there and that he took the picture with the man in the room, and by dec7's response, this was the first time of him even hearing about this picture.

       Alright, so basically, that thumbnail was taken by the man that found the dungeon and was nothing, but a little joke he and his friend pulled off. And the top 5 link just used a picture they found online and were probably just trying to scam people for their money. That's what I've gotten out of this O.O

       Thats what I get from it.  Probably just google image searched for some creepy dungeon pics and used that one.  the text in the video looks russian,  don't know why the guy in the first video would speak russian.  Also I think most people who would run something like a streaming online snuff business would be careful not to link themselves to that in a youtube video.

       I did a bit of searching, and being that the guy in the first video has a english accent, I think CCFC stands for Cardiff City Football Club. And you're right, they wouldn't link themselves like that if they were attempting something that serious online.

       Oddly enough, I can vouch for this. While I am american, I got a little obsessed with a Dr. Who spin-off called Torchwood. Torchwood takes place, and is filmed in some parts of, Cardiff. Cardiff is a city in Wales, and as such, their language and dialect is more welsh than traditional English. It's called Cardiff English and could be compared to someone in America with no accent to someone from New Jersey with a heavy accent. It took me a while to wrap my head around this as I once used to believe that an English accent was just an English accent.

       It was the best example I could think of at the time. I suppose it could have been substituted with a strong New York accent, or Minnesota.

       My dad is a European immigrant and he has a slight accent but because I've heard his speech from the day I was born, I don't actually hear it.  My friends told me once that he has an accent but I refused to believe them.  It was only after I moved out of the house and only went back to visit a few times per month that I really heard it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what I'm saying is...the accent is there, you're just "blind" to it because you're so used to it.

       LOL mistake on my part, I didn't even research the team to fully understand where it is. I guess I just assumed soccer/football and thought England (I'm from the US and play soccer/football so I don't know why I assumed that), but I was also wrong in the sense that the guy from the first video doesn't have an English accent, but an Irish accent.

       I think the one that did the top 5 video used a lot of stock pics and 'borrowed' pics for that vid, not actual screen grabs.  The picture from that vid seems to be pulled from another reddit post about the dungeon found.  If you google 'ccfc ok' that pic pops up as the first one.

       If you meet a hitman, it's a cop. Far too few people get this. If you need something done, do it yourself or be ready for the jailtime. Actually, be ready for the jailtime anyway. But at least if you do it yourself it gets done.

       I think the guy didn't spray paint it himself and I also don't believe that a murderer would put himself out there like that. I think the thumbnail is the link between the two, and nothing else.

       its a conspiracy for a reason. It doesn't mean that it's true, its just stating a view on a topic and asking what other people think about it. Your comment is probably more off-topic as it has nothing to do with conspiracy.
