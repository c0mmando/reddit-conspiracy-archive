<p>Already you lost me. Why does a conspiracy theory need to be sexier than anything?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>creepy guys in their basements </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not in a basement. I&#39;m not creepy. How many here are &quot;creepy guys in their basements&quot;? Have you seen them? Or did you just hear that somewhere?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>talking shit about the government on IRC</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IRC eh? But is it ok to talk about the government on reddit? Is it OK to talk <em>good</em> about the government on IRC? Would that be less creepy?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The CT community needs a more attractive poster boy than David Icke or Alex Jones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Didn&#39;t know we needed a poster boy (or girl for that matter), but I imagine both of those guys are doing a great job as controlled opposition. Who made them the &quot;poster boy(s)&quot;? I don&#39;t have posters of those guys on my wall.  I do agree that neither of them are attractive though. Hard to disagree with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who put that image in image in their minds? Not me, and not most people here. The corporate media did. David Ray Griffin is pretty much the most credible writer on 9/11 and not the person the MSM would have people focus on with respect to &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;. They prefer idiots like Jones because he just makes everyone who  disbelieves the official 9/11 fairy tale look, well, like idiots.</p>

<p>The &quot;CT community&quot; isn&#39;t a monolithic entity where people all believe or disbelieve the same things. Jones doesn&#39;t reflect what I think or believe in any way, and most of the serious bloggers and writers I follow see him as at best, an idiot, at worst, paid disinfo. But I can&#39;t control who the MSM chooses to be the &quot;CT Community&#39;s&quot; poster boy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no poster boy for conspiracies. People that I know who investigate what they think about conspiracies do not live in a basement nor are they creepy.</p>

<p>Furthermore, David Icke and Alex Jones are not poster boys for conspiracy theory in general. </p>

<p>I have no idea what the point of this post is....telling people how they need to be? I would like to see better quality posts in the future around here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a movement. It&#39;s individuals noticing incongruity mostly. there is no need to have people who simply hum the mantra of &quot;yeah I believe that too&quot;. They do this because they can&#39;t think for themselves.</p>

<p>Conspiracies occur. They happen in government, geo-politics, military actions, social experimentation, big business etc. </p>

<p>Typically, the conspiracy is only noticed or thought about by one or two people and then either spoken of, or not.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all it is. No leaders, no followers. Simply thoughts based on observation. Getting the word out is optional. In fact, all the characters that surround themselves with the fancy parts are just that, egotistical characters who seek and need adoration for whatever reason. Not at all true conspiracy theorists or thinkers and mostly contribute more to the ridicule than to solving the problems presented by the people who figure stuff out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact of that matter is that most people in society simply cannot deal with the idea that their own government is lying to them and manipulating them. Most people know that there is a lot of information about 9/11 that hasn&#39;t been stated. The official report is clearly a poor excuse for a shit story and they know almost no one will read it as much as they say they might. the worst part is that it was greed motivated in so many ways over and above the political motivations to create that what is now an obvious false flag event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While in some sense I agree with the premise that MSM has stereotyped the tinfoil wacko image ad nauseam, <em>&#39;sexing up&#39;</em> is a double-edged sword. Sure, common people might be more open to <em>at least considering listening</em> or analyzing some info, but if a real, genuine personality oozing charisma and attractive to boot hasn&#39;t surfaced, well, what can be done? <a href="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1540343/thumbs/o-EDWARD-SNOWDEN-facebook.jpg">Create a mediagenic Max Headroom?</a></p>

<p>Another thing: there is no single, monolithic &#39;conspiracy&#39; group or entity. What is posted here is very rarely supported by everyone. You can&#39;t put every doubter and truther and curious mind in one sack and expect to <em>elect</em> a spokersperson for all. </p>

<p>I&#39;d venture one personality that can fit the bill of being a genuine researcher <em>and</em> having a mediatic demeanor: James Corbett.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the very intelligent reply on this.</p>

<p>I think the fragmentation of the CT community is exactly the problem. People can&#39;t even agree there is an &quot;Illuminati&quot; and then most that believe there is one falsely believe that its got something to do with bloodlines.</p>

<p>The CT community needs Lenin to rise up, someone who will unify and direct all this scattered energy. Obviously, such a person will have to be limited in their media presence, however I don&#39;t think that detracts from the potential appeal. Look at how infatuated people are with Anonymous and they&#39;re just nerds on Tor.</p>

<p>Snowden is okay but his charisma is limited and so is his vision. This figure I&#39;m imagining needs to have nothing less than a rock-star aura.</p>

<p>Who are this <em>&#39;CT community&#39;?</em> If you&#39;re referring to r/conspiracy, you surely must have seen that you just can&#39;t unite all the themes and interests posted. Some obsess with political aspects of events, other with occult symbolism, other with down to earth practicalities regarding profits and corruption, others with religious or arcane interpretations... add the shills and plain deluded souls and you have a cacophony that I find impossible to unite. </p>

<p>And here&#39;s where I disagree. If you peruse my past posts you&#39;ll find I personally consider him an actor, an agent in the war between the intelligence powers. Maybe unknowingly? He&#39;s the perfect example of what you&#39;re proposing: a young, pleasant, attractive face with both sexy and nerdish appeal, the hero caught between the wheels of global intrigue, having to ditch his life, exiled to the cold wastelands where his faithful woman finally reunites with him. Just <em>too perfect</em>. A perfect media image, unlike those other <a href="http://go.bloomberg.com/political-capital/content/uploads/sites/3/2012/10/1018-thomas-drake.jpg">old, krinkly guys</a> and <a href="http://www.caribbeandigitalnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/julian_assange_2010-front1.jpg">pervy looking dudes</a> that just don&#39;t look that good on TV.</p>
