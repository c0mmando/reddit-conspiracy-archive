You decide for yourself. I mean it looks like &quot;Xavier&quot;s face is shopped from a few, and not sure where Sydney crawled out from. Also weird their whole company is owned by smartoil.homestead.com/AboutUs.html  and their sites are incredibly ambiguous and simple. Which is also weird because LA supposedly just paid them $30,000,000 for their plastic balls. Maybe they could take their new 30MM and buy some new photo shoots and site that is not from 1994.</p>

<p>This would explain why the balls from &quot;Xavierc.net&quot; look entirely different.</p>

<p>No claims - we are simply asking who the hell are these oil consultants and how are they qualified to put that much oil-based HDPE black carbon dyed plastic into LA&#39;s sunlit water reservoirs. </p>

<p>This article mentions both companies involved, and the amount of balls(ha) each company contributed. The $30 million was the overall price tag for the project. It is interesting to note, that the article focuses more on XavierC LLC more than Artisan Screen Printing. Also, while researching XavierC LLC has 2 different webpages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I don&#39;t know. It seems odd that a company with such a shoddily constructed web site and what looks like stock photos of a manufacturing facility would win a city contract worth millions of dollars. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t imagine the city wouldn&#39;t do their homework on the company either. I actually called the number listed on their website and the woman who answered just said &quot;Sydney&quot;. Not XavierC or any of the company names. Which is odd as well. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with the shade balls per se (as I&#39;m a journalist, not a conspiracy theorist in the fluoride is poisoning our brains type of way), but there&#39;s just a lot of weird stuff with this particular company. Maybe they put all their money into the shade balls and didn&#39;t have any left over for site design or friends who knew basic Photoshop. </p>

<p>It&#39;s certainly weird, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. So did you talk to &quot;Sydney&quot; lol. Sounds like a James Bond phone where you call and a handler picks up. I have to say - how could you not have ANY of $30,000,000 left to build a $1,000 site? Come on this whole thing stinks on ice. Also we never said fluoride or any of those &quot;theories&quot; I am simply stating ( and 1,000s agree) that all this shitty plastic shouldn&#39;t be dumped into the LA drinking water. This is not crazy. This is crime theory - and I think that something very shady happened with a lot of that cash. Why is there nothing else about Sydney online?</p>

<p>Thanks. I didn&#39;t say the shade balls were tainted. I simply said they contain a lot of chemicals that aren&#39;t really proven to be safe to be dumped wholesale into our water. No long term studies. And all the &quot;people&quot; behind it seem shady as hell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Found out that Xavier is a disabled vet, supposedly, and that &quot;Sydney Chase&quot; found him and had a &quot;place in her heart&quot; for him... and I guess named the f____ site XavierC.net ... the weird thing is there are like 5 sites that &quot;make&quot; the shade balls.  Gets harder and harder to track down where that $30,000,000 tax payers money went. </p>

<p>ONE MORE site that is related - but not sure where the money trail goes with this:
Water Conservation and Management co - <a href="http://www.waterconservationandmanagement.com/">http://www.waterconservationandmanagement.com/</a></p>

<p>Also note, NONE of these sites show any safety data, results from studies, site the safety of these, or show FDA approval for shade balls or bird balls to be in drinking water. No material about the studies, safety, or health approval process of these HDPE plastic balls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the love of god, the man&#39;s name is Xavier... and he is in a wheel chair... like professor Xavier. I don&#39;t mean to be a heartless human being but for bloody fucks sake is this a real story? Was this guy selling wheel chair equipment in 2007 the same guy? I mean if he is... than why is he now a part of selling plastic shade balls that are leeching chemicals into the drinking water. This is nuts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So many strange things surrounding this. Why the horrible, blatantly obvious photoshops? What&#39;s up with Xavier&#39;s strangely worded bio? If Xavier is an independent consultant, why is the company apparently named after him? And he&#39;s an IT guy, too. </p>

<p>Have you seen this site as well? <a href="http://www.xaviercllc.com/About-Us.html">http://www.xaviercllc.com/About-Us.html</a></p>

<p>Sydney&#39;s picture has something added to it: TPC Sawgrass, Home of the Players. A logo for a Florida golf course.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure going down the rabbit hole on this one will turn up more interesting things.</p>

<p>EDIT: They list their company address as 1220 Pennel Drive, Glendora, CA. That&#39;s simply a residence.</p>

<p>Yes - we posted this a few days ago :) they &quot;went underground&quot; meaning they are shady as f___ with tax payer&#39;s money on this whole deal. Why do they have 4 shitty sites and all fake &quot;leaders&quot; on there?</p>

<p>Apparently &quot;Xavier Casanova&quot; which sounds FAKE FAKE is a &quot;CEO&quot; of a &quot;startup&quot; called &quot;liveclicker&quot;. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=ABQAAAAAN-YBIHm6SAwuxBZjWA0CvygMAFeDF8E&amp;amp;authType=name&amp;amp;authToken=K6Ur&amp;amp;trk=extra_biz_connect_hb_upphoto">https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=ABQAAAAAN-YBIHm6SAwuxBZjWA0CvygMAFeDF8E&amp;amp;authType=name&amp;amp;authToken=K6Ur&amp;amp;trk=extra_biz_connect_hb_upphoto</a> so maybe we know where some of the $30,000,000 is going.

<p>Who knows where these jokers are making them but Orange Products Inc. was supposedly the company making them for 5-6 years and how it&#39;s &quot;XavierC.net&quot;. It doesn&#39;t make sense why he is making a product that goes in DRINKING WATER when he has a background in shitty startups. </p>

<p>This article mentions both companies involved, and the amount of balls(ha) each company contributed. The $30 million was the overall price tag for the project. It is interesting to note, that the article focuses more on XavierC LLC more than Artisan Screen Printing. Also, while researching XavierC LLC has 2 different webpages.</p>
