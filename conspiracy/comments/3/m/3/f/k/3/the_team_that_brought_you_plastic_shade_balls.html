       Does something seem OFF about these photos? You decide for yourself. I mean it looks like "Xavier"s face is shopped from a few, and not sure where Sydney crawled out from. Also weird their whole company is owned by smartoil.homestead.com/AboutUs.html  and their sites are incredibly ambiguous and simple. Which is also weird because LA supposedly just paid them $30,000,000 for their plastic balls. Maybe they could take their new 30MM and buy some new photo shoots and site that is not from 1994.

       I know "Xavier's" face is definitely shopped. It almost looks like a hybrid between John Travolta and someone else. I mean the photo also looks like it's from the 90s.

       But, there were 2 companies involved. The other company provided 89.6 million of the balls, this company only provided 6.4 million. XavierC would have only received $2.3 million dollars not the $30 million you claim in your post. I 100% agree that those photos are photoshopped, but being clear with as many details as possible gives more credibility to whatever it is you are trying to claim.

       This would explain why the balls from "Xavierc.net" look entirely different.

       No claims - we are simply asking who the hell are these oil consultants and how are they qualified to put that much oil-based HDPE black carbon dyed plastic into LA's sunlit water reservoirs.

       This article mentions both companies involved, and the amount of balls(ha) each company contributed. The $30 million was the overall price tag for the project. It is interesting to note, that the article focuses more on XavierC LLC more than Artisan Screen Printing. Also, while researching XavierC LLC has 2 different webpages.

       Black absorbs heat, right?  Heat distributes through said black ball, and heats water, no?  Not to mention leaching plastic directly into the water supply (as plastic leaches over time &amp; at high temp)...

       I find this whole thing totally weird because the shots of him on XavierC.net are cropped closely to his face. And you can not tell he is in a wheel chair. In these [photos](:

       ) the dude is in a wheel chair, apparently he is a vet. He is also a "consultant" and the weirdly spelled site XavierC.net appears to actually be named after the guy. What do you make of all this?

       Honestly, I don't know. It seems odd that a company with such a shoddily constructed web site and what looks like stock photos of a manufacturing facility would win a city contract worth millions of dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't imagine the city wouldn't do their homework on the company either. I actually called the number listed on their website and the woman who answered just said "Sydney". Not XavierC or any of the company names. Which is odd as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think there's anything wrong with the shade balls per se (as I'm a journalist, not a conspiracy theorist in the fluoride is poisoning our brains type of way), but there's just a lot of weird stuff with this particular company. Maybe they put all their money into the shade balls and didn't have any left over for site design or friends who knew basic Photoshop.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's certainly weird, though.

       Thanks. So did you talk to "Sydney" lol. Sounds like a James Bond phone where you call and a handler picks up. I have to say - how could you not have ANY of $30,000,000 left to build a $1,000 site? Come on this whole thing stinks on ice. Also we never said fluoride or any of those "theories" I am simply stating ( and 1,000s agree) that all this shitty plastic shouldn't be dumped into the LA drinking water. This is not crazy. This is crime theory - and I think that something very shady happened with a lot of that cash. Why is there nothing else about Sydney online?

       No, I get you, my point was I'm less concerned about these shade balls being tainted in some way than I am about this supposedly professional company somehow scoring a major contract from America's 2nd largest city. And the site thing is something I don't get. There are tons of options (like SquareSpace) out there for amateurs to build a professional-looking site.

       Thanks. I didn't say the shade balls were tainted. I simply said they contain a lot of chemicals that aren't really proven to be safe to be dumped wholesale into our water. No long term studies. And all the "people" behind it seem shady as hell.

       Found out that Xavier is a disabled vet, supposedly, and that "Sydney Chase" found him and had a "place in her heart" for him... and I guess named the f____ site XavierC.net ... the weird thing is there are like 5 sites that "make" the shade balls.  Gets harder and harder to track down where that $30,000,000 tax payers money went.

       For the love of god, the man's name is Xavier... and he is in a wheel chair... like professor Xavier. I don't mean to be a heartless human being but for bloody fucks sake is this a real story? Was this guy selling wheel chair equipment in 2007 the same guy? I mean if he is... than why is he now a part of selling plastic shade balls that are leeching chemicals into the drinking water. This is nuts.

       Found a different physical address about this company. Of course, it's also a residence. Do we even know where these balls are actually manufactured? Certainly not in Sydney's backyard.

       Yes - we posted this a few days ago :) they "went underground" meaning they are shady as f___ with tax payer's money on this whole deal. Why do they have 4 shitty sites and all fake "leaders" on there?

       Apparently "Xavier Casanova" which sounds FAKE FAKE is a "CEO" of a "startup" called "liveclicker".

       Who knows where these jokers are making them but Orange Products Inc. was supposedly the company making them for 5-6 years and how it's "XavierC.net". It doesn't make sense why he is making a product that goes in DRINKING WATER when he has a background in shitty startups.

       just does not add up to a company that is responsible for adding 96,000,000 HDPE plastic balls into the drinking water supply. This is so shady.

       This article mentions both companies involved, and the amount of balls(ha) each company contributed. The $30 million was the overall price tag for the project. It is interesting to note, that the article focuses more on XavierC LLC more than Artisan Screen Printing. Also, while researching XavierC LLC has 2 different webpages.
