<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3m2clx/if_the_sun_disappeared_from_one_moment_to_another/">https://np.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3m2clx/if_the_sun_disappeared_from_one_moment_to_another/</a></p>

<p>so logic.</p>

<p>if nothing is faster than the light then earth can&#39;t know where the sun is positioned right now to correctly orbit around the sun and not fucking remain behind and what not. a delay of 8 minutes would get us out from sun orbit and we would be fucked. yet we are still here so is fucking obvious that the gravity force is fucking faster than the light and appear to be instantaneous.</p>

<p>check the askscience post to see how the so called science tries to get out of this with magic logic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m speaking in layman&#39;s terms here, I&#39;m not a physicist, but I have an understanding. I hope you open your opinion up to learning more about these things instead of just screaming &quot;they&#39;re lying to us with magic logic&quot;. </p>

<p>Gravity propagates faster than light. That&#39;s what you seem to be at odds with. &quot;Nothing&quot; travels faster than light, but gravity <em>doesn&#39;t travel</em>. It&#39;s a word for the effect felt by objects resting in a portion of spacetime near other, more massive objects. Spacetime is spacetime <em>everywhere</em>, it&#39;s all the same spacetime. When an object interacts with spacetime (creating gravity), all of spacetime reacts to it immediately. Not just faster than light, but <em>instantly</em>. We see similar effects in the &quot;quantum leap&quot; whereby an electron jumps from one orbit to the next, without ever existing in between those orbits. </p>

<p>Another point to keep in mind: &quot;Where did the Big Bang happen?&quot; Most people might think it was someplace far off, but it wasn&#39;t. It happened right where you sit. It happened to your left, and right. It happened <em>everywhere</em>, because that&#39;s where spacetime is. </p>

<p>Imagine a flat surface, a blanket stretched out. Now drop a basket ball on it. It&#39;ll roll to the center and indent the surface/plane, right? Now take a small rubber ball and toss it around the basket ball. You&#39;ll see it rotate around the basketball (orbiting) until it falls into the basketball itself. That&#39;s gravity. That&#39;s a mass (the basketball) affecting spacetime (the sheet) by curving it. The curvature provides the &#39;path&#39; (the orbit) of the rubber ball (the earth). </p>

<p>Nothing attached the basketball to the rubber ball <em>except the sheet</em> (spacetime), which bends and flexes and stretches <em>faster than light</em>. It&#39;s really hard to picture, but spacetime itself <em>is</em> something (probably). We just don&#39;t know what (exactly).</p>

<p>Gravity isn&#39;t a &#39;force&#39; in the same way that electromagnetism is. The electron is the force-carrier for electromagnetic forces, but we don&#39;t know if Gravity has a similar force-carrier particle. There might be something like &quot;Gravitons&quot;, but science hasn&#39;t proved Gravitons exist (that&#39;d be that particle, the force-carrier, which travels faster than light - that&#39;d be a very ground-breaking discovery). </p>

<p>Further, we only refer to the light speed limit as a speedlimit because we&#39;ve never observed any<em>thing</em> (mass-thing) break it. That&#39;s not to say that it&#39;s outside the realm of physical possibility.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve read through your comments in this thread and you do seem to have a decent grasp of science and you do know a thing or two, so I wanted to let you know that your answer is dead wrong.</p>

<p>Gravity does not propagate instantly, it propagates at c. I&#39;m not being combative and I don&#39;t want to get into an argument with you. You seem intelligent and reasonable and also like someone who can admit when he is wrong. </p>

<p>If the Sun were to instantly teleport away, the Earth would not fly off on a course tangential to its orbit for 8 minutes, the time it takes for information to reach the Earth from the Sun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the speed limit of c only applies to objects moving through space, not space itself.</p>

<p>So the Universe is really really big. And it&#39;s expanding a tiny tiny amount, but everywhere. So if something is 2 million light years away from you, there is 2 million light years of expanding space in between you and that object. So let&#39;s say that object is moving away at x speed. </p>

<p>An object 4 million light years away has 4 million light years of expanding space between you and it. That object is moving away at 2x speed.</p>

<p>At some point when you get far enough away  the object is receding from you faster than the speed of light.</p>

<p>The actual speed of expansion is ~(68km/s)/Mpc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good question. We don&#39;t really know. In order to show that Gravity moves <em>as fast</em> or slower than light, we should be able to detect gravitational waves. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational-wave_observatory">We haven&#39;t yet, and it seems when we think we have found traces, they&#39;re later shown to be false positives.</a></p>

<p>Remember the force of gravity falls off pretty rapidly over distance, making this really hard to detect. That&#39;s why the closer a planet is, the faster it rotates the sun. It&#39;s not just a smaller distance-factor, it&#39;s actual speed relative to the sun is greater than that of a planetary body further away. </p>

<p>Gravity itself is a pretty weak force, all things considered, but it <em>is</em> pervasive. That is to say that our star&#39;s mass <em>is</em> having a gravitational affect on the blackhole at the center of our galaxy, but it&#39;s so small that detecting it would be very difficult. It can still be calculated though, and the amount is not zero (which, speaking in terms of math and the cosmos, anything <em>not</em> zero is infinitely <em>more than</em> zero). And its weakness is demonstrable here on earth: A common kitchen magnet can overpower all the gravitational force of the earth, if applied to a smaller bit of metal (like a safety pin). Even a human can, but for a moment or two.  </p>

<p>Anyhow, this is all tangential stuff. Again, I&#39;m just an enthusiast. I love astronomy and the physics behind it. Makes for a spicier, more interesting existence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Einstein&#39;s theory doesn&#39;t explain the entire universe as we know it. Quantum theory shows that to be the case, and even Einstein had serious issues with Quantum theory (even though it&#39;s among the most well-tested and well-proven theories in science). </p>

<p>Science is working on a unified theory that will combine special relativity to quantum theory. They haven&#39;t figured it out yet, which is okay. It&#39;s okay because unlike you (apparently), science is alright with admitting it doesn&#39;t know everything about everything. </p>

<p>I see you&#39;re not really into chit-chatting about science or learning about new things, you&#39;re simply here to call others liars and make a big kerfluffle. That&#39;s your prerogative, but I (and I assume others) don&#39;t care to engage in that. </p>

<p>The only reason you got so hyperbolic is because you didn&#39;t agree with me. </p>

<p>You called me a Russian (or Ukrainian? I can&#39;t even tell, you hardly elaborated) shill in so many words, then said verbatim: &quot;Your job is getting people killed&quot;, ostensibly for money. A totally baseless, unreasonable accusation. Par for the course for you.</p>
