<p>That is until you look at the amount of money some of these scientists pay themselves out of government grants (tax payers beware).</p>

<p>And this Jagadish Shukla scientist isn&#39;t just some random climate scientist that I&#39;m picking on for no reason.  This guy actually started the RICO20 group who&#39;s aim is to have climate change deniers or more forthrightly scientists who get grants from companies who don&#39;t want AGW to be real, charged with a federal crime.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right, this guy who gets paid over 250,000 dollars a year for part time work wants his opponents to be charged with a crime if they take money from a company that isn&#39;t pushing the climate change narrative.</p>

<p>250,000 dollars a year for part time works sounds too good to be true, glance down a little further in the payroll and you&#39;ll notice that his wife is also paid handsomely.  This doesn&#39;t even factor in their wages from the university.</p>

<p>Merchants of fear?</p>

<p>So in closing I&#39;m going I&#39;m going to list a few reasons why climate scientist might lie.</p>

<p>Husband</p>

<p>$292,688.00 (501c3 salary)</p>

<p>$40,360.00 (listed as other in 501c3 docs)</p>

<p>$250,866.00 (university salary)</p>

<p>Wife</p>

<p>$145,045.00 (501c3 salary)</p>

<p>$20,052.00 (listed as other in 501c3 docs)</p>

<p>Grand total income for their household</p>

<p>$750,011.00 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thing is, it&#39;s money on two fronts. Big Oil is sponsoring climate change deniers, whilst climate change proponents are abusing the government grants. The truth is somewhere in the middle I guess.</p>

<p>The climate has been warming ever since the last glacial age ended. We might have accelerated it slightly, but it would likely still have warmed anyway, it would have gotten to the point where the methane trapped in tundra would be released, furthering the change. Then it would just get warmer, up until a point where the albedo of the ever-present clouds would be too big and the climate would start cooling again. Methane would be trapped, CO2 would be trapped by the photoplankton. ice age would be advanced. Ad Infinitum.</p>

<p>Our existence and the pollution we are spewing is most likely affecting the mechanism, changing the rate at which it was usually advancing. We, as humans, did in fact cut down a lot of the forests (in the ancient times, for example, Australia used to be covered by the forests the men brought down), we&#39;re polluting the oceans, disrupting the food chains.</p>

<p>The massive die-off is happening, there&#39;s also no denying it - oceans are overfished, wildlife is endangered, not to mention the bees (that have recently been absent from the sub, suspiciously), and other pollinating insects.</p>

<p>To wrap it up, climate is changing, but it was never in an equilibrium to begin with. We are most likely contributing significantly, but at this point there&#39;s probably little we can do to stop the changes.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also rather see the money be spent on investigating the changes (even if the conclusion will be further taxation), than have it spent on warfare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The government steals our money and gives it to people who go along with them. If you don&#39;t believe taxation is theft then I have to assume you want to pay for bombing the middle East, corporate welfare, black budget ops, foreign regime changes, wall street bailouts, small and medium-sized businesses getting g regulated to death and all the other bullshit they spend our money on like police brutality attorney fees and attorney fees for their corruptions. </p>

<p>If anyone wants to scream &quot;muh roads&quot; you can go fuck yourself and kiss my testicles because the public could easily fund everything in the commons indefinitely with voluntary payment of the estimated costs of those services if elected officials actually paid fair market value for them and opened the contract bids to public scrutiny. Our money, our decision. </p>

<p>The deniers of climate change are far more credible because they don&#39;t have anything to gain. They risk their careers, income, and credibility on their science. The proponents of global warming risk nothing but instead gain lucrative compensation in the form of grants, funding, academic advancement and consulting gigs. </p>

<p>The assholes in government steal our money and gives it to their &quot;people&quot; while pretending to be a neutral party.</p>

<p>Oil companies and other rich industries which have a large environmental impact and could be harmed by increased regulation have <strong><em>nothing to gain</em></strong> by convincing people that their activities aren&#39;t harmful and they don&#39;t need to be regulated. Are you fucking serious?</p>
