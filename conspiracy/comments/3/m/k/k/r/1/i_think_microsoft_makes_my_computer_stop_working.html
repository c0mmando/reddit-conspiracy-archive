       So I'm not sure if this is the place to post this but whatever. Also, keep in mind this isn't a super serious post or anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've noticed for a little while now, my computer will alert me there's a new update needed for something. I usually ignore it because I'm using my computer and I don't really want to stop to do the update.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, a little while later, every single time, something on my computer will stop working. Nothing major, only minor inconveniences or annoyances. The trackpad will stop working. The speakers won't let any sound get out. None of my brightness setting buttons will do anything, the volume won't change, etc, etc. Like I said, nothing that will stop the computer's vital functionality, but it does make it very difficult to use normally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've tried fixing these issues manually by going into the settings, turning the programs off/on, changing the settings alternate ways, but no, nothing works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I'm stuck with the only option left, which is restarting my computer. And what happens then? Update time.
      </p>
      <p>
       In saying this, it could be the quality of my computer and that it's just a coincidence, but this sort of stuff only ever happens a few hours from, to a day or two after an update is available.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not entirely sure, but I feel like Microsoft could be including some weird little glitches to force people to restart their computer so the computer can update.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's it.

       Look up Richard Stallman, the founder of the GNU half of GNU/Linux and then switch to Linux. As long as you use Microsoft or Apple operating systems on your computers, you are being toyed with, spied on , and manipulated. Do some homework, and take control of your computer, or accept that your computer betrays you every time you turn it on.

       I can't wait until the Vulkan API becomes common. I will ditch Windows forever once Linux gaming support is up to speed. The only reason a lot of people run windows these days is due to an unhealthy reliance on DirectX in the gaming industry.

       I'd love to switch over to Linux. But, I mostly game on my PC and there's just not enough support for it. Like, 80% of my library will be unusable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did at one point have some distro, I believe that's what it's called, on my USB, and I would just boot from the USB on what ever PC I was on. Felt like I had my own PC with me all the time.

       going to stallman lengths of using free software is a bit ridiculous though.

       I agree. Stallman uses a thinkpad (I think) with Trisquel Linux. He doesn't browse the web though, and his only interaction with it is through a deamon which downloads what he wants to read and send it to his email.
      </p>
      <p>
       While those lengths certainly are pretty extreme, you can't argue with his reasoning. The only way to be totally sure of your online security and privacy is to avoid the web altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least with most Linux distributions, you have control over what pieces of software are installed, and you can get as close to Stallman as you want.  I personally cannot function without the internet, so I'll never be like Stallman. But I can live without iTunes, without Windows, and probably without Google, although I still lean on that one.

       The email thing is just for "personal reasons", and he doesn't recommend everyone to do it. (he hasn't elaborated on the personal reasons part)

       VLC is a good alternative to itunes. If you want something to have a "music library", Amarok works. Amarok is included in Kubuntu (a user-friendly linux distribution that is similar to windows but includes non-free software)
DuckDuckGo is a search engine that doesn't track you.

       Give it another year or two. Tried the OS a while ago, it's a bit buggy IMO. Why not Mint? It may not look as good, but it's solid as fuck.

       Hi, I'm curious what the advantage of Elementary OS is over some other modern Linux distribution, such as Mint or straight Debian? I hear about this one a lot, but am not up to speed on the latest distributions. Ubuntu has always been suspect to me, as anything ostensibly given away for free by a millionaire should warrant suspicion.

       I know exactly what you mean buddy, trust me. Microsoft are worse than spammers with their fucking updates, and even when you turn them off you still get constant messages flashing at you telling you to turn them back on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The worst is when something crashes and you want to do a quick reboot (say if you're gaming, for example), but then Windows gives you the message that it is "configuring updates" and makes you sit waiting for it for twenty minutes like a cunt.

       This isn't a conspiracy, it's a problem with the design of PCs, particularly laptops.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you leave your machine running all the time, file fragments and other bits of code clog up your memory, processor cache and disk caches. This is typically handled by 'garbage collection'. Sometimes the collection doesn't work well and little snips get left behind. The longer your machine runs, the more of these little snips are left behind and the slower your machine will run. When you restart the computer, these snips are purged as volatile storage doesn't keep data when powered off. I'm assuming you shut your PC down somewhere around the once a month mark. Keep in mind, closing your laptop is not shutting it off.

       I'm very aware of the importance of turning off/restarting computers and laptops regularly, and you've explained this very well. However, to give more information about my post, I generally turn my laptop off every 2-3 days, latest at week, but nowhere near as long as a whole month.

       What OS are you running?
      </p>
      <p>
       Win 7, and Win 8.1 here, no problems like that. Sounds like you have some kind of auto-update on which you still need to turn off. Your computer (can't speak about Win10) will not update itself just upon reboot with the proper settings. Google how to turn off auto update and you windows version.

       Funnily enough, I had a Windows 8.1 a little while back, and even though I had the auto-updates turned off, they still kept coming. Especially annoying with the forced ones that gave me a clock ticking down to the time it would force a restart and update.

       However to answer your question, I am running Windows 10.

       I didn't install an update and prosponed it for like 4 days.
      </p>
      <p>
       I uninstalled my virus scan and restarted my computer.
      </p>
      <p>
       When uninstalling it.. It made a secure point which I could roll back to if I had any problems. BAM.. My hard drive e had lost its startup files and I was unable to restore my computer for the restore point it created moments ago and the disk didn't even help fix the problem...
      </p>
      <p>
       I had to basically reformat my hard drive completely and delete all partitions before I could even reinstall another operating system.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes I do agree. Games stopped working at first... Videos became laggy and excessive CPU speed was being used by  unknown programs not running in task manager.

       I begun having that same problem on my windows 7 laptop recently. 
My cousin told me his iPhone has been acting really weird, slow, glitching, etc. and I suggested it was because of the new model being released soon. He wholeheartedly agreed that that was the likely cause.

       I work in IT. The most probable thing that is happening is some of the updates are already installed. Microsoft now searches for driver updates and bundles that on with Windows updates. So it could have found an update for your touchpad, went ahead and installed that. Then even though that update requires a restart to be fully functional ms won't really get that memo and they'll just keep prompting to restart and update to do whichever updates can't be done safely with the computer in use. Mostly changes to the registry. So now your touchpad is funny because the update was only half done and they just assume it'll be fine when you eventually restart. Same with the sound and graphics stuff. Mine keeps installing a new graphics driver that pretty much halves my fps even though the driver is the exact same one I can get on my own from nvidia, install and it works fine. Their blanket push out of third party drivers is kinda convenient, but can have issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not too dismiss anything nefarious, but driver issues are super common and all your problems are common symptoms of partially installed drivers.

       I don't get why all of my die hard friends put up with the endless upgrade cycle that consistently makes the product worse. I'm being honest and not an asshat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever since Windows Vista, they've been shoehorning more BS into the product. This is why sys admins and our own government would love to stay on Windows XP. Even a branch of the military is paying MS several million dollars to give them an additional year or two of XP support until they can move to Windows 7 (or 8).
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't feel like you're throwing in the towel on MS and supporting the competition. Trust me, MS needs to die if they continue to try and make Windows this glory god send of the end all answer to the internet's complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how you lose customers. Complicate the crap out of a product and people give up and go somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust me, there's way better alternatives to MS out there.

       I only use Windows for work purposes and the only reason I do is because of my employer having to use IE for some godforsaken reason.
I currently use Linux and would recommend that you give it a try too. It comes in many different variants,from beginner to experienced.

       (good place to start). I only got into computers about two years ago but learning Linux has really increased my understanding and love of technology. My initial reason for switching was coming home to my computer(windows 7) and turning it on and my desktop icons being moved around and numerous other problems that made me think about security(viruses, malware etc..). Paying shit loads of money for security(which is still vulnerable) and necessary programs was starting to bum me out too. If you must use Windows still, you could "dual-boot" that puppy. Youtube is full of great tutorials.

       Every time a major windows update has come out, my computer has crashed and been brought to the point of no return.  I found this had to do with my hard drive being faulty, but still.  Computer working perfectly fine, notification saying Windows 8.1 is ready, and the thing blue screens on me.  Reinstall windows, computer working perfectly fine, notification saying Windows 10 is ready to install, thing blue screens again, can't boot windows.

       i remember something familiar on windows 8.1, but with me it has, some keys on my keyboard simple stopped working, restart, system restore, anything i did solved, i installed some optional updates. and started working again..this comes with very surprise to me was i through only with me this thing happened, that why we dont need to be afraid to report ''minor inconveniences'', this can connect some dots.

       same with me and am on windows 8.1, i recently installed the destroy windows 10 spying which removes some spying updates which Microsoft recently automatically downloaded into my pc, and guess what.., and update message appears soon after, telling me about some available update i decide no thanks and continue with my normal use. well that was a big mistake because for some effin reason my computer stopped responding, mouse was still moving but everything else was was like a still image. task manager would not open with the usual shortcut so i was forced to restart the damn PC without ssd :/. fast forward "windows is updating" message comes out and start to install the updates again which i removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       this already happened twice to me. been truthfully the first thing i thought was the same thing you posted which was, they are making out computer unusable unless we update but then i told to myself, naww maybe is just me with bad luck. thanks for posting this becase now is clear what the hell is going on.

       The article doesn't mention this, but adding the domains used to "phone home" to your hosts file may be advisable as well. Though, perhaps this would break other "features".

       That's a great point. My initial comment on adding the domains to host files was directed at those that are stuck in a Windows environment for whatever reason. When operating in Linux, blocking all Microsoft servers is an excellent idea.
