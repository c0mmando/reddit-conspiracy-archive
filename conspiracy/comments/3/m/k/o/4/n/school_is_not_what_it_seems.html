        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From 1776 through much of the 19th century, American education was “decentralized, entrepreneurial, and driven by the demands of individual parents and local communities, not school districts or states.” (1)</p>

<p>This began to change in the mid-19th century when American academics became enamored with Prussian schools. Prussia, a modern day Sparta organized for constant warfare, purposefully designed its school system to create obedient soldiers, workers, and civil servants. Thomas Alexander wrote in 1919:</p>

<p>&quot;The Prussian is to a large measure enslaved through the medium of his school…his learning instead of making him his own master forges the chain by which he is held in servitude…the whole scheme of Prussian elementary education is shaped with the express purpose of making ninety five out of every hundred citizens subservient to the ruling house and to the state.&quot; - <em>The Prussian Elementary Schools</em></p>

<p><em>This</em> is the system American education is based on. Let that sink in for a second. </p>

<p>Wikipedia explains, “In 1843, Horace Mann traveled to Germany to investigate how the educational process worked. Upon his return to the United States, he lobbied heavily to have the ‘Prussian model’ adopted.” (2) Mann’s proposal became popular in the Whig Party, and in 1852 Governor Edward Everett of Massachusetts instituted a mandatory education bill based on the Prussian system. New York State quickly followed suit, and the system spread around the country. </p>

<p>Reflecting on this new system of American public education, famed philosopher and logician Charles S. Peirce wrote in the 1870s:</p>

<p>&quot;Let the will of the state act, then, instead of that of the individual. Let an institution be created which shall have for its object to keep correct doctrines before the attention of the people, to reiterate them perpetually, and to teach them to the young; having at the same time power to prevent contrary doctrines from being taught, advocated, or expressed. Let all possible causes of a change of mind be removed from men&#39;s apprehensions. Let them be kept ignorant, lest they should learn of some reason to think otherwise than they do…Then, let all men who reject the established belief be terrified into silence.&quot; (3)</p>

<p>Now let’s fast forward a bit. By the early 20th century, mandatory schooling was firmly rooted in the United States. Molding the youth had literally become a science.</p>

<p>Meet Ellwood P. Cubberley, (1868–1941), dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Education and a key player in the field of educational administration during the first half of the 20th century. </p>

<p>Also chief of elementary school textbooks at publishing company Houghton Mifflin, Cubberly heavily influenced what school children learn in this country. In 1934 Cubberly bragged in Public Education in the United States that compulsory schooling is designed to extend childhood by two to six years. Indeed, Cubberley viewed school as a giant social engineering project; he wrote, “Our schools are…factories in which the raw products (children) are to be shaped and fashioned.” </p>

<p>A close personal contact of Cubberly’s was a Harvard professor named Dr. Alexander Inglis. Inglis wrote a famous book in 1918 called <em>Principles of Secondary Education</em>. In this book, he outlines the true goals of public school. They include: </p>

<ol>
<li><em>The adjustive or adaptive function</em> - teaching kids to accept and respect authority. </li>
<li><em>The integrating function</em> - making every one alike.</li>
<li><em>The diagnostic and directive function</em> - determining each student’s social role/class.</li>
<li><em>The selective function</em> - helping along the evolutionary process by using grades, demerits, peer pressure, etc. to mark and ostracize those deemed ‘unfit’ or unwilling to conform</li>
<li><em>The propaedeutic function</em> - identifying the next generation of elites and teaching them how the system really works </li>
</ol>

<p>If you think Inglis’ book is outdated, or merely the ramblings of one eccentric professor, think again. Inglis was in charge of all secondary school textbooks at Houghton Mifflin. Furthermore, his book was cited as the definitive analysis of public schools by James Bryant Conant. Conant was president of Harvard University for over twenty years, a key member of the Manhattan Project, and United States High Commissioner for Germany from 1953–57, so his opinion carries weight. </p>

<p>I get that this all sounds a bitch far fetched. Like, why would the government implement an evil school system? Do they just like fucking with people? I’d argue the answer is a lot more complicated than that; in fact, some of the elite’s rationale makes sense. </p>

<p>First, it is an incredibly difficult task to govern a nation of 310 million people who are dispersed over thousands of miles and part of totally different ethnic groups, religions, etc. The government would argue that central institutions like school are needed to ward off anarchy and to foster a sense of unity and social cohesion.</p>

<p>Our economy is based on work and consumption, both of which need to be taught. Human beings are not naturally inclined to spend 40+ hours a week sitting in 8x8 boxes. Brainwashing the population into a 9-to-5 lifestyle may not be ideal, but it&#39;s better than living like some impoverished Third World nation. </p>

<p>There is no way to establish an Empire, invade other countries, etc. if you have a nation of 310 million individuals who think for themselves. </p>

<p>Obviously I don&#39;t agree with the above reasoning, but the point remains that there is some logic behind this system. </p>

<p>I probably should have credited Gatto in my post - some of this is just a summary of <em>Weapons of Mass Instruction.</em> He&#39;s a really good dude - left a high paying job on Madison Avenue to work in some of NYC&#39;s worst public schools. (For those who don&#39;t know him), he won NY teacher of the year 3 times in a row, and yet he hates the system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brilliant write up. I actually wrote a paper about Mann&#39;s trip to Germany. He saw the kindergarten and his mind was blown. Mann would love common(er) core to say the least. </p>

<p>Schools used to be a place of learning, even enlightenment. At one time the knowledge accessed in school was greater than what could be attained outside of the school. Today, sadly that is far from the case. The public school system is becoming a hindrance to progress. The search for the answers that have already been decided begins from infancy. When the answer is in the back of the book there is no incentive to actually think about the possibility of other answers. Now in mathematics there is a rigid organization that requires a formulaic answer. But, there is no reason for the humanities to have all human aspects ripped from them. In this world of false dichotomies the rigid right and wrong system is foundational for a lifetime of choices given. When people are given choices by an authority figure they lose free will to make up their own minds. Schools diminish the honest pursuit of truth by strictly dividing students, time, and subject. Slapping the hand of the boy who scribbles a poem instead of hearing the lecture. Discouraging art for rote repetition. One used to learn to think. Now they learn to repeat. Boredom destroys the joy of learning.  </p>

<p>The structure of the Prussian school deliberately teaches acquiescence to authority. The traditional school which had multiple age groups stratified learning throughout the community. The teacher would teach the oldest children, then the older children would be tasked to teach the younger. This taught the children how to work together. Today the teacher and the text book are the sole sources of authority in a class room. The teacher may not know but the hierarchical structure of the classroom is a tool of indoctrination. Children do what they are told and the ones who follow the instructions without any resistance get the highest marks. The one who is the best as doing what they are told becomes the valedictorian. The grading structure actually promotes competition between students who should be learning together. All students are meant to listen not interact. The teacher has all of the answers and the answer is not up for debate. How does this influence critical thinking? How can multiple choice, which has been worded intentionally fucked up, foster thought? </p>

<p>What people do not realize is how the public school system increases class divide. The affluent choose to send their children to schools with children of the same class. They spend their entire youth groomed to be heir apparent without leaving their special bubble. Rich kids are taught to see the poor as vermin. That the poor are the cause of their own downtrodden existence. The rich have abandoned the public schools or built schools in their rich neighborhoods that receive exorbitantly more funding; generally due to the tax structure that funds schools through local property tax. Simply put, property that&#39;s more valuable pays more tax. Now that the elite have left so has the funding. Plenty of money for prisons and police, but, when Sally needs a new book the excuses fly. Politicians and Wall Street bankers do not send their kids to the same schools we send our kids to. </p>

<p>The state takeover of schools was fundamental in destroying the Black community in the united states. Before curriculum was mandated by the state Catholics would teach what they saw as important, Cherokee, Creek,  Protestant communities, Black, Polish, Italian, Chinese would all teach their own American experiences. Catholic schools if they were to get state funding the had to teach the state sanctioned curriculum. Which was usually formulated by protestants. Catholic, and other communities subject to the imperial school structure, naturally rebelled to the power of the state. The Black Power movement during the civil rights era was directly fueled by radical Black teachers. The teaching of Pan-Africanism and African culture was an attempt to regain what was lost in the long night of slavery and Jim Crow. Segregated schools had segregated staff. Being a doctor, teacher, school administrator were some of the few powerful jobs people in the Black community were able to access. At a time when white doctors would not touch a black person being a black doctor was a path to success. This fosters independent cultural communities independent of the greater empire. In this same way independent community control of the school system allowed people to teach what they saw as important. For example the biblical story of exodus showed parallels to the struggle for acceptance and freedom faced the American Black population. When states took over the schools and integrated  them they shipped in white teachers. Obviously white parents were not going to have their children taught by a man who goes to black panther meetings on the weekend. But, if I was a parent I sure as hell would want the person teaching my children to be ideologically similar to me. And if that means they are <em>radical</em> so be it. You can see how the regulations introduced by the state take over of the school made every school in the country the same. This is an imperial tool that solidifies control over a population.</p>

<p>I see functional literacy as the main obstacle our society faces. People need to just learn to read. People will tell you they can read and do read. But, in reality they are only functionally literate. They read articles in Buzzfeed and can interpret a Stop sign but to pick apart John Milton is a near impossibility. To <em>read</em> comes from the old English Raedan which means to guess. i.e. I read his intentions on his face. People who are good readers are good at guessing. This increases the ability to quickly make decisions and interpret their surroundings. Reading and critical thinking go hand in hand. Reading long complicated works rather than excerpts grows the intellect more than any repetitive grammar exercise. Ask people and they will boast about <strong>not</strong> having to read. In this TV world reading had become a chore. People are actively discouraged to read by the TV culture. Reading is for the nerd. The winner can get by and succeed without reading. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this great comment. You made a lot of good points. I especially agree with your point about reading. What many don&#39;t realize is that the literacy rate in colonial America (way before state run schools came into play) was actually over 90%. In some areas, like Boston, it was close to 99%. People also read at a very high level - many of the classic boosk we have today were actually published for mass entertainment back in the day. </p>

<p>You also bring up a good point about competition within schools. Students are divided in every way possible. This gives rise to what are essentially gangs (jocks, preps, etc.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone who thinks this sounds far-fetched should do a little research into the history of eugenics in the United States before WWII.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eugenics, the social movement claiming to improve the genetic features of human populations through selective breeding and sterilization, based on the idea that it is possible to distinguish between superior and inferior elements of society, played a significant role in the history and culture of the United States prior to its involvement in World War II.</p>

<p><strong>Eugenics was practised in the United States many years before eugenics programs in Nazi Germany, and U.S. programs provided much of the inspiration for the latter.</strong>  Stefan Kühl has documented the consensus between Nazi race policies and those of eugenicists in other countries, including the United States, and points out that <strong>eugenicists understood Nazi policies and measures as the realization of their goals and demands.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics_in_the_United_States">source</a></p>

<p>These were some of the prevailing beliefs at that time, and it took the horrors of the Nazi regime to make them unpopular.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t fringe theory.  It&#39;s established history that nobody ever wants to think about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding what your dad says about &quot;making them into little socialists,&quot; maybe he&#39;s not wrong. </p>

<p>I&#39;m nearly 30 myself. For years I&#39;ve noticed there&#39;s been an increase in the anti-government movement. In general, society is now extremely wary about the government and doesn&#39;t trust it whatsoever. What if this was done strategically for a purpose? The elite businessmen would like more power. But how are they going to get it with the government in their way? &quot;Order out of chaos&quot; definitely comes to mind. </p>

<p>I read a book by Smedley Butler called War is a Racket. In it, he talks about how he was propositioned by wealthy businessmen to stage a coup of the government, specifically to overthrow the President. He lead them along until he knew all the details, and then spilled the beans to Roosevelt about it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m an anthropology/sociology major at a large US university, and in every single class this semester we&#39;re spending lengthy time on Marx. Nearly every semester in the past, I&#39;ve had at least one class that goes over Marx in considerable depth. One of my professors repeatedly says that most people would rather be flayed alive than admit they&#39;re agreeing with Marx. Another repeatedly talks about when she was getting her PhD at the University of Chicago in the 90s, professors on average spent one lecture going over Marx. Even in economics we&#39;re heavy on Marx these days. I recently read an article that was published in The New Yorker that said, &quot;There is a Nobel Prize waiting for the economist who resurrects Marx and puts it all together in a coherent model.&quot;</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t disagree that there is an inherent flaw in capitalism, and that I do think Marx was right that capitalism cannot be sustained, we need to all consider what will happen if we just overthrow the current system.</p>

<p>Scarily it seems that lots of movies with a corporate dystopian future seem to be more and more accurate. Even that tv show continuum has that as a theme, even in a somewhat positive light.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely seems like a crazy, long con. In the current system the government bends to the corporate will a lot of the time, but it must be a real pain in the ass for elite businessmen. Wouldn&#39;t it just be easier if <em>they</em> were directly in power? Maybe I&#39;m wrong here, but since it seems to be that the modern capitalist system won&#39;t last forever in its current state, a New World Order with a more &quot;socialist&quot; government ran by the elite businessmen (instead of these &quot;shady politicians&quot;) seems to be the way that we&#39;re heading.</p>

<p>Also on a side note: my professor in my economy class showed a pretty interesting <a href="https://erablogdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/sectoral_balances1-14.png">graph</a> the other day. Up until the late 90s, government spending was nearly equal to savings. Notice that around the time of 9-11 almost all of the money was going to the capitalists. When I saw this, Smedley Butler instantly came to mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool graph, if you noticed savings it&#39;s starting to match the government spending again.  </p>

<p>They&#39;re in charge without any of the blame. Think about it, they can dictate policy through the politicians. When the politicians get blamed for policy they never blame their donors who asked them to pass a bill. And later those same politicians work for the corporations like that general at jpmorgan or any politician basically every in Congress. You get what you want as a rich person without any blame or exposure. It&#39;s genius, I don&#39;t blame the CEO of Johnson&amp; Johnson for wanting EPA regulations loosened, but I bet he gave money to politicians since if it passed he&#39;d earn more money due to reduced production costs.  </p>

<p>The Koch(I probably spelled it wrong) wanted to be famous Republicans and put themselves out there, get some of that crazy Republican pussy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the good read. I came from very modest means but attended a pretty wealthy school, and became so turned off from what I was seeing, I stopped attending my junior year. I learned computer programming on my own in my early 20&#39;s and now make a fair income. While it&#39;s not as much as I probably should be making, I have no student debt and got an extra 6 years of my life to do what I wanted and not be stuck doing schoolwork.</p>

<p>If I ever have children, they won&#39;t ever step foot in a school. This is one of the big reasons I&#39;m hesitant to have any. While several of my teachers saw my talents, my inability to focus on what I saw as BS homework kept me from getting good grades and ultimately put me on a path to the lower class, which I took upon myself to avoid.</p>

<p>I doubt nothing about this information. Reddit itself is a perfect example - it&#39;s stunning to me that the Conspiracy subreddit is as quiet as it is. The hivemind insults alternative thinking openly and turns members into conformers, due in part to a likely presence of shills who search for and ridicule those who expose truths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Public schooling is the NUMBER ONE scourge upon humanity. Take the children, force them to WASTE their entire childhood doing absolutely nothing productive or useful, force them to associate &quot;learning&quot; with tedious and mediocre work, then they go home and associate &quot;fun&quot; with tv and the media. Teach the children to hate learning, to love being unproductive, and guess what? You may as well have killed them. You may as well have raped them. You have taken everything from them, and they don&#39;t even realize it. </p>

<p>It is the worst crime ever committed, the worst institution ever conceived of, yet no one talks about it. Ever. Those that do are ridiculed.</p>

<p>We should be ANGRY. They took away the one thing we can never experience again and never get back, our childhood. We should be livid, we should be viciously tearing apart the people organizing it. Yet no one cares, they just let it go.</p>

<p>Bit extreme, no? Force them to waste time learning &quot;absolutely nothing productive or useful&quot;? Kids in school have every opportunity to learn useful and interesting trades, sciences and such over the years. I don&#39;t know what school you went to but it must&#39;ve been a shit one.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re thinking back to school as some sort of regimented prison system full of pain and misery, but I look back and see a place where I met all my favourite people and learned almost everything I know about the world. I fulfilled my curiosity by asking questions and getting answers, and even if there were things I didn&#39;t like about it (and still don&#39;t like), I wouldn&#39;t have traded it for anything.</p>

<p>But grr, mandatory anything is bad, fuck the new world order turning us into mind-slaves!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>School can be great for lots of people, but it&#39;s not for everyone. There are lots of bright minds who, instead of being groomed and refined to accomplish real things in life, are held back through a combination of slow advancement in challenging material and a group of peers who encourage this drawn-out process. I personally did not see good grades as an accomplishment. Maybe it wasn&#39;t ingrained in my head enough, maybe I&#39;m delusional.</p>

<p>I spent the vast majority of my time in school writing, creating charts, inventing card games, building imaginary statistic sheets, just random crap that kept me stimulated. I was always scolded for it, and I held the resulting frustration for a long, long time. Most people will tell me &quot;you should have been paying attention.&quot; But for me, that&#39;s a whole lot easier said than done. You can&#39;t fake interest in something.</p>

<p>So yes, the fact that there is a mandatory system you must move through is not the best solution. Meeting friends in school was not enough to give me fond memories of it and enjoy it. I was introverted and it wasn&#39;t until I stepped into the real world before I learned where the need is for skilled workers, and decide what, of those careers, I enjoyed most. I always saw the educational benefits as fraudulent, however obscure that view might be, and I feel like how my life has progressed has cemented that viewpoint.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t ever look down on those who enjoyed school and benefited from doing well in it. In fact, I&#39;m a little jealous they spent more of their lives in happiness than I did. And for most people, it works. But a mandatory system shaped around the average majority is wrong, plain and simple, and is not the best for producing great minds. But as this supported text clearly states, that is not the goal of the system, and that in and of itself is the serious crime here.</p>

<p>EDIT: As far as the &quot;rape&quot; comment...yeah, that&#39;s not entirely fair. But the notion that sucking most of the joy of childhood out of you does qualify as a form of trauma, and is something people who didn&#39;t fit in experience. It resulted in depression for me in my early adulthood, which I&#39;ve been fortunate enough to overcome as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, but you only listed 5 of the 6 goals. </p>

<p>This is from John Taylor Gatto&#39;s book, The Underground History of American Education</p>

<p>1) The adjustive or adaptive function. 
Schools are to establish fixed habits of reaction to authority. This, of course, precludes critical judgment completely. It also pretty much destroys the idea that useful or interesting material should be taught, because you can&#39;t test for reflexive obedience until you know whether you can make kids learn, and do, foolish and boring things.</p>

<p>2) The integrating function. 
This might well be called &quot;the conformity function,&quot; because its intention is to make children as alike as possible. People who conform are predictable, and this is of great use to those who wish to harness and manipulate a large labor force.</p>

<p>3) The diagnostic and directive function. 
School is meant to determine each student&#39;s proper social role. This is done by logging evidence mathematically and anecdotally on cumulative records. As in &quot;your permanent record.&quot; Yes, you do have one.</p>

<p>4) The differentiating function. 
Once their social role has been &quot;diagnosed,&quot; children are to be sorted by role and trained only so far as their destination in the social machine merits - and not one step further. So much for making kids their personal best.</p>

<p>5) The selective function. 
This refers not to human choice at all but to Darwin&#39;s theory of natural selection as applied to what he called &quot;the favored races.&quot; In short, the idea is to help things along by consciously attempting to improve the breeding stock. Schools are meant to tag the unfit - with poor grades, remedial placement, and other punishments - clearly enough that their peers will accept them as inferior and effectively bar them from the reproductive sweepstakes. That&#39;s what all those little humiliations from first grade onward were intended to do: wash the dirt down the drain.</p>

<p>6) The propaedeutic function. 
The societal system implied by these rules will require an elite group of caretakers. To that end, a small fraction of the kids will quietly be taught how to manage this continuing project, how to watch over and control a population deliberately dumbed down and declawed in order that government might proceed unchallenged and corporations might never want for obedient labor.</p>

<p>Back in the early 1960s and 70s when I was a kid in school quite a few teachers were ex-military, and we were afraid of them.  They ruled their classrooms with no nonsense tolerated.  There was the threat of sitting outside in the hall ostracized, being sent to the principal&#39;s office, staying after school or detention, and though all were trifling punishments, some of us kids were scared shitless. I don&#39;t know how many eventually got beyond feeling afraid all the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the common core definitely enforces this. and while i can see why it could seem nefarious to think making community college free, i think it&#39;s important to note that it&#39;s just hard to get a good job without a degree, and maybe some people want to do this nefariously, i think some people just want this so more people have an opportunity. if done correctly, it could be a good thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to disagree, I think that college falls right into the aforementioned goals.

    <div class="md"><p>no, i agree with you, i&#39;m just saying that maybe SOME of the people advocating for free college are just trying to compensate for that reality. people go through public school and are disadvantaged. i am sure some people, whether in the minority or whatever, are just trying to help the disadvantaged get access to opportunities they would be without otherwise. i generally disagree with the school system, but i recognize that it is hard to get a good job without a bachelor&#39;s degree (at least), and i think free college is, at least for some, a small attempt to help the commonwealth.</p>

<p>i&#39;m not saying it&#39;s the right answer, i just don&#39;t think that everyone fighting for it is in the wrong.</p>

<p>I get that this all sounds a bitch far fetched. Like, why would the government implement an evil school system?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it&#39;s not far fetched AT ALL. What other reason would the government desire to have a formalized, structured education system? Surely not out of the goodness of their hearts. Everything the government does is <em>intentional</em> to further its goals. It is NOT in the interests of the government to have an educated, logical, rational, skeptical public. Which means that the reason for schooling must be something else - something that furthers the ends of the government.</p>

<p>Whenever the government has a program, ask, cui bono? (Who benefits?) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes because this is the only way, without this way there would be chaos. How about teaching kids to think, and have compassion and respect for the world they live in and the life in it, both human and animal. How about instead of making kids feel inadequate for not being good or interested in all subjects, helping them find and build up on their natural skills and interests. How about teaching kids REAL nutrition, so they don&#39;t poison their bodies with what passes as food these days, how about teaching kids what money is and how to manage it property so they don&#39;t get out of school and fall in a crippling debt. I can keep going, you really think that this system is the only system, and without this system we&#39;d just have retards on the loose? No, in fact most children are naturally good, only outside influences like uneducated parents or a education system made to conform that breeds more people that are not fit to be parents or even part of a utopian society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s besides the point. The point is that the first step to addressing a problem is acknowledging there <em>is</em> one. You won&#39;t even do that here, you&#39;re here to argue that the problem doesn&#39;t exist. If it doesn&#39;t, great, but it does. OP did a very thorough job evidencing that. So again, if your only contribution here is &quot;nuh uh!&quot;, this really isn&#39;t the sub for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well people come to this sub for different reasons. I come mainly for the laughs. But this thread I just found even more dumb than usual. It outlines the schooling system as if something was wrong, when in my view it&#39;s one of the things that works great in our society. Look no further than countries with a bad education system, and look how bad their population have it. Essentially the better/more accessible the education system the better the citizens have it, so bashing the education system seems like just wanting to make noise for the sake of making noise.  The OP also points out how teaching children to &quot;work&quot; is somehow bad?? wtf? </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t understand what&#39;s wrong with the values of :
-having a great, fun childhood learning things (which is what most people in western countries have as far as I know - maybe it&#39;s just the schools I attended and am completely biased)</p>

<p>-eventually make it to a age where you can decide what kind of work/career you want to have</p>

<p>-go through college/university and learn a trade</p>

<p>-make an honest living doing something you like, grow older with a certain wealth that allows you a comfortable living, and make a family of your own - give your children the same opportunity you had</p>

<p>What&#39;s wrong with that?  I mean everyone here seems to agree with OP and think the system is flawed, so surely you must all have SOME idea of how you would change it or change society? I mean I&#39;m sure we would all love to live in some utopia where no one works and robots do everything and we just sit on our ass watching TV but at this point it seems like this is the best model we have to build functioning societies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing the point, again. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a discussion on solutions. You want to make it that so you can argue those solutions, rather than participate in the discussion <em>about the problem itself</em>. Any solution presented would be inadequate to you because you don&#39;t see the situation as requiring one at all in the first place.</p>

<p>If you think there&#39;s no other education system better than the current, you&#39;re extremely naive. America doesn&#39;t have &quot;the best education system ever&quot;, yet your whole issue seems to accept that as gospel truth. Forgive me if that makes <em>me</em> laugh, as it&#39;s said like a true blue believer - again, the type of which doesn&#39;t typically garner a warm welcome in this sub.</p>

<p>Enjoy your yucks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know the point isn&#39;t finding a solution, after all this is a sub about complaining about society not about finding solutions. I&#39;m not american so I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re bringing that up. I&#39;m talking about western countries education system in general, which is pretty similar everywhere except for tuition cost for college/universities - but the general idea of teaching kids about work ethics is the same everywhere.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry I&#39;m enjoying my laugh, enjoy your &quot;conspiracies&quot;. Win-win for everyone :)</p>

<p>I probably should have credited Gatto in my post - some of this is just a summary of <em>Weapons of Mass Instruction.</em> He&#39;s a really good dude - left a high paying job on Madison Avenue to work in some of NYC&#39;s worst public schools. (For those who don&#39;t know him), he won NY teacher of the year 3 times in a row, and yet he hates the system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why people put up with this schedule I never understood. 
I get that the businesses and corporations want to extract the absolute maximum out of their employees, basically working them into the ground. If employees willingly allow themselves to be ass raped by their employers, why not. Exploitation to the max. If only the common pee on had a brain. And if only the business execs realized that production is actually stifled by long work hours we might have a happier society. Alas they are blinded by greed.</p>
