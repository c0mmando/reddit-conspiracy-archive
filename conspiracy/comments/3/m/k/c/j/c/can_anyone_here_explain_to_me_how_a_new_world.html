        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am genuinely curious. Up until a couple years ago I viewed it as something nobody wanted. I was among you guys completely refusing to accept it. The more I&#39;ve thought about it, the more I&#39;ve realized that it&#39;s actually something everybody really, really needs. Especially if we want peace and/or unity. Hell, the words &quot;One World Government&quot; literally means unity.</p>

<p>There is simply too much division in the world today and nobody seems to get along because of it. There are an incalculable number of religions, cultural differences, etc. that does no good whatsoever. Keeping the system like it is only encourages this division.</p>

<p>That being said, I will agree wholeheartedly that consolidating so much power into a very select few (kind of like it is today) really opens the door to major corruption. <strong>However</strong>, on one hand, there&#39;s nothing to gain by those chosen to be leaders of the NWO/OWG by &quot;enslaving everyone&quot; and creating a dystopian world. People will eventually see through it and revolt. Therefore it is not in anyone&#39;s interest, especially the rulers, to create such a system. On the other hand, you keep the people happy, give them the freedom to do what they please without harming others under the proposed &quot;One World&quot; laws, everyone wins. Those in power keep their power, the rest of us are happy.</p>

<p>Basically, the nonsense that&#39;s being spread claiming we&#39;re headed towards a dystopian future, IMO, is very harmful.</p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;re right. Maybe I&#39;m just overly optimistic. Please help me understand why I&#39;m wrong. What do <strong>you</strong> think such a system would end up looking like?</p>

<p><strong>NINJA EDIT:</strong> Given that I&#39;m posting this in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, I fully expect what&#39;s inevitably coming my way. Keep in mind, though, that I truly want people to be happy. That&#39;s it. I&#39;m not a shill (that&#39;s what a shill would say,) I&#39;m not an agent of any sort (that&#39;s what an agent would say,) I&#39;m just a regular guy trying to live a happy life like everyone else.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Why is this getting downvoted? Seriously, is this not a legitimate concern?</p>

Let&#39;s take today&#39;s younger generation as an example. With the advent of the internet and other means of mass communication, people are already becoming accepting of other people that their parents/grandparents/great grandparents never really took too kindly with (aka racism.) We get to personally know (as much as the internet will allow) people from other cultures. This ends up in building friendships. Religion is on it&#39;s way out. As the older generations die off, pretty soon everyone is on the same page. At that point, I&#39;d say the world is ready for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because nationalistic sentiments have been ingrained since birth. So who rules will matter. This will never be a peaceful process. The only way to rule is to divide. And humans will always have divisions. No one will be happy. Think of the economic side of thing. You&#39;d end up playing favourites and some will always be disenfranchised. The new world order will have to be run like a shadow government. World Bank and such bodies may see a more vocal role in all global policies. Apart from that, the happy peaceful utopia you think of is just naive. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Yes, but I&#39;m pretty sure I addressed this in my initial reply to you.</p>

<p>Remember that this is a hypothetical. Who knows what it would look like in reality? A shadow government? Sure, I don&#39;t see why not. As far as banks go, who&#39;s to say that we would still have a cash-based economy instead of gift-based?</p>

<p>Besides, I may be &quot;naive&quot;, but I like to think in the long-term and how things might affect one another if implemented. I try to take many aspects into account. You know, cost vs. benefit. Think about it; a happy workforce is a productive workforce. A dystopia would bring about the most unhappy, unproductive, tired workers you could imagine. In the long-run, this is very bad news. Things would progress at a snail&#39;s pace. Treat your workforce with respect and give incentives, they&#39;ll never leave. In fact, they&#39;d be happy putting in more hours than required. The one&#39;s running the show <em>know that</em>. I&#39;m sorry, but I just don&#39;t really see it playing out any other way. I really hope I&#39;m correct in my assumptions. If not, so be it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a good idea whose time has, unfortunately, come. </p>

<p>We are going to be handed a one-world government that is based on American fascism stripped of its democracy. Whole swaths of the human population will be reduced to second and third class citizens if they refuse to abandon their ethnic identities and all claim to separately shared histories. It will have the greatest levels of economic injustice in the history of the planet -- a statement that has been true in the USA almost every day for the past 150 years -- and it will have draconian laws protecting the haves from the have-nots ever rising above their station. Society will be designed around eugenics with programs that claim to be meritocratic but actually deny all opportunity to all but a few.</p>

<p>In short, the only kind of one-world government that is really possible at this moment is a planet-sized USA. Not good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Freedom! Give the power and choice to smaller and smaller communities of people and be free to move to where you like the laws/culture/environment/jobs. </p>

<p>Be free to travel and enjoy our planet and raise a family while making the planet a better place for the next generation.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the perfect world where you can be happy and be left the fuck alone to live your life however you like as long as you&#39;re not hurting others or committing atrocities. </p>

<p>&quot;One&quot; set of rules for everyone is never going to work. Democracy won&#39;t work and I&#39;m already not really a fan of the current versions of democracy anyways. Just because a &#39;majority&#39; believes something doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re doing what&#39;s truly best for everyone or even able to understand the bigger picture.</p>

<p>Might as well assign one type of diet and force everyone to eat the same &quot;food&quot; or have &quot;approved&quot; music and art that can&#39;t deviate from what&#39;s &quot;appropriate&quot;.</p>

<p>We need the ability to dream. The root of &quot;government&quot; is &quot;mind control&quot;, to govern your thoughts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely, you are wrong to believe that the &quot;chosen leaders&quot; would &quot;gain nothing&quot; from &quot;enslaving everyone&quot;. A generation brought up brainwashed to believe they have no choice, no ability to change the world for the better... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>think of it this way, the larger your country becomes the worse job a government does of representing its citizens.</p>

<p>so if your leader is from the USA he would do a terrible job of representing people in australia, or russia.</p>

<p>the more disconnected from the people it becomes the less likely it is to serve their needs.</p>

<p>then you have the whole absolute power aspect. say we elect a Trump, or a Stalin or another hitler and he is commander in chief of the whole worlds army how is that going to play out.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh I agree with you OP.  One world government is demonized hardcore without any real reasoning as to why it&#39;s worse than the current system.  Unfortunately you won&#39;t find much support here.</p>
