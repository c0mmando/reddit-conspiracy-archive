<p>Depending on how it plays out, could it have been part of, or used in a strategy to weaken Germany/EU? What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure VW was the target of economic warfare. I&#39;d dismiss it as &quot;shit happens&quot; usually, but then there&#39;s <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/volkswagen-accused-cooperating-brazils-military-dictators-1520789">this</a> lawsuit conveniently filed at the same time of the scandal outbreak. Pretty sure this isn&#39;t a coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect you are onto something. My first post on this story was:</p>

<p>I&#39;m wondering if there is industrial intrigue, a smear campaign, here. It is known that there are VW diesel passenger cars in Europe getting 70mpg. The US has blocked the import of that engine here. Could a vast untapped market, beginning to ask questions and wondering why, really?
If I could buy that here, I would. It would impact the sales of all the hybrids, the electrics, especially now that we&#39;re seeing diesel getting cheaper than gasoline again.
In this day of sell out politicians, media, and banking, I wouldn&#39;t put it past a consortium of interests coming together to launch a smear campaign. At the very least I&#39;d like the specifics on the before and after power and pollution numbers. They invoke Milli Vanilli in the article, that sounds fishy. This was 9 days ago.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m thinking it was a campaign for some hedge fund. It would be interesting to see who was shorting VW stock prior to the release.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m guessing that would be a smaller version golf with a 1.4L Tdi motor. After the tune, and removing some unnecessary components from the engine bay and cleaning the intake manifold, my moms 05 jetta tdi gets roughly 52-53mpg on the highway depending on cruising speed. But just daily commutes to work and in and around town we see 40+. There are VERY few and I need to stress that word very because after 05, the fuel economy dropped in the diesel jettas and passats. At least what was reported on the window sticker. If you put a taller 5th gear in the PD BEW jetta you can push 60mpg EASILY. And because it&#39;s a diesel, they last much longer than a normal gas car. You&#39;ll see 500k miles before major components are worn out in the engine. Would someone please point me to an American made car with this kind of fuel economy and longevity. I&#39;ll wait.</p>
