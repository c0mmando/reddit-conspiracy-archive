    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m still here. I was/am a mod of (the now COMPLETELY inactive)  op_jade_helm. I&#39;m relieved and in a weird sense disappointed. I&#39;ve seen videos of military activity  (using the term VERY loosely) still going on at the &#39;closed wal marts&#39; that everyone was freaking out about. </p>

<p>I never predicted anything. I never said it was going to be martial law. I really and truly was just concerned on what was happening. There were plenty of over the top conspiracies, and i took them all with a heaping handful of salt. I feel dumb because I am lumped in with that group.</p>

<p>Sure, i speculated lots of different things. It was just such a new thing, and i wanted to dig as deep as i could. </p>

<p>At least i didn&#39;t think an asteroid was going to wipe is out two days ago. </p>

A dozen pawns are placed in each game over several years to push forward a strategy(surveillance, disarming the public, mandatory vaccines, etc.) and once a generation or 2 has grown used to their doublespeak and criticisms THEN they slowly implement their goals. If you don&#39;t see how gun restrictions/banning has gotten more and more focus in the past years then idk what to tell you.

<p>Seems to me that you&#39;re the delusional one here.  There are more guns in the US than in any other country in the world, and every year there are more.  Nothing&#39;s preventing you from owning guns in the US, and nothing ever will.   The last time they made any vague attempt to stop randoms from getting guns was when they tried to assassinate Reagan, and that still didn&#39;t have any effect.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been on r/conspiracy for years now.  You guys are constantly telling me that gun control is coming really soon now, and that whatever latest atrocity is a false flag to force gun control.  It never happens, and you never change your tune.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t say there is more restrictions.</p>

<p>It says that, that issue has received more attention.</p>

<p>Yes, and that is completely wrong.  </p>

<p>I assume you&#39;re a lot younger than I am, but during Reagan&#39;s era, for example, the gun control issue was HUGE - it was constantly being discussed on the media, gun control had supporters from both R and D.  This momentum continued, leading to the Brady Bill in 1993 which had bipartisan support... and then, nothing.  It&#39;s been 22 years and since then gun restrictions have steadily been eroded.</p>

<p>The US isn&#39;t going to get gun control. I think this is a mistake, but I&#39;d be stupid to allow my personal preferences to trump reality.  </p>

<p>We&#39;ve had twenty years of slowly-loosening restrictions for the vast majority of Americans with only a very few states bucking the trend, and no evidence that this will ever change.  We have gun sales and separately, ammo sales at or near record highs for over five years straight, we have a record number of guns in America, and there&#39;s no evidence at all that any of this will change.</p>

<p>No one&#39;s coming to take away the guns.  I&#39;ve had to listen to gun owners claim this for decades now and it&#39;s not happened, and it&#39;s not going to happen, and I&#39;m bored of hearing this bullshit.  The gun owners won decades ago, can&#39;t they just shut up about it now? Get a life, guys, FFS!</p>

<p>(Noted that you don&#39;t own a gun - this is more generally directed...)</p>

<p>It&#39;s good that people have passion for things that aren&#39;t openly discussed. But, if they don&#39;t want to converse where there may be holes in their theories.. then they really aren&#39;t theorizing anything. They&#39;re hypothesiz-ing. </p>

<p>October 24, 1929 wasn&#39;t the &quot;doomsday date&quot; it was the beginning of a mess. The market would have been worse had the fed raised interest rates this past week. They were scared and kicked the can down the road. That hike is coming (and it needs to come) but everyone is hoping for just a little more time.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to enjoy the postion I put myself in financially and hope that other&#39;s have played the CYA game as well.</p>
