       i believe some aspects of most are hoaxes. I do believe that some people do get threatened, intimidated, or killed. Just as many are likely paid off in money, promotions, or other favors. It's easy to convince people they are doing something for the benefit when they also get something out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at all the times cops kill people. If you watch closely you can spot the bias that the news adheres to. If it isn't a false flag/hoax they promote the stories that go with the emotion they are trying to play to in people.

       People deal with death and horrible situations in different ways.  Shell shock is one of the situations that tends to come out of it.  The thing about being shell shocked, is that it's not always that thousand yard stare that we tend to associate with it.  There's often a detachment, sometimes a euphoric laughter that comes out of it.  It really boils down to people dealing with things differently, as opposed to pointing at a guy that smiled and saying "yep, it's a hoax."

       Massive confirmation bias at work. "Sandy Hook was fake, no matter how they behave, it's not real." However people reacted, Hoaxers proclaim either "Look at that terrible lack of emotion, clearly a crisis actor!" or "Look at that hysterical over-reaction, clearly a crisis actor!"

       No, I'm afraid it's clearly not "confirmation bias."  Though it is quite interesting that what you're saying here is the standard counter argument whenever this is mentioned.  Almost as if this exact response is Step 1 in the forum disruption manual.  Worth noting.

       You name the alleged staged shooting event, and I'll gladly identify the people who responded immediately in an emotionally inappropriate manner.  And more importantly, the unrealistic behavior of MULTIPLE crisis actors immediately after the "event" is but one
       <strong>
        minor
       </strong>
       aspect of the multitude of strong evidence that clearly demonstrates the events were staged.  To your weak attempted point, and as others have already mentioned in this very thread even, at no time were 450 students ever seen evacuating the school.  This is with multiple dash cameras rolling and a news helicopter circling the staged scene.  Watching the same pathetic people circle the firehouse in a comedic fashion in an attempt to make it appear as though more people (parents, teachers, students) were involved.  Say enough to cover what needs to appear to be 450 elementary school students and their parents.  No valid death certificates, which are PUBLIC RECORD, no believeable motive for the alleged murder of 26 entirely unrelated and innocent people.  Coupled with the lies immediately floated by multiple key individuals involved who attempted to shoehorn a plausible motive into the fiasco.  With claiming Nancy taught at the school, and "Adam" having an altercation with staff prior to the staged shooting.  The school was not operational, did not have a web presence typical of any school in CT, nor did any of the parents, teachers, students, medics, or police behave in a manner typical of such a large scale mass shooting event.  The use of fake names (Leonard P Osner), and the staged, reshot, and repositioned photographs of one micro group of the same students being evacuated.  Gotta get this one good and looking real for the newspapers tomorrow!

       Those 100% unused triage areas....the already rusty bullet holes in the car parked out front...the hole in the glass that a fully armed Adam Lanza allegedly entered through....the lack of any and all video evidence...the staged home of Nancy and Adam...the video of him allegedly purchasing murder wares...the lack of independently verifiable photographs of the creation that was "Adam...the nurse not being found for hours...then Fucking up her story so bad she had to change critical aspects...

       The list goes on and on. And while it's nice to believe we're discussing the totality of evidence with just the unbelievable behavior of the participants, again, this is but one tiny piece in the fictional staged event that was Sandy Hook.  Thanks for trying.

       You mean the manipulated footage that doesn't actually show anything at all? Please, point out specific people that "circle the firehouse". Of course, this claim also adds hundreds and hundreds of people to the alleged list of "crisis actors" - now, apparently numbering in the thousands, because
       <strong>
        not one

       of the people who were there on the day, have ever expressed any degree of skepticism about the event. That is reserved for Youtube warriors and the likes of Wolfgang "GoFundMe" Halbig.

       Adam Lanza was insane. Just like James Holmes, Seung-Hui Cho, Dylann Roof, etc. The inability to grasp their motives is entirely explicable, and hardly points to a false flag event, unless you're entirely deluded and completely ignorant of how mental illness affects those it afflicts.

       What video evidence are you expecting? This is yet another fictitious claim made by Hoaxers: the only camera at the school was on the front-door and was an entryphone, with no recording capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on, but the truth is, there is not a single piece of evidence that the Hoaxers can provide, which is not made up entirely (like your "lack of video evidence" claim), or has a much more credible rational explanation. It takes a special kind of "special" to somehow weave this into "nobody died," and then continue to believe it, in the face of all the actual evidence.

       Not a shill accusation whatsoever.  Simply an observation made of people acting in an almost identical fashion when attempting to counter this clear as day staged HSEEP event.  A little paranoid,

       ?  Your response here is unfortunately lacking substance, and kind of drones on and on needlessly without addressing much.  A fluffy apologist rant lacking.  It's nice to see that you've attempted to claim the camera wasn't an actual recording camera, even though the documented cost of the recent new security enhancements to were far more than a simple unrecorded closed circuit single camera setup.  I love that other schools in the area had full security monitoring, yet mysteriously the dilapidated Sandy Hook elementary was the only one that did not.

      <p>
       If you'd like to attempt to back your claims, why not find us any other mass shooting where zero children victims are rushed to the awaiting hospital, or even where zero victims were removed from the cold, bloody concrete well over 24 hours later.  It must be a common practice to fully set up triage gear, to then not use any of it for the actual triage work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, any footage or proof that shows 450 students being evacuated from the violent crime scene.  I fear it doesn't exist.  In the joke of an official report, or photographic or video evidence of the day.  These basics would have been seen by multitudes of people, and should be extremely easy to locate.  I wish you well in your efforts.

       I don't deal with mass casualty events in my relatively tame profession, yet often times working through lunch is at times a necessity.  But those cops, the exact same ones who demanded in interviews that NO ONE call them heroes, clearly behaved as though they WEREN'T heroes with this simple act.  As you're attempting the lamest of all justifications, saying:

       No, we expect the cops to focus on the largest mass shooting event they've ever experienced before they bust out the party size Doritos and soda, and cold kicking it while joking and laughing on the hood of a cruiser without a care in the world.  It's not like there were far more pressing issues to deal with.  Those dead children laying on the cold, hard concrete perhaps?  Nah, couldn't expect those worthless non-hero cops to starve a mere 3 hours after arrival on scene...

       Oh, so with the shooter now dead, all pressing police work there was clearly then done.  You know, securing the scene, doing multiple sweeps yet still not finding the lying nurse for still a few more hours at this point, the whole notifying the affected parents or guardians, that crime scene investigation jazz I believe I've heard the police do sometimes...

       Nah, they should have simply just packed up and took off.  While the bodies of small children we're left on the cold and bloody concrete for what will be well over another day, they've got more important issues to attend to.  It's that critical mid-day snack and joke time!

       Official reports on such events are quite detailed. They list which doors were used, which direction people went, and at exactly what time. The point is that things did NOT happen as the report states. People were supposed to be crossing that parking lot. It matters not what "could have" happened behind it.

       Why was none of this ever caught by any of the police dash cams OR the overhead news chopper?  450 students in that school, and all anyone has ever seen was a clearly staged and reshot evacuation of less than a classroom of young students.  Sounds perfectly reasonable.

I personally saw her burn marks, like I said i used to work with her. I don't know if she still works there but we worked at home depot together and she was training to be a firefighter.

       Isn't the theory with that one not that it didn't happen, but that there were multiple shooters? There are videos of a couple early news stations reporting this I believe.

       She said the person on the phone that opened the door was not James Holmes.  She said at times it sounded like he was firing two guns at the same time but never said anything about there being more than 1 person.  I personally think he had accomplishes or that James holmes might not even been the one doing the shooting.

       The two gas masks along with the drugged and entirely passive James Holmes sitting in the passenger seat of his locked personal vehicle indicates otherwise.

       These staged events all share common characteristics:  The most basic questions are ALWAYS simply ignored by the media and law enforcement.  Take the heavy security camera coverage of the entire theater ALONG WITH the rear of the building, where he allegedly entered and went Rambo on innocent citizens for no..valid..reason - is simply never shown in court or to the public, even basic questions about the existence of such footage was ignored many times over by law enforcement.  Emotionally inappropriate behavior by the many actors and actresses who allegedly just lost loved ones.  Defense lawyers who NEVER attempt to challenge that their clients performed the shooting.   Great work.

       My girlfriend worked at a bowling alley near where the shootings happened. The evening before the shooting, we were talking over the phone about whether or not she should go see the movie.  We waffled back and forth (as love birds tend to do) before she finally decided to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward to the next day when the news broke, and it goes without saying I was beside myself with worry. When she finally did call me back, she said that they HAD gone to the theater, but the line was rather long and she and a lady friend of hers decided to instead go out to a local eatery and maybe come back for a later showing.

       I think it's more the case that an event, such as a mass shooting, happens and the powers that be or whatever use it as their agenda to push their goals. I have a hard time with the whole hoax thing with these shootings, I really feel like they did happen, or at least to a certain degree, and then it was capitalized for an agenda, wether that be gun-control or what have you.

       The Dylan Roof shooting is a perfect example of this.  Look how quickly the government turned that into an anti-gun, anti-free speech idea.

       Then the cops proceeded to stop and arrest a known armed mass murderer so casually.

        Fuck a felony stop.  Let's not even draw a gun here.  He's not a risk to us or anything with that pistol sitting on his lap.

       This is where staged fiction reveals itself.  With highly abnormal behavior by the participants magically becoming* the norm.  He murdered no one.  The alleged victims couldn't act their way out of a paper bag.

        I just lost my Mom but it's not that big of a deal.  I forgive him hours later.  It's been a little rough, but I'm just so filled with love now that my Mom has been brutally murdered with no motive whatsoever.
