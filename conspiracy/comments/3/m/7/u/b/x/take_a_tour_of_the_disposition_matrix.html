        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know what I am about to say will be perceived by some as seditious, but so were the writings of Thomas Paine.  Remember, conspiracy theories are not just theories if they are true.  I believe I have connected the dots on the so called scandals and data breaches we have been seeing in the US Government.  First, you have to accept the premise that the Military Industrial Intelligence Complex is committed to endless war and/or intelligence surveillance and harassment in every country on earth.  If you can&#39;t accept that premise, take the blue pill, and the story ends here.  But if you take the red pill, get ready for a journey through the Disposition Matrix.  The Disposition Matrix is not my term.  It is the actual term used by the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community to state how they are going to deal with every target in their database.</p>

<p>I will call this Disposition Matrix just the Matrix for short from here on.  For each target, there is a flowchart for how to neutralize the target - by drone, kidnapping, discrediting, harassment, etc.  Google Disposition Matrix if you have any doubts whatsoever about this.  Jo Becker and Scott Shane of the New York Times broke the story of Obama&#39;s foreign kill list three years ago, complete with its list of Terror Tuesday meetings at the White House. Jeremy Scahill of Democracy Now broke the story that Americans were on the list and being targeted overseas.  I am now breaking the sad news to you now that Americans are on the list for targeting on US soil.  A few brave journalists like Sierra Adamson have asked government officials if such a list exists.  But the White House press core has failed to ask even about the Scahill disclosures about Americans being targeted overseas.</p>

<p>Why target Americans living in America?  The primary mission is to destroy any anti-war movement organizers and civil liberties advocates.  My first piece of evidence is how the Veterans Administrations used medical records to retaliate against whistleblowers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/04/13/shock-testimony-va-officials-retaliate-against-whistleblowers-by-illegally-accessing-their-medical-records/">http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/04/13/shock-testimony-va-officials-retaliate-against-whistleblowers-by-illegally-accessing-their-medical-records/</a></p>

<p>My second bit of evidence is that the OPM hack of government employees was an Intelligence Community hack.  These data sources like fingerprints allow for cross indexing with many other databases for records for all Federal civilian employees. The Intelligence Community already has these records for military personnel.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/09/opm-now-admits-5-6m-feds-fingerprints-stolen-hackers/">http://www.wired.com/2015/09/opm-now-admits-5-6m-feds-fingerprints-stolen-hackers/</a></p>

<p>With each new hack, a new data source is added to the Matrix.  There have been so many hacks of medical records from major insurance carriers, I won&#39;t bother to list them here.  Medical records are the key way to discredit any dissident or anti-war protestor.  The Intelligence Community is meeting with every American university to identify individuals who are deemed mentally unstable to create new targets every day..</p>

<p>Every protest in every city is the US is photographed and processed by facial recognition programs and cross references with license plate scans in a one mile radius of the event.  Every physical and online protest becomes a new data domain like Occupy or BlackLivesMatter.  So why collect all this information?  Anti-terrorism? No. Most of the data sources have nothing to do with domestic terrorism. No, the purpose is to crush dissent.  And the sad fact is US Federal law enforcement is systematically killing key leaders and influencers in each movement with a renewed Cointelpro style harassment campaign.  I know this sounds incredible, but this is a repeat of what happened in the Vietnam War. Mark Twain said history doesn&#39;t repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme.</p>

<p>The rhyme here is veteran suicide, only the rhyme now is a lot louder, meaning there are a lot more forced veteran suicides.  I will state here, for all US Federal law enforcement to see, that there is a harassment program right now in the United States to kill veterans who oppose the wars or who speak about the atrocities they have committed.  Jacob David George is probably the most famous victim.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.popularresistance.org/another-casualty-of-war-jacob-george-rip/">https://www.popularresistance.org/another-casualty-of-war-jacob-george-rip/</a></p>

<p>The same forced suicide program is being run for internet freedom advocates, the most famous being Aaron Swartz.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rt.com/usa/aaron-swartz-funeral-chicago-059/">http://www.rt.com/usa/aaron-swartz-funeral-chicago-059/</a></p>

<p>And reporters are being targeted as well.  In this car accident, somehow the engine of Michael Hastings car was found out of the vehicle, more than 200 feet away.  This never happens in a car accident.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.metabunk.org/debunked-michael-hastings-crash-engine-found-north-of-crash-going-south.t1964/">https://www.metabunk.org/debunked-michael-hastings-crash-engine-found-north-of-crash-going-south.t1964/</a></p>

<p>And lastly, active shooters like Myron May and Aaron Alexis both reported harassment before they lashed out violently.</p>

<p><a href="http://memoryholeblog.com/2014/11/21/fsu-shooting-was-myron-may-a-targeted-individual/">http://memoryholeblog.com/2014/11/21/fsu-shooting-was-myron-may-a-targeted-individual/</a></p>

<p>And sometimes, suspected leakers are whistleblowers are targeted.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtGfTkJtCeo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtGfTkJtCeo</a></p>

<p>And finally, defenders of civil liberties which include all the NSA whistleblowers and innocent, concerned Americans such as myself.</p>

<p>The Disposition Matrix for Americans is real.  And I am not sure even Congress can stop it.  But Congressional reform of the Intelligence Community is our only chance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t want to pull one request at a time through the firewall like PRISM does.  That is an interactive, Web system.  They want to cross reference your fingerprint with all the crime databases nationally and internationally. Let&#39;s say you had a DUI five years ago.  If you blow the whistle tomorrow, they can tell the press you are a drunk within two minutes of the press calling them for comment.  It is all about discrediting potential whistleblowers in advance - a proactive strategy.  PRISM is more of a deep dive tool for an analyst to really scrap up dirt on you from a very large number of data sources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is apparent to anyone with a brain that there are groups of radicalized extremists within the government who are OBVIOUSLY and blatantly subverting US law and order - who use their positions to terrorize and harm Americans, because these people (terrorists) are criminals and want to harm and target other people. They seem to be infiltrating secret agencies, military agencies, and &#39;law enforcement&#39; agencies - we can see this from the behavior of individuals and groups within these services. If they were not terrorists - they would not be acting like terrorists - but they are.</p>

<p>Even talking about it online might be dangerous, as these terrorists let everyone know that they are tracking all communications between Americans. Their former employees like Edward Snowden try to warn us after they realize it&#39;s criminal behavior and terrorist/radical extremism/anti-americanism that they cannot in good conscience participate in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes the bankers, or the oil markets writer in New Jersey.  Yes, a very rich, young investment banker with a beautiful wife and kid jumps off a roof with restricted access and a 10 foot fence.  It is as real as toast folks.
