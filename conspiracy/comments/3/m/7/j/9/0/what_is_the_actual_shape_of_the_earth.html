        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.&quot; - Aristotle</p>

<p>It takes a certain mindset to ever begin questioning something as ubiquitous as the shape of the earth, given the 12 years of <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3a6agc/education/">government indoctrination we receive</a>. Despite NASA being a military organization with secrets classified under national security, few ever scrutinize any of NASA&#39;s claims, instead accepting everything at face value. Even to those who have seen NIST&#39;s fraudulent report of the obvious controlled demolition of the 3 buildings that were destroyed on 9/11/2001, NASA represents an ideal that could never lie to us, because they represent our hopes and dreams.</p>

<p><strong>The thing about the truth is it doesn&#39;t matter who questions it or why</strong>; after all the investigation, the truth will remain if it is pursued honestly. Do you trust yourself to attempt to figure out the shape of the Earth? Where would you start?</p>

<p>Like me, you haven&#39;t seen a curved horizon with your own eyes, nor do you feel any spinning motion right now. With what extraordinary evidence were you convinced that contrary to your senses, you&#39;re actually on a ball spinning at thousands of miles per hour?</p>

<p>Here is a brief list of reproducible observations that contradict a spinning ball in space:</p>

<p>1) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Ei7ZZsVDM">The horizon is flat and remains at eye level when you increase altitude</a>.</p>

<p>2) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPGW9bIx_e8">All amateur attempts</a> to reach as high an altitude as possible show a flat horizon at heights NASA material shows curvature.</p>

<p>3) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afsb39_6QF0">The constellations in the night sky can be photographed slowly rotating around Polaris, the Pole star</a>.</p>

<p>4) <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/35bkup/surveyors_engineers_and_architects_are_never/">Railroads span hundreds and even thousands of miles without taking into account any curvature</a>.</p>

<p>5) <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/35c86b/airplane_pilots_and_sea_navigators_fly_and_sail/">Sailors navigate by plane sailing</a>, mathematically assuming a Flat Earth to compute their heading.</p>

<p>6) <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/35q8m7/the_statue_of_liberty_in_new_york_stands_326_feet/">Lighthouses can be seen at distances that should be occluded by curvature</a>, with countless examples such as <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bioem/flat_earth_proof_this_is_70_miles_from_jupiter/">Florida from the Bahamas, 70 miles away</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8eIuT-nSAs">Chicago across Lake Michigan</a>.</p>

<p>7) The Michelson-Morley experiment compared the speed of light in different directions, <em>in an attempt to detect and thus prove the relative motion of the Earth</em>. The heliocentrists claim that the experiment &#39;failed&#39; because it did not detect an &#39;ether&#39;, discarding the evidence that the Earth was stationary and not rotating.</p>

<p>These observations fit much better with a basic version of the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/bCVQG">Flat Earth model</a>. <a href="http://earth.nullschool.net/">Here</a> you can view many useful realtime datasets on different map projections, comparing them on a spherical (orthographical projection) and flat (azimuthal equidistant projection) model. <a href="https://youtu.be/_mfJXp4ePu0?t=12m43s">Here</a> is someone showing you some examples of how the data fits a flat model more cleanly.</p>

<p>In short, the non-curvature of the Earth can be <a href="https://i.imgur.com/IEcAo8G.jpg">independently reproduced by anyone</a> with a little bit of math and real world observations.</p>

<p>For more information, if you&#39;re a reader, <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/earth/za/">literature from over a century ago</a> is still very relevant. If you prefer to watch something,  you can start with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFjG4jpUhQI">feature-length documentary</a> that will prime you on the subject, and there are many more that you can discover.  In short, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/PyaY8gn.jpg">Flat Earth is flat.</a></p>

<p>The ring of Antarctica is the limit of our current knowledge, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Treaty_System">the combined militaries of the world will stop you from any further exploration.</a> In a century of constant warfare, this is the only thing they can agree on. NASA was created to continue the spherical Lie and everything they put out is a hoax, starting with Operation Paperclip&#39;s Dr. Werner Von Braun&#39;s phallus rocket fetish. The higher in altitude you climb, the lower the density of the air and the less effective rocket propulsion becomes. NASA has not gone to low-earth orbit or any higher because <a href="https://imgur.com/a/3qri3">rocketry does not work in a vacuum</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some other hoaxes that are used to prop up the heliocentrist mythology:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Coriolis Effect: The rotation of small scale liquids in opposing hemispheres is identical. The patterns that heliocentrists claim as proof of a coriolis effect in large scale bodies of water look much more realistic when viewed in a <a href="https://youtu.be/_mfJXp4ePu0?t=12m43s">flat instead of spherical projection</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Foucalt pendulums: These do not uniformly swing in any one direction; they can be found spinning in every direction, often in the exact opposite direction of any supposed rotation of the Earth.</p></li>
<li><p>GPS: GPS, a US government program, is done via ground-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_station">repeater towers</a>. Electro-magnetic signals weaken proportional with the square of distance from the source, and thus the sources of these signals cannot be hundreds of miles overhead with limited power sources but are instead the nearby towers, a few dozen miles away at most and powered off of the enormous power grid.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Obligatory &quot;why is this a conspiracy&quot;: If you believe in a spherical earth, you literally believe down is up and up is down. You have been indoctrinated into a state of helpless ignorance; you are already a slave to lies in your mind, completely lost, and easily controlled.</p>

<p>&quot;The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.&quot; - Alvin Toffler</p>

<p>EDIT: I pointed out the disparity between how many comments this topic attracts versus the number of downvotes on the post <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3m82qz/where_theres_smoke_theres_fire_another_flat_earth/">here</a>, which was then removed after also generating the same pattern of high comments, 0 points.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol!</p>

<p>No, the sun, if it were indeed a few thousand miles away, would appear bigger, then smaller, but it would still be visible ABOVE the horizon, since it is, you know, IN THE SKY and bright as fuck - much like in the case of the northern cap. </p>

<p>Which brings me to the most important counter argument to the whole Flat Earth bullshit.</p>

<p>If the earth is indeed flat, and the Antarctica is the ice wall that prevents us from falling off, then how can you explain 6-month days on the Southern Pole and on Antarctica?</p>

<p>Antarctica has to be all around the flat earth, yet for 6 months you can see the sun on the low horizon from ANY point on the Antarctic continent, I&#39;ll demonstrate it on a little diagram for you, so that you can fully understand the concept.</p>

<p>That statement is a double-edged sword.  <em>You</em> clearly have no experience with things of this size, but basic math can tell you how it would appear if your claim was accurate.  (That is to say, smaller as it gets &quot;farther away&quot; if in fact it were a spot light with limited light coverage.)</p>

<p>Refraction.  The same reason the sky appears blue during the day, and a colorful sunset in the evening.  It also explains the temperature difference in winter and summer due to the Earth&#39;s tilt, imagine that.</p>

<p>Clearly there are parts math and science that is believed, as it is used (incorrectly, generally) in attempt to disprove a globe.  Yet at the same time denied if the concepts are above a basic level of understanding.  A fascinating perpetual flip-flop.</p>

<p>Aside from tightly controlled research facilities, you cannot just go visit Antarctica.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit. You can take a cruise to the <a href="http://www.polarcruises.com/antarctica/destinations/ross-sea-region">Ross Sea</a>. <a href="http://www.victory-cruises.com/sail_antarctica.html">This cruise</a> will specifically allow you to experience the midnight sun in Antarctica. You idiots keep telling us that the Antarctic is patrolled and off-limits, but here in the real world there are any number of cruise companies that will happily take you there.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t trust the cruise companies, you can always charter a yacht and take a trip down there yourself. You don&#39;t even have to go all the way to the Pole. At 66 degrees, you will get to see a full 24 hours of daylight at the Summer solstice.</p>

<p>So, what&#39;s stopping you?</p>

<p>They are more truthful than a dogmatic priest. They actively try to prove themselves wrong and find out more about the nature of reality by conducting actual study that is heavily scrutinized and attempted to be replicated by many other people. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t just generalize scientists as being atheist and selfish...</p>

<p>If the atmosphere is held in tow by this down directional and spatially proportional force you call gravity, what force gives it the angular momentum to hold in perfect alignment to earths independent surface as it spins 1000 miles an hour? </p>

<p>I mean, it&#39;s so simple right?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not &quot;Science.&quot;  Those are shills.</p>

<p>What I mean is, do you understand things like F=ma, inertia, that sort of stuff?  </p>

To answer your next question about why the upper atmosphere doesn&#39;t at the same rate increase, google atmospheric boundary layer, and begin to read.  There is obviously no convincing you otherwise, and I admire that you attack this subject so passionately, but there is a basic misunderstanding of fluid dynamics at the core of your argument.  For example...put water in a glass, and start spinning the glass.  What happens to the water? Now remember what i said earlier about air being a &quot;fluid&quot; under the same properties as water...that is why our atmosphere is spinning.  Viscous drag and Newton&#39;s law of inertia.  </p>

<p>Do you take into account spin when landing? Do you have different amounts of fuel and flight time depending on if you are flying with the Earth&#39;s spin or without it?</p>

<p>No, you basically fly exactly as if there were no spin whatsoever. If you keep asking questions trying to get at an answer here as to why you can&#39;t detect spin, you&#39;ll eventually be told it&#39;s &quot;all relative&quot; and &quot;gravity&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>WOAH THERE!  You are making very broad assumptions about a subject that is very, very complicated.  Flight planning takes in A HUGE amount of factors to compute things such as optimal altitude, speed, and route.  I am happy to talk about this stuff for days because I think it is fascinating!<br/>
  As far as your questions, I would reference straight back to what i said originally.  As a pilot, all you are concerned about is the airmass in which you are flying.  Think of a fish in a fish bowl.  Now what if that entire airmass (fishbowl) was slid over the ground?  Now you have a GROUNDSPEED different than your AIRSPEED.  The speed of the airmass moving around your wings is measured by by a comparison of static barometric pressure, to the pressure measured by forced air into a probe.  This is called your airspeed, and it is the ONLY speed that really matters, as planes all stop flying at a particular AIRSPEED, (this is actually a little more complicated, and really has more to do with a term called angle of attack), but that gives you the gist.<br/>
  Now as i mentioned before, think of the &quot;airmass&quot; as contained in a fishbowl for this example.  I mentioned, &quot;what if you move the fishbowl over the ground&quot;....well....wait for it.... WIND!  this is called wind!!! you can feel it on your face when you are standing, if the airmass you are standing in is moving around you.  That is why airplanes also have a GROUNDSPEED, which can be vastly different that their airspeed, depending on how fast, and in which direction the airmass they are traveling in is heading.  Once during training i managed to have a negative groundspeed!! The plane i was flying was able to fly at about 65 knots safety, and the headwind (or airmass moving the opposite direction as i was going) was greater than 65knots at the altitude i was at.  I could look down, and see myself moving backwards relative to the ground.
  As far as flying as if &quot;there is no spin whatsoever&quot;... I very much fly differently depending on how that airmass is moving over the ground, especially during the moments where i want to stop flying, and begin driving ;) and vice versa.  </p>

<p>This was very long winded, but I hope it helps clarify my thoughts on the subject.  </p>

<p>Then when does it compute for the air mass moving against the Earth (i.e. when you are flying in the other direction)?</p>

<p>It&#39;s ok, you don&#39;t have to make that many responses, I know the answer is no, they don&#39;t account for spin whatsoever.</p>

<p>An indoctrinated mind does not know that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aristotle provided physical and observational arguments supporting the idea of a spherical Earth:</p>

<p>•    Every portion of the Earth tends toward the center until by compression and convergence they form a sphere. (De caelo, 297a9–21)</p>

<p>•    Travelers going south see southern constellations rise higher above the horizon; and</p>

<p>•    The shadow of Earth on the Moon during a lunar eclipse is round. (De caelo, 297b31–298a10).</p>

<p>The concepts of symmetry, equilibrium and cyclic repetition permeated Aristotle&#39;s work. In his Meteorology he divided the world into five climatic zones: two temperate areas separated by a torrid zone near the equator, and two cold inhospitable regions, &quot;one near our upper or northern pole and the other near the ... southern pole,&quot; both impenetrable and girdled with ice (Meteorologica, 362a31–35). Although no humans could survive in the frigid zones, inhabitants in the southern temperate regions could exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the burden of proof falls on them to prove the earth is not spherical.  Because there&#39;s already plenty of actual proof that it is round.  Also basic gravitational physics tells us that massive objects such as planets pull there molten (or once molten) material inwards towards the planet&#39;s center into the shape of a sphere. Although they are not perfectly spherical due to rotation they are close enough to be considered spheres.  Praise Neil Degrasse Tyson! </p>

By the way, if it is flat what is on the flip side of our earth coin so to speak? How do you explain the countless photos from high earth orbit that show a round earth?  Explain where earths magnetic field comes from if not our dynamic core, if its flat there can be no core correct?  Why hasn&#39;t anyone drilled through to the other side of your flat earth? The video I linked may be invalid as proof because the distortion of lens used,  but this entire theory of a flat earth is invalid because it can be disproven time and time again.   </p>

<p>Are you mental, how exactly would you fake space? Really I want to know how.  So every time I watch a rocket launch from my backyard (I live by KSC) what happens? They just ditch the thing in ocean when it&#39;s out of sight?  How does GPS work? Why are there tides if not for the moon? Why hasn&#39;t anyone sailed off the edge?  How do you explain the day/night cycles at the poles as apposed to the equator?  If the earth was flat day/night cycles would be the same at the poles as they are at the equator. </p>

<p>Face it, your whole theory is complete nonsense! </p>

<p>That&#39;s not &quot;Science.&quot;  Those are shills.</p>

<p>What I mean is, do you understand things like F=ma, inertia, that sort of stuff?  </p>

<p>Because what you&#39;ve asked is basically, &quot;If the earth surface is moving 1,000 mph, why don&#39;t I fall down?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That just isn&#39;t true..</p>

<p>Many scientists <em>do</em> believe in God, just most of them in a spiritual, non-religious way, like pantheism without making a thing of it. Some are religious also.</p>

<p>They are more truthful than a dogmatic priest. They actively try to prove themselves wrong and find out more about the nature of reality by conducting actual study that is heavily scrutinized and attempted to be replicated by many other people. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t just generalize scientists as being atheist and selfish...</p>

<p>At least scientists study natural phenomenon in very controlled studies to test theories about reality and say they&#39;re wrong when they&#39;re wrong, than priests who act like messengers of God for ancient cultural belief systems and take everything on faith. </p>

<p>Who actually gets things done? Who made the computer you&#39;re using?</p>
