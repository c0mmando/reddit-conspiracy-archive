       "It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it." - Aristotle
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes a certain mindset to ever begin questioning something as ubiquitous as the shape of the earth, given the 12 years of
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3a6agc/education/">
        government indoctrination we receive
       </a>
       . Despite NASA being a military organization with secrets classified under national security, few ever scrutinize any of NASA's claims, instead accepting everything at face value. Even to those who have seen NIST's fraudulent report of the obvious controlled demolition of the 3 buildings that were destroyed on 9/11/2001, NASA represents an ideal that could never lie to us, because they represent our hopes and dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The thing about the truth is it doesn't matter who questions it or why
       </strong>
       ; after all the investigation, the truth will remain if it is pursued honestly. Do you trust yourself to attempt to figure out the shape of the Earth? Where would you start?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like me, you haven't seen a curved horizon with your own eyes, nor do you feel any spinning motion right now. With what extraordinary evidence were you convinced that contrary to your senses, you're actually on a ball spinning at thousands of miles per hour?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a brief list of reproducible observations that contradict a spinning ball in space:
      </p>
      <p>
       1)
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Ei7ZZsVDM">
        The horizon is flat and remains at eye level when you increase altitude
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       2)
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPGW9bIx_e8">
        All amateur attempts
       </a>
       to reach as high an altitude as possible show a flat horizon at heights NASA material shows curvature.
      </p>
      <p>
       3)
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afsb39_6QF0">
        The constellations in the night sky can be photographed slowly rotating around Polaris, the Pole star
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       4)
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/35bkup/surveyors_engineers_and_architects_are_never/">
        Railroads span hundreds and even thousands of miles without taking into account any curvature
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>

        Sailors navigate by plane sailing
       </a>
       , mathematically assuming a Flat Earth to compute their heading.
      </p>
      <p>
       6)
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/35q8m7/the_statue_of_liberty_in_new_york_stands_326_feet/">
        Lighthouses can be seen at distances that should be occluded by curvature
       </a>
       , with countless examples such as
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bioem/flat_earth_proof_this_is_70_miles_from_jupiter/">
        Florida from the Bahamas, 70 miles away
       </a>
       , and
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8eIuT-nSAs">
        Chicago across Lake Michigan
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       7) The Michelson-Morley experiment compared the speed of light in different directions,
       <em>
        in an attempt to detect and thus prove the relative motion of the Earth
       </em>
       . The heliocentrists claim that the experiment 'failed' because it did not detect an 'ether', discarding the evidence that the Earth was stationary and not rotating.
      </p>
      <p>
       These observations fit much better with a basic version of the
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/bCVQG">
        Flat Earth model
       </a>
       .
       <a href="http://earth.nullschool.net/">
        Here
       </a>
       you can view many useful realtime datasets on different map projections, comparing them on a spherical (orthographical projection) and flat (azimuthal equidistant projection) model.
       <a href="https://youtu.be/_mfJXp4ePu0?t=12m43s">
        Here
       </a>
       is someone showing you some examples of how the data fits a flat model more cleanly.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, the non-curvature of the Earth can be
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/IEcAo8G.jpg">
        independently reproduced by anyone
       </a>
       with a little bit of math and real world observations.

       <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/earth/za/">

       is still very relevant. If you prefer to watch something,  you can start with a

        the combined militaries of the world will stop you from any further exploration.
       </a>
       In a century of constant warfare, this is the only thing they can agree on. NASA was created to continue the spherical Lie and everything they put out is a hoax, starting with Operation Paperclip's Dr. Werner Von Braun's phallus rocket fetish. The higher in altitude you climb, the lower the density of the air and the less effective rocket propulsion becomes. NASA has not gone to low-earth orbit or any higher because
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/3qri3">

      <p>
       Here are some other hoaxes that are used to prop up the heliocentrist mythology:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Coriolis Effect: The rotation of small scale liquids in opposing hemispheres is identical. The patterns that heliocentrists claim as proof of a coriolis effect in large scale bodies of water look much more realistic when viewed in a
         <a href="https://youtu.be/_mfJXp4ePu0?t=12m43s">
          flat instead of spherical projection
         </a>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Foucalt pendulums: These do not uniformly swing in any one direction; they can be found spinning in every direction, often in the exact opposite direction of any supposed rotation of the Earth.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         GPS: GPS, a US government program, is done via ground-based
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_station">
          repeater towers
         </a>
         . Electro-magnetic signals weaken proportional with the square of distance from the source, and thus the sources of these signals cannot be hundreds of miles overhead with limited power sources but are instead the nearby towers, a few dozen miles away at most and powered off of the enormous power grid.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Obligatory "why is this a conspiracy": If you believe in a spherical earth, you literally believe down is up and up is down. You have been indoctrinated into a state of helpless ignorance; you are already a slave to lies in your mind, completely lost, and easily controlled.

       If it's a few thousand miles away at most, then why do we not see it in the sky after the sunset and it 'disappears' under the horizon?

      <p>
       If the Earth is indeed flat, it should be visible at all times, only slightly smaller, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       It should be also getting smaller as it's about to set, and bigger as it's rising.

       Just because something is very large and very high, doesn't mean it can't move past your visible horizon.

       Why does night fall gradually over the land as a dimming of the light?

       Reasonably speaking, the shadow of the earth should sweep across the land.

       It doesn't

      <p>
       And why does the sun arc across the sky?

      <p>
       If it's as far away as they say, it should always form a perfectly straight line through the sky from horizon to horizon.

       No, the sun, if it were indeed a few thousand miles away, would appear bigger, then smaller, but it would still be visible ABOVE the horizon, since it is, you know, IN THE SKY and bright as fuck - much like in the case of the northern cap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which brings me to the most important counter argument to the whole Flat Earth bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the earth is indeed flat, and the Antarctica is the ice wall that prevents us from falling off, then how can you explain 6-month days on the Southern Pole and on Antarctica?
      </p>
      <p>
       Antarctica has to be all around the flat earth, yet for 6 months you can see the sun on the low horizon from ANY point on the Antarctic continent, I'll demonstrate it on a little diagram for you, so that you can fully understand the concept.

       You are meaning to say that when you are at the black spot, you can somehow magically see the sun throughout the day, when the rest of the world only see it for a couple of hours, and it's invisible at the center of the flat earth?

       clearly have no experience with things of this size, but basic math can tell you how it would appear if your claim was accurate.  (That is to say, smaller as it gets "farther away" if in fact it were a spot light with limited light coverage.)

       Refraction.  The same reason the sky appears blue during the day, and a colorful sunset in the evening.  It also explains the temperature difference in winter and summer due to the Earth's tilt, imagine that.

       It sure makes it more difficult to discern between trolls and ignorance.  What I find scary is the seemingly blind trust given to YouTube content over the maths and sciences and anyone in those fields.

      <p>
       Clearly there are parts math and science that is believed, as it is used (incorrectly, generally) in attempt to disprove a globe.  Yet at the same time denied if the concepts are above a basic level of understanding.  A fascinating perpetual flip-flop.

       What is "eye level" in a video?  Depends on the camera person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would I need to see a video depicting something I've experienced for myself?  I've flown around at 2,000 feet.  The horizon is below eye level while you are in level flight.

       You need a wider viewing angle to see it.  I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure they say you need 60 degrees to view the Earth's curve from something as close as a plane.  Most cameras probably won't have a wide angle lens on them.

       Ooo, a pilot. If the Earth is rotating at thousands of miles per hour, how does that not affect your landing? Why don't you have to compensate for that when you land?
      </p>
      <p>
       Shouldn't it take more fuel to fly 'against' the rotation than 'with' the rotation?

       I can't wait for the answer "the atmosphere is rotating". With what energy does the upper atmosphere 'accelerate' in order to

       Because of relativity to the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Astronauts on the ISS are traveling at 17,000 mph along with the station, that's why when they do space walks they are barely moving
       <em>
        relative
       </em>
       to the station.
      </p>
      <p>
       You sitting down right now, relative to earth you are not moving. But relative to the Sun, or a fixed position between here and the moon, you are moving over a thousand miles an hour. You don't feel it because of how gravity works. You don't understand it so you think something is wrong. Ignorance to physics, as well as paranoia, are the recipe for these theories to exist
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't even say the ISS is a hoax, that is delusional. Thousands of people all over the world contribute to its operation. There is no conspiracy because there isn't a reason to have one.

       Just read a brief summary of "dark matter."

       The universal constant that they invented (and still can't prove even exists) out of necessity to make gravitation work in a macrocosmic universe.

       Every practical example of "gravity" here on Earth is just as easily explained by density.

       You're right, at least priests had the decency to say that they were the messengers of God.

       Scientists take it one step further. There is no God and they are the arbiters of truth.

       That just isn't true..
      </p>
      <p>
       Many scientists
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       believe in God, just most of them in a spiritual, non-religious way, like pantheism without making a thing of it. Some are religious also.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are more truthful than a dogmatic priest. They actively try to prove themselves wrong and find out more about the nature of reality by conducting actual study that is heavily scrutinized and attempted to be replicated by many other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't just generalize scientists as being atheist and selfish...
      </p>
      <p>
       At least scientists study natural phenomenon in very controlled studies to test theories about reality and say they're wrong when they're wrong, than priests who act like messengers of God for ancient cultural belief systems and take everything on faith.

       If the atmosphere is held in tow by this down directional and spatially proportional force you call gravity, what force gives it the angular momentum to hold in perfect alignment to earths independent surface as it spins 1000 miles an hour?

       Friction implies there is a difference in the rotational speeds, which arguably one would expect.
      </p>
      <p>
       No such friction is observed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, the notion that the wind blows regularly, and quite forcefully, in the direction directly opposing the spin, and in other places, with the spin, negates this theory altogether.

       That's not "Science."  Those are shills.

       What I mean is, do you understand things like F=ma, inertia, that sort of stuff?

      <p>
       And that has nothing to do with corporate shills, vaccines, or GMOs.  It has to do with you not understanding basic actual science.

       If I said he was disrupting normal conversation for his own purposes, would that be a violation? Because I won't stop calling him a troll til he stops calling me a shill, and he does so in so many words at nearly every turn. If he can get away with it by being the least bit ambiguous about it, I intend to do the same. Just being honest.

       Because I am flying in an "airmass".  It actually follows the exact same properties as fluid, hence fluid dynamics.  It matters not how fast we are moving through space, simply how fast the airmass is flowing over the wings.

       viscous drag causes the atmosphere to rotate.  To answer your next question about why the upper atmosphere doesn't at the same rate increase, google atmospheric boundary layer, and begin to read.  There is obviously no convincing you otherwise, and I admire that you attack this subject so passionately, but there is a basic misunderstanding of fluid dynamics at the core of your argument.  For example...put water in a glass, and start spinning the glass.  What happens to the water? Now remember what i said earlier about air being a "fluid" under the same properties as water...that is why our atmosphere is spinning.  Viscous drag and Newton's law of inertia.

       If the atmosphere is spinning, then flying with the spin should require less time and less fuel than flying against the spin, and either way the spin will need to be taken into account when landing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you take into account spin when landing? Do you have different amounts of fuel and flight time depending on if you are flying with the Earth's spin or without it?
      </p>
      <p>
       No, you basically fly exactly as if there were no spin whatsoever. If you keep asking questions trying to get at an answer here as to why you can't detect spin, you'll eventually be told it's "all relative" and "gravity".

       WOAH THERE!  You are making very broad assumptions about a subject that is very, very complicated.  Flight planning takes in A HUGE amount of factors to compute things such as optimal altitude, speed, and route.  I am happy to talk about this stuff for days because I think it is fascinating!
       <br/>
       As far as your questions, I would reference straight back to what i said originally.  As a pilot, all you are concerned about is the airmass in which you are flying.  Think of a fish in a fish bowl.  Now what if that entire airmass (fishbowl) was slid over the ground?  Now you have a GROUNDSPEED different than your AIRSPEED.  The speed of the airmass moving around your wings is measured by by a comparison of static barometric pressure, to the pressure measured by forced air into a probe.  This is called your airspeed, and it is the ONLY speed that really matters, as planes all stop flying at a particular AIRSPEED, (this is actually a little more complicated, and really has more to do with a term called angle of attack), but that gives you the gist.
       <br/>
       Now as i mentioned before, think of the "airmass" as contained in a fishbowl for this example.  I mentioned, "what if you move the fishbowl over the ground"....well....wait for it.... WIND!  this is called wind!!! you can feel it on your face when you are standing, if the airmass you are standing in is moving around you.  That is why airplanes also have a GROUNDSPEED, which can be vastly different that their airspeed, depending on how fast, and in which direction the airmass they are traveling in is heading.  Once during training i managed to have a negative groundspeed!! The plane i was flying was able to fly at about 65 knots safety, and the headwind (or airmass moving the opposite direction as i was going) was greater than 65knots at the altitude i was at.  I could look down, and see myself moving backwards relative to the ground.
  As far as flying as if "there is no spin whatsoever"... I very much fly differently depending on how that airmass is moving over the ground, especially during the moments where i want to stop flying, and begin driving ;) and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was very long winded, but I hope it helps clarify my thoughts on the subject.

       They most definitely do compute for headwinds when flying west.  You're one screw loose my friend.  I don't know how else to explain it to you.  I guess my advice would be to go back to school and actually study physics if you are that passionate and interested in subjects like this.

       <p>
        If you believe in a spherical earth, you literally believe down is up and up is down. You have been indoctrinated into a state of helpless ignorance; you are already a slave to lies in your mind, completely lost, and easily controlled.
       </p>

       An indoctrinated mind does not know that
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Aristotle provided physical and observational arguments supporting the idea of a spherical Earth:
       </p>
       <p>
        •    Every portion of the Earth tends toward the center until by compression and convergence they form a sphere. (De caelo, 297a9–21)
       </p>
       <p>
        •    Travelers going south see southern constellations rise higher above the horizon; and
       </p>
       <p>
        •    The shadow of Earth on the Moon during a lunar eclipse is round. (De caelo, 297b31–298a10).
       </p>
       <p>
        The concepts of symmetry, equilibrium and cyclic repetition permeated Aristotle's work. In his Meteorology he divided the world into five climatic zones: two temperate areas separated by a torrid zone near the equator, and two cold inhospitable regions, "one near our upper or northern pole and the other near the ... southern pole," both impenetrable and girdled with ice (Meteorologica, 362a31–35). Although no humans could survive in the frigid zones, inhabitants in the southern temperate regions could exist.

       Yes, the burden of proof falls on them to prove the earth is not spherical.  Because there's already plenty of actual proof that it is round.  Also basic gravitational physics tells us that massive objects such as planets pull there molten (or once molten) material inwards towards the planet's center into the shape of a sphere. Although they are not perfectly spherical due to rotation they are close enough to be considered spheres.  Praise Neil Degrasse Tyson!

       Most cameras do not come with a wide view lens, which is needed to see the curve of the earth from such a close distance, such as an airplane.  Not to mention, since you claim the lens is curved in the videos, how do we know the others aren't altered as well?  There are a many of effects that could be used to make it look like a flat horizon, for instance not having a wide enough lens.

       That's because your argument is ironclad and he can't win, so he has to slide the conversation away to where he can just claim victory.

       Ouch.  Making fun of someone for using an old image.  So you have a false idea of the earth that is 2000 year olds, but you make fun of me for that?  Laughable.  And the size of it, now you are just rushing to critique something while still avoiding to retaliate anything relevant.  I applaud your mastery of the debate style I named "Fox" style.  The way you derail the conversation, put words in my mouth, and just completely ignore replies is in tune with Fox news so well.  You should really look into it as a career.  Also that is the second time I posted that on reddit, I'm sure you have the time to read through my replies to fact check me, the first time was when someone on ask reddit was curious what I think people on reddit look like.  Nice try again to derail the conversation though.  People like you are the reason flat earth get's downvoted and can't take it seriously.  Well that and the fact it is a completely ignorant thought.

       Do you not realize that's exactly what you did in the previous reply? To be honest I don't care how I strike you.  The only reason I use fox news is because I'm from the south where majority of people watch it so CNN and MSNBC aren't seen or heard nearly as much.

       Excluding the fact I can still see the waves which probably means it isn't really that high.  For all I know this picture is from parasailing really high.  Also do you have any proof that it is in fact a wide angle lens?  I've poked more holes in this one theory than there were in my dad's condom.

       Ok fair point, I didn't take into account the fish eye lens.  Still doesn't change the fact that earth is spherical.  By the way, if it is flat what is on the flip side of our earth coin so to speak? How do you explain the countless photos from high earth orbit that show a round earth?  Explain where earths magnetic field comes from if not our dynamic core, if its flat there can be no core correct?  Why hasn't anyone drilled through to the other side of your flat earth? The video I linked may be invalid as proof because the distortion of lens used,  but this entire theory of a flat earth is invalid because it can be disproven time and time again.

       Are you mental, how exactly would you fake space? Really I want to know how.  So every time I watch a rocket launch from my backyard (I live by KSC) what happens? They just ditch the thing in ocean when it's out of sight?  How does GPS work? Why are there tides if not for the moon? Why hasn't anyone sailed off the edge?  How do you explain the day/night cycles at the poles as apposed to the equator?  If the earth was flat day/night cycles would be the same at the poles as they are at the equator.

       Face it, your whole theory is complete nonsense!

       Haha sorry man but you were right the first time. Every single scientist (the people who measure the world) agree that it is not flat, and a guy who made the video on the internet is not smarter or has more data than the scientists. You have been taken for a fool.

       I cant tell if you are serious or an elaborate troll, Do you understand that rails are made of relatively flexible steel in relatively short lengths and that you beat the rails into the ground with spikes? If you do that, the rails create a very slight curve that conforms to the earths surface

       That Lake Superior video is utter bullshit. They don't even have the right lake. It's Lake Michigan Chicago is on. Lake Superior is far to the north. I've seen the weird illusions on the lake and It actually is a good argument for the earth being round. Not to mention the reverse mirage is one of the coolest things I've seen in a while. 
Spending my time watching that video was the most painfully stupid event I've ever had to go through. So many inconsistencies and logical fallacies, if you believe this crap there is no hope for changing your mind

       That's not "Science."  Those are shills.

       What I mean is, do you understand things like F=ma, inertia, that sort of stuff?

       And that has nothing to do with corporate shills, vaccines, or GMOs.  It has to do with you not understanding basic actual science.

       That just isn't true..

      <p>
       Many scientists
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       believe in God, just most of them in a spiritual, non-religious way, like pantheism without making a thing of it. Some are religious also.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are more truthful than a dogmatic priest. They actively try to prove themselves wrong and find out more about the nature of reality by conducting actual study that is heavily scrutinized and attempted to be replicated by many other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't just generalize scientists as being atheist and selfish...
      </p>
      <p>
       At least scientists study natural phenomenon in very controlled studies to test theories about reality and say they're wrong when they're wrong, than priests who act like messengers of God for ancient cultural belief systems and take everything on faith.

       Because you don't believe the evidence. THAT is why you need to test it yourself. We don't need to add one more because everyone who isn't a moron agrees based on the evidence. But you don't want to believe it, so you
       <em>
        choose
       </em>
       not to believe empirical evidence, so we suggest you do it yourself, so you can see for yourself and there will be no bullshit excuses about the lens.
