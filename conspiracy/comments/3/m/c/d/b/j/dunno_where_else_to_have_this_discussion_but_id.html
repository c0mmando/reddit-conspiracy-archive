       After formal introductions, Pope Francis turned around, shook the hand of a smiling Joe Biden and the turned to Boehner.  Boehner shook his hand and, with a kind of over-compensatory arrogance said to the Pope, "Good luck" as if this speech was meant to win something.  Pope Francis didn't respond verbally, instead hung his head slightly, an expression of disappointment coming over his face like a parent catching their child in a lie, hoping they'll admit to it themselves before someone else calls them out.  The Pope then turned to begin his speech and, almost immediately, Boehner burst into tears.
      </p>
      <p>
       Normally, I wouldn't think much of such a thing, dismissing it as a melodramatic person at best letting their emotions get the best of them, at worst trying to shift focus away from someone else threatening to steal their spotlight.  With the news of Boehner resigning, though, it gained a certain significance in my opinion.  I enjoy reading into things (sometimes a little too much) and acknowledge that the Pope's speech was little more than pretty words followed up with little to no action on the part of both the speaker and his audience but something tells me this was a significant moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it be at this moment that Boehner finally realized the team he's playing for, maybe even becoming aware of his role in a force darker than he may have originally intended?  I imagine some "news" network already talked about this at some point in the last couple of days but i don't watch them so forgive me if this comes across as making a big deal out of nothing, something it may very well be.

       Maybe the Pope sparked some compassion in Boehner and he perhaps finally realized, at the core, what these people in power in front of him, him included, are doing to the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       He hoped the Pope could do the same for Congress, thus the "Good luck".

       I believe Boehner was half in the bag and the Pope picked up on it. Did you see the way the Pope looked back at him again, and lingered for a few seconds while Boehner avoided eye contact? Shameful.

       I watched the address live and I noticed the same thing.  The way Boehner said "good luck," really struck me.  I am glad to see I wasn't the only one that noticed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way he said it implies that there was some object to be achieved.  I am still struggling to put together any sort of theory on what is going on though...

       ive worked and interacted with politicans before on the state and federal level.  i can tell you this: yes the sociopaths exist in congress, but that does NOT mean that every senator and every congressman is ted bundy.  ive never worked with boehnor, and ive only heard him mentioned a few times, but i do know this about him: hes  a devout catholic and has been all his life.   oh, and he cries at the drop of a hat.
      </p>
      <p>
       now, the pope is totes awesome to boehnor, and he even gets brief alone time with the pope before his speech.  nobody knows yet what happened in that meeting, BUT, one of the greatest tools used by the catholic church (and dont attack me here because im a christian too) is guilt.  my guess is boehnor admitted to something he felt a twinge of guilt about and the pope made the disappointed gesture on purpose.  either that or upon meeting the pope, suddenly he was consumed with guilt and the pope, using his guilt-dar picked up on itt, but boehnor said nothing about it, and the pope was truly disappointed.
      </p>
      <p>
       i guess the point im trying to make here is the popes visit and boehnor resigning are clearly related, and it is certainly within the realm of possibility that for once assface boehnor had a change of heart and realized he was doing some terrible things.

       I get what your saying, but I really doubt these two guys are on opposite sides of the field. I mean, the UN is meeting today. They're talking about shit like, idunno ISIS, Israel-Palestine, Iran's Deal; there's a lot going on and of course we don't have any access to what these people know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets examine some facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) John Boehner claims to be a devout Catholic.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The Pope addressed Congress and he resigned the next day.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The government is in danger of shutting down again at the end of October.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) John Boehner's resignation is a huge blow to the Republican Party's dominance in Congress. People like John McCain and George Bush have said it will ensure a Democrat victory in the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Joe Biden is going to "run for president"
      </p>
      <p>
       6) The Syrian Immigrant Crisis is about to start effecting the U.S. much like Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       7) The Pope has a few more days here in the States
      </p>

       I personally keep that one at arms length because I don't understand particle physics enough to educate other people on it and I wouldn't want to give the wrong information. I haven't heard anything about it going full power two days ago, I'm sure we eventually will.

       I think the pope realized Boehner was using him as a tool when he said "good luck".  So the big P-diddy gave bone-dog a stare down to make him feel bad for trying to use the pope as a political tool.  Boehner cried, realizing his lifetime idol was disappointed in him.  He thought about his life more afterwards and planned his resignation.

       or maybe Boehner is just
       <em>
        stupid
       </em>
       ? i'm thinking, he
       <em>
        didn't know
       </em>
       what to say.
