       It's a pretty antagonistic place, on all sides. You're never going to be rid of shills or trolls for any issue, but there are real people out in the muck who take on the mantle of shills or trolls because they see it day in and day out and think that's just how you're supposed to behave.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I wonder, if we all try to raise our level of discourse, do you think it would spread? I mean, obviously the abusive whininess "I know you are but what am I?" kind of discourse is learned via exposure, why couldn't being decent to each other and having real conversations spread, too?

       The majority of us do try and be decent to each other. But there are people (both paid and unpaid) that look to derail that. I've always thought that the most obvious aspect was the fact that if they disagree with us so much why even bother to waste your time coming here and kicking up bullshit. They aren't even coming to change minds by having a reasonable conversation. They just try to discourage distract and derail.

      <p>
       Here's where the assumption breaks: There
       <em>
        is no "us"
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You might believe certain conspiracies. I might believe differing ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're coming in to this sub saying "no conspiracy ever happened, ever, in history" then you're a troll. No one can say sincerely. And really, no one
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       say that.
      </p>
      <p>
       What people say is "
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       theory is bullshit" or "
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       theory is bullshit". But not "
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       theories".
      </p>
      <p>
       So you get 'teams' of people. For instance, you've got some 'truthers' who believe that 9/11 was caused by thermite. Others who argue that it was mini-nukes. Others who argue it was cruise missiles. All these groups disagree with eachother (and when they confront, it's usually vehement and abrasive and very-much brings out at least one group of trolls). But they all agree that a conspiracy happened. That's why they all have a home in this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they're not "us". There is no "us". There is you, and how you feel. And me, and how I feel. This sub does not officially endorse any line of thinking whereby one could say "see, you go to that sub, therefor you must believe X theory" and not be disingenuous.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the flipside, again: There is no us. We don't all agree, so we should never pretend that there is some consensus. Before I get harangued for 'trying to silence the sub', let me just say: If you have honest-to-god evidence of a conspiracy that hasn't been brought up, by all means; Bring it up. I mean if you can
       <em>
        prove beyond the shadow of a doubt
       </em>
       that your conspiracy theory is correct, then you have a moral obligation to attempt to make the guilty parties face justice. That means you shouldn't be here trolling stuff like "downvotes? guess i'm on to something big lols" and then moving to the next thread. It means you should be
       <em>
        lawyering up
       </em>
       , contacting the ACLU, etc etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       in this sub is willing to go that far though (myself included - admittedly, I'm one of those who's simply entertained by all this). Most people here just
       <em>
        enjoy the juicy gossipy stories
       </em>
       . Conspiracy is entertaining. It makes for some great non-fiction, but it can also make for some really great
       <em>
        pure fiction
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why everything here
       <em>
        has to be
       </em>
       taken with a grain of salt. The majority here are just here to be entertained, in one form or another. Whether that be the stories or the drama or the arguing itself. And if the posters here can't be bothered to actually fight battles they can fight within our legal system, why should any of us fight their battles for them in the comments? I dunno. Maybe I'm just not a defeatist, and maybe defeatism is more rampant than I thought. But to me, the common response to this is simply "we can't fight them, they're too powerful" or "anything you can do will be undone later by 'them' again". That's defeatist. That's saying "I won't ever win the game so there's no reason to play". Defeatism, on its face.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow. I got off on a rant. Just having a bit of honest discussion.

       The 911 stuff is weird. I usually stay out of that topic, but last week posted a link to a theory about mini-nukes just to see what people thought about it and what was out there related to it because it was new to me and a couple of users came in and completely lost their shit and went into solid attack dog troll mode.

       There's a lot of disinfo people here, paid or not. But there's also a lot of just plain emotional people too. And people who can't ever admit to being incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Treat everyone the same, I say: With reason and the respect their character deserves. If their character is that of a racist, I'll treat them that way. If they're respectful in their dissenting views, I'll respect them. If they are the type to simply deny basic science at every turn, then I kinda lose all respect: These types are the biggest disinfo agents there are, imo. Flat earth nonsense and similar tripe. They're here to discredit us all. That's their effect, regardless of their true motives.

       You make an excellent point, I hadn't quite thought about it like that. I guess I when I say us I just mean those who are willing to question the official narrative in general, though we may have different theories and opinions, the main theme is critical thinking and a desire to understand and figure out through discussion, why something is the way it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I too have not the means nor the time to try and actually do something about it, but the fact of the matter is that being able to come here and voice my feelings and let my opinions out does a great deal of good to my mental well being. Otherwise I'd be stuck thinking about all the fucked up shit going on and have only myself to talk to.

       Okay I just dug deeper, I looked at the last 500 of your posts/comments and without exception every comment you've had removed has been for calling someone a shill or just outright insulting people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I 100% agree with the removals and would like to ask you to please follow the rules on our sidebar in the future.

      <p>
       Your rule breaking posts actually make this place worse for the wear and in several instances they spawned a flame war that didn't need to happen.

       Look, we all know how selective rule/law enforcement is used in enforcing tyranny. It's obvious what's going on here. You're supporting the limited hangout operation of AE911Truth.

       I never had a problem with this until I stumbled upon the nuclear demolition of WTC on 9/11 and started making posts. It was like a switched got flipped -- I picked up 5 or 6 insta-stalkers, and the whole mod team, including you, turned on me at once.

       Our aim isn't to ban anyone, I try to work with people, often to my own detriment, in hopes that they can learn how to face criticism better.

       Can confirm as well. This placed was taken over 1 1/2 to 2 years ago. Has never been the same. Also, the mods have a database of most of the users here.

       Okay you can down vote me but I must know something.  What do we mods supposedly do with this database of users?  Is there a FEMA camp somewhere with 330,000 plastic coffins?  How deep does this theory go?

       And if that's true, it paints a very different picture of what this place is all about. (And, frankly, I think it's unimaginable that this place would

       You have to contact the Reddit admins to see if you can get your site-wide shadowban reversed.

       So it's cool for
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       to call people trolls. Just not me, especially when they're actual AE911 brigades.

       And if that's true, it paints a very different picture of what this place is all about. (And, frankly, I think it's unimaginable that this place would
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       be controlled opposition.)

       It's just like how 9/11 woke people up to all the bad stuff the government is doing. Once you understand 9/11, suddenly it all makes sense.
