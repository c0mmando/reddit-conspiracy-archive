    <div class="md"><p>I find solace in the words of other truthseekers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People usually think that progress consists in the increase of knowledge, in the improvement of life, but that isn&#39;t so. Progress consists only in the greater clarification of answers to the basic questions of life. The truth is always accessible to a man. It can&#39;t be otherwise, because a man&#39;s soul is a divine spark, the truth itself. It&#39;s only a matter of removing from this divine spark (the truth) everything that obscures it. Progress consists, not in the increase of truth, but in freeing it from its wrappings. The truth is obtained like gold, not by letting it grow bigger, but by washing off from it everything that isn&#39;t gold.</p>

<p>Tolstoy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was the same way for a long time, and to a large extent I still am.  Its VERY easy to focus on negatives when they&#39;re staring you in the face at every turn.  Even things that are disguised and genuine humanitarian movements, such as this whole ordeal with &#39;Syrian&#39; refugees; if you&#39;re awake and aware you recognize the lies and slander even in these cases.</p>

<p>And so I&#39;ve taken to recognizing the fact that we can&#39;t RELY on the outside world to bring us happiness and comfort.  Real happiness comes from within, and we have to generate it on our own.  Recognize the bad, but also try and recognize the good.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing in this world that can crush the genuine human spirit, no matter how hard the psychopathic elite try.  Each of us at our core is a pristine, pure, and untouchable being of light which is not subject to the ups and downs of the world, although we can partake in them if we choose.  I CERTAINLY don&#39;t think avoiding the world is the right choice, but we have to recognize that we are in complete control.</p>

<p>If we let them cloud our minds with illusions to the degree that we lose sight of ourselves, and consequently lose joy in our lives, they win.  We&#39;ve been defeated and the human spirit is burried under a thick layer of sludge.  </p>

<p>Take some time to wipe your mirror clean.  Practice meditation - it really works.  Generate your own happiness from within and spread it wherever you go.  Live genuinely and be in the moment.  Don&#39;t let the world control you - you control it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Recently I had a conversation at the bus stop with my neighbor. She had no idea of anything current events that were a bit odd and deserved a bit of scrutiny.</p>

<p>She seemed interested about the quantitive easement that our government was doing. Well I suggested a few topics and further reading that I got as comments here when I asked for them.</p>

<p>She said she didn&#39;t care after I sent it all to her. She said she didn&#39;t have time cause her work and kids. Whatever else. The thing is that people for the most part don&#39;t care because they are detached from it.</p>

<p>The shit doesn&#39;t effect a majority of them directly so it doesn&#39;t make them deal with it. So they won&#39;t deal with it. </p>

<p>Why should you feel suicidal for shit because others won&#39;t realize the problems of today? Lose your empathy. It helps man really it does. Get a hobby. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha.... You say I don&#39;t have to. </p>

<p>Gonna tell you a little story. Since reddit loves how people share.</p>

<p>Around the time they were catching the Boston bomber I was really heavy into this subreddit. Like checked it all the time because it seemed that it was cutting edge. </p>

<p>I was actually looking into buying 2 years of MRE, water, and some fuel for the coming apcolypse. Cause damnit I was sure it was going to happen. Well my relationship with my wife and son was hanging by a thread cause I was always so stressed out and just pissed off. </p>

<p>My job was suffering and lots of bad shit. Then one day I &quot;WOKE UP&quot; ! It took an admin to ban me to realize I went too fucking far. I went all the way back to when she was born. Everything I could find on her. Now I never released anything cause she didn&#39;t deserve that. </p>

<p>But I didn&#39;t know who she was. She never warned me just banned me. Well I stopped and cought my breath and said wtf am I doing here. So I realized that reddit and most of all this subreddit perpetuates hate and fear. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t want to be your friend here. No one wants to share an idea or even debate really. They want you to follow them cause they feel they are just so damn smart they want to have someone echo it back. </p>

<p>Fuck all that. For me I have met more life long friends that I talk with off of reddit so much from the <a href="/r/lego">/r/lego</a> subreddit. These are good people. Now some in there are just dicks and that is too be expected. </p>

<p>For me I want to make some friends. People I can invite over and have dinner with or invite to my sons bday party. Share an interest with. You know?</p>

<p>That&#39;s what lego did. Now this subreddit is for entertainment only. You should realize that. Be aware of that at all times. </p>

<p>Now lego can get your mind busy and distract you and that&#39;s awesome. It can also make you go broke, but you find something to do like we did. We share it with the kids in our area that we live in.</p>

<p>Be a part of change not by posting some shit for karma or recognition. Actually help someone. And yes we did. Because of us there is a boy that otherwise wouldn&#39;t have been inspired. He is going to MIT because we did the shit with lego</p>

<p>We made something happen thru it. So if I can help you like I did him then I have to do it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly what I want to do here, I lack friends mostly and it&#39;s generally due to the lack of personality with strangers, I don&#39;t tend to talk much, I have a sort of guard because I&#39;ve learnt not to trust people. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t made any friends here yet but I got reddit to make friends or at least someone to talk to temporarily, and the fact that you&#39;ve gone to such lengths to reassure me, I am going to get into lego. If i dont like it, at least I&#39;ve tried it, and you can&#39;t put a price on happiness. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just so surreal how me commenting on this subreddit about conspiracies has brought much more indepth conversation with a genuinely awesome stranger. If I had money in the bank I&#39;d give you gold right now :-) genuinely made my day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the cost of being well-informed. Sometimes I really get down about it - I used to reach &quot;Saturation points&quot; where I would simply stop reading into world events and completely shun them until I felt ready to bear the burden again.</p>

<p>Now, I feel that it&#39;s my responsibility as a US citizen to understand as fully as possible my country&#39;s heinous actions. Their greatest asset is their constituents&#39; ignorance, apathy, or disinterest. That&#39;s how they&#39;ve gotten this far, because few have spoken up. So I agree with arggabargga but I think it&#39;s important to try and let anyone and everyone know. Find people you can have constructive conversations with about this stuff. Protest whenever possible. Call your congressman. Anything you can do to feel like you&#39;ve TRIED to make a difference will be cathartic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The U.S citizen and country crap is another mind control tactic btw. Their both corporate fictions, while we are living beings or We are free individuals on the land. We don&#39;t belong to a political class which what is a country is unless we consent to it by our inaction or participation. The fact of the matter is our political democratic societies operate by mob rule which is another way of saying that people who are unaware are manipulated into following corrupt people and agendas.

    <div class="md"><p>Of course, citizenship is a construct of the elite to create serfs, servants, tax sources, etc etc. I agree with you there but this construct, while false, is still very real in terms of modern human interactions. Race is also a false pretext of division and control with no biological reality. Believe me, I don&#39;t tout my citizenship - I&#39;m merely saying that I represent America to outside countries, and I have to pay taxes to these fucktards so I have the right and the obligation to know how they spend them, and to spread that information as far as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To re-present yourself or your land its to create a fiction to act in place of it. Its the worst kind of thing you can do because every time you use that process you exchange your living rights for a dead shell that the political system can use to act against you.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t represent anything you are a individual who lives on the land of this earth, you need no representation for that, not unless don&#39;t want to take responsibility for your life. We don&#39;t need that system to interact with people we use our natural born individuality to directly interact with people. 
And btw as a U.S citizen, you have no rights what so ever. You have given those up for benefits and privileges, remember that. 
If you want rights and freedoms you need to stop using these entities to act on your behalf and have ownership of some kind of property, because if you dont own any property then you are in debt to this system. The servant king video series is a really good primer to this.</p>

<p>I respect what you are saying spearthrower, I just think we need to start redefining the terms we use and second, do what we can to shift our energy away from it into something more sustainable that directly benefits us. That way they get weaker and we get stronger.
If we want things to change we need to divest from this centralized government. Its a foreign entity created to extract wealth from the people. That wealth goes to foreign interests. If we want to stop the abuse we need to stop giving it energy and stop exchanging our rights and freedoms for its benefits and privileges . We can return back to our common law jurisdiction as individuals and turn away from the political system based on mob rule that we allowed to come into existence.</p>

Conspiracy theorists need to network more and meet up with each other.  There is just no trust and we need more of it and believe in our fellow man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, I&#39;m right there with you, and just like you i&#39;ve been awake or at least more aware for about 2 years. Just like you, some things depress me for a few days other things just linger in the back of my mind every waking moment, and you just feel depressed because it feels like there is nothing you can do as you stand back and watch it all unravel. I feel detached from life sometimes too you know, but the best advice I can give you is, keep moving enjoy what you can and have fun, associate yourself with like minded people and wiser people because during my depressing episodes, it&#39;s my older work colleagues who talk sense to me without them knowing i&#39;m depressed just engage in conversation and enjoy what you can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s a little more settling to know i&#39;m not the only one who feels depressed/suicidal at times due to us not wanting to be blind to what&#39;s happening.  Yeah definitely have noticed that if I had hobbies it would take my mind away for a little. Camping is nice too, just leave for a weekend with someone you&#39;ll enjoy your time with and make sure you have no signal or any way to know what&#39;s going on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny, I was just feeling the same yesterday and I&#39;ve realized that the best thing you can do is be happy. You feel bad because, unlike our rulers, you have empathy and that&#39;s a good thing. Now, maybe we who see the things as they are can&#39;t do much to change things but what you can do is love your loved ones like it was your last day on earth and live to the fullest. If there comes the time for you to lay your grain of sand to help humanity then welcome it, but in the meantime be as happy as you can, and don&#39;t ever feel suicidal. We need more people like you man, seriously. (

    <div class="md"><p>I think the uncomfortable answer we seek is that we have to unite around truth and dedicate our lives to scooping up the shit of our elites before they enslave and destroy us all with their unscrupulous behavior toward others (us and nature).  It&#39;s not as if we don&#39;t have a part in this.  We are what they harness to do this to us.</p>

<p>I feel just as you do.  I see no hope for us, unless we do this.  We are averse to taking responsibility and struggling long term for things we want.  In history, it usually took a great perceived offense against ourselves to stand up.  Blacks rights, women&#39;s rights, gay rights, environmental protection, worker protection, and customer protection all came from fighting against manifest human darkness.  Today is no different.  </p>

<p>We have to unite around integrity and demand to see it elsewhere, effectively, by looking at it with eyes that see with integrity.  We need to blame ourselves <em>as much as we can perceive</em> for this situation, not because we are the sole cause of it, but because we can only affect it with our own actions.  Blaming anything puts an onus of change upon it <em>within our own minds</em>.  If we blame others we say <em>to ourselves</em> that they need to change for the world to improve.  If we blame ourselves we say <em>to ourselves</em> we need to change to improve the world.  Which is more effective?  </p>

<p>Blaming others for things will ensure our own frustration and stagnation.  The elites seek to maintain control of us, because we are the power they wield!  We have to stop spinning in their mind jobs and start employing our own direction to our lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha.... You say I don&#39;t have to. </p>

<p>Gonna tell you a little story. Since reddit loves how people share.</p>

<p>Around the time they were catching the Boston bomber I was really heavy into this subreddit. Like checked it all the time because it seemed that it was cutting edge. </p>

<p>I was actually looking into buying 2 years of MRE, water, and some fuel for the coming apcolypse. Cause damnit I was sure it was going to happen. Well my relationship with my wife and son was hanging by a thread cause I was always so stressed out and just pissed off. </p>

<p>My job was suffering and lots of bad shit. Then one day I &quot;WOKE UP&quot; ! It took an admin to ban me to realize I went too fucking far. I went all the way back to when she was born. Everything I could find on her. Now I never released anything cause she didn&#39;t deserve that. </p>

<p>But I didn&#39;t know who she was. She never warned me just banned me. Well I stopped and cought my breath and said wtf am I doing here. So I realized that reddit and most of all this subreddit perpetuates hate and fear. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t want to be your friend here. No one wants to share an idea or even debate really. They want you to follow them cause they feel they are just so damn smart they want to have someone echo it back. </p>

<p>Fuck all that. For me I have met more life long friends that I talk with off of reddit so much from the <a href="/r/lego">/r/lego</a> subreddit. These are good people. Now some in there are just dicks and that is too be expected. </p>

<p>For me I want to make some friends. People I can invite over and have dinner with or invite to my sons bday party. Share an interest with. You know?</p>

<p>That&#39;s what lego did. Now this subreddit is for entertainment only. You should realize that. Be aware of that at all times. </p>

<p>Now lego can get your mind busy and distract you and that&#39;s awesome. It can also make you go broke, but you find something to do like we did. We share it with the kids in our area that we live in.</p>

<p>Be a part of change not by posting some shit for karma or recognition. Actually help someone. And yes we did. Because of us there is a boy that otherwise wouldn&#39;t have been inspired. He is going to MIT because we did the shit with lego</p>

<p>We made something happen thru it. So if I can help you like I did him then I have to do it. </p>
