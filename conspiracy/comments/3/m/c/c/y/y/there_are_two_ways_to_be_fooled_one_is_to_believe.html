    <div class="md"><p>Free market capitalistic principals are superior to socialism, communism and capitalism. The thing is we live in an oligarchical system of fascism. Free markets are libertarian ideology and not an ism. The average everyday person such as you and I are the market. We are consumers, a business increases its market share by attracting more consumers through competition with other businesses. In all the ism forms of economics, government ie parasitic self serving individuals, inject their wishes into the market and fiddle with the natural order of things. When a few parasitic assholes dictate the choices of the masses then the market is no longer free it is steered or as the put it &quot;planned&quot;. </p>

<p>Regulation of pollution, safety, and ethical practices should be the only function of a government. They shouldn&#39;t be in the business of regulating prices, or products. The money supply shouldn&#39;t be in the hands of private individuals, it should be directly tied to the market. </p>

<p>But your market is <em>made</em> of individuals. The whole point of a free market is to accumulate capital, dismantling that point.</p>

<p>The start of the industrial revolution. Developing nations. Online stores (initially). Without government interference or costly regulation individuals can more easily sell their product to consumers. Consumers in turn, drive the demand for the product. If consumer demand grows then the business owner must raise capital to meet the demand or have a competitor meet the demand. The end result is better <em>quality</em> products at an affordable cost to the consumers demanding the product. The minute government steps into the supply, and  demand manipulating them is the minute artificiality is introduced into the system.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Government role is to protect borders, pass laws, coin money, and build infrastructure. Their mandate does not call for market manipulation or merging with corporate institutions. You may feel that they&#39;re supposed to do that but that&#39;s your opinion. The reality is our founding documents provide a framework for government that limits its function to specific things. Market interference is not one of those things.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You may be mixing up ethical and moral. The two are not exclusive. Ethics are taught in university and have a clear definition. The government should only be involved when ethical rules are violated or allegedly violated as they are tasked with judicial duties.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But your market is <em>made</em> of individuals. The whole point of a free market is to accumulate capital, dismantling that point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You didn&#39;t dismantle the point... The <em>supply</em> of money is not to be in private hands. The <em>accumulation</em> ie saving of money for your less productive years is entirely a private matter. The government, specifically the treasurer is supposed to issue money. Not private banks. The ultimate fascist system in America is the Federal reserve. Private bank executives on a board with civil servants. Literally a merger of state and corporation. Hence the booms and busts and the higher concentration of real assets and tangible wealth into the hands of the bankers and their cronies. </p>

<p>Both of you are assuming anyone who believes a particular political ideology <em>must be</em> in on some conspiracy to control us all. Ergo, neither of you are totally correct. Neither are totally wrong either.  </p>

<p>People in power don&#39;t care about -isms. They&#39;ll use socialism as readily as they will capitalism or communism to achieve their goals. This has been shown over and over.</p>

<p>Actually I wasn&#39;t assuming he/she is part of any sort of conspiracy. I&#39;m just pretty well versed in economics so I was hoping to get an elaboration on what specifically in their mind was wrong with socialism. There are flaws in it just like any other. The only thing I assumed was that they did not know of which they spoke.</p>
