    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>they edited 14 minutes out of the movie </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s almost certainly not the whole story. All this tells us is that the Kubrick version was 14 minutes longer than the publicly released cut. However, it&#39;s likely - inevitable, even -  that cutting room floor material, rejected by Kubrick, was added to help make the censored studio version more &quot;coherent&quot;. This means that far more than 14 minutes of the Kubrick original would have been removed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being that his attention to detail was unmatched in Hollywood and he was known to change the &quot;final&quot; cut of a movie up to and AFTER release, either way it&#39;s safe to say that Eyes Wide Shut is (with almost 100% certainty) NOT the film he intended us to see. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is possible that Kubrick made Eyes Wide Shut as a form of revenge against Scientology and revenge against Tom Cruise. So maybe Scientology whacked him. They&#39;re crazy enough and power mad enough to try I bet.</p>

<p>EWS put Tom Cruise in all these situations and scenes with his own wife that might have truly under minded his marriage to Kidman. Poor ole Tom also has to walk down the street while being catcalled &#39;faggot&#39; by street kids. His reaction is priceless as if Kubrick didn&#39;t tell him about the scene before hand.</p>

<p>The movie ends in the toy store with their daughter, and if you pay close attention you notice that the two door men from the &#39;orgy&#39; are there too. And then we no longer see the daughter while Tom and Nicole casually walk  away with &quot;eyes wide shut&quot; while their daughter gets abducted. Just like how Kubrick&#39;s daughter was &quot;abducted&quot; by Scientology...</p>

<p>Good question, probably lack of oversight given the fact he was already an insider. SURELY he wouldn&#39;t be that stupid they probably assumed.</p>

<p>If it requires close attention then there is no problem. So what is your point? </p>

<p>They were worried that the public would give two shits about some &quot;number 23&quot; level theories that a movie clearly intended for <strong>entertainment</strong> was actually an exposé?</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible... but you&#39;re really stretching.</p>

<p>I agree with <a href="/u/spartyjason">/u/spartyjason</a> - the movie doesn&#39;t seem exceptionally problematic for any imaginable secret society. You can really only speculate that something more significant was removed until it hopefully surfaces (or that his actions outside this film further indicated he was a problem). It isn&#39;t odd at all for 15 minutes to be removed from a three hour film. You can be suspicious that those 15 minutes were &quot;kept in secret&quot; but that isn&#39;t really that odd either. There are infinite possibilities for material a studio might take the liberty of purging from existence, if given the opportunity. If you think they all involve revealing illuminati secrets, then I fear you aren&#39;t being all that creative. I could make up line-crossing material for EWS hours.</p>

<p>And of course, there&#39;s Occam&#39;s favorite: the possibility that it was simply lost. Non-controversial &quot;lost&quot; film surfaces all the time.</p>

<p>Of course not... don&#39;t let simple facts get in the way of a good conspiracy theory that&#39;s driven by wild possibilities and end&#39;s in a 70 year old filmmaker being &quot;definitely murdered&quot; because he &quot;revealed too much about the nature of the occult societies&quot;. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the symbolism in the film. A fraction of the depth of the symbolism is analyzed in a three part series:</p>

<p>Confucius stated that &quot;signs and symbols rule the world not words nor laws&quot; and the SYMBOLISM/SIGNS in the film make it what it is. The article linked above is only a fraction of what is in the film symbolically. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What we know is: he made a film about secret societies and he died, reportedly of a heart attack, before it was released, meaning that the film was edited without his supervision.</p>

<p>Kubrick was 70 and overweight. His IMDB biography notes him as being a &#39;heavy chain smoker in his youth&#39; who quit in the 70s, but continued to smoke when stressed out on set. He was always going to be at risk of a heart attack. He was also a famously obsessive auteur who wanted to control every aspect of his films. The released  version of EWS was 2 hours 45 minutes long. The studios probably cut it because it was a monster of a film and, without Kubrick, they were free to meddle as they saw fit.</p>

<p>All of the conspiracy theories about Kubrick seem to be nothing more than unsubstantiated conjecture. Why is Kubrick assumed to be the good guy? The internet is awash with claims that the &#39;Illuminati&#39; have a hand in film, TV, and pop music. If Bieber or Miley Cyrus starred in an Eyes Wide Shut-esque music video, everyone would interpret it as the Illuminati sending out a message, or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If he was involved in hoaxing the moon landings, he was probably forced to do it. The movie &quot;Room 237&quot; highlights the fact that Kubrick included allusions to the moon landing. His movie 2001: A Space Odyssey also involves a conspiracy about the moon. </p>

<p>Again, <em>if</em> Kubrick was involved in hoaxing the moon landings, then he was only involved in faking the videos. That&#39;s not to say that mankind did not go to the moon, simply that the official narrative may not have been entirely accurate.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, he was definitely murdered. Recall the <a href="http://humansarefree.com/2012/04/cia-declassifies-1975-weapon-heart.html">heart attack gun</a> which was declassified in 1975.</p>

<p>Edit 2: Room 237, not 213 as corrected by <a href="/u/rbslilpanda">/u/rbslilpanda</a>. Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take a look at Kubrick&#39;s outer appearance throughout the years. He looked more and more rugged towards his end. It&#39;s safe to say that his movies got clearer and clearer in their statements. A Clockwork Orange seemed highly experimental and metaphorical. He was going through changes when he got higher up in the industry. So it&#39;s not very unlikely that he was introduced to some of the more wicked folks that rule the industry and won&#39;t meet everyone. Kubrick was different. He was a highly intelligent man with a fairly deep understanding of the world to some degree, even though he might not have grasped it in his early years of filmmaking. So he might have been invited into the inner circles and rituals, but couldn&#39;t decide to fully devote himself to that mindset. If he decided to tell a story or two about those circles he was invited into, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d turn hostile towards him, even if he faked the moon landing depictions for the very same people (if fake, it&#39;s highly likely he helped out and would consequently be invited into the responsible power circles he proofed himself to before!).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like a lot of the late great director’s movies, Eyes was shot in total secrecy, its sets at Pinewood Studios in England locked tighter than that CIA vault Cruise dangled into in Mission: Impossible. Whatever the film’s married costars were up to inside Kubrick’s sealed soundstages — one (false) rumor had Cruise wearing a dress — the world would have to wait to find out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was becoming a serious thorn in the side of a wider cabal that included players at NASA and their Saturn V rocket manufacturer that banked on a &quot;successful moon walk&quot;. The film Napoleon was cut by producers after he had researched him and his wars for over two years. The material he was going to expose in Napoleon (and his funders) had to be shut down. He was pissed about that and later made EWS to expose this elite group even further - and enough was enough.</p>

<p>Btw, on the moon hoax, you have <em>opportunity</em> (Kubrick&#39;s unreal 2001-level effects with backlit scotchlite making space scene&#39;s look incredibly real) and <em>motive</em> (Saturn V rocket sales post-moon landing to worldwide military, etc). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hOiasRsrA">The Shining Code 2.0</a> lays it out perfectly on the moon hoax, and is actually much better than Room 237 imo. This was a big one to get over the cognitive dissonance on. Nevertheless, truth always prevails.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I am not really a fan of Spielberg (666 Boyalston Boy), and have always been uncomfortable with his proximity to Kubrick at the end of his career and the horseshit job he did on AI after K&#39;s death. Not saying the guy isn&#39;t talented, he just doesn&#39;t even come close to holding a candle to Stan, period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just watched that documentary you posted, The Shining Code 2.0 and while there were a lot of good points made, and I especially find the Room 237 and the TV scene making completely sense, there were too many things that were a stretch. And I got tired of hearing &quot;the number 11 this is a reference to the Apollo 11 mission&quot;. The guy must have said this line 800 times now. 
It&#39;s also weird in some points where it points out something but never explains what it means to a full extent. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy....Apollo 11 work and no play makes Stanley Kubrick a dull boy... ok so what does this mean? The scene just cuts off there.</p>

<p>What I also found a REAL STRETCH was how the cars in front of the hotel was supposed to represent the date of the Apollo mission, they underline the cars in a very random way. Splitting up a row of cars in 2 colors for no reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one else is making the difference clear: This <em>is</em> a theory, not a fact. </p>

<p>Therefor, by the rules of theory, people need to be willing to accept it <em>might not be true</em>. Yet no one here is doing that. It&#39;s a very important part of &quot;theory&quot;: It has to be falsifiable. To many here, this (and other &quot;theories&quot;) are not falsifiable: They <em>have</em> to be true. That&#39;s not how theory works. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t use the word if you don&#39;t actually <em>use the word</em>. &quot;Theories&quot; are expected to be tested and evidenced, and dismissed if they don&#39;t fit up to the tests. Not <em>re-tested</em> over and over and over to try to illicit different results. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I knew a guy who was 41 years old. About the same size as Kubrick. Bigger guy. One day he went water skiing. He bailed, wiped out, and the boat swung around to get him back in. He climbed up, dismounted his skis, sat back, and took a deep breath with a huge smile on his face. Then his eyes rolled up behind his head and he died right there. Massive heart attack. Preventable too, had he been seeing doctors regularly and getting check ups. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying: Heart attacks can and do sneak up on you. Easy. Really easy. Death doesn&#39;t care about fame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well anytime someone uses Occam&#39;s razor as the main reason they believe one thing over the other you know they&#39;re basically just holding up a defense mechanism.</p>

<p>Occam&#39;s razor doesn&#39;t apply to something like this because first of all its not a logical proposition, human affairs are illogical. Second of all, even if this somehow had to happen &quot;logically&quot; it doesn&#39;t require any less assumptions that he died in his sleep spontaneously than he was murdered by conspirators. In fact, it requires a many more assumptions to suggest he died spontaneously, so if Occam&#39;s razor did apply (which it doesn&#39;t) it would be in favor of the conspirator argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Biology is so logical, and a heart attack is biology. It&#39;s not a human affair, so your reasoning really doesn&#39;t apply to that version of events at all.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying if I think he was assassinated or not, I&#39;m saying I don&#39;t know. That&#39;s an okay opinion to have, no one&#39;s drawing lines on the sand here but you.</p>

<p>But the official story is biologically sound without needing to assume any assassins or motives, ergo under Occam&#39;s razor, it&#39;s reasonable if the conclusion of a particular person is that he simply died of natural causes, because it requires fewer assumptions than the alternative theory. </p>

<p>Note: This is not to state Occam&#39;s razor ever proves anything - it doesn&#39;t, at all. It simply says it&#39;s not an unreasonable conclusion. Again, you&#39;re approaching this as if it had to be one or the other. There&#39;s in-betweens too. There&#39;s wildly different too. It&#39;s not black and white, yes or no.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Biology is not logical especially when its tied in with illogical human behavior which it always is.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not biologically sound, nobody has ever figured out the mechanism behind random massive heart attacks (other than a blood clot breaking off, but even in that case there are usually clear warning signs), so its a biological phenomenon, but its not one that has been reduced to a clear cut logical science that one could apply Occam&#39;s razor too.</p>
