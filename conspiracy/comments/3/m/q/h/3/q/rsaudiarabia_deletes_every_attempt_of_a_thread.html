        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>And the cherry on top of the cake is that whenever somone does post something then for the few minutes that the thread manages to exist the general, immediate reacion in the comments is: this news is a just a piece of priopaganda by the Yankees (if by any American news outlet)/Ruskies (if by RT)/Qataris (if by Al Jazeera)/Shia-Jews-Western-Imperialist-Islamophobe-Racists (if by anyone). Some even say that the stories are fabrications while denying that the people or their trials actually exist, since they don&#39;t even hear about it bla bla (how surprising that it is not discussed in the Saudi &quot;press&quot;!).</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/saudiarabia/comments/3mnj5h/can_someone_explain_the_this_whole_crucifixion/">Here&#39;s a link to a thread removed yesterday</a>. Note that the OP&#39;s flag is from Kuwait, so he is most likely a Muslim from the Arab Gulf, questioning the news in a very open, almost innocent way. Doesn&#39;t matter. To <a href="/r/saudiarabia">/r/saudiarabia</a> and its users it&#39;s just part of a big conspiracy (!) that deserves to be crushed and hidden. Use their search bar and you will find <em>absolutely zero</em> threads or comments complaining about any of the absurds Saudi Arabia does in a weekly basis, be it the beheading and crufixion of a teenager or anything else. The threads that are allowed and upvoted are so ridiculously innocent it&#39;s adding insult to injury.</p>

<p>Edit: a moderator from the <a href="/r/saudiarabia">/r/saudiarabia</a>, <a href="/u/tg_wl">/u/tg_wl</a> (do check the guy, he has a master degree in apologetics for the Saudi Royal Family and PhD in removing and banning people from his sub for less than justifiable reasons), claimed that he is deleting threads about this because &quot;there is no need to more than one thread about a similar subject&quot; (thank Allah this genius freedom fighter doesn&#39;t run a country) so he decides to allow only one. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/saudiarabia/comments/3ltvj9/saudi_arabia_arrested_a_17yearold_now_wants_to/">The one in question</a> 1) is not a critical argument against it, 2) was downvoted by the sub&#39;s censorship brigade, 3) is mostly people defending the teenager&#39;s death penalty. The majority of the top comments by this enlightened group of people in the thread is: &quot;he&#39;s a terrorist&quot;; &quot;there is no crucifixion in the country, it&#39;s all a lie&quot;, &quot;I fear his execution will make him a martyr&quot;, &quot;it&#39;s western hypocrisy&quot;. Talk about a fucking dystopia! Charlton Heston will probably land there soon.</p>

<p>I&#39;m normally very passive on the news but this is next level. The guys being crucified for fuck sake, for speaking against something and it&#39;s being censored with nobody asking questions. </p>

<p>Actually I don&#39;t see where the op is coming from. Because the topic that we didn&#39;t delete had 20 more comments and almost all of the upvoted comments were against what was happening and speaking out.</p>

<p>Take a look for yourself.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/saudiarabia/comments/3ltvj9/saudi_arabia_arrested_a_17yearold_now_wants_to/">https://www.reddit.com/r/saudiarabia/comments/3ltvj9/saudi_arabia_arrested_a_17yearold_now_wants_to/</a></p>

<p>Now tell me if we did censor stuff, why did we leave this topic open?</p>

<p>The op saw me deleting a topic (because we do not want someone asking the same thing every couple of days) and just yelled &quot;CENSORSHIP!&quot; </p>

<p>Oh and just so people know where I am cominng from. Whenever saudi is in the news here on reddit, and the subreddit gets linked, we get loads of trolls just coming in and trolling, attacking us like we&#39;re the cause of all evil. This is what is happening right now and it&#39;s why we don&#39;t allow crossposting from the subreddit. Just an FYI, these are the people claiming we&#39;re censoring left and right. This is exactly how the person with the fascist comment got to the subreddit. Just sayin&#39;</p>

<p>Well....Saudi Arabia is the number one backer, financially, and spiritually of ISIS, Al-Queada, Al-Nursra Front, and every other wahabist jihadist group on the planet today, who is slaughtering Christians, Jews, and other Muslims across the globe.  I kind of get why people are angry with your country actually.  Saudi Arabia is not a moderate country, they are a radical country trying to impose their perverted view of Islam on the rest of the world.  I mean come on, you have terrorist rehabilitation programs, but your country is crucifying a 17 year old kid?! </p>

<p>Can you at least understand why people are angry?</p>

<p>I&#39;d really like to hear your opinion on this actually.  Are all Saudis this evil?  Do you support ISIS, and Al-Queda, and the beheading and slaughtering they&#39;re doing?  Will you take a stand right here and right now against the barbaric actions of your government? Serious questions.</p>

<p>Saudis are not evil. Do we have people supporting ISIS? Yes, just like how the west has people supporting ISIS, or have we forgotten jihadi john? </p>

<p>binladen declared war on saudi years years ago and I don&#39;t know if you even know that. So Al-qaeda is against saudi.
have a read <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2015/08/06/Timeline-Al-Qaeda-and-ISIS-attacks-in-Saudi-Arabia.html">http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2015/08/06/Timeline-Al-Qaeda-and-ISIS-attacks-in-Saudi-Arabia.html</a></p>

<p>Now lets go over the ISIS angle. You&#39;ll be pretty much shocked.</p>

<p>Do you know ISIS have been attacking saudi for 1-2 years now? Do you know that they&#39;ve bombed mosques here?  In fact, just 5 days ago, an ISIS member KILLED his cousin and fucking recorded it for everyone to see. His cousin was in the army and thats why he was targeted. One isis member was recording the video while the other one had a gun. His cousin was practically begging him saying &quot;please please don&#39;t kill me&quot;. After he killed him he said something along the lines of &quot;Bagdhadi is my caliph&quot; . The video actually went viral, and everyone on twitter, reddit and so on wanted the isis members killed. The police found them and killed one of them while the other is in custody. Would you like to see the video? Because I can show it to you.</p>

<p>Do you know that just 2 days ago the government found an ISIS cell that was planning to attack? Here, you can read all about it. <a href="http://www.spa.gov.sa/english/details.php?id=1403171">http://www.spa.gov.sa/english/details.php?id=1403171</a></p>

<p>And this <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/06/middleeast/saudi-arabia-mosque-attack/">http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/06/middleeast/saudi-arabia-mosque-attack/</a>
Oh and btw, ISIS actually hates the Al saud family, just an fyi.</p>

<p>People were too afraid to go to mosques because of ISIS and saying we support them is really insulting.</p>

<p>We ban people if they go against the rules. EVERY single ban has been to someone that goes against the rules. </p>

<p>you&#39;ve said we ban people over less than justifiable reasons. Let&#39;s see how well that claim holds, shall we?</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s read the rules of the subreddit: No reposts, no trolling, no personal attacks and no vague questions.</p>

<p>The last person who was banned said this in the comment section to another mod.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re disgusting Fascists. Stop collaborating.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t sound like personal attacks to you?</p>

<p>Now tell me how am I an apologist? </p>

<p>Now on to your main point. One of the rules CLEARLY say no reposts. Just this week we&#39;ve gotten at least 4 topics on the same subject. Al nimr is in the news right now and we keep getting people asking about him every day. So, we point to one topic. The topic deleted had 20 comments. The topic that wasn&#39;t deleted had 40. </p>

<p>The topic you linked, the one that wasn&#39;t deleted, was actually at 69% upvotes ratio. Thats more than half. Let&#39;s see what the most upvoted comments in the topic were?</p>

<p>Now keep in mind this is the topic i&#39;ve directed people to, when I deleted the most recent one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A political activist is getting crucified and yet people are somehow justifying this horrid act. What is more dangerous than dictators are the brainwashed peasants who swallow up all the bullshit those in power throw at them.</p>

<p>Crucifying someone is barbaric, if someone needs to be reminded of that then their is something very wrong with them. As for him being a terrorist, the Saudi dictatorship should bring some evidence to the public about that and by evidence I don&#39;t mean a forced confession.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;No matter which way I look at this, I can&#39;t help but think it&#39;s an alarming move.
He was arrested at 17. Even if he was guilty, is it really fair to lay down the full force of the law on him? Capital punishment for crimes committed as an impressionable juvenile? There are many cases of the government offering captured al-Qaeda and Daesh members rehabilitation. Why can&#39;t we do the same with this kid?
Now, if he was innocent, that would be a disaster. The court should be called into question for relying on shoddy evidence (and our courts have been lenient with the death penalty lately). It would no doubt have been a political retaliation against his uncle, Nimr al-Nimr. But why should this kid have to pay the price with his life?
Either way, to execute him would be a poorly calculated political move. He will become a martyr and a symbol of resistance, Qatif and its surrounding cities will descend into chaos, and the Shia community will lose further faith in the government providing fertile ground for a greater Sunni-Shia divide in a time when we&#39;re trying to emphasize unity.I hope King Salman can see why this is a bad idea and overturns the court&#39;s ruling.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If anything, the comments defending his execution  were actually downvoted. Like &quot;17 isn&#39;t a kid, this isnt the US&quot; with seven downvotes.</p>

<p>So tell me, where&#39;s this &quot;censorship brigade&quot;? You&#39;d think if we want to censor things we&#39;d actually remove these comments. </p>

<p>Also, 4 days ago we had this submission and it wasn&#39;t removed. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/saudiarabia/comments/3md1yx/saudi_prince_arrested_at_la_mansion_for_alleged/">https://www.reddit.com/r/saudiarabia/comments/3md1yx/saudi_prince_arrested_at_la_mansion_for_alleged/</a></p>

<p>And this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/saudiarabia/comments/3lfv8m/saudi_diplomat_accused_of_raping_two_maids_uses/">https://www.reddit.com/r/saudiarabia/comments/3lfv8m/saudi_diplomat_accused_of_raping_two_maids_uses/</a></p>

<p>care to tell me why we didn&#39;t censor these posts?? Since we&#39;re clearly connected to the government?</p>

<p>OH and btw, since you&#39;ve said i am a genius freedom fighter and own a &quot;master degree&quot; in apologetics, I can assure you i&#39;ve been through hell in saudi and do not &quot;Defend it baselessly&quot; like you so claim.</p>

<p>I actually find it funny for you to accuse us we&#39;re somehow connected to the government, rofl.</p>

<p>actually it was. Because the person who said that said we delete the topics, that were again, against the rules, because we&#39;re fascist.</p>

<p>But hey, you go on believing this whole conspiracy if it makes you feel any better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t even bought into the whole conspiracy angle of it, but come on, fascist?!  That&#39;s a political term, not a personal attack!  That is THE DEFINITION of censorship when you stifle conversation based on politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a poltical term, and as I said, the reason for using fasicst is because the other mod removed POSTS. I dont know how simpler I can make this be.</p>

<p>Regardless, can you please tell me if we do censor stuff, why didn&#39;t we censor the other negative stuff about saudi? Like, the prince raping someone, and the other diplomatic? I am waiting for your answer.</p>

<p>So you admit it, right here, that you banned someone for using a political term.  This is the definition of censorship.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s no regardless. You just admitted to me and this sub that you banned someone for using a political term.  That&#39;s the end of the debate.  You censored someone based on politics, nothing more.</p>

<p>again you still don&#39;t get it. The poster CLAIMED That the reason for removing the posts was political (hired by the government), just like how the op here claims so. In fact the comment that the banned person replied to WAS about deleting comments.</p>

<p>If you say I am a fasciast and the reason that I have for deleting these topics is political, that&#39;s an insult. Because A: I might not agree with the government&#39;s stance on a particular subject, and B: the comment serves no purpose other than accusing us of something we&#39;re not.</p>

<p>This is an attack. Now, don&#39;t avoid my other points.</p>
