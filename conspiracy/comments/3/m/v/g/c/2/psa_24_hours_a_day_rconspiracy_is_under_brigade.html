I don&#39;t have any proof, but it feels as if meme-style content is being mass up voted in here to drown out quality posts.

<p>I&#39;ve been actively posting here for about 3 years. I&#39;ve never seen anything but constant downvotes in the new queue.</p>

<p>For example, when one of our mods got caught working for a group that took money from AE911 truth, those groups worked very hard to cover up the connection that another one of our mods has to that very same AE911 truth group.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s what you need to tell yourself. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not the one who jumped up to attack a person. I&#39;m simply telling it like I see it, as a very active commenter and voter in the New and the Hot and the Controversial queues in this subreddit (specifically, no less).</p>

<p>You&#39;re the one singling me out as &quot;proving the point&quot; by being honest and saying there <em>is</em> a lot of shit here that gets upvoted for no good reason, and there <em>is</em> a lot of shit that gets downvoted for very good reason (and that there&#39;s some from column A that ought to be in column B). </p>

<p>Your saying that I&#39;m proving the point is to say, given the context of the OP, that I am part of a &quot;brigade attack&quot;. How I could be apart of such a &quot;brigade attack&quot; while simultaneously &quot;[not] realizing it&quot; is beyond me. Suffice it to say though, that I think I know which one of us actually has a point and which one of us is here trying to feel better about themselves. </p>

<p>Edit: Also telling that my comments to you have been downvoted near immediately. I haven&#39;t downvoted you at all: You made valid points, up until you asserted I might be &quot;proving the point without realizing it&quot;.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Full-time lying to random people on some side-alley of the internet? Especially anonymously? <em>Trolls exist for this.</em> For the right kind of cash, I imagine a lot of people wouldn&#39;t mind being an asshole on the net. It&#39;s already pretty easy. It just gets easier if you get to be an asshole to people you already don&#39;t like.</p>

When they&#39;re posting 10 articles at a time, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re picky, but maybe 60% of the articles are something normal users would upvote without thinking and the others are just articles you would skim over.
