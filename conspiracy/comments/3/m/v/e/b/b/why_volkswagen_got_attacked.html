        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Shortly before the final negotiations on TTIP, the world&#39;s largest car manufacturer is being sued for billions. So Volkswagen was about to incorporate its ambitious strategy to take over the American market, selling cars that would have been manufactured in Russia. Makes sense now.</p>

<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Despite sanctions: <a href="http://www.volkswagenag.com/content/vwcorp/info_center/en/news/2015/09/VW_Kaluga.html">Volkswagen Group inaugurates its own engine plant in Russia</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motoring/vw-becomes-largest-car-maker">Volkswagen became the world&#39;s largest car manufacturer and exceeded General Motors.</a></p></li>
<li><p>VW&#39;s newest Passat was designed with the North American market in mind, they launched an ambitious plan to sell <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/volkswagens-big-game-of-risk-the-ambitious-plan-for-world-domination-feature">800.000 units by 2018</a>, compared to their previous 435.000.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The new Americanized Passat was the first car built at Volkswagen’s all-new Chattanooga, Tennessee plant, and their first attempt at building cars in the U.S. since 1988. The plant was a state-of-the-art industrial complex and a centerpiece of their expansion plans in North America. The $1 billion environmentally friendly plant opened in 2011, currently employs 3,200 workers, and has the capacity to produce 150,000 cars a year. But while it was intended showcase Volkswagen’s success in America, it has become known as the site of one of the most contentious labor disputes in recent memory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait until the fix to this issue is applied to all the cars affected by this ordeal. An ECU reflash will be done on all the cars which are diesel. The main reason people were buying the cars was for the fuel efficiency of the diesel engine and it was advertised as clean diesel. The fixed ECU flash will reduce power and decrease fuel efficiency also, there are already reports of 5% power loss and 15% decrease in fuel efficiency in what is thought to be the file which will be used . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know a great deal about this particular issue, but even if there is a conspiracy to take down VW (which there very well may be - again, I don&#39;t know one way or the other), is the emissions issue that they got snagged with the case/valid?  If it is, then it would seem that it doesn&#39;t matter if there is a conspiracy afoot here or not because - if VW <em>did</em> cheat on the emissions issue with its cars - then it would seem they <em>should</em> definitely be brought down, no?</p>

You want to know why the emissions regulations are bullshit?
Because if anyone really cared they would bring about alternatives to oil and coal and anything else with emissions instead they just impose a tax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I certainly don&#39;t disagree that 100% viable alternatives absolutely exist (and get ruthlessly suppressed).  We should have been off of fossil fuel burning technology long ago.  However, within the context of the emissions regulations that <em>do</em> exist, it would seem that VW <em>was</em> indeed cheating and fudging numbers.  For that, it would seem that their being punished would make sense.</p>

<p>Not siding with any one thing one way or the other.  Just saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I liken this as the same kind of opportunity the media and others took against Toyota when for some reason a few cars engines wouldn&#39;t stop?  Anyone remember that?  A kind of character assassination against the company, I think.</p>

<p>I know a retired detective who during his time, had an investigation with a vehicle incident and he himself did some testing with multiple cars and <strong>never</strong> in those tests was he NOT able to overcome the engine by applying the brakes entirely.  Even with failed brakes, brute force wins the day.  They did a recall because of that fiasco.</p>

<p>The media ran with that one and put a big dent (pun intended) in Toyota.  So, I tend to believe this kind of thing happens on a corporate level but I have no proof either.  I just know the Toyota incident was definitely bullshit.  People flying down the highway supposedly not able to stop, yeah right.  Only happened on highways where another car could get a good shot or video.</p>

<p>Interesting to consider none the less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s suppressed for two main reasons:</p>

<p>A)  There is a global, multi <em>TRILLION</em> dollar monolithic power structure that has sunk its teeth completely into and fully committed to not only the fossil fuel burning infrastructure, but into all the industries that fossil fuels have reached out to and infiltrated.  Going away from that would involve a total changing and wholesale revolutionizing of the entire energy industry on this planet.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t want that.</p>

<p>B) The alternatives to coal and fossil fuel burning technologies can be not only super clean…but, once the infrastructure of a clean energy industry is up and running globally, it seems it would be more difficult to monetize technology that could be ubiquitously and easily accessed with the right device.</p>

<p>You get more power for less using clean energy technology, less dependence on “the grid” of the current system, and this leads to a cleaner environment and more prosperous civilization.  The last thing TPTB want for the 99% is for it to live above abject sustenance.  “You have to <em>struggle.”</em> is their motto.  “You have to work, work, WORK…until you die…until you get old and useless and are sucked dry.  Your life must be carved out through struggle, and we cannot allow you to have much of any free time.  You must work, mule.  <em>Work</em>.”</p>

<p>Better, cleaner, more easily obtainable, and cheaper (if not <em>free</em>) energy would lead to a level of citizen power and prosperity that would cause us to realize that we do not need to nor did we <em>ever</em> need to depend upon any PTB over us to feed us or clothes us or travel about freely.</p>

<p>And TPTB gotta keep the citizens dependent upon <em>it</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah.  Got it.  My apologies for misreading that initially.  The answer to that, however, is not all that greatly dissimilar to what I posted above, as <em>what</em> is oppressed is, to put it simply, free energy technology.  There are various unrelated sourced that have gone on record stating that we have had free energy technology since at least as far back as the 1950s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure they did. But that&#39;s not the reason why they were being attacked. It&#39;s just the weapon. I deem that point to be of major importance. The only reason why this is such a huge deal, is because of the climate change religion. We&#39;re still drilling for oil, killing and enslaving millions for computer and mobile phone parts, yet climate change as a part of social marxism is a weapon now that can be utilized not just against the public, but in economic warfare.

    <div class="md"><p>Yo, that guys link has answers for you.  VW apparently had a switch in some of their diesel engines that were sold in the U.S. to go between the European standard and the U.S. standard for emissions.  This is what they were fined 18 Billion dollars by the U.S. for.  Last year, GM had a problem where their cars were like blowing up, 174 people died, they were only fined 1 billion, so basically yeah the U.S. mainstream media story here is a total crock.</p>

<p>Wanna ELI5?  Perhaps you did, that <em>was</em> an ELI5 you gave above, and I&#39;m just <em>that</em> lost on it though...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On phone, but... The issue is software causes the car to go into low emission mode in circumstances similar to a test... Car is going at constant speed. Sounds like a feature to me...</p>

<p>But, how do you test? Depends on if you have source code. With no code, you are black box testing. Looks like a feature to me (low emissions in specific conditions), and I don&#39;t have access to the source code to tell you that it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Also, I think Toyota issue was true bug or hacking that killed people.</p>

<p>Yes.  That does indeed sound like a feature to me as well.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t be too surprised by that.</p>

<p>Thank you for the clarification.  Appreciated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the fix can&#39;t be all that big of a deal. The cars have all the emissions equipment to pass tests. New software and off you go. The problem is that all those customers have a valid lawsuit against the company for performance they expected but now will not get. Let alone the penalties from government bodies around the world.</p>
