<p>If you&#39;ve ever been to a concert, there is at a minimum, 15 people filming the show at all times. Not to mention the show is always recorded by the venue for security purposes.</p>

<p>Where is this footage? Are we going to get Sandy Hooked again? It&#39;s just too graphic?</p>

<p>I can understand how cell phones are collected but odds are someone slips through the cracks and something is shown on video.  I don&#39;t even see a video of anything as the aftermath.  All those targets and no one even seems to show a video that I can find of even an ambulance driving down the road.</p>

I am sure this thing was an &quot;inside job&quot; by those who want world forces to attack Syria. but I can not tell if the death is real or not. A lot of it appears staged.

But yeah --- I&#39;m really trying to find signs either way. Staged death/ real death? I can not tell.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s as simple as that, because it was a real band that was on tour. But I think the band got out of the venue really quickly. And maybe nobody actually died, they just fired blanks, then held the &#39;hostages&#39;, and had some planted actors at the concert who pretend to get shot?? Idk, but even in that case, there would be some footage, right?? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sandy Hook wasn&#39;t done in front of a live audience though...I could see that being more likely at Aurora. My initial reaction was that there&#39;s not much video from in there simply because anyone who was in there was probably fearing for their lives and running out or playing dead.</p>

<p>That being the case...you would think maybe someone would be recording the concert on their phone when the gunfire begins to erupt? Not sure if we&#39;d get the footage anyway. Were the attacks outdoors and explosions the Twin Towers, and the situation in the theater was Flight 93? I personally doubt it right now, but you can&#39;t help but wonder, especially since C(ISIS)A is claiming responsibility. Awful stuff that happened in Paris, regardless of what anybody thinks, gotta feel terrible for anyone with loved ones involved.</p>
