        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>The Mysterious and Bizarre Case of the Bukhari &quot;Brothers&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Two men with the last name &quot;Bukhari&quot; were originally said to be on the flight manifest for Flight 11.  The FBI insisted that ID cards of the two &quot;brothers&quot; were &quot;left behind&quot; magically in Atta&#39;s rental car.</p>

<p>But neither man was on Flight 11.  They weren&#39;t brothers.  <em>And one of them was already dead for a year.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adnan_Bukhari#Arrest">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adnan_Bukhari#Arrest</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Between 5:00 and 5:30 on the morning of September 12, FBI agents, backed by a SWAT team, stormed Bukhari&#39;s leased house at 4036 57th Terrace and arrested him, saying that <strong>identity cards of him and an Ameer Bukhari, mistakenly thought to be a brother, were found in a rental car</strong> the hijackers had left in Portland, Maine, though <em>it later turned out that Ameer had died a year earlier</em>, and had no relation to Adnan.</p>

<p>Agents evacuated nearby houses, citing concerns that Adnan Bukhari&#39;s house was rigged with explosives, and took him to Miami for questioning. While searching his house, <strong>they announced that they had found a copy of Ameer Bukhari&#39;s pilot license</strong> (the alleged brother), and a &quot;hazardous materials manual&quot;.[1] After passing a polygraph, he was released and later cleared of any wrongdoing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Questions:  </p>

<p>(1) The FBI <em>never backed away from their claim of &quot;finding IDs for the two men in Atta&#39;s car.&quot;</em> How did their IDs get there if they weren&#39;t involved?</p>

<p>(2) The FBI <em>never backed away from their claim of &quot;finding Ameer&#39;s ID&quot; in Adnan&#39;s house</em>  Since they weren&#39;t brothers &amp; didn&#39;t know each other, what is the explanation? </p>

<p>WhatReallyHappened.com notes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This poses a problem for our investigators - proving who was actually using these IDs is very difficult. It also creates the very difficult question: why did they have to steal so many IDs from pilots? Is it more likely to be someone trying to create the illusion that the hijackers flew the planes into the buildings?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m starting to get very confused with the timeline and events within the bataclan. Gunmen entered at 9:40 pm, news said they killed security guards, at this point gunshots must have been heard in the theatre. The amateur video shot shows the first gunfire which scares the band - this could presumably be the same shots that killed the security guards? So what happens for the next 2+ hours in the theatre? Gunmen kill spectators (survivors mention gunmen continuously firing and reloading several times). Police speculate that hostages were then brought to the front of the stage, gunmen give brief announcement about Syria, ISIS, so on (lots of mixed reports of what they said here), at around 12:20 police storm building, kill gunmen. Apparently, suicide vests were triggered but no images of explosive damage within the theatre. There just seems to be a gap in the timeline, or the story is just all over the place. Would like to see more information released by officials. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>at first I was like -- oh no for sure people died in this one -- but the more I look into it I see indications of staging and listening to fox news report ( only because somebody they up 20 mins of it on youtube) --- there is zero element of natural discovery and investigation. all is just --- this is happening - now this is happening - (and then they actually say ) &quot;suddenly&quot; this is happening. </p>

<p>it reads like a bad play - like just intentional scary fake news, which I conclude is exactly what it is. </p>

<p>I think there are too many players who organized this thing - and too many of them French themselves - and I think they might take part for certain reasons but it would be a lot harder for them to take part if they knew murder was really occurring. </p>

<p>for now I make conclusion it was all staged, until I see proof otherwise . </p>
