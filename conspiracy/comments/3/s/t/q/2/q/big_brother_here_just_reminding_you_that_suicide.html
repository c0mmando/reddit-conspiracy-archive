       Uh yeah sure if you want the homicide toll to increase exponentially? I think prohibiting all guns from all nations and all platforms of society would be the way to go. Also outlaw all military arms development and dispose of every single missile/bomb/gun/tank/explosive weapon. If we don't make weapons weapons don't kill people.

       You're blowing yourself up!

       It's the fucking definition of it.

       Now, don't get me wrong, I question WHY certain things are worth blowing yourself and other people up over, but there is no doubting the courage it takes to do so.

       <p>
        Behaviour and courage are two complete different things.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well, you're wrong. Courage is ultimately defined by action, or inaction. ie. Behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line is trading your life for something you believe in is a courageous act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, you would YOU trade your life for something you believe in?
      </p>
      <p>
       If yes? You're courageous.
      </p>
      <p>
       No? Then you're a coward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I absolutely question WHAT someone is willing to die for, but the question of whether that act is courageous is an absolute non sequitur.

       Loud mouthed and igorant?  How can you be loud mouthed on reddit?  Am i Ignorant because im not getting upset that someone has a different opinion than me? Kinda like you are right now.  Just relax a little a bit, stop with the name calling and maybe we can have a civil argument, or do you just want to keep calling me don cherry and ignorant for having a different opinion. And i said PROPPER Canadian, not real canadian, you should get the facts the straight if your going to try and use something against them, otherwise it just makes you look unintelligent.

       your dumb, you should have looked back a few more paragraphs when i said you werent a propper canadian in my first or second reply, but your memory probably does dont go back that far.  You changed it from propper to real in the first the place and that is what i was referring too, but its ok man,  it probably sucks when your emotions take over but it happens to stupid people so dont blame yourself, blame your parents for not having an abortion , BOOSH,  mic drop

       Your education is FAR from complete in regards to sociology, anthropology, psychology, history, global studies, and philosophy. Areas in which you claim to know
       <strong>
        so much
       </strong>
       about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently you didn't learn anything of
       <strong>
        real
       </strong>
       value along the way in regards to social interaction, social structures and the nature of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have such a narrow worldview and frame of reference that it's impossible to have a rational conversation with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say Nazis weren't brave because you disagree with what their motives were.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is definition of ignorance. Blatant fucking stupidity. Your entire argument is therefore moot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, go back to school and learn how to
       <strong>
        think
       </strong>
       rationally, as obviously didn't do much of that the first time around.

       You seem to be stuck on this notion that intelligence is solely based on ones vocabulary.  Your like that kanye west interlude where he makes fun of the guy keeping himself warm on the city bench that  hes sleeping on with all of his diplomas.  You try to acccuse me of having a limited vocabulary, I can name every single plant on this earth, latin origin or scientific classification, whichever you'd like.  I had a phd in plant science by age of 24 but i dont go around saying hey buddy i bet you dont know this word because im better than you.  Im tell you about my meterial possesions because i AM better than you, better than you at life.

       Im sorry i dont believe you about your education, youve been defenceful and upset this whole conversation towards someones different view on a situation.  If you were actually as educated in all these feilds that you claim to be, then you would have been much more understanding that my point of view is different and then tried to explain why you think its wrong, you wouldnt have started name calling and sayin someone is stupid for having a different view then pulling outnyour dictionary so you could ask me if i knew the definitikn of a few words, definitely not the behaviour of a highly educated person. Or maybe your university is just really fucked up.

       Yes. It's different. And I've spent countless messages explaining why it's wrong.  But you stopped listening a long time ago, this of course assuming you were even listening to begin with.

       Heres my point of view, people who blow themselves up for a religious belief arent sane, you cant give an insane person for credit for being brave, just like we dont charge insane people with murder or anything else that they do because they dont understand what there doing.    Let me ask you this, if you think these guys are brave for blowing them selves up, then would say the nazi's were brave for stuffing jews in the gas chamber? Or were they weak minded people that were taken advantage of?

       This isn't a sound argument.  It makes no sense.  Who is insane? Who isn't? By what perimeters do you set your definition by?  Anyone that believes anything is insane? Does individual agency not exist at all? What
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       a rational or irrational belief?

       The answer is both to a certain degree, but this isn't a good example in the least.

       We are talking about the willingness to sacrifice yourself for what you believe.

       Nazi soldiers on the ground were brave. Sure. Guys cooking in the kitchen were brave to a certain degree,  but there are still levels of courage (in facing fear in someway) that apply to each case

Nazis werent brave because they were brainwashed, they soldiers that volunteered and fought against them are brave.  If there werent fucked up people like you in this world we wouldnt have wars.

       alone under obama got more than 10.000 civil people killed with drone stikes
      </p>
      <p>
       military targets? ... cmon
      </p>
      <p>
       to call something a military target, knowing there will be 90% civil targets is pure murdering
      </p>
      <p>
       and just to make it clear ... aims for military targets? what about the hospital 1 month ago where they murdered the doctors without borders + patients?
      </p>
      <p>
       but yeah i know, when usa is doing it than its ok. its only terror when some desert people are doing it ... right?

       It is known how many civil people got murdered with drone strikes in last years - over 10.000 - and you can be sure obama know this numbers too. And so he know this drone strikes murder 90% civil people. Doing it, knowing this, is murdering civil people. Its that simple

       This narrative is all wrong.
       <br/>
       Drone pilots and false flag jackals are all cowards by Bushido standards.
       <br/>
       "suicide bombers " are victims of being uneducated, being brainwashing by an ideology/religion and dying to prove their conviction thereof. 
Unlike" suicide bombers", drone pilots and false flag jackals know better yet they act cowardly murdering hundreds of people as a matter of course because their government sanctions this behavior and pays them extraordinarily well to keep their mouth shut. 
Systemic murder is considered "civilized", while "random" acts of guerrilla warfare are somehow barbaric.
       <br/>
       It's all nonsense.
