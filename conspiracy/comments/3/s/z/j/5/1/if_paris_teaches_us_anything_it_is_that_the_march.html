       That is an absolutely, absolutely ridiculous statement.  OF COURSE it can fucking be stopped.  WE could stop it.

       Face the reality that it is WE who are not stopping it as a people.  We're not stopping it because we're not willing to put aside the bullshit indoctrinated falsehoods and racism that have been brainwashed in us.

      <p>
       The reason the wars don't get stopped isn't because we can't stop them.  It's because we're not doing what's necessary as a people to stop them.

       While you are right, you also have to acknowledge that in the face of these acts, we are just bystanders. The wealthy and powerful people have their way, one way or the other. They reward the people who they have indoctrinated handsomely while the ones that question their authority are thrown to the ashes. You have to understand that it's both easy and hard to be free. Don't be so hard on yourself, humanity has proved time and time again it is on the march for its own destruction. And even a messiah can only break the fall. He cannot stop it.

       Bullshit. This defeatist attitude is cancerous. TPTB can not just declare war without manufacturing consent for it.  Take Obama's attempt to bomb Syria a year ago that he had to cancel because public opinion was so dead set against it. This is a perfect example of how We The People can prevent war if we are vocal and unfraid about voicing our opinion against it.

       I am just reminding you what you are up against. TPTB have much more resources, orders of magnitudes higher than any of us. They also have the numbers in their favour. For example, I have 400 facebook friends. How many of them are speaking up? None. Maybe 1 or 2 are sceptical, but they are in no position to do anything. Even my own sister who I have tried to "wake up" believes the official narrative. The voice of reason gets shouted down in the echo chamber of MSM we are surrounded by. This isn't a fight between David and Goliath. It is more like a fight between an ant and a thunder storm. I used to be like you, but I have given up the fight. I admire you're optimism, and wish you luck. I am the first person that wants to see you succeed. I still will help in my own capacity, and it is only beneficial to be reminded of the reality of the situation, if you were truly prepared and/or serious to do anything about it.

       You are relying on a social media platform which has been proven to silence any dissent that goes against the grain.  I still use this platform myself, and have not had very many people like my posts, or comment on them, but when I saw them in person, they told me they saw them, and have looked into it and found what I was saying is true.  They clearly are afraid to speak out, which is fine, that's their right, but even when you think you aren't reaching people because of likes or comments, know the work you're putting in is not going un-noticed.

       I feel sorry for you, honestly.  You (seem to be) informed, and "awake" but have given up.  Never give up, ever.  I will only give up when I'm six feet under.  Do you have kids?  I do, and that's what has really made me that much determined to fight as hard as a can to ensure they have just a good of world and country as I have growing up.  There is no other option but to fight IMHO.

       As it stands currently, the numbers are definitely in their favour, held together firmly by a hierarchical system of control. For every ten of us that are "awake", there are a thousand that either believe the official narrative, or will support authority than go against it, or are directly working for them and are rewarded monetarily and with access to resources that none of us have. Moreover, they are a few steps ahead of the game, they know what is about to go down as they have planned things before hand. We are only reacting after the fact.

       I can absolutely respect this sentiment. In fact, if I did not have children that I brought into this world, I too may find this mentality comforting, and the easiest way to deal with the craziness.

      </p>
      <p>
       And yet it’s ALL bullshit…and then when you become an adult - a 30 or 40 year old…or, hell, even a 25 year old - you look back at that kid and you wonder how it was ever possible that he/she didn’t just stand the fuck up to that piece of shit parent and just
       <em>
        fight back
       </em>
       /did what was right.

      <p>
       That’s not to say that things would be easy, and that’s not to say that a lot of kids that have abusive parents and who
       <em>
        do

       fight back and end up running away don’t end up just as if not more fucked up now that they stood up and actually did something - maybe now they’re on the streets and homeless and even worse off.  However, the point to this analogy is that I think most of us can look at a young kid getting abused and think “Just FUCK that piece of shit parent up, kid!  Fuck them!  They don’t deserve you and you’re not stuck or beholden to them!  Stop taking that abuse!”
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of us can very well think this, and we very well may be justified in our frustration over the kid remaining in this type of shitty situation, but the fact of the matter is that we as a civilization are no different.  We are the equivalent of a young kid with an abusive parent where the kid feels like there’s no other recourse but to keep taking the shit he/she is taking, so we just sit here and keep taking what TPTB keep dolling out to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s fucking
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       frustrating…especially for those of us kids in this civilization that know we
       <em>
        don’t
       </em>
       have to keep taking this shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are being fucked, and manipulated, and destroyed and coerced by an evil elite that is destroying us and keeping us from being what we definitely
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       be…and, ultimately, it seems that the biggest thing that is keeping us shackled down and that is keeping us from rising up and moving forward together…is OUR VERY OWN MIND, our very own hearts.  It is
       <em>
        WE
       </em>
       who are keeping us from breaking out of this shit.  It’s us…not them…because we overpower them.  We are stronger than them.  There are a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       more of us than them.  We just have to come together.

      <p>
       Correct, sir.  Correct.  All of us down here, living in the ashes, however, should simply hold hands, come together as one, and rise up.

       Stop being their foundation - their support system…because that’s what we are.  They live off of US.  We are the

       I feel like death is better than allowing myself to be beholden to the war machine that is this civilization, and I would rather die objecting to the b.s. that is happening and

       I’m not saying that I’m some sort of “eternal rebel” - cuz I’m not.  I’m a normal person that drives a car, buys groceries, pays rent, still has to pay for shit, etc, etc.  I know I’m still “in the system/matrix”.  However, I feel myself more and more -
       <em>
        every

       moment - being more and more aware of just how much of a fucking farce this whole civilization is.

       starting to “wake up” mind you.  I’ve felt this way almost my entire life it feels.  I’m just saying that I’m getting

       …Man….Yeah.  Lots of misinterpretation there.  I’m not saying it’s “really simple” either.  Obviously it’s not “really simple” since we are SUPER far from having what I’m talking about.  If it were that simple, we would already have had it by now.  Don’t misunderstand:  It’s super simple ONCE we do what we
       <em>
        need

       to do.  DOING what we need to do, however, is obviously

       “super simple” for a lot of humans, unfortunately.  It’s pretty darn simple for

       of us, but we don’t need “some” of us to do this in order for things to work out.  We need a LOT of us to do the right thing - not just “some”.

       TPTB
       <em>
        want

       Well, right now, WE the people - the 99% - are that 10 year old child...and tptb are that pedophile abusing bully.

       And just like a pedophile abusing bully, they fucking THRIVE on secrecy.  They THRIVE on our cooperation and willingness to go along with their evil and not stand up to it.  If we DON'T go along with their evil en mass, and we

       Although I will agree with you for the most part, I know for me I can‘t even identify if we have an enemy, who it is. i.e...
      </p>
      <p>
       I come from a large eastern city in the US. I have moved to a western city, not rural but it has some pretty rural ‘burbs. I have rommates that are litterally like Opie from Mayberry.  They do not question ANYTHING the t.v tells them. Thankfully I won‘t live with them for much longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this is my point. They came from 50 miles outside of one of the  most developed cities in the western part of the US and I think they are pretty fucking dense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now take me, I read everything I can conspiracy, main stream, social media and I still can figure what is REALLY going on and WHO is REALLY behind it. I mean we can ACT like we know the real deal, but we are light years behind and in the dark.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let‘s take all of us that are at least savvy enough to know that something stinks, I think we just know it stinks and we think we knw what it is, but, really, do we? Now that‘s us.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the peolple in the less sophisticated and uneducated parts of this country, omfg. If we are light years behind, they are millions of light years behind. If we just barely see the tip of the iceberg they don‘t even know an iceberg exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don‘t think it‘s a matter of can we stop ‘it‘, I really do think, what is it that we are even looking to stop, and should it even be stopped?
      </p>
      <p>
       I like looking before leaping.

There is a US army residence near where I live and it is guarded by the most uneducated, illiterate Indians who have come here from villages to earn just a fraction more of what they have earned if they stayed back in their country. You cannot even begin to have a conversation with them about reality. They don't even have the right faculties for that. And even if they did, they would be like the rest of the people in the educated world. There are quite a few hurdles to jump if you were to really free the mind. Some of us may have jumped more than a few hoops, some may have jumped a few before they get comfortable, but the vast majority of them, they don't even know that we are stuck in a mindless race!

       Thank you for your honesty. I think we have some bread crumbs of an idea. But bread crumbs compared to the entire cake is nothing.

       So yeah, there is tons of crap going on. For me I just try to stay aware of as much as I can, do the best I can and try to be as honest with myself and others as I can.

       Spot on mate. We are just spectators watching fragments of a movie, we call life. Some may get agitated at the movie, at fellow theatre goers, at the actors, or at the director himself, not realizing that we have been given essentially a free ticket to watch what is just a movie and that there isn't much long before we are kicked out of the theatre. So while you can, enjoy the show! Cheers!

      <p>
       I think a big portion of what stinks is our inability to come together as one people and our continuing to allow ourselves to be kept apart from one another as a cohesive whole.

      <p>
       What we are looking to stop is our ignorance and our inability to see one another as parts of the same whole.  The being “apart and antagonistic” part of this civilization that so constantly gets indoctrinated into us is, I feel, a pretty good specific that needs to get stopped.

       I feel like I can personally see what I just mentioned above pretty clearly actually.  I feel pretty comfortable
       <em>
        right now

       in moving forward this very moment and jumping head long into a willingness to help one another - help my fellow being (human and otherwise) - and engender an energy of connectives amongst
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of us.  Right now, what we have in this civilization is, to a great extent, antagonism against one another - antagonism based on race, creed, religion, economic status, etc, etc…and all these things are ultimately flames that are fanned by TPTB.
       <em>
        These
       </em>
       are the things that we can fight against and counter by simply NOT playing into them; NOT vying into the antagonistic type of thinking that gets indoctrinated into us from birth.  Easier said than done, I know, but if we all imbued and engendered the proper mentality of seeing one another independent of the b.s. antagonistic indoctrination we’re fed, we would be able to go a long ways AWAY from the very things TPTB use to pit us against one another and cause us to fight with one another in war after endless war.

       I see you like to play armchair james bond, so let me ask, have you ever been invited to the Bilderberg Group? G20 summit meeting? Ever been part of any sort of debriefing? DoD meeting? Bohemien Grove participant? Ever actually been a Mason?

       If not, then I‘m sorry, as what we do is speculation. Quite frankly we might be spot on in that speculation, but we may be as far away as the moon. You‘re deluding yourself if you think otherwise.

       Your response ultimately shows you to be nothing more than part of the problem - not part of the solution.  You’re not even
       <em>
        abstractly
       </em>
       part of the solution; not even
       <em>
        hypothetically
       </em>
       such - which is an extremely sad thing.  We’re talking bout a person in you that is so trapped in their subservience that they can’t even
       <em>
        imagine
       </em>
       how it’s possible to break out of it.  Your mind is so small, shallow, and closed that you can’t even possibly imagine how it is that the human species can overcome the issues we face.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is part of the unfortunate problem I’m talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t worry though.  We don’t have to continue in this conversation.  You can just go away and keep thinking how you’re thinking.

       I’ve no interested in “digging our own grave” though.  I’m interested in trying to learn as much as I possibly can and in arriving at as great a level of enlightenment as possible in the short time I have here on this plane.  It may ultimately amount to almost nothing - to a negligible amount of understanding - but my focus is nonetheless upon trying to learn and, where possible, teach and impart whatever I can.

       Even if you're right, that does not mean we should stop trying to fight it. Disheartening indeed, but the battle is not lost yet. This sub has consistently had double the numbers of people "thinking freely" since the Paris attacks then usual. People are waking up. Whether or not it will be too little, too late remains to be seen.

       No, Syria had been a BLOODBATH for years now. WTF? The citizens there have been suffering and not one nation gave a fuck or did anything, in fact they are only stepping in now to pick the carcass and cast lots for the leftovers. War hasn't been avoided in Syria, people should have started helping there years ago, but none did because they aren't part of the central bank complex, so now Daesh comes along and now public support to enter Syria and divy up what's left. More than likely Israel's expansion, or maybe that's why Paris was attacked, they recognised Palestine and this was the grave consequences they warned about?? Those bombs fell way toooo fast, that big ass french boat was already there and here comes NATO's green light.  The more you know. One voice rises with another voice and another one... The story they are spinning? The radicalization of extremist? How fucking stupid do they think we are? Stupid enough to think planes and not explosives brought down huge skyscrapers in less than an hour? Seriously, we aren't that stupid, none of us are. It's DENIAL. It's SHOCK. IT'S LIKE BEING ABUSED AND EMOTIONAL AND IGNORING THE TRUTH. When we accept the TRUTH, en mass, than the shift happens. And it will. The truth alone will survive.

       Tptb know the weakness of the human mind very well, they know exactly which buttons to push and when. That doesn't mean we shouldn't fight back, but we have to acknowledge these people have much more resources than any of us to manipulate us in ways we only realize after the fact.

       Seems the enemy is, for the most part, our own ignorance and indolence.

      <p>
       I think a big portion of what stinks is our inability to come together as one people and our continuing to allow ourselves to be kept apart from one another as a cohesive whole.

      <p>
       What we are looking to stop is our ignorance and our inability to see one another as parts of the same whole.  The being “apart and antagonistic” part of this civilization that so constantly gets indoctrinated into us is, I feel, a pretty good specific that needs to get stopped.

       I feel like I can personally see what I just mentioned above pretty clearly actually.  I feel pretty comfortable
       <em>
        right now
       </em>
       in moving forward this very moment and jumping head long into a willingness to help one another - help my fellow being (human and otherwise) - and engender an energy of connectives amongst
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of us.  Right now, what we have in this civilization is, to a great extent, antagonism against one another - antagonism based on race, creed, religion, economic status, etc, etc…and all these things are ultimately flames that are fanned by TPTB.
       <em>
        These
       </em>
       are the things that we can fight against and counter by simply NOT playing into them; NOT vying into the antagonistic type of thinking that gets indoctrinated into us from birth.  Easier said than done, I know, but if we all imbued and engendered the proper mentality of seeing one another independent of the b.s. antagonistic indoctrination we’re fed, we would be able to go a long ways AWAY from the very things TPTB use to pit us against one another and cause us to fight with one another in war after endless war.

       Spot on. There is a US army residence near where I live and it is guarded by the most uneducated, illiterate Indians who have come here from villages to earn just a fraction more of what they have earned if they stayed back in their country. You cannot even begin to have a conversation with them about reality. They don't even have the right faculties for that. And even if they did, they would be like the rest of the people in the educated world. There are quite a few hurdles to jump if you were to really free the mind. Some of us may have jumped more than a few hoops, some may have jumped a few before they get comfortable, but the vast majority of them, they don't even know that we are stuck in a mindless race!

       Spot on mate. We are just spectators watching fragments of a movie, we call life. Some may get agitated at the movie, at fellow theatre goers, at the actors, or at the director himself, not realizing that we have been given essentially a free ticket to watch what is just a movie and that there isn't much long before we are kicked out of the theatre. So while you can, enjoy the show! Cheers!
