<p>Most European countries require everyone to carry national ID when in public, although it&#39;s not often checked.  But if you&#39;re a dark-skinned guy driving into Paris, probably higher chance of being stopped and having papers checked.  Why risk having your attack spoiled by failing a simple traffic stop ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>repeating a comment I wrote in another thread</p>

<p>A Syrian passport is USELESS if you want the cops to leave you alone. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_Syrian_citizens">You need a visa as a Syrian to be allowed in France.</a>. Did the terrorists asked for the extra paperwork and stamps? probably not. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re driving, you need a driver&#39;s licence. A valid one that is. Insurance, documents that prove the car is yours. I know because I&#39;ve been stopped as a driver in France more than once (my car is a falling apart, probably why). </p>

<p>Then cops DO NOT have the time to stop every single tourist to make sure they&#39;re not illegals overstaying. There&#39;s just too many people in Paris. If you want to evade cops, might as well mug some French Arab guy on a supermarket parking lot and take his documents . It would make more sense.</p>

<p>Get to the check point.  No matter what don&#39;t be dumb and blow it by making  a wrong turn  and getting pulled over.. or locking your keys in your car.. </p>

<p>Also.. Europe is not like america.. In Europe you can jump between countries pretty quickly and the need to carry a passport is more necessary than here where you have to travel Hundreds of miles to reach a boarder that requires a passport for entry. </p>

<p>A French radio reporter who was  inside the theater told CNN the gunmen wore masks and black clothes, but he didn’t hear them say “anything.”</p>

<p>“And the terrorists were very calm…and they reloaded three to four times their weapons. They didn’t shout anything. They didn’t say anything. They were in masks. They were wearing black clothes,” the witness said.</p>

<p>A French radio reporter who was  inside the theater told CNN the gunmen wore masks and black clothes, but he didn’t hear them say “anything.”</p>

<p>“And the terrorists were very calm…and they reloaded three to four times their weapons. They didn’t shout anything. They didn’t say anything. They were in masks. They were wearing black clothes,” the witness said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try providing a fake ID next time the police pull you over.  Let us know how well that goes for you ;)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People are required to carry ID</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True, but that are not required to leave said ID at the crime scene.  Quite the opposite, most professional criminals will tell you:  Leave behind zero evidence unless you are planting it to distract.  </p>

<p>But hey... i am not a professional criminal , so what would i know?? ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you live in Europe?  Have you had your passport checked here?  Do you know the process?  Are you aware that for minorities they usually just check the validity of the paper form of the visa and don&#39;t necessarily cross-check it in the central database?</p>

<p>If you have been checked, which European countries have you had your passport checked in during a random stop?  What was the procedure?  Fortunately (or unfortunately) I&#39;ve had mine checked many times, I&#39;d be happy to hear how your experiences differe.</p>

<p>Furthermore, do you have a valid European driving licence?  When pulled over in Europe, were you asked to provide your passport as well, or were you only required to provide your licence?  If you were also asked to provide your passport, what were the circumstances?</p>

<p>More and more people are even acknowledging that r/conspiracy has been making more and more good points recently... Attention is on the corrupt media like never before, inequality, the 1% and Wall Street crooks...  All of it seems to be regular chat in r/all and on Facebook news feeds</p>

<p>Definitely a pivot point we&#39;re at... Be more positive... sounding like that may sound unwelcoming to anyone who is here just curious or wanting to ask questions</p>

<p>if it&#39;s all so black and white, then we have proof he broke the law and should be in jail, and the fact that he is not, means the DA and the judges aren&#39;t doing their job, which is also provable AND a criminal offense...</p>

<p>so why isn&#39;t anybody in jail for this?</p>

<p>A French radio reporter who was  inside the theater told CNN the gunmen wore masks and black clothes, but he didn’t hear them say “anything.”</p>

<p>“And the terrorists were very calm…and they reloaded three to four times their weapons. They didn’t shout anything. They didn’t say anything. They were in masks. They were wearing black clothes,” the witness said.</p>
