       Come on... I'm open minded, but it's not as blatant as you make it sound. There's a couple of questionable things, that's it.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the passport, it's one of them. He could simply have accidentally had it on him.  It's not like it flew out of a burning building that later pulverised pretty much everything in it.

       Most European countries require everyone to carry national ID when in public, although it's not often checked.  But if you're a dark-skinned guy driving into Paris, probably higher chance of being stopped and having papers checked.  Why risk having your attack spoiled by failing a simple traffic stop ?

       True, to get into most pubs and clubs in the bigger cities in the UK you need to have your passport or drivers license for the ID scan machines.  As part of licensing laws

       Interesting, I don't think they do that in bars and clubs here in Spain, hasn't happened to me.  I've seen signs in casinos saying you have to show passport.

       A Syrian passport is USELESS if you want the cops to leave you alone.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_Syrian_citizens">
        You need a visa as a Syrian to be allowed in France.
       </a>
       . Did the terrorists asked for the extra paperwork and stamps? probably not.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're driving, you need a driver's licence. A valid one that is. Insurance, documents that prove the car is yours. I know because I've been stopped as a driver in France more than once (my car is a falling apart, probably why).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then cops DO NOT have the time to stop every single tourist to make sure they're not illegals overstaying. There's just too many people in Paris. If you want to evade cops, might as well mug some French Arab guy on a supermarket parking lot and take his documents . It would make more sense.

       Good point that you need more than a passport to drive.  But your passengers need only a passport.

       I imagine gunshots and the cop going off the air and maybe the cop shooting into your car and people around calling other cops would kind of make it hard for you to continue driving to the concert and getting in and doing your thing.

       Especially like 9/11. It is really amazing how far we have gotten along the war on terror and people till this day don't know the truth about 9/11.

       Well you carry your main identifying papers with you in case you get stopped on the way and those little mistakes can screw the entire operations timing.  Everyone must be at the location on time and no one can be detaining before. so have everything you need to get to the check point.. Once there it doesn't matter. Put on the mask to instill fear and chain the exits..

       You just need papers to get you to the location.  Fake or real.. what ever passes..  You cannot get stopped without any identifying papers that would cause them to search you..
      </p>
      <p>
       Get to the check point.  No matter what don't be dumb and blow it by making  a wrong turn  and getting pulled over.. or locking your keys in your car..
      </p>
      <p>
       Also.. Europe is not like america.. In Europe you can jump between countries pretty quickly and the need to carry a passport is more necessary than here where you have to travel Hundreds of miles to reach a boarder that requires a passport for entry.

       “And the terrorists were very calm…and they reloaded three to four times their weapons. They didn’t shout anything. They didn’t say anything. They were in masks. They were wearing black clothes,” the witness said.

       The terrorists used fake Syrian passports because they want you to believe they were refugees and start a war with refugees in Europe. What ISIS hates most is Apostates and they consider all refugees to be Apostates. They want Europeans to kill the refugees for them.

       IS don't care about being martyrs in eyes of anyone except themselves and for that they don't need Id's.
In IS they burn Id's. Lots of videos about that if you want proof.

      <p>
       I believe the ID's where strictly for identifications to enter the concert.
How it survived a bomb belt is a different question.

       well you pretty much were the belt around your waist and you keep your ID in your pocket, waist area?

       Well it's a pretty small detail that could jeopardize the huge operation. If they can't get in then how are they going to do this efficiently. If the just rushed in and started shooting they wouldn't have anyone covering the emergency exits etc. Whole thing would be over quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is just speculation from my side. I have more questions how the passports survived the suicide.

       Why did the 3 kamikaze who blew themselves up at the Stade de France (footbal stadium where the France-Germany game was being played) did so in isolated places, and killed only 1 person, if their objective was to cause terror ?
      </p>
      <p>
       If their goal was to cause a maximum of damage, they could have blown themselves up before the game, where the crowd was queuing. Or at the end of the game where everyone was leaving, or at the closest metro station, which was likely very crowded.

       who wins out of it? where was oil found recently? Golen heights. So what one side wants is the destruction of Syria so they can land grab, but they need the world in on it.
the plan, kidnap Syrian refugees blow them up out front of places, not inside as seen, dead men cant walk.

       World seems to have plenty of oil.  Price is low.  Oil found in Arctic, off Cuba, off Falklands, tar sands in Canada.  Production in Iraq and Libya is below normal levels, so that's another source that will come back online someday.  Anything found in Golan Heights would be tiny, as well as a huge hassle to protect while being extracted and transported.

       a false flag is not (necessarily) fake terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       a false flag simply means the event is falsely blamed on a group that (in practice) has very little (if anything) to do with the planning/funding/execution of the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       i.e., fake passports are used to blame non-participants.  (false flag)

       There have been loads of stories about refugees tearing up their real papers (usually non-Syrian) and getting false papers, so they have a better chance of being allowed to stay in Germany or wherever.  False papers are a huge business in Turkey.  Along with selling lifejackets and rafts for the crossing to Greece, etc.

       Masks probably for intimidation value.  Although some of the attackers did escape alive.

       Masks are for concealing one's identity, something you wouldn't need to do if you had actual strong religious conviction about what you are doing.   The terrorists could be wearing a Richard Nixon or an Obama mask or a rainbow clown wig, it wouldn't matter.

       While it is odd, one answer could relate to why cops wear sunglasses or masks when their names are exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blocking ones face helps to dehumanize the the aggressor making the actions easier to stomach.

       People who fall for this kind of simplistic "proof" are obviously Americans who don't know how often minorities are asked to provide ID in Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are required to carry ID on them at all times in many countries in Europe.  If the people making these claims about it being "suspicious" that the terrorists were carrying passports had spent time in Europe beyond darting between tourist destinations they would see police officers constantly stopping minorities and asking for ID.
      </p>
      <p>
       So much for critical thought in this place ... it's filled with one-dimensional simplistic explanations for incredibly complicated issues.

       Try providing a fake ID next time the police pull you over.  Let us know how well that goes for you ;)

      <p>
       True, but that are not required to leave said ID at the crime scene.  Quite the opposite, most professional criminals will tell you:  Leave behind zero evidence unless you are planting it to distract.

       Do you live in Europe?  Have you had your passport checked here?  Do you know the process?  Are you aware that for minorities they usually just check the validity of the paper form of the visa and don't necessarily cross-check it in the central database?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have been checked, which European countries have you had your passport checked in during a random stop?  What was the procedure?  Fortunately (or unfortunately) I've had mine checked many times, I'd be happy to hear how your experiences differe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, do you have a valid European driving licence?  When pulled over in Europe, were you asked to provide your passport as well, or were you only required to provide your licence?  If you were also asked to provide your passport, what were the circumstances?

       The issue is many people don't give a shit about evidence, George W Bush himself could step up on stage tomorrow and announce that he was working with the CIA to plan and execute 9/11, and then provide a photo of him in a conference room with McCain, CIA members shaking Osamas hand with a dry erase board with info only the planners would know clearly visible in the background, and people
       <em>

       I haven't lost total hope, just part of accepting thay some people simply don't want to or can't be woken up. I could spend my entire day explaining to a tree stump why 911 was a false flag attack and an inside job, tree stump isn't going to suddenly march out and protest, doesn't mean I'm wrong or said anything wrong, just what could you even expect a tree stump to do?

       I'd honestly wager half of what is talked about here isn't believed by many. I used to talk about how I thought Israel would nuke a US city and blame it on Iran during the deal that was going on, but I didn't really believe it, if I had you wouldn't be reading this because I'd still be hiding out in a bunker somewhere.
