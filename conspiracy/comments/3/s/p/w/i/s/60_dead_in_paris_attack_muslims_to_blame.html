       I'm not saying it's anything other than what the MSM claims it to be. Just trying to think of all the scenarios or possibilities, so I can discern the bullshit from the truth. Critical thinking, you know....

       Absolutely agreed. I have a real hard time believing anything the MSM says, though. I've found that this sub has actually become the best source of news I can find these days. Granted, there is a lot of bullshit, but by and large, there are some pretty decent sources of news here.

       Just the circumstances, I have no "hard" evidence other than my gut and events leading up to tonight.

       The millions of "refugees" allowed into Europe. It just feels a little too convenient to me that all these refugees are allowed in, and then this happens on the day we get Jihadi John. It's Friday the 13th and most of us who believe in an NWO/Illuminati also believe they are very heavy into the Occult and numerology.

       Don't you think jumping to conclusions without evidence is detrimental to the discussion? Sounds like you've made up your mind before knowing anything about the situation. Thats a bad habit to get into.

       Your opinion is yours. Mine is mine.

       I like how you ignored when I said "i have little doubt", thus implying I actually have some doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also pretty odd how you ignored that I said "I could be wrong, and probably am". I'm sorry, I missed the part in which air-tight evidence is required to enter a discussion. Opinions form discussion, if you don't like my opinion, or belief, then you are in no way obligated to reply to me, or entertain me. By all means, feel free to scroll on by anything I say if it bothers you. I truly do not mean to start shit, or be an ass.
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate and understand your point, I really do, but I'm also not being hateful, or in any way disrespectful to the thread or discussion, or anyone in the thread, as such, why come after me with things like "it's a bad habit to form"? Thanks for the advice, but I have a pretty good handle on how to make decisions in regards to what I believe and think.

       Clearly, I am not the only person in this thread who thinks this has false flag written all over it. I haven't seen you comment or reply to them yet..

       I didn't ignore it, but when you use that to follow a statement that is a bold claim, it implies the doubt is minimal at most. I found that odd considering so little details are known. As of the time of your commenting, the media wasnt even reporting on possible perpetrators aside from reports of Islamic expressions.

       You made a claim. You said, with little doubt, that this was a false flag. That's a claim. And yes, I think generally people ask for evidence when you make a claim.

      <p>
       I feel it is important to express skepticism regarding all claims. Yours in particular appeared to completely lack evidence, so I questioned you about it.

       Because skepticism is important. It is a sad day when questioning assertions is considered bad form in r/conspiracy of all places. I thought that was the point.

       I would just watch my wording I guess. Your first comment was worded like a confident claim, not a cautious suspicion. When you make an assertion, people will ask for evidence.

       No shit, but people in this sub claim false flag with no evidence within 5 minutes of every high profile world event. Doesn't mean they are supported by evidence. Just like Charlie Hebdo, I'm sure this sub will be filled with claims that Jews did this shortly.

       I don't value them much in global issues, especially when I am able to recognize that at the moment, next to no information is available. Most importantly, I have to realize that my gut can be flawed, and thus I must measure my speculation accordingly, in order to be intellectually responsible. I don't believe you made this attempt whatsoever in your comment, so I felt it necessary to question it.

       Your claim of a false flag relies on a MSM story, as the theory implies that this story is false. When you don't even have an official story yet, a claim of a false flag is absurd.

       I don't buy it. Do you believe all Islamic terrorism is America/Israeli run? If so, since when had it been so? We know that the US sometimes supports para-military groups if they oppose the US's enemies, but what reason do we have to believe that US actually controls organizations like ISIS, and can decide their targets?

       The vast majority of it in Europe and the US is, yes. From the first bombing of the WTC in the 90s to 9/11 and after. Every single Muslim "terrorist" incident busted by the FBI in the US was setup by the FBI in the first place.

       Whatever "Islamic terrorist" is in Europe is on the payroll of Soros or someone of his ilk.

       So if a genuine terrorist organization were to murder dozens of people in Paris, everyone will quickly forget about it, whereas if George Soros does it, people would think it is important?

       Unfortunately this is what happens when you let Muslims in your country. They are not there as immigrants they are there to conquer france ,and the rest of the world. That is the plan of all the so called immigrants ,wake up people before it's too late ,and they are bombing and shooting up your town.
