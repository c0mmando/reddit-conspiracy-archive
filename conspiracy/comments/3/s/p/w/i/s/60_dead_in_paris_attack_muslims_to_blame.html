<p>The millions of &quot;refugees&quot; allowed into Europe. It just feels a little too convenient to me that all these refugees are allowed in, and then this happens on the day we get Jihadi John.

<p>But evidence and facts are not. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t ignore it, but when you use that to follow a statement that is a bold claim, it implies the doubt is minimal at most. I found that odd considering so little details are known. As of the time of your commenting, the media wasnt even reporting on possible perpetrators aside from reports of Islamic expressions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also pretty odd how you ignored that I said &quot;I could be wrong, and probably am&quot;.</p>

<p>You only conceded that after I called out your evidenceless claim though. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sorry, I missed the part in which air-tight evidence is required to enter a discussion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You made a claim. You said, with little doubt, that this was a false flag. That&#39;s a claim. And yes, I think generally people ask for evidence when you make a claim.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I feel it is important to express skepticism regarding all claims. Yours in particular appeared to completely lack evidence, so I questioned you about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I appreciate and understand your point, I really do, but I&#39;m also not being hateful, or in any way disrespectful to the thread or discussion, or anyone in the thread, as such, why come after me with things like &quot;it&#39;s a bad habit to form&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because skepticism is important. It is a sad day when questioning assertions is considered bad form in r/conspiracy of all places. I thought that was the point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the advice, but I have a pretty good handle on how to make decisions in regards to what I believe and think. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would just watch my wording I guess. Your first comment was worded like a confident claim, not a cautious suspicion. When you make an assertion, people will ask for evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, I am not the only person in this thread who thinks this has false flag written all over it. I haven&#39;t seen you comment or reply to them yet..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No shit, but people in this sub claim false flag with no evidence within 5 minutes of every high profile world event. Doesn&#39;t mean they are supported by evidence. Just like Charlie Hebdo, I&#39;m sure this sub will be filled with claims that Jews did this shortly. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gut instincts exist for a reason, and I tend to listen to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t value them much in global issues, especially when I am able to recognize that at the moment, next to no information is available. Most importantly, I have to realize that my gut can be flawed, and thus I must measure my speculation accordingly, in order to be intellectually responsible. I don&#39;t believe you made this attempt whatsoever in your comment, so I felt it necessary to question it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regardless of any &quot;facts&quot; we are force fed by the MSM. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your claim of a false flag relies on a MSM story, as the theory implies that this story is false. When you don&#39;t even have an official story yet, a claim of a false flag is absurd.</p>

<p>The vast majority of it in Europe and the US is, yes. From the first bombing of the WTC in the 90s to 9/11 and after. Every single Muslim &quot;terrorist&quot; incident busted by the FBI in the US was setup by the FBI in the first place. </p>
