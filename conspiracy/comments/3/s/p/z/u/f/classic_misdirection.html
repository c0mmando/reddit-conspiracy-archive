       The TPP is already not being discussed at all by the media. The race issue immediately replaced it on the news cycle. This Paris thing may be endless fuel for the news cycle. Watch the misdirection. Watch the control.

       I honestly think the whole Starbucks thing is just a marketing scheme made up by Starbucks. I haven't heard of one single person make a big deal about the cups until it hit on social media. Seriously, I don't think one single person gives a flying fuck that there are no snowflakes on the cup.

       Yes, but in the big picture we really can't. The government/whoever is in control of all this shit has basically everything in their hands and no "movement" from the people will stop anything. As much as I support fighting against the government when shit isn't right, I think that the 1-2% of the population that stand up would have 0 impact on anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost everybody I come across has no interest/are so closed minded about everything the government are doing to the populace that I don't think anyone really has any say at all.

       What do you think 'the government' is doing?  Is the USPS mailing bombs while the Federal Bureau of Prisons is giving psychopaths tans, bombs and guns and sneaking them into Paris with the help of the Coast Guard and telling them to kill a bunch of random people so France will sign up with the TPP?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is it possible the terrorists who have already attacked Paris, repeatedly, are simply trying again?

       in France there's people who blame the refugees, but plenty are also aware this is dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the news in France they keep on saying AK-47s were used. When they
       <a href="https://youtu.be/5ONh6AsNfL0?t=4">
        show you an "AK" on French tv, it's very often a VZ 58, a totally different Czech weapon.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But people are victims to the Gell-Mann effect especially when they hear these tragic news.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect works as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray’s case, physics. In mine, show business.
        <strong>
         You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues
        </strong>
        . Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward–reversing cause and effect. I call these the “wet streets cause rain” stories. Paper’s full of them.
       </p>
       <p>
        In any case,
        <strong>
         you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story–and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read with renewed interest as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about far-off Palestine than it was about the story you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        That is the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. I’d point out it does not operate in other arenas of life.
        <strong>
         In ordinary life, if somebody consistently exaggerates or lies to you, you soon discount everything they say
        </strong>
        . In court, there is the legal doctrine of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus, which means untruthful in one part, untruthful in all.
But when it comes to the media, we believe against evidence that it is probably worth our time to read other parts of the paper. When, in fact, it almost certainly isn’t. The only possible explanation for our behavior is amnesia.
       </p>

       Recent events - The US was exposed waging a fake war against ISIS. US, Israel, Saudi backing of ISIS.

       Russian plane crash US prematurely tries to decide what happened before the truth came out.

       ISIS, the Wests proxy terrorist army that is trying to take out Syria's Assad is getting blown to bits by Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       How else are the powers going to have an excuse to put boots on the ground in Syria and take over where ISIS failed? Massive false flag attack by none other than ISIS, the bad guys for any occasion except they are really us...it's their pathetically over used tactic and anyone who has been paying attention can see through this bullshit.

       You've summed it up perfectly. No doubt the terrorists themselves are genuine jihadist fanatics. But they are also tools of those who want "boots on the ground" in Syria.

       You think the grunts at the bottom really know who's at the very top? They just know their 'boss' said to go, and maybe that their boss's boss said to go or whatever. But go high enough and it's a whole different ballgame.

       I agree. Grunts still got hearts and minds. These can be corrupted of course, even through religion in order to achieve and end. My point is that the layers needed would so many and so deep, I just don't think all those people can keep that secret.
