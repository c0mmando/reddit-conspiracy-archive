The government/whoever is in control of all this shit has basically everything in their hands and no &quot;movement&quot; from the people will stop anything.

<p>Almost everybody I come across has no interest/are so closed minded about everything the government are doing to the populace that I don&#39;t think anyone really has any say at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>in France there&#39;s people who blame the refugees, but plenty are also aware this is dumb.</p>

<p>On the news in France they keep on saying AK-47s were used. When they <a href="https://youtu.be/5ONh6AsNfL0?t=4">show you an &quot;AK&quot; on French tv, it&#39;s very often a VZ 58, a totally different Czech weapon.</a></p>

<p>But people are victims to the Gell-Mann effect especially when they hear these tragic news. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect works as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray’s case, physics. In mine, show business. <strong>You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues</strong>. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward–reversing cause and effect. I call these the “wet streets cause rain” stories. Paper’s full of them.</p>

<p>In any case, <strong>you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story–and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read with renewed interest as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about far-off Palestine than it was about the story you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.</strong></p>

<p>That is the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. I’d point out it does not operate in other arenas of life. <strong>In ordinary life, if somebody consistently exaggerates or lies to you, you soon discount everything they say</strong>. In court, there is the legal doctrine of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus, which means untruthful in one part, untruthful in all.
But when it comes to the media, we believe against evidence that it is probably worth our time to read other parts of the paper. When, in fact, it almost certainly isn’t. The only possible explanation for our behavior is amnesia.</p>
