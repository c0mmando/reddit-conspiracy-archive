<p>The New York City skyline is clearly visible from Harriman State Park’s Bear Mountain 60 miles away. If Earth were a ball 25,000 miles in circumference, viewing from Bear Mountain’s 1,283 foot summit, the Pythagorean Theorem determining distance to the horizon being 1.23 times the square root of the height in feet, the NYC skyline should be invisible behind 170 feet of curved Earth.</p>

<p>Except it&#39;s not, and this just proves how little you question your own claims since this is an error that keeps getting repeated by people mindlessly copy-pasting Dubay&#39;s arguments.</p>

<p>Search for &quot;Bear mountain&quot; <a href="http://www.daftlogic.com/projects-google-maps-distance-calculator.htm">here</a> and check the distance to NYC yourself. I chose the downtown area for the maximum distance, and even that is just <em>40</em> miles, not 60, which if you calculate horizon drop (8 <del>feet</del> inches per mile, I believe) and factor in the actual height of Bear Mountain (around 1330 feet) gives you a result of...</p>

<p><strong><em>0</em></strong> feet hidden.</p>

<p>There is absolutely nothing that states you should not be able to see the NYC skyline from the top of Bear mountain. Dubay is using false numbers, isn&#39;t checking his facts, and is propagating outright falsehoods as truth, which is getting blindly accepted and copied over by people like you.</p>

How about even if you dont want to watch the full video id say watch the last 10-15 minutes. That was my favortie part of the video</p>

<p>Edit: ok fair enough, i didnt actually gove an example in this post. How about this one</p>

<p>There are rivers that flow for hundreds of miles towards the level of the sea without falling more than a few feet - notably, the Nile, which, in a thousand miles, falls but a foot. A level expanse of this extent is quite incompatible with the idea of the Earth&#39;s &quot;convexity.&quot; It is, therefore, a reasonable proof that Earth is not a globe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok I&#39;ll debunk one of his points where he says that the curvature of the Earth isn&#39;t taken into account into engineering projects.</p>

<p>Partially true because most big projects allow for small errors. But in the case of a high precision giant engineering project like the CERN this has to be taken into account :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To make matters more complex from a visualisation and planning perspective, the curvature of the earth has to be taken into consideration in any future design path. This means that the “flattened” satellite imagery available across the diameter of any potential alignment for the FCC has to be compensated for in the virtual modelling. This curvature (3D) versus flattening (2D) effect <strong>accounts for a differential of up to 100m across the diameter of an 80-100km ring</strong>, and the alignment is further restricted by a maximum slope of 1-1.5% across the whole circumference for the complicated cryogenic and magnet installations to work effectively.</p>

<p>“It gets quite complicated because if we were to use sea level as our reference point this would imply horizontal. <strong>If it were the same distance above sea level around the ring then you would not be in the same plane because the machine would be following the earth’s curvature,”</strong> said Osborne. The best way to imagine it, he explained, is to think of the FCC as an enormous fixed disc that needs to be sunk in its entirety into the earth in order for it to be in the same plane.</p>

<p>With the effect of the earth’s curvature having considerably greater impact upon the necessary depth considerations for the larger FCC as compared to the 27km LHC, early calculations show that for an 80km ring, and to remain within slope parameters, the shafts might have to be at an average depth of 270m with a maximum overburden along the tunnels of up to 670m. This compares to an average shaft depth of 100m for the LCC, and a largest overburden of 170m.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright explain this one to me</p>

<p>So over a given distance of D miles, the curvature is approximately 8&quot; per mile squared, or curvature = (D)2 x 8&quot;. 1 mile should drop 8 inches, 2 would be 32&quot;, 3 miles would be 72&quot;, etc. This measures the expected drop from the horizon to where the flat horizon would be.</p>

<p>Once you are familiar with the calculations all you need is a tower or a lighthouse or even a tall building next to a body of water.</p>

<p>The Port Nicholson Light in New Zealand is 420 feet above sea-level and visible from 35 miles away which means it should be 220 feet below the horizon. The Egerö Light in Norway is 154 feet above high-water and visible from 28 statute miles where it should be 230 feet below the horizon. The Light at Madras, on the Esplanade, is 132 feet high and visible from 28 miles away, where it should be 250 feet below the line of sight. The Cordonan Light on the west coast of France is 207 feet high and visible from 31 miles away, putting it 280 feet below the line of sight. The light at Cape Bonavista, Newfoundland is 150 feet above sea-level and visible at 35 miles, where it should be 491 feet below the horizon. And the lighthouse steeple of St. Botolph’s Parish Church in Boston is 290 feet tall and visible from over 40 miles away, where it should be hidden a full 800 feet below the horizon!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of those &quot;X is visible from X miles away&quot; arguments always leave out a crucial detail: from what height was object X viewed from?</p>

<p>The distance by which an object is obscured by the horizon is given in terms of if your eyeball was perfectly level with the ground/ocean but I would wager that sailors are not hopping out of their boats to look for the light house with their eyes at Sea Level.  Instead, these folks are viewing these objects from vantage points above seal level on their boats, right?</p>

<p>Basically, all of these are simply tricks of math.  The calculation assumes an observer with eyes on the ground and the actual observations are performed with eyes 10, 20, 30 feet above sea level which changes the expected amount of obscuring completely.</p>

<p>So, go ahead and get back to me with the actual elevation above sea level from which these observations were performed and we can check the math.  You should be VERY curious as to why none of your examples include the most relevant piece of data: the actual height from which these observations were made.  Everyone of them is quite explainable if we know the height of the observer, but all of them mysteriously leave out that detail and without it the math tells us nothing.  Curious that people interested in &quot;finding the truth&quot; are leaving out critical pieces of info in their arguments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It appears as though you failed to read the rest of the article, which is unfortunate.  Here are specific measurements:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At 1,000 yards the Coriolis deflection is small but not necessarily trivial. Una computed that at the latitude of Sacramento, a bullet traveling 1,000 yards would be deflected about three inches to the right. In addition, because gravity pulls the bullet down as it flies, you’d have to aim higher or lower depending on the degree to which you were facing east or west. If you were firing due east, you’d have to aim six inches lower, since the earth is rotating toward you, meaning your target would be slightly closer by the time the bullet arrived. If you were firing due west, you’d have to aim six inches higher.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would also seem as though you are unfamiliar with how the word &quot;esoteric&quot; is being used in the case of your argument if you think it provides any sort of counter argument.  I&#39;d suggest looking up a definition so you don&#39;t conflate it with &quot;non-existent&quot; in the future.</p>

<p>Regardless, the article gives tangible numbers for the amount of adjustment needed to be made due to the Coriolis effect.  The fact that it isn&#39;t very big doesn&#39;t negate the fact that it exists.  We&#39;re talking about 1,000 yards in the article, the effect is much greater over larger distances.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not entirely sure what your point is otherwise.  The article clearly states the adjustments needed to be made due to the Coriolis effect, you seem to have glazed over that fact.</p>

<p>The proof of the Coriolis Effect through experimentation comes from Foucault&#39;s Pendulum, which you can make yourself.  The effects of the Coriolis Effect on extremely-long range shooting is incredibly small and difficult to verify experimentally due to a number of factors.  But if you are interested in looking at the math behind it, this thread contains some relevant equations:</p>

<p>Yup, and I&#39;m sure if somebody conducted the Foucault&#39;s Pendulum experiment in Sacramento it would match with Una&#39;s calculations.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How do you explain gravity? Please don&#39;t use &#39;dense things sink&#39; because that only happens because of gravity.</p></li>
<li><p>We can measure the curvature of the Earth at distances far less than 1 mile. Explain please?</p></li>
<li><p>Tall structures diverge with height. This is because of the Earth&#39;s curvature. What&#39;s your explanation?</p></li>
<li><p>If the Earth is flat how does the Sun disappear below the horizon every day. On a flat plane, that&#39;s impossible.</p></li>
<li><p>How do you explain the precession of the equinoxes if the Earth is flat?</p></li>

<p>That&#39;s not an explanation. </p>

<p>It&#39;s simple. The Earth&#39;s curvature is 8 inches over 1 mile and we can measure that. At half a mile its curvature is 2 inches. We can measure that. If the Earth is flat, explain this curvature we can measure everywhere?</p>

<p>That&#39;s nonsense. We can measure the divergence in tall structures that are metres apart. If you build two vertical towers, masts or columns close together, the distance between them at the top is greater than at the bottom. And it&#39;s measurable. And it&#39;s because the Earth has curvature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>See answer 3. The same applies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t. On a flat plane, an object above that plane can never sit below the horizon. And at sunset you can watch the sun drop below the horizon. In fact you can see half the sun above and half below. That&#39;s an impossibility on a flat plane if the sun is above the plane.</p>

<p>So how about trying again with those 4.</p>

<p>You want me to spend 2 hours of my life watching your video but you can&#39;t answer 4 very basic questions? If you can&#39;t answer these I can&#39;t imagine there&#39;ll be anything credible in the video.</p>

<p>Also, you ignored the precession of the equinoxes for some reason?</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The horizon always appears perfectly flat 360 degrees around the observer, regardless of altitude. All amateur balloon, rocket, plane and drone footage show a completely flat horizon over 20 plus miles high.</li>
</ol>

<p>Oh, really? Here is a photo taken by a student using a cheap helium balloon:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/09/article-0-14EB936F000005DC-819_634x475.jpg">http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/09/article-0-14EB936F000005DC-819_634x475.jpg</a></p>

<p>Here is the article it is from:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Adam Cudworth, 19, of Ombersley, Worcestershire, managed to capture these incredible views of the earth from space - using little more than a balloon and a second-hand £30 camera bought on eBay.</p>

<p>You can clearly see the curvature of the earth without even resorting to a ruler or straight edge. </p>

<p>Here are more similar photos:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A variety of reasons - chief among them could be whether a camera has wide angle, telephoto, or regular lens on it. Telephoto in particular would be good at showing some detail, but due to the innate way the lens bends light, it doesn&#39;t show as wide a view, and therefore would be less likely to show the curvature that would normally be visible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ball-believers often claim “gravity” magically and inexplicably drags the entire lower-atmosphere of the Earth in perfect synchronization up to some undetermined height where this progressively faster spinning atmosphere gives way to the non-spinning, non-gravitized, non-atmosphere of infinite vacuum space. Such non-sensical theories are debunked, however, by rain, fireworks, birds, bugs, clouds, smoke, planes and projectiles all of which would behave very differently if both the ball-Earth and its atmosphere were constantly spinning Eastwards at 1000mph.</p>

<p>If Earth and its atmosphere were constantly spinning eastwards over 1000mph then North/South facing cannons should establish a control while East-firing cannonballs should fall significantly farther than all others while West-firing cannonballs should fall significantly closer.

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3recgp/121000_feet_little_piggy_cam_high_altitude/cwnbbxp">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3recgp/121000_feet_little_piggy_cam_high_altitude/cwnbbxp</a></p>

<p>Interesting that he still went with 5 &quot;questions&quot; even though this time this one: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explain how circumnavigating the world at the equator is a longer journey than circumnavigating further south. And the further south, the shorter the circumnavigation distance. Which is totally contrary to the flat earth map you guys base your theory on. According to that map, the distance should increase at increasingly southern latitudes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the Earth is flat how does the Sun disappear below the horizon every day. On a flat plane, that&#39;s impossible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess the former question wasn&#39;t quite strong enough for the top 5.</p>

<p>Anyone who is unwilling to engage the actual subject matter should not bother with discussion.  </p>

<p>He claims you are ignoring and making excuses but I guess he doesn&#39;t have to respond to my question, presumably because the burden of proof lies on us.  </p>

<p>Regardless of the shape of the Earth, the process of challenging your most deeply held beliefs is the mark of a strong mind.  Those that don&#39;t even wish to try are not worth having discussion with.</p>

<p>Every structure does so. If a building&#39;s opposite walls are both &#39;plumb&#39; vertical they are further apart at the top than at the bottom. It&#39;s predictable and measurable.</p>

<p>Of course there&#39;s curvature at 6 miles. Again, it&#39;s predictable and measurable. At 6 miles it would be 288 inches, or 24 feet.</p>

<p>Examples of seeing objects when they &#39;should be&#39; below the horizon are typically because of light being refracted by air.</p>

<p>And there are times when the curvature of the Earth has to be engineered out of a construction project if they need to achieve a truly &#39;flat&#39; structure. </p>

<p>Easy to calculate but more difficult to observe.  You also didn&#39;t provide any source for that.  I am talking about an example.</p>

<p>Surveyors have to account for both curvature and refraction when taking measurements so you could check any website that&#39;s focussed on surveying or levelling techniques. Or you could speak to most civil engineers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If the opposing walls are both vertical, then they will be wider apart at the top than at the bottom.</p>

<p>If there is no difference in width with height, then the walls are not perfectly vertical.</p>

<p>In most buildings there&#39;s no need for the opposing walls to be perfectly vertical and the difference is so small it&#39;s of no consequence.</p>

<p>But in every building, one of the cases must be true.</p>

<p>I work in commercial real estate.  I have asked multiple surveyors, architects, and my father who is a developer.  No one I have polled has ever taken curvature into account in their buildings.  I have been trying to figure out why, but you seem to believe that they do, so I am even more puzzled as to how you came to that conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Over the size of a standard building the curve is negligible.  But, every Surveyor&#39;s equipment STILL compensates for it.  Look at any piece of survey gear -- they now have built-in functionality (It used to have to be done mathematically by hand) for this. Look at any Surveying textbook and you&#39;ll see that every Land Surveyor on Earth is taught how to account for the curve.  Without doing this their surveys are inaccurate. I was a surveyor&#39;s assistant doing Mining Claims in the Western US in the summer of 2004.</p>

<p>So the device measures and compensates for the curve but the Surveyor and Architect need not take it into account given the relatively small size of the building compared to the Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know this.  But I think a previous commenter was incorrect when he stated that the beams would be farther apart at the tops than at the the bottoms.  This is always true with free standing pillars like we see on bridges, but I don&#39;t think it would be true with a building because there would be other materials (walls and such) that would ensure the beams remain parallel.  But of course, the distance between beams in a building is so small that even if they exhibited the curve the would likely only be fractions of a millimeter further apart at the tops than at the bottom.</p>

<p>You see, the problem with your statement is that refraction and curvature are adjusted for after the fact.  The only problem--from there--is that I can&#39;t seem to find an equation anywhere that separates and computes both variables independently of one another. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have the keyboard symbols handy, so I will simply describe the adjustment as the change in height being equal to .0067 * distance<sup>2.</sup></p>

<p>.0206 * D<sup>2</sup> = (C - r)</p>

<p>Ok, now a discussion can actually take place.  </p>

<p><strong>Questions for the flat-earthers</strong>:you see any issue with the above equation being offered as leading logically and solely to the conclusion DethFiesta now asserts?  Can you envision any limitations at all?</p>

<p>What would be the practical impact of ignoring this adjustment?  Do reasonable workarounds exist, and if so 1) what are they and 2) what might those workarounds themselves imply?</p>

<p>However, it isn&#39;t hard to prove the Flat Earth wrong. I&#39;ve challenged Jeranism, Stars Are Souls, MrThriveandSurvive, and Dubay to reconcile the existence of the 2 celestial poles with the Flat Earth and all of them FAILED.  LOL.</p>

<p>There are 2 celestial poles.  A Flat Earth where everyone lived on the same side would only have 1 celestial poles and that pole would be visible everywhere on Earth.  In this world, each pole is only visible from that hemisphere.  In short, we see exactly what we expect on a Round Earth and what we see is impossibe to explain on a Flat Earth:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because stupid things are funny. It&#39;s because watching people contort themselves while believing they can do something they plainly, obviously cannot do, is amusing.</p>

<p>The value and worth of an idea <em>is not</em> measured by the amount of resistance to it. That is <em>absolutely abhorrent</em> logic. The value and worth of an idea <em>is</em> measured by the facts that support it, or the arguments and logic that can successfully defend it. In the case of flat earth, there are no facts that support it and the arguments that <em>claim</em> to prove it are all easily disprovable and sometimes laughably ignorant right from the start.</p>

<p>If you mainly believe someone&#39;s claims or ideas have merit <em>because</em> other people can easily and effectively challenge or even disprove them, then you&#39;re simply doing things wrong. You&#39;re only ever going to believe things that are false, because the more false they are, the easier it will be to argue against it, and thus the more people will be doing just that.</p>

<p>Flat earthers have a ton of amusement value because they believe things that are <em>so hilarious false</em> it&#39;s hard to even find a place to start taking them apart. They literally reject all of reality around them. They disbelieve gravity, physics, optics and anything else that happens to disagree with their beliefs, and replace all of it with <em>ad hoc</em> claims based on absolutely no facts or credible research whatsoever that aren&#39;t even consistent with each other. The same person can refuse to accept that light can bend (which explains certain phenomena on a globe earth, such as superior mirages) and then turn around to claim that &quot;<em>of course</em> light can bend, that&#39;s why we see red sunlight <em>under</em> clouds when the sun is still technically above them&quot;.</p>

<p>It is just absolute stupidity and/or ignrance on a scale so intense there&#39;s little to do but mock it and laugh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know this.  But I think a previous commenter was incorrect when he stated that the beams would be farther apart at the tops than at the the bottoms.  This is always true with free standing pillars like we see on bridges, but I don&#39;t think it would be true with a building because there would be other materials (walls and such) that would ensure the beams remain parallel.  But of course, the distance between beams in a building is so small that even if they exhibited the curve the would likely only be fractions of a millimeter further apart at the tops than at the bottom.</p>
