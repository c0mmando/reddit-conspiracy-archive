       Just wondering why people believe others testimony without any real evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you make fantastic claims, surely you need fantastic evidence to back it up. I am thinking of people like James casbolt,Sara Adams and max Spiers. All they have ever done is given testimony, yet so many people just accept what they're saying without seeing or asking to see any solid evidence. Just wondered what others thought.

       I am all for entertaining a thought. No question about that. But to accept it, one should seek strong tangible evidence. Anything else is foolish, in my opinion.

       Am mainly thinking of people who claim to have been part of mind control programs or secret projects. Or those who claim to have been on a spaceship. There is no evidence for those sort of claims. Some people just take their word for it, which seems foolish.

       Of course.. You can believe what you want. But it can't be accepted as truth if someone says they were part of a mind control program and have been on a spaceship. People can believe them, but it can't be held as the truth

       What makes you think people believe them and think its true? Most of us
       <em>
        entertain
       </em>
       thoughts here. Our jury remains out until a critical mass of circumstantial or other evidence, including plain logic and lessons from history cause us to come to a (fairly) solid conclusion. Such as on 911 and other topics.

       Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton , the Chair and Vice-Chair of the 9/11 Commission, made an astonishing admission in their book, Without Precedent – The Inside Story of the 9/11 Commission. They said,
      </p>
      <p>
       “It appeared to both of us that the [9-11] commission was set up to fail”.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzrv-e37Es8">
        http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzrv-e37Es8
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Kean and Hamilton, in the first chapter of the book titled, “Set Up to Fail,” explain their reasons for thinking this.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The late establishment and start of the commission itself. In fact, it took 441 days after the attacks and a Congressional mandate to force the Bush administration into a formal investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) There were numerous complications in obtaining security clearances for Commissioners and staff.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) There was a deadline for completion which did not allow the proper time to fulfill their mandate.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) The commission was severely underfunded. Only $3 million dollars was initially allocated, though two months later the Bush Administration reluctantly increased the total to $12 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) The commission had restricted access to important documents and witnesses. According to Hamilton, “… we were fighting the question of access right up to the end of the Commission’s work.”
      </p>
      <p>
       6) False testimony was given by NORAD officials, and
      </p>
      <p>
       7) The commission encountered obstruction by the CIA, and possibly the White House, over access to prisoners accused of having a role in the 9/11 plot.
      </p>
      <p>
       So then, the actual Chair and Vice-Chair of the 9/11 Commission have no faith in it, for good reasons. And yet you do, why is that?

       I guess it depends on the person, subject, and testimony they give.  I mean, eyewitness testimony is considered valid evidence in a court of law as one example.  If my best friend tells me about an experience he had, I'm going to assume he's telling me the truth as another example.

      <p>
       The main point is that what qualifies as "good evidence" to me may not qualify as "good evidence" to you, people have different opinions and thresholds.

       The real problem is much deeper and it relates to concept of "evidence". What is real evidence? Who/what is a trustworthy source?
      </p>
      <p>
       On this sub, many of us operate from a premise that no single source is 100% reliable or trustworthy. Do you believe everything your government tells you? Do you believe press releases, advertising and sponsored research issued by corporations (including pharmaceutical companies) are absolutely transparent, honest. I don't, so the key is to look at multiple sources and to be sceptical of those sources which clearly have an incentive to lie (or at least hide the truth).

       Those aren't sources, numbnuts. And if you think anything which is merely labelled "science" is 99.999% reliable, you are part of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science is a process, and there are countless issues within science, some absolutely fundamental (ie the origins of time and matter), which are contested.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that an enormous amount of scientific research is sponsored by pharmaceutical corporations, who have a naked commercial agenda. Even if the methodology employed during this research is objective and scientific, the publication of the results are, more often than not, withheld because those results don't support the sponsors agenda. Only favourable research or trial data is actually published. An organisation that withholds scientific data for commercial reasons is not doing science properly.

       Well I think I wasn't clear enough but what I really meant was that I trust in fundamental scientific theories for example: The laws of nature (Newton, Gravity, Light), the Chemical properties of materials, biological processes (photosynthesis as an easy example).
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientific theories are always true until proven wrong. And there are alot of scientific theories that have existed for a very long time which still haven't been proven wrong, and can almost be taken as a fact (Again maybe, Newtons laws as an example). Those I do trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same for scientific research. If the conclusion and/or process of the research can be proven wrong with concrete evidence, then I'll distrust the research. Doesn't matter if it's from a legit scientist or from a corporate funded (corrupt) scientist.

       gravity has really come into question lately and for good reason. the "what goes up must come down" is not in question  - but the fact that gravity keeps us stuck to a spinning ball and keeps all planets attracted to each other just enough is in question --- look into it. if you want to challenge your convictions the new I deas will do that for you.

       I don't know anything about the case you are reffering to, but from my perspective the vast majority of what we believe has no real evidence. if you don't bare witness to events yourself - or if you cant reproduce same scientific results with your own recources   - you are always choosing to believe without truly knowing.

       What kind of things might be an example of that? Things we accept without evidence that aren't fantastical claims. That's the difference,I think. A lot of personal claimed are wildly fantastical,so our threshold for evidence should be set very high when examining those claims.

       It should be set very high when a lot is at stake. For example, when we take away our rights, spend trillions of dollars, murder and torture people, and directly profit those that made the claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea what testimony you are describing, but we have spent trillions on a few conspiracy theories dreamt up by our government with zero corroboration. When you realize that this has been going on for decades and that our media refuses to discuss it, then you are required to seek sources that are willing to discuss it and extrapolate based on known instances to determine the validity of the claim rather than the "authority" or "credibility" of the source.

       we believe millions of people were killed in gas chambers in  WW2. and yet none of those gas chambers had the means necessary to operate, as gas chambers, American experts in gas chamber executions themselves have stated this. there is no explanation for how the gas chambers were operational - so no evidence, yet we KNOW they were used.

       One example, IMHO, is evolution.

      <p>
       I don't mean to say that it isn't true.  It's just that we cant recreate the results and we haven't found evidence of the "missing link" between humans and apes.  This is something that is widely accepted, yet only a very very small portion of the believers actually examine the concept using the scientific method.  I am not even sure how you could.

       There is a big difference between not knowing the evidence for something and asserting things about the subject based on your lack of knowledge. In this case I'd say that you are more arrogant then the people that just accept something because the majority do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evolution is a change in gene frequency over generations. It's a process that affect all life. The evolution of the human species is a result of this but it's not mutual to evolution. We could by all means know nothing at all about our lineage and still observe and understand evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evolution as a process will give different result depending on the time scale, but in the end it's the same old process. You can compare it to other processes like ageing. It's a slow process as well and if you compare two days you'll see no change, a week or a month won't do much either. But if you have 5, 10, 20, 50 or 70 years between your data points you will see bigger changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is that you in most cases can find out how and why certain things is accepted. Evolution is one of the most well substantiated scientific areas there is, anyone that can handle a computer is 30 seconds aways from thousands of scientific peer reviewed articles describing certain parts about evolution. They describe what we we have observed, what the process for doing so where and mostly who has repeated the same thing and come to the same conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       In science the peer review is very strong. Things don't just get spread because someone say so. That type of authority don't exist. 
Sure, as a layman you need some sort of trust for people what work in specific fields. But making that equals to saying that that trust unjustified and that you are almost being lied to is a very different thing.

       I said "IMHO," and I elaborated on why I hold the opinion that I do.  I am unsure how you perceived my position as arrogant.  I did not claim that evolution is not true, and I did not claim that anyone is lying about it.

       Yes, I read them. But initially you claimed this, showing that you'r image of evolution and science in general isn't that good.

       <p>
        I don't mean to say that it isn't true. It's just that we cant recreate the results and we haven't found evidence of the "missing link" between humans and apes. This is something that is widely accepted, yet only a very very small portion of the believers actually examine the concept using the scientific method. I am not even sure how you could.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       To which I explained what evolution is and why it's accepted. Being able to replicate something that has happened in the past is not a requirement for understanding it or knowing that it has occurred. Especially when the same thing goes on today.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also use the word "believers" which also is a very bad phrasing. You don't believe in things that is demonstrable. That Pluto orbit the sun or that we have plate tectonics which altering the land masses on our planets is not a belief because they are demonstrable. We can both see it happen and at least in one case we can see older results of it. The same thing goes for evolution.

       We've found like 5 "missing links" between humans and the last common ancestor between us and chimps. Evolution has lots and lots of evidence for it, so I'm not sure if that's a great example for you to use.

       I am familiar with that experiment.  It is extremely interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also like
       <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/105/12/4792.full">
        this example
       </a>
       of rapid evolution in lizards.
      </p>
      <p>
       A population of lizards are moved to a new environment and over a 36 year period their appearance and behavior is monitored.  The population that moved rapidly adapted to have larger jaw muscles to increase their bite force to make them better suited to survive in the new conditions.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        despite the fact that microevolutionary responses to environmental changes have been well documented, the unpredictability and reversibility of changes of morphological traits in fluctuating environments have raised questions regarding how these microscale changes can lead to the emergence of novel structures as seen on macroevolutionary scales.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The interesting thing to me is that despite the difference in appearance of the lizards, they are genetically indistinguishable.  Meaning that although they may have
       <em>
        evolved
       </em>
       in a sense, they did not change into a new species.  Just like your E. Coli example, the organisms adapt, but they don't become a new species.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure organisms are extremely adaptable, and perhaps we should call that phenomenon evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       But why are people so sure that we came from apes, when no organism we have ever observed has ever produced a new species of any kind that was capable of reproducing/thriving?

       Micro/macro evolution is a false distinction. There is only evolution.

       We aren't descended from apes, we share common ancestry.

       Micro or Macro, it doesn't matter what we call it.  The significant language to me is:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ...emergence of novel structures...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The succession of mutations that would have to occur to create any new sensory organ, say an eye ball, would have to be somehow advantageous to the organism throughout the entire process or else the trait would not survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine the randomly mutated evolutionary precursor to the eye ball.  It would be a mucousy area of the body that, if out of focus, would provide zero environmental advantage.  Not to mention that without utility, this region would be undesirable to a healthy potential mate. In order for an eye ball to emerge, it would have to emerge in a single birth, or else the trait would not survive due to natural selection.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we have never seen a useful novel structure emerge in any single birth in our entire recorded history, why do we assume that it happened to create every living organism on the planet?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I am not saying that evolution is not true, I am saying that people believe it despite not being able to verify, observe, or test it with the resources made available to them.

       The argument you're making seems like it's coming very close to the creationist argument of 'historic' vs. 'observable' science.

       If you're really interested in the evolution of functional morphology, Your Inner Fish is a great place to start. The documentary is great, and the book is even better. It's 3 parts, each about an hour if I remember correctly. Check it out.

       "missing link" is a misleading term. yes we've found creatures that show a combination of dna, so that could be seen as a "link" but there is yet to  be any proof that one actually evolved into the other. this is the problem with evolution theory. for all the sharing of dna - we have no record of one speciece turning into another. similarity is not the same as transition.  -- not saying evolution is disproven but I would say it has yet to be proven,

      <p>
       You make a good point about fantastic claims needing fantastic evidence. But think about this. In order to find that evidence (ie. to start actively looking for it), someone first has to be able to think that fantastic claim
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, in a case where there's a pile of evidence, someone has to be willing to imagine that a fantastic explanation might be the best one.

       A variation on the "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence" quote popularized by Carl Sagan. My problem with that is, who decides what's an extraordinary claim? By that logic, Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo would have required a lot more than maths and physics to prove that the earth revolved around the sun, since their claim that Ptolemy was wrong when his model stood unchallenged for 1500 years was indeed extraordinary. Of course, I agree with you that a claim requires evidence, I just don't agree with the "fantastic" part.

       I know right? I wondered why I ever believed the official 9/11 conspiracy theory that 19 men working under the direction of some guy in a cave in Afghanistan managed to subvert the most protected airspace in world history. I mean, that claim is pretty extraordinary. Yet apparently most actually believe that without "real evidence", and I did too for a couple of years, so it's a great question. I spent quite a bit of time trying to answer that over the years. The best answer I could come up with is that I believed it based on nothing more than faith in what  the media told me.

       That's the real shame. If something fits what people are interested in, or already believe, then they will tend to believe it... With no questions asked. I want to believe in as many true things as possible and as few false things as possible. One must surely rely on evidence for this.

       A lot of times, it's just a lack of education which leads to the lack of critical thinking. Then you see things like Flat Earth and chemtrails pop up around here with very little actual discussion/debunking. I've actually seen chemtrail believers assure others that contrails can't last more than a short time, but yet can't explain how clouds form. Seriously.

       So, you don't believe in chemtrails, therefore they do not exist? Regardless of recorded spraying chemicals from planes for all sorts of reasons in the past and present as well as all the patented means to do so for a variety of reasons that apparently aren't actually happening, according to you.

       I never said I didn't believe in chemtrails. Maybe you shouldn't jump to conclusions so quickly in the future, as your aggressive response makes you look quite foolish.

       No need to apologize though. I can tell you're passionate about this subject. As long as you help us clear up how clouds form with the more ignorant chemtrail believers, it'll make this sub that much stronger!

       Just as bad. Too many people just set up their stall and refuse to move from it. Even in the face of overwhelming evidence. That is the real definition of a bigot. We must rely on evidence. Things that can be verified..tested, demonstrated again. Recreated. That kind of tangible evidence.

       I guess it depends on the person, subject, and testimony they give.  I mean, eyewitness testimony is considered valid evidence in a court of law as one example.  If my best friend tells me about an experience he had, I'm going to assume he's telling me the truth as another example.

       The main point is that what qualifies as "good evidence" to me may not qualify as "good evidence" to you, people have different opinions and thresholds.

       If you're really interested in the evolution of functional morphology, Your Inner Fish is a great place to start. The documentary is great, and the book is even better. It's 3 parts, each about an hour if I remember correctly. Check it out.

       There is a big difference between not knowing the evidence for something and asserting things about the subject based on your lack of knowledge. In this case I'd say that you are more arrogant then the people that just accept something because the majority do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evolution is a change in gene frequency over generations. It's a process that affect all life. The evolution of the human species is a result of this but it's not mutual to evolution. We could by all means know nothing at all about our lineage and still observe and understand evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evolution as a process will give different result depending on the time scale, but in the end it's the same old process. You can compare it to other processes like ageing. It's a slow process as well and if you compare two days you'll see no change, a week or a month won't do much either. But if you have 5, 10, 20, 50 or 70 years between your data points you will see bigger changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is that you in most cases can find out how and why certain things is accepted. Evolution is one of the most well substantiated scientific areas there is, anyone that can handle a computer is 30 seconds aways from thousands of scientific peer reviewed articles describing certain parts about evolution. They describe what we we have observed, what the process for doing so where and mostly who has repeated the same thing and come to the same conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       In science the peer review is very strong. Things don't just get spread because someone say so. That type of authority don't exist. 
Sure, as a layman you need some sort of trust for people what work in specific fields. But making that equals to saying that that trust unjustified and that you are almost being lied to is a very different thing.
