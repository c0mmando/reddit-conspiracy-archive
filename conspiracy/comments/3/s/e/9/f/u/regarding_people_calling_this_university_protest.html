       While it would be easy to get going, what would the benefit possibly be here? Anything that would happen from this protest seems extremely small scale and strictly at their state level.

       It's not a psyop.  Dumbshit SJW and their peasant-skirt chasing beta-cuck orbiters are a real life, highly prevalent staple of 201X's culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only people who want you to think this is a psyop are the ones who don't want the era of their youth to be looked back upon with both (really either/or) pity and contempt.
      </p>
      <p>
       IOW, if they're screaming "psyop" it's only because they personally identify, and their identity is invested.

       Hahaha already did, brother. "White males oppressing minorities and white women." LOL. For what it's worth, I'm Hispanic and I wholeheartedly disagree with this person's statements. Do not take the race bait. Do not bend at false accusations of being a racist, sexist, xenophobe, etc. It's divide and conquer in action. Remember that.

       I'd be happy to. TRP is short for The Red Pill; a subreddit mostly used to discuss male sexual strategy. That's the majority of posts but what I find more useful is when feminism (aka cultural Marxism) is discussed. These guys aren't too fond of it &amp; won't hesitate to tear down the bullshit myths the feminists/SJW/cultural Marxists love to promote.
      </p>
      <p>
       DE or Dark Enlightenment talks about the progressive movement's myths without the sexual strategy stuff from TRP and takes it one step further. In a way, TRP is a prerequisite for the Dark Enlightenment. If these ideas or topics resonate with you, I recommend checking those subreddits and explore them yourself. See if it's any use to you. I do have to warn though, Dark Enlightenment gets a bad rep for supposedly being white supremists but that's total bullshit. I also recommend lurking for a while before posting because DE doesn't like their forum being cluttered with shit posts and TRP might tear you a new asshole if you're a pussy beta bitch boy. But you seem to "get it" so I doubt you have to worry about that. Hope this helps!

       Maybe if racist white males didn't oppress minorities and white women, they wouldn't share a common intrest. Thanks to all that racism, not only do minorities repopulate with white women, but they inadvertly stand by our anti-oppression goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Haha, looks like thousands of years of oppression is about to come to end. You thought by using all those off the wall words I wouldn't catch but I did.

       Nice quotes around racist, as if somehow it's a made up concept.

       Orly? Here is a quote from you describing minorities and white women who are anti-you.

       It was in the context that you used it, hence the quotations...

       Those described could be of any color.  You are the one now defining them as white women and minorities.  And you want to call others racist!

       Nice pull out method, but any educated black person knows exactly what you are trying to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the post you are commenting on is about a white male leaving racist threats on a university computer about blacks. Which than turned into a protest, accompanied by people of all races. So yea when you say
       <strong>
        SJW
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        Cuck
       </strong>
       I know exactly what you are trying to say.

       Ah so that's why white males are not outside the school walking around the school, playing war songs and threating blacks?
