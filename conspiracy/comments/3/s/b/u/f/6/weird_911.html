      <p>
       Y'know, "toasted cars", the sounds on the 34th floor, the firefighter who found a body in the closet, misc reports of car bombs around the country, "angel is next", etc etc etc

       About how they found the passports in the building wreckage  so they knew the name of the terrorist. Yep the steel holding up the buildings melted and collapses yet a paper document survived.

       What items did they recover from the planes? The only things you will find are items with an extremely high melting point. And even then there so few of them. But for a passport that was on board a plane that hit a building that then burned for hours and yet the passport came out completely unburned. I call total bullshit to the story .

       Exactly. Don't forget the iconic testimony from the firefighter who said everything was pulverized to dust, and the only thing he found was half a keypad from a phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bodies blown to bits - according to USA Today, "Three months after the World Trade Center attack, victims' families are being forced to face the ghastly possibility that many of the dead were 'vaporized,' as the medical examiner put it, and may never be identified." - yet fragile items which, coincidentally, were instrumental in swaying public opinion, were recovered unscathed? C'mon.

       Exactly. I just want a no bullshit answer to a few questions .  Just like a mass majority out there. No more lies. Not saying everything was a lie but I do know there where a lot of half truths being told and a few out right lies. WMD's  my ass. Terrorist...actually I'm starting to think they are killing us because we have been bombing the shit out of them for a few decades.

       and this one piece is conviently the one to incriminate the said terrorist!?

      <p>
       who in the end were never on the planes, because they were CIA remote controlled planes?

       all of them, and the three WTC building crumble with only 2 planes.

       so convinient, dont you think?

      <p>
       so many biaised informations in this event, that it was orchestrated. for the sole purpose to impose security contracts, go to war, fix the heroin problem in afghanistan, when i say fixing, im ean take control back of the puppy fields

       , the much needed pretext to kickstart a global empire exansion campaign AND a handy way for some real state people to get rid of a property oozing with hazardous waste (asbestos) while raking up a tidy insurance profit is so damn... pedestrian, so

       There's really no solid defense of the official story at this point beyond brute force, brainwashed bumper-sticker phrases, and emotional retorts. "9/11 was a day of firsts" ::rolls eyes::
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush even mentions the angel is next incident in his memoir (or whoever wrote it) - albeit as a "conspiracy theory", which is very curious. Also, rewatching his speech from the military base that morning clearly seems he was terrified about something BIG. Makes one wonder if there was a B-Plan that day that wasn't enacted...

       I've never heard about the body in the closet!
      </p>

       I'd like to discuss that.

       The passport found near Vesey Street BEFORE the towers fell.

       Saleh Ibn Abdul Rahman Hussayen stayed at the same hotel as Hani Hanjour, Khalid Almihdhar, and Nawaf Alhazmi on September 10th.

       On flights AA-11, UA-175 and AA-77 each had sets of brothers among the hijackers.

       The body in the closet is one of those, "Woah woah woah, go back to that thing you just said" moments. Hiding a murder in 9/11 wouldn't be too impossible, considering the magnanimity of the event... especially considering those who planned the attack obviously value redundancy and contingency like fuggedaboudit.

       What about the plane debris? Like the engine and landing gear. Also the human remains from all passengers onboard the flight? Is that not evidence?

       I've seen very little plane debris except tiny scraps of metal, which could have come from a missile , no passenger bodies, and no video surveillance. This is one of the most highly secure places on earth, and all we get is a grainy, jumpy video that doesn't show a plane. Sounds fishy to me.

       A plane engine could have come from a missile? How could that have happened? Also they found enough remains to identify the passengers. How do you explain that?

       I agree, relatively, with Skeptitron. I'm more interested in the unabashedly bizarre facts about the event more so than the hotly debated peculiar aspects. Take Flight 93, for example. There's definitely a considerable lack of debris at the site which many debunkers claim - well, the plane went down so fast at a nose-dive that the entire thing incinerated. Okay, "maybe". Day of firsts, ammirite? ;-) ;-)
      </p>
      <p>
       But dig this: There's photos going back to 1994 of a wing-shaped trench in Shanksville about 100 feet away from the 2001 "crash site". Although they're not exactly in the same position, the similarities are extremely curious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a few others I just thought of:
      </p>
      <p>
       The 5 Dancing Israelis recording the event from the beginning. They were arrested then quietly released. "Five of the Israelis came to the FBI's attention after they were seen by New Jersey residents on Sept. 11 making fun of the World Trade Center ruins and going to extreme lengths to photograph themselves in front of the wreckage. The FBI seized and developed their photos, one of which shows Sivan Kurzberg flicking a cigarette lighter in front of the smouldering ruins in an apparently celebratory gesture."
      </p>
      <p>
       And the van many police officers on the scene reported: “It’s a big truck with a mural painted of an airplane diving into New York City and exploding. Don’t know what’s in the truck. The truck is in between 6th and 7th on King Street.” I believe the van exploded?
      </p>
      <p>
       Many witnesses in Virginia witnessed the "plane" that "struck" the Pentagon coming in from the opposite direction! Fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ground of the Pentagon was broken for construction on September 11, 1941... exactly 60 years before the attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, and I guess I should mention H.W. Bush's "New World Order" mouth babble from September 11, 1990 :-p
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch was defeated on November 9th 1923, which in Europe is written 9/11/1923. Obviously may or may not be related. Kristallnacht also began on 9/11/1938 (European numeration). Minor curious footnote.
