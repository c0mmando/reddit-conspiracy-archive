       Pretty simple question. Does the United States of America still stand for what we were taught in school and told on TV? Does the United States of America really care about the citizens of this once great nation? Are you willing to still fight for our nation if, god forbid, there is a third world war? The answer (for me) is becoming harder and harder to answer.

       I'll point my guns at the people asking me to kill other people for the sake of their ego, lust for power and greed. The whole earth is one, we are but one united race, one consciousness. But I'm willing to kill the people who want to destroy that for the sake of the rest of us

       Yes but I won't defend those who started it because, as it is, our State Department and "allies" are trying like hell to get it going. We will have to start by bringing our "leaders" to account and not get suckered (again) with furious pseudo-patrism, misdirection, and propaganda thicker than petrified shit.

       If WWIII broke out the borders between all countrys will be gone.  The devastation from this level of war would pit us all against even our neighbor.  I would not be an American any longer but I hope I will still be a human holding onto my values of life and, hopefully, apply it to my own small piece of existance and hope others will do the same.

       WW3 will last a few days if that, and end when the world is radioactive ash. The M.A.D. policy is still very much in effect, the end of the cold war did not end Mutually Assured Destruction.  But lets say there is a conventional warfront somewhere.  Yes I will fight for my country.  Combat soldiers often talk about fighting for their country, but when they say that they almost always preface it by saying they fight for their way of life, their home, their family and friends.  Not necessarily their government. I'd like to believe that would be what I was fighting for rather than for the government.

       It depends on what you were taught in school and told on tv.

       It never did and it was never a great nation.

       Violence is not the answer. The "country" you and I live in is and has always been an experiment; just like all governments, isms, and institutions. I would only harm another being if that being was, within my sight, harming someone else. Countries mean nothing. Laws mean nothing. It is the people behind them who matter, who enact them, who worship them. There will not be a "world war III" because we have been in that state of constant war for decades. It's been World War III your whole life. World War III is being fought between the State and the People. The people of the world can stand united and go with the flow of nature or we can give in to the sensual pleasures of technology; which have sculpted us into gender-less automatons ready to work for $7 an hour for the rest of our lives. We must stop violence EVERYWHERE. We must stop racism EVERYWHERE. We must stop corporate irresponsibility EVERYWHERE. We must stop poverty EVERYWHERE. Countries should open their borders, people should work together, everyone should have their basic physical, mental, and emotional needs met... We can do it.  We just aren't. We have all this wonderful, God-like technology but we can't even feed many of our people, not to mention hundreds of millions of malnourished human beings well within the public's ability of aiding? It is truly sickening, the scope of human suffering.

       Absolutely fucking not. Not in the US (just a vassal state of the US), but the answer is still FUCK NO. I'll go bush first.

       Your title was kinda odd then i saw why, you speak as if USA is the only county on the planet... sad. Say what, WW3 lol how do you think of fighting in that, its gonna be over before you switch the channel. I doubt WW3 ever gonna happen i mean too much is at stake... humans aren't that dumb and crazy, right ?! Besides War is NEVER the answer because "War, war never changes".

       Nope. I would pick up a gun for my fellow human beings before I die for any country.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would honestly either go into hiding if war broke out in this country or try to find refuge with the 'enemy'. I don't need to die for a bunch of fucks I don't care about.
