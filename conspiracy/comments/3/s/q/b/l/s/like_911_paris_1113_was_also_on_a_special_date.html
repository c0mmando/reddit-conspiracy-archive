<p>As well as 11 and 13 being in the date, the attack was also staged in the 11th district of Paris. </p>

<p>We know who is behind this, the Western powers are furious that Russia are in Syria, they are creating a pretext for a Western invasion.</p>

<p>I wonder how many people can&#39;t actually see that this is an obvious false flag, the narrative doesn&#39;t even make sense as the West want Assad out, yet it&#39;s the Western funded terrorists who are behind this attack, so going to remove Assad in Syria doesn&#39;t make any sense, if anything it only makes things worse.</p>

doesn&#39;t take much to shift it to 11.13.15.  or 13.11.15 the euro way.</p>

<p>They told us. We have to call them out. Won&#39;t matter. The black and white faces? Dead or alive? hahahahaha. The leaders of all those countries dead this year? looks like most of us will be joining them. </p>

<p>ok, well nice knowing you folks. go get your iodine and a shovel and dig a hole nice and deep. peace out, I&#39;m in major metro so please god it&#39;ll just be more or less vaporization.</p>

<p>someone please tell me how to get in touch with david blaine. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if this&#39;ll help, but embrace the end with love. The transition will go much better for you. Don&#39;t fight, love that you get to experience whatever it is that is coming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just spotted the length between the January 7th Paris attack and November 13th, it&#39;s 311 days, this is another one of their special numbers, like 911, they have used March 11th as an attack date before, one example is for the Madrid train bombings in 2004.  They use both 911 and 311 as special phone numbers, 911 is emergency, 311 is non urgent community concerns.</p>

<p>March 11th was also the date of the huge Japan Tsunami which triggered nuclear meltdown, only the more open-minded people here will consider that this was also a planned NWO event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s about doing things in the open yet also in disguise. It&#39;s a game, basically. &quot;Catch me if you can.&quot; It&#39;s flaunting of power and influence, because even if you figure out the game, you can&#39;t do anything about it. This game is for the people at the highest levels of society. They believe that if they make their intentions known they are freed of responsibility for them.

<p>To truly understand, you&#39;d have to dig into occult practices. For example, look up the &quot;Cremation of Care&quot; ritual that happens annually at Bohemian Grove.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Do you see why I have trouble reconciling that with the idea of cold, ruthless, and brilliant people who manipulate the entire world?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do. Until I delved into the occult practices and secret world of the super elite I couldn&#39;t believe people could be so cold and ruthless. Think of it this way. What if you grew you up with your every whim satisfied? With more money than the Pope? What if you were surrounded with the extremes of privilege? What if you knew you could do anything including murder and get away with it? Do you think ordinary life would get boring for you?</p>

<p>You already see psychopathic behavior in royal families like the House of Saud. Just do a news search for crime-related words and &quot;Saudi royal family.&quot; Thousands of people born with every advantage, every privilege, every advantage, and they turn into sociopaths. They have absolutely no feeling, no compassion. I use the Sauds as an example, but these families exist in countries around the world. Some are royal, some are just fabulously rich.</p>

<p>Now imagine if you were in that position and united behind a cause. Your entire family -- which is largely crossbred with a few other families going back hundreds and even thousands of years -- is united with other elite families and know what the game is. Domination is a game that&#39;s been played among these families for <strong>thousands of years.</strong> Go back and read about the history of the House of Windsor. Read about the Macedonian Greeks and Seleucids and Romans. They were playing this game two-thousand years ago.</p>

<p>People need something to stimulate them. They need a challenge. And when you have everything, there is no challenge. So they play the domination game. It&#39;s the only thing that gets them off.</p>

<p>The stated goal of the elites that make up Bilderberg and Trilateral Comm. and such is to create a one-world gov&#39;t. They said it publicly for the first time in the 1960s, but the history of the idea extends to before WWI. At the time it seemed impossible because of how divided the world was, but now the plan is almost complete. Only a few nations are not fully onboard, and those nations -- Russia, China, Syria, Iran -- are about to get whacked.</p>

<p>The attacks in Paris are being used to justify an all-out NATO invasion of Syria, where the Russians and Chinese have already said &quot;hands off.&quot; Supposedly a Syrian passport was found next to the mangled body of an attacker. The French have promised to be merciless. But they aren&#39;t truly after terrorists -- the attackers were trained by Western and Western-aligned (Israel, Yemen, Saudi, Pakistani) intelligence agencies. They are after an excuse to invade Syria and unite NATO countries behind it. And now they have it.</p>

<p>It will probably lead to a nuclear exchange and pretty much the obliteration of the entire region, but hey, gotta break some eggs to make an omelette. That&#39;s how these people think.</p>

<p>If you follow statements from people like David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger, they have said many times they are creating a one-world gov&#39;t and won&#39;t be stopped. George Bush Sr. gave a speech about it from the Oval Office. Watch the video. Look at his eyes and the expressions on his face as he talks. Dude has a fucking hard on for the subject.</p>

<p>Finally, look into the history of the NSA and CIA. NSA was led for years by a high-ranking Satanist. Allen Dulles, the first head of the CIA and the most powerful Director ever, was a Nazi. The founder of Salon recently published a book about the Dulles brothers and the culture they grew up in. There are videos of the English royal family practicing the Nazi salute. Read what the Huxleys had to say about the elite world they lived in.</p>

<p>When you put all this information together, what sounds crazy actually becomes plausible. Not only plausible, but it&#39;s the thread that ties everything together. Crazy? Yeah. Real? Well, get the info you need and decide for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the detailed response.  The point about the effects of power makes sense but given (as you referenced) the long history of people in power playing the game of power it seems that there is never an unbalanced force i.e. the Macedonians fought the other Greeks then the Persians then each other, the Romans fought Carthage and Gaul and the Parthians and very frequently each other, and the list goes on.  I guess you&#39;re suggesting that &quot;our&quot; elites are fighting the Chinese and the Russians, but would they not also be vying with each other?  </p>

<p>I think the unity is what I have the biggest problem with, the over-the-top rituals could make sense and playing games with the geopolitics of the world is basically a given in some respects, but to me it seems that being power-hungry and being united are incompatible, and have been for all of history.  If they are looking to play a game, why play it against the stupid sheep when there are other powerful people who will take what you have if you don&#39;t take what they have?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah, they compete among each other. They aren&#39;t singing Kumbayah.</p>

<p>I probably expanded my net too far and diluted my assertion. I mentioned the ancient empires to make the point that domination is the name of the game and it&#39;s been played for a long time.</p>

<p>I found a list of quotes -- can&#39;t vouch for all of them but some of them come straight from books and speeches written by the people quoted -- that give some backing to the idea that there is central coordination among these competing elite power centers. The ones from Woodrow Wilson, Kissinger, Rockefeller and Warburg get the closest to making my point.</p>
