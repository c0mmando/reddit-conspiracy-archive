       Attack may have been announced a year ago. 
A topic on a French video game forum was created last year predicting this exact date. Link to webcache :

       This is pretty creepy. I was watching the news when all this stuff was happening live. I'm a bit surprised that there's not a single picture / video from inside the Bataclan while all this was happening. All the pictures / videos were of outside. Also, what about the suicide bombers that exploded outside the stadium? Anyone have footage of that or photographs of where the bombs went off? My news station either sucks or they left all this stuff out.

       Yep too busy to capture a picture, take a video, but full of time to tweet. Not to mention, no cameras in the Bataclan? Not a single camera to capture these terrorists anywhere.. makes sense.

       How did the 2-3 terrorists point AK Rifles at all 100+ hostages simultaneously? Pretty impressive considering the camera phones probably have a better zoom than the weapon being used.

       Anyone can fake evidence, but how do you fake a void of evidence? Like in all cases, just looking for as much information as possible. You essentially deem it likely that of all 100+ varying personalities, ethnicities, and cultural backgrounds, no one would deem documenting this worth dying for (in a situation they were likely to die anyway)?
      </p>
      <p>
       not even trying to argue, i just want to better understand your thought about the lack of general evidence involving cases like this. it never turns up, we never see it. why?

       Well i dont know about evidences persay, im no policer officer, im not working on the investigation. What i told is just facts, from the few amateur clips of bystanders and most basic informations relayed by the french media.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a phone video clip taken outside of the Bataclan, you can hear lots of gunfire, three distinct explosions, and a flash happening later on on the second floor, which is what i assume would be the police intervention that neutralized the fourth 'attacker'.
What happened at the Stade de France was broadcasted live on national television, same thing, three distinct and rather loud explosions.
What happened in the street is i admit a bit more fuzzy at this point, as you can imagine no bystander dared even step closer to the massacre while they were hearing heavy gunfire.
Also, one thing we get to see and you probably dont is the testimony on tv of the people that were actually there and survived. I can just relate to what they say, and its painfull to hear.

       Just to play devils advocate here: Where I am from, many people use their cameras to take photos or videos when they are seeing their favorite bands. I am sure at least a couple people inadvertently captured at least part of the attack in the concert.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I've seen at least 2 videos showing (or at least recording the sounds of) initial gunshots in the venue.

       First, as a french citizen, as much as i would like to know how this happened, how it unfolded etc. I REFUSE that any footage showing the attacks live action (not bystanders that are in a rather secured place) is shown on TV or any other media.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are shocked beyond words here. Out of decency, first for the families of the victims, and secondly to any other person with a heart, none of this is good to show.

       Look, I feel terrible that this happened - I know real people died, I have friends and relatives in Paris, THIS is exactly why I want to know what happened in there, what really happened. The lack of any exposure of the events that went down in the theatre in the news is exactly why everyone should be wondering what the fuck happened.
Refer back to the Nord Ost event in Moscow. Same setting, same situation, lots of coverage. Don't you think we deserve to know how and why innocent people died at this theatre? Instead of just believing passports were found. There's so much sketchiness surrounding the events of last night - and so much failure by the media to provide us with any accurate information what so ever.

       I do deserve to know why those people died in the theatre, but i do not think seeing how they were all shot to death like fish in a barrel could in any way or form help figure out the reasons.
What happened is four terrorist burst in the theater all guns blazing shooting people, lets end it at that.
Any video that might show the terrorist just even shoot their AKs is just more salt on a large wound that is still bleeding out, it hurts really bad

       No, it's not. If the attacks happened tomorrow, or next week, you'd still be able to find some random Internet nutjob who "predicted" an attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at Alex Jones. By his count the United States was supposed to be destroyed by a false-flag terrorist attack 896 times so far. And if an attack happened to occur one a day he claimed, everyone would be on here saying "ZOMG ALEX JONES PREDICTED IT!!!!!"

       Alex Jones is the typical temple dog that mixes some truth with disinformation and propaganda, more of the same entertainment(entrainment) for the sheeple. Whoever listens to that crap is only wasting his time.

       It's worth noting that there have only been two other Friday the 13ths from September 2014 to November 12, and those two happened on back-to-back months.

       I would say the opposite, this is the only place where common sense and open minded thinking is welcome (yes, there are some people with very extreme views that try to impose them on others, but those are everywhere).
      </p>
      <p>
       The other subs like
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews

       are filled with people that are completely entranced and hypnotized by every single word the mainstream media utters, thus any outside-the-box thinking is met with extreme rage and resistance, instead of a critical evaluation based on common sense and reason.

       He also posts in 18 to 25 yo threads, found that out after I did some digging. And let's not forget that one of the terrorists identified was born in 1995. He could potentially be the same age as the terrorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       In his profile, it's revealed he lives in a coastal city in France that has very large north african ghettos where lots of young kids get involved with crime. It wouldn't surprise me if the city is a port for immigrants.
