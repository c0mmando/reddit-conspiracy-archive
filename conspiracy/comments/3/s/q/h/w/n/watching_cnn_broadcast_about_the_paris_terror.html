This sometimes happens in live broadcasting.&quot;  The guy being interviewed was trying to connect the refugees to the terrorists who carried out this shooting and was saying they already had Intel on that and the feed drops.. The other two guys he&#39;s interviewing are now speculating about how they have no real information and there&#39;s no way to predict when/how something like this can happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This could have just been a coincidence and live feeds do drop but it&#39;s kinda convenient that the one feed they lose is the one guy who is actually offering hard intelligence that connects the Syrian refugees to the attack.  After they lost the feed Anderson and the 2 other guys being interviewed never even mentioned what that guy was saying... they all just moved on to speculate about who could be behind this and what can be done to prevent this sort of thing.  The Syrian refugees were never mentioned again.  That&#39;s pretty god damn convenient for the current narrative where everyone is supposed to have hands-across-the-world to help take care of these poor refugees from war torn Syria even when a large amount of these refugees are young healthy Muslim men who should be getting heavily vetted before they are allowed to enter any democratic Western country.  God forbid people decide to be more skeptical than compassionate towards these people.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  The MSM for the past few months has been pushing this idea that we need to help these poor Syrian refugees and support Obama who pledged to bring tens of thousands of them to the US.  If you don&#39;t agree with that then you are an Islamaphobe.  The Syrian refugees, as far as the MSM has been saying, are not terrorists.  They are displaced citizens who are victims of a war and they just need asylum.  Fox News has been saying we need to be careful of this push to let them into every country in the West but the other networks are saying it&#39;s our duty to welcome them with open arms unless you think all Muslims are terrorists which, of course, is racist.  The refugees are not to be confused with terrorists.  If you question that you are a bigot.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You get some outliers who will argue the side that says &quot;we need to be careful&quot; and they are painted as racist.  Fox News, of course, will hold up the &quot;anti-immigration/anti-refugee&quot; angle but the other networks are going to give you the &quot;we need to be compassionate and understand that Muslim doesn&#39;t mean racist and war refugees are victims, not terrorists&quot; and when somebody says something to the contrary they are painted as being bigoted.  Especially during/after the Pope&#39;s visit to America.    </p>

<p>EDIT:  And you can totally ignore the whole media angle and just look at this from a political angle.  Say they connect this attack to Syrian refugees.  Obama committed to taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees.  So now what question is everyone going to ask Hillary on the campaign trail?  &quot;In light of the recent attacks in Paris, what are you going to do about the Syrian refugee situation?&quot;  You think that&#39;s a question she&#39;s going to want to answer?  </p>

As soon as the guy started talking about the solid Intel they have connecting what&#39;s going on with Syria to the attacks in Paris the feed instantly dropped out while he was in mid-sentence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was listening to NPR earlier tonight and the journalists were thankfully doing real journalism, unlike so many mainstream outlets. Several sources were being interviewed and the interviewer pressed them for facts. One man was claiming it was connected to Syria and islamists and she wouldn&#39;t let him off the hook so easily. &quot;Where did you hear this? What is your source?&quot; The man had no concrete answers, preferring to use weasel words like &quot;it&#39;s what I&#39;ve been hearing&quot;. Neither ISIS nor Al Qaida nor any other group has claimed responsibility as of Friday night and anyone claiming to know what happened is merely speculating, but many couldn&#39;t resist the urge to pin it on islamists, ostensibly so that the event can be used to justify boots on the ground in Syria. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the guy I saw on CNN was trying to say the intelligence that he said they currently know for a fact before he was dropped from the feed (accidentally or not).  Maybe he was about to just make shit up but maybe he was actually about to give intelligence that he actually has.  I think the problem is that Obama made remarks yesterday morning about Isis being virtually wiped out so we don&#39;t want this to be Isis.  Obama also committed to taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees so we don&#39;t want this to be Syria.  But the attack was committed in a random shooting style which Al Qaeda leaders have condemned because they don&#39;t want to accidentally hit any Muslims so this doesn&#39;t appear to be Al Qaeda.  So it&#39;s either Isis which makes Obama look real bad.  It&#39;s Syrian refugees tied to Isis which is worse.. Or worst case scenario possibly.. Its refugees with no actual connection to Isis who have organized on their own to do this.  If that&#39;s the case any country taking these refugees in will be terrified to do so.  Connecting this attack directly to the Syrian refugees is the worst thing that could happen.</p>
