Someone tweeted about we all should be equipped with guns, "the good men has to kill the evil men, we live in a western movie." sort of in those words.

       Because it is. If 20/100 people had a concealed weapon during those attacks, this could have been handled and people could have been saved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make no mistake, lack of foresight is no ones fault but this all helps to prove that we need concealed weapons for the safety of others.

       Where I live in Florida, we had a shooting in our theater, all I can think about is how much better things could have been if someone had been there to take the shooter by surprise and to take him out.

       Sure, 40/50 people may have been saved last night if there were a few concealed weapons but in the long run, everyone having guns is not how to save lives.

       Don't really see how a national statistic of shootings is relevant to what I said, I mean other than the fact that the number you've provided could be reduced at least slightly by people having concealed weapons like I mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, if 10/100 had weapons that night or even less, the 8 people attacking could have been neutralized.

       The statistic is relevant because it shows people having guns does not lead to less death. It leads to far, far more.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a slight possibility your theory could have happened, absolutely.
      </p>
      <p>
       But 1) Who would really think it was necessary to take a gun to a rock concert surrounded by people partying, drinking and having a good time (maybe this is the mindset in the USA, I don't know, but if it is there's something seriously wrong), 2) How do you get those people with concealed weapons to co-ordinate with either other in a hostage situation. If one person starts firing, the attackers would start wiping everyone out, allowing fewer to escape than did last night and 3) If terrorists were aware there was a good chance hostages were going to have guns they would simply change their plan of attack to something even more aggressive.
      </p>
      <p>
       This event last night is not an opportunity to promote guns.

       That failed attempt to kill a train full of people would've been prevented if only a few had concealed weapons. Every terrorist attack is an argument for having guns because people wanna protect themselves. Unless you can prove or even give me a sensical answer why having laws that allow guns for certain people would drastically increase murder-rates than please stop bringing up nonsense-arguments. You're just assuming the worst and being a scared pussy that would rather have us all beg for our lives instead of defending ourselves, pathetic.

       Check out crime statistics for London as well as how Chinese terrorists use knives.  Spoiler: gun crime in london is higher today per capita than it was before the ban, and chinese terrorists kill dozens with only knvies.  gun control does nothing, this is a mental health issue.

       Someone who was at the event when it happened said he heard the shooters speaking French. He was asked what language they were speaking. I was waiting for "Arabic" but the witness said French. Also that one of the shooters was barely 20.

       la France est devenue un allié important d'Israel. Deja l'union Européenne est entrain de souffrire, au niveau economique, et automatiquement la France. Cette alliance avec Israel ne résoudras pas ces problémes mais va meme les aggravire. Souhaitant que le peuple Francais s'on rend compte et realise que les Marocains, Algériens et autres sont leurs alliés. N'oublie pas que les Musulmans ont aider la France a devenir une force enconomique.

       I'm seeing it under both /rising and /hot, but Reddit is under heavy load and sometimes it's returning 503s.

       I don't know if it is feasible, but this might be a good post to sticky to help keep the discussion centralized.

       Many Americans are reported to have been at the concert, which means the US will be involved in response. Will be very difficult for alternative media to sniff out discrepancies if all the documents are in french.

       Yeah, the war drums are beating furiously. I think I'm the only guy sitting back and wondering WTF everyone wants to flatten Syria when most of the killers came from France and Belgium. OK, ISIS gave them passports, money, cars, training, and guns and bombs, but they were born in neighborhoods in Brussels and France; how about Europe fixes the problems at home before wasting lives and money in the Mideast? I don't get the priorities here.

       Yeah, right.  Not fully doubting people didn't die.. but all I see is video on the street with emergency vehicles.  It starts to raise my little tinfoil hat alarm.  1500 people in the one venue...

       Ok I'm taking sides in either camp... But loud noises are easily made. The reason people question whether or not these were real are because of the lack of visual proof and the quick jump to lay a narrative down by the news.

       Too much tinfoil. I suppose if a camera was already rolling you'd question
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       he was already rolling. "Didnhe know it was going to happen?"
      </p>

       The attacks happened. Explosions went off, innocent hostages were taken, and people died. You can be a skeptic about a lot of things, but don't take it too far

       Typical...response includes a meme. There are cctv cameras all over the place, 150 people is a lot of blood, things should not only show up but they should look real. Like I said I don't believe one way or the other... even with everything happeng exactly as reported, it could still be a false flag.

       It could very well be a flase flag. I'm not saying it wasn't. I'm just saying that you're questioning things too much. What if we had CCTV footage? Maybe you'd be up in arms because "it's too pixelated to tell"
      </p>
      <p>
       People died. That's given, there's no questioning to be done whether people died or not. Who did it, who motivated it, who helped it... Those are better things to question.

       I'm still trying to figure out the possible motivations and who would and would not have them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why Paris?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't the targets of revenge for ISIL or Al Quaeda be Russia, Iran, Syria, or even Israel for their on going abuses against the Muslim Palestinian population?
      </p>
      <p>
       The US is plenty guilty of War Crimes, the root cause of the refugee crisis in Europe,  and the ones that have been funding ISIL and Al Quada in hopes to oust Assad.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this would be the last thing they would want because if it does come back to be ISIS, it gives Assad a strong position to gather world support in his fight against them and would bring  sympathy for his fight against the ISIL in Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Along with give the US another black eye for continuing to fund them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would Assad risk the possibility of a coalition being formed with the US, or even give the US a remote claim to put boots on the ground in Syria to fight against the terrorists?
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowing the US would remove him from office, or have a drone "accidentally" mistake him for a terrorist?
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't see Russian involvement for that very reason of not wanting to give the US any legal reason for going into Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Money is always a motivator, Paris was just making waves about the TPP.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the last thing the people fleeing the region would want, because they are looking to Europe for an escape from the region.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would fully be aware that the borders would clamp down and they would be sent back to the area they are running from.  In no way would this benefit them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do the leaders of the European Countries benefit from this as justification to shut down their borders in the current refugee crisis?
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel has been strangely silent in wake of the events.  They are usually the first ones to be there stating "now you know how we feel."  Like they said after 9/11.   Their silence is deafening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why wouldn't the attacks be against Russian interests?  Or Damascus?  Even Iran and Iraq.  They are much closer and probably an easier target for these types of attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is even a chance in all this to bring the East and West together in a common goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there are millions of Muslims that have been suffering at the hands of the West and have lost husbands, wife's, children, and would like nothing better to exact revenge for their losses and oppression.
      </p>
      <p>
       However they also are witness to what 9/11 did to the region and would have to realize that an attack like this would do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much like 9/11, I am sitting here going why?   Why Paris?  They hate their freedoms and lifestyles?  Please, save that line of bull shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       When this much blood is shed, on this type of stage, there is a reason besides to terrify and kill people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also find it hard to believe that not one of the intelligence agencies from any country knew nothing or had nothing to do with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There had to be one or more assisting in this, and the questions remain, who could pull it off, who needed an event like this to further their agenda.  This is not going to further the agenda of ISIL if it comes back to them.  It will do the exact opposite of that, and they know that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am watching the Paris English public coverage of this right now and they have a former CIA agent on the phone saying the same crap like after 9/11 about needing to invade Muslim countries to fight them there, and that in it self says a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know who benefits from this yet, but we do know who doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would the US risk the possibility of Assad gaining sympathy from the world in his fight against ISIL?   Their other strategies have been colossal failures, maybe this is a last ditch attempt to justify the US presence in the region.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Israel just weighed in with the "we stand shoulder to shoulder in the fight against terrorism."  Iran, Russia, and Turkey weighed in hours ago calling the attacks, crimes against humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thoughts?
      </p>
      <p>
       And prayers for the families of the victims who lost loved ones, for the victims, and for the Muslim's who have been subjected to losing family members, homes, and violence on a daily basis with no recourse or justice.

       France has a sizable Islamic population (second largest religion) and a history of problems with it internally. Apologies for being lazy enough to lift from Wikipedia, but:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 2008, 148 French Muslim graves were desecrated near Arras. A pig's head was hung from a headstone and profanities insulting Islam and Muslims were daubed on some graves.[55] Dalil Boubakeur, a director of a Paris mosque described the vandalism on a Mosque in Paris, France as Islamophobic.[56] On December 13, 2009, The Mosque of Castres in southern France, was vandalized in the night.[57] Swastika in black paint, "Sieg Heil" in German, "France to the French" in French, and "White Power" in English were scrawled on the mosque.[58] Additionally, a pig feet was hung on the mosque.[59]
        <br/>
        In 2010 France banned face coverings including women wearing the niqab. The French Collective against Islamophobia reported "an explosion" in the number of physical attacks on women wearing the niqab. Kenza Drider, a protester against the law, said: "I'm insulted about three to four times a day. Most say, 'Go home'; some say, 'We'll kill you.' One said: 'We'll do to you what we did to the Jews.'... I feel that I now know what Jewish women went through before the Nazi roundups in France. When they went out in the street they were identified, singled out, they were vilified. Now that's happening to us."[60]
        <br/>
        After the Charlie Hebdo shooting in January 2015, there were reports of attacks on mosques and Muslim citizens throughout the country.[61]

       I am not kidding about mercenaries,  or professional paid shooters of some kind.    Does anyone doubt that Jack Ruby had been put up to killing Oswald?    Or do people believe that Ruby loved Kennedy that much,   or was that patriotic,  religious or whatever?

       Follow the money and the power shift.    France always tends to go back to left of center if you don't repeatedly help give them a reason to react in fear to something.
      </p>

       France withdrew from the integrated military command in 1966 till it rejoined in 2009 after 43 years of dissent,  and they cooperate with NATO more or less depending on when they are "threatened" from outside.    These mercenary/professionals are more inside than outside.

       That is not to say that there are not opportunistic clerics and fundamentalist religious kooks trying to wipe out Assad.     But it is to say that someone helped them get trucks and guns,   because that someone is going to eventually be able to import gas into Europe through Syrian pipelines.    And those pipelines were not happening under Assad the way that the western allies wanted them to.

       Would like to hear this sub's thoughts on the amount of conspiring that must have taken place to execute such a coordinated attack. It would seem that behind every attacker there would be at least one other person as accomplice. Weapons and bomb materials need a pipeline.  Who is in that pipeline?

       Be sure to consider that requiring a background check and closing gun show loopholes doesn't really infringe on gun rights at all.  That's all Bernie is considering doing.  He knows he loses rural votes if he goes full gun control, and he respects the right to bear arms.  Don't lump Bernie in with the shitters that actually want to take your rights away, please

       wow.  you have no clue how government actually works.  well lil' trump, im not going to be the one to educate you.  i could be shouting winning lottery numbers right now and you would tell me how wrong i am.  if you want to play army with your guns then go join the oath keepers.  the hell makes you think im so anti guns anyway?  nice leap you made there.  have fun making your gi joes explode with firecrackers.

       The two most important factors in your life are religion and race. Are you starting to get it now? It doesn't matter how you would like people to behave -- what matters is how they actually behave in the real world. They are driven by religion and race. You cannot understand their motives without understanding this fact.

       I think the half century of bombing, killing their children and overthrowing their countries to suit are needs is the biggest peice of the puzzle. The religion is just a motivational support that they use to give context to the atrocities they want to get revenge for.

       Really? Half a dozen people communicating without technology and over a long time with minimal reference or obfuscated language about their plans and timings, it's more than possible. Without the use of technology and unless the perpetrators are known to the security services, organised guerrilla attacks are going to be easy to organise.

       if you actually believe that the best target the #paris terrorists can come up with is a crappy satanist band with the name DEATH in it... on friday the 13th...
      </p>
      <p>
       if you want to get the governments to submit to your will, or 'Do What Thou Wilt', the best thing to do is attack a pseudo joke of a revolving member, satanic 'Eagles of DEATH Metal' band.
      </p>
      <p>
       then you'll get whatever you want, likely more attacks on poor brown people in far away lands, a whole country, france, to immediately turn into a police state, invade everyone's privacy, close it's borders, etc. just attack a death metal band, it's like jet fuel on steel.

       Pseudonyms
Hughes uses many different nicknames, including "J. Devil" (or simply "The Devil")[10] as well as "Boots Electric" ("Boots" for short) and "Fabulous Weapon" (both of which were band names used by Hughes' father). In an interview[11] Hughes revealed that his band mate Josh Homme gave him "The Devil" nickname when he was thirteen. "I used to get picked on a lot by Karl Doyle" says Hughes, "And when I would get picked on severely, or if it really made a point to me, I would get vengeance, but I would get vengeance in the way that I could, which was mostly clever and all consuming. Joshua once witnessed me in the moment I was about to enact vengeance upon someone, and he just said, 'You're the fucking devil dude,' and it stuck."

       Josh Homme, it transpires, is from one of the more affluent families in Palm Desert. His grandfather Cap Homme has a park named after him in an exclusive enclave in Coachella Valley, where retired movie stars, former American presidents and Microsoft’s Bill Gates all live. There’s a Homme Street where the family ranch used to be located – now the location of the very posh Monterey Country Club, 375 acres of luxury homes tucked underneath the shadow of the Santa Rosa Mountains.

       “My grandpa used to do new clichés. ‘If you could be the sheep or the shepherd, which one would you be? The wolf.’ And another one was, ‘If you’re going to be different, you’re going to get hit by rocks, so learn to like rock.'”

       After 11 months of harrowing trials and studio mishaps, they ended up with one of their most important musical documents. Dubbed after Aleister Crowley’s system of signifying the period after he became a full-on Satanist, it’s a tour de force that combines the blurry power of Zeppelin’s Physical Graffiti with the punch of The Stones’ Some Girls, all underpinned with stripper beats and whacked-out English psychedelia.

       Another false flag event apparently carried out by ISIS, the grunts of the CIA and Mossad, to fuel Islamophobia more and more to justify wars against the Islamic world.

       Yeah, right.  Not fully doubting people didn't die.. but all I see is video on the street with emergency vehicles.  It starts to raise my little tinfoil hat alarm.  1500 people in the one venue...

       Of course not.   They are even saying that people are covering bodies with sheets.   There are no photos of anything that you'd call an attack, but the appearance of one is a given.

       Typical...response includes a meme. There are cctv cameras all over the place, 150 people is a lot of blood, things should not only show up but they should look real. Like I said I don't believe one way or the other... even with everything happeng exactly as reported, it could still be a false flag.
