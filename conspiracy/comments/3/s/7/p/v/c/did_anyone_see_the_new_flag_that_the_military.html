<p>WTF?</p>

<p>How is this acceptable for our military??</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/ztTVGlB">New Flag</a></p>

<p>Also what you see at center field is a camouflaged ribbon - you know the ribbon image that is used for everything now?  Pink for breast cancer, etc.  This one was camo.</p>

<p>To be fair - they didn&#39;t claim it was a new flag.  However, everyone on the field holding the banners are military personnel.  The anthem singer is a female military personnel and she&#39;s singing our national anthem to THESE flags.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t get how this is in anyway acceptable.</p>

<p>singing to a flag is weird enough on its own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I was in Kindergarten, I remember thinking to myself that same thing every morning during the pledge of allegiance.  I would ask my classmates if they thought it was weird and they all would say, &quot;No, everyone else is singing.  You should follow what everyone else is doing....&quot;.  Bam!  Conspiracy theorist was born.</p>

<p>Fun fact, before/during WWII, classrooms use to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellamy_salute#/media/File:Students_pledging_allegiance_to_the_American_flag_with_the_Bellamy_salute.jpg">salute the flag</a> Hitler style.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could it be that it&#39;s just a stylistic choice done for the graphic on the field? I don&#39;t really see a new flag here more like a re arrangement of the flag to center the ribbon.</p>

<p>And why would something that significant be revealed for the first time with no proper announcement on a football game. Do you seriously expect it to actually change into that?</p>

<p>Even if it did so what? The flags changed before throughout history, why not change it to include the territories owned outside the states?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well regarding my tone, I was feeling quite sanctimonious and my post reflected that but on further reflection, that was never my intent so I booted it.</p>

<p>When I posted in <a href="/r/military">/r/military</a>, they all pretty much said, &quot;meh&quot;.  They didn&#39;t see it as a big deal at all.  In fact they noticed the color guard that had a real flag, even if it was TINY.</p>

<p>In fact, most replies mentioned how they didn&#39;t give a fuck about the NFL at all. haha</p>

    <div class="md"><p>haha - well they were much more focused on real shit.  One person compared the number of concussions to the troops under their command and concluded with &quot;fuck the NFL&quot; or something like that.</p>

<p>Another was like, &quot;Well the flag has changed over time, no big deal&quot;</p>

<p>Once they saw the color guard they seemed to be more like, &quot;You&#39;re singing to that flag&quot;.</p>

<p>I deleted that thread too because it seemed to be getting the tone of this is some &quot;first world problems&quot; bullshit.  Let&#39;s deal with some real shit that matters people.  In browsing some other threads it made sense and I really didn&#39;t want to have to keep explaining my concerns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wow I never knew about that history, thanks for the link. </p>

<p>I recommend the kent state doc on netflix. it doesn&#39;t touch conspiracy and yet I felt I could read a lot between the lines. </p>

<p>following Kent state - the gov altered their tactics - rather than attack anti war protestors - which only helped them gain sympathy from broader public - I believe the infiltrated them with drugs and new spokesman with diffusing anti-action messaging. getting high and lounging became the next &quot;action&quot; taken at the next major demonstration. I believe it was the gov hired &quot;actors&quot; infiltrating the youth movement that engineered this transferring of focussed anti war demands - into extremely unfocussed anti establishment music/fashion/style.  </p>

<p>and I think charles manson was the CIA&#39;s cherry on top. I&#39;m sure that he was manufactured too. I don&#39;t doubt his cult/crimes were real - I just think the CIA was coaching him and aiding him. </p>

<p>So we are left with-- anti war protestors are just into drugs, not showering and irresponsibly having babies on the road and eventually murdering beautiful innocent actresses and their friends. .... I think that is no accident. I think it was orchestrated/ I think the gov was thoughtful and realized they must discredit the movement from within - while outwardly showing as much patience as possible. </p>

<p>and we have to get over that mindf**** to try again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well a lot of other soldiers that I know are conspiracy theorists. We often talked about the things that we believed were wrong with the country and theoretical outcomes to our current situation. A police state enforced by the military came up but most of us agreed that we would not follow those orders. I do think that a police state by militarized police forces will be a much more likely scenario than a scenario in which the military is used to enforce a police state. I forsee a situation in which the military is used in a large war or in multiple small wars much like recently. This will result in the only large presence in the US will be police which will be used to take over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wow I never knew about that history, thanks for the link. </p>

<p>I recommend the kent state doc on netflix. it doesn&#39;t touch conspiracy and yet I felt I could read a lot between the lines. </p>

<p>following Kent state - the gov altered their tactics - rather than attack anti war protestors - which only helped them gain sympathy from broader public - I believe the infiltrated them with drugs and new spokesman with diffusing anti-action messaging. getting high and lounging became the next &quot;action&quot; taken at the next major demonstration. I believe it was the gov hired &quot;actors&quot; infiltrating the youth movement that engineered this transferring of focussed anti war demands - into extremely unfocussed anti establishment music/fashion/style.  </p>

<p>and I think charles manson was the CIA&#39;s cherry on top. I&#39;m sure that he was manufactured too. I don&#39;t doubt his cult/crimes were real - I just think the CIA was coaching him and aiding him. </p>

<p>So we are left with-- anti war protestors are just into drugs, not showering and irresponsibly having babies on the road and eventually murdering beautiful innocent actresses and their friends. .... I think that is no accident. I think it was orchestrated/ I think the gov was thoughtful and realized they must discredit the movement from within - while outwardly showing as much patience as possible. </p>

<p>and we have to get over that mindf**** to try again. </p>
