        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This latest video made me start thinking it:</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/7QqgNcktbSA">http://youtu.be/7QqgNcktbSA</a></p>

<p>It seems more and more we have a new generation of kids that want to ban free speech, invoke censorship and make all places safe spaces.</p>

<p>Just curious what you folks think as to this rise being the product of some kind of TV upbringing/propaganda etc.  </p>

<p>There is no doubt young people growing up have their morals/opinions moulded by the music they listen to and the TV they watch.  Could this be the result?</p>

<p>Comedians more recently have even said they won&#39;t play colleges anymore as it&#39;s too politically correct and the students are easily offended</p>

<p>SJWs and kids like in this video seem to have their heart set on destroying free speech and all the things students/young people from generations ago fought so hard for.  They do it so blindly, without thought or questioning themselves. They ignore the hypocrisy of how they go about it (bullying/ganging up)... It is clear set examples of how people act after being brainwashed.</p>

<p>This could all be way off here, but maybe this generation is the result of some kind of government/powers-that-be long game mind fuck to control society. </p>

<p>The guy in the video has since stood his ground regarding the &#39;Halloween costumes being offensive and hurting some feelings&#39; thing, but standing ground like that can only last so long.  There are more and more SJWs out there and they are slowly getting a foothold.  Look at reddit a year ago compared to now.  Safe spaces and censorship are popping up everywhere and things are certainly changing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no. The government probably realized that they could kill the fishermen by poisoning the lake, and so interfered with learning (standardized testing, hiking the cost of schools, using hippies and drugs to undercut the antiwar movement etc), but I think it reaches deeper. As a society, we have insulated ourselves from pain and evolution. Perhaps it&#39;s a conspiracy that combines a Huxley-an pleasure world to lull us to sleep while everything slips into an Orwellian dystopia, maybe not...I don&#39;t know. But, for instance, 150 years ago, it wasn&#39;t uncommon to have had one (or more) siblings die before adolescence, or mom dying delivering the last child. Now, not as common. Then, people with disabilities were on the bottom of the evolutionary food chain, today the playing field is far more evened out. Before, food is all grown, organic, and needs to be stored for winter or people starve. Now, &quot;food&quot; is far more available.  RIGHT THIS SECOND, I AM CORRESPONDING WITH PEOPLE, POTENTIALLY THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY IN SECONDS WITH A HAND HELD DEVICE THAT SELF ILLUMINATES WHERE BEFORE A LETTER WRITTEN BY CANDLE LIGHT WITH INK AND QUILL WOULD TAKE MONTHS TO REACH YOU ALL. Life is easier, we live in a society where effort and discomfort are not just obstacles but demons. Unpleasantness infringes on our right to not feel unpleasantness.  It&#39;s no mystery then, that if you challenge someone&#39;s view and there&#39;s not an easy answer, and the implications of the question makes one uneasy, said people tend to go a bit batsh*t. (Especially when challenge has come to mean oppress.) It&#39;s not that racism, sexism, homophobia etc are fake or things of the past. It is important to keep these in check; awareness keeps free speech against a group/idea from spilling into organized active hate. But the cost cannot be the first and most basic of human rights, or gentleness makes slaves of us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate to say it, but Millennials are FUCKED. They know ABSOLUTELY nothing about the world. They will pay SS, and never see that money. They will consume poisonous food, and never link it to their poor health. They will graduate from college with huge debt, and struggle to find work that pays more than $10 an hour.</p>

<p>I went to a really great university, and was in a Honors Business program. My peers were mostly goody two-shoe SJW morons with no concept of how money is made. They are fervently supportive of transgender Jenner and Gay marriage, yet know nothing about our Economic situation. They get excited to see the new Ellen D show, or any &quot;progressive&quot; bullshit in the media, but never question our foreign policies or our militant police. I have seen more outrage over transgender bathrooms than I have over police shooting children.</p>

<p>Millennials are brain washed fucktards, and I am ashamed to be one.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. It&#39;s like the thought police of 1984. It&#39;s getting bad now but wait until the next generation when these people have children and raise them to believe that their ideas are perfectly normal, acceptable and should be universal. Throw in the state and educational institutions actively promoting this type of behavior and eventual internet censorship, bye-bye free thought and free information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see a pattern with kids under 30 today and it&#39;s becoming a pattern, albeit very small right now. </p>

<ul>
<li>School shooters in the last few years.</li>
<li>Shooters with multiple victims outside of schools.</li>
<li>Victims of police shootings.</li>
<li>Police officers shooting unarmed civilians (a handful). </li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s like a generation of children grew up and think whatever actions they do have no repercussions. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also seeing people like this girl screaming thinking that&#39;s how you get your way. </p>

<p>Fuck these people. I&#39;m tired of the PC crowd. Don&#39;t tell me how to run my life. Don&#39;t tell me what&#39;s right and wrong. </p>

<p>With the advent of social media, it takes one instance like this to get on the news and then your actions are judged by the world based on how the media reports you. </p>

<ul>
<li>That dentist who killed that lion in Africa. The whole nation wanted his head. I agree what he did was wrong, but had we not had social media breaking the story, he wouldn&#39;t be in harms way. </li>
<li>The lesbian couple in Hawaii two weeks ago arrested for too much PDA. That officer is being harassed for what he did. Another victim of social media and SJW. What he did was wrong yes, but he didn&#39;t need to have his life strewn out on TV. </li>
</ul>

<p>Social media has turned into a recruitment ground for the thought police. It&#39;s a giant message board where people who think they are experts in everything can comment on how they think it should be. Other people want to get in on it and participate by agreeing on whoever has the biggest stick in the conversation. Then it trickles out into real life. </p>

<p>One of my close friends is having a mini meltdown of sorts related to this. He and I both agree that social media is poison to people and it just makes the world a horrible place to live in. Only if you live and die by the shit that gets posted on fb, Twitter, whatever. </p>

<p>It scares the crap out of me knowing that these soulless monsters in school today will be running the world when I am retirement age. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Along with all the other great points made, all it takes is a few well placed agents provocateurs to plant the seeds and spark an idea in a group. These thoughts don&#39;t just happen on their own. That girl was trying to get that instructor to hit her. She used her body language, including dropping her back pack while raising her voice and moving closer, to threaten the man.  If he had lost his composure and reacted in any way it would have been catastrophic. My bets are placed that she was &quot;instructed&quot; to do what she did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aren&#39;t they just exercising <em>their</em> freedom of speech? You may well not agree with them - and you&#39;re free to do so publicly - but as advocates of freedom of speech, isn&#39;t this how you think things should work? Opposing views are expressed and engaged with. It&#39;s by a similar mechanism that racial/ethnic slurs and homophobia stopped being generally socially acceptable.</p>

<p>I think you also overestimate the reach of such archetypal SJWs. They seem to be a very noisy minority, versus a relatively quiet (at present) and unworried majority. And they&#39;re in college, which isn&#39;t really &quot;real life&quot;.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t expect it&#39;s anything to do with TV, music or other media because most of it is pretty problematic... SJW bros love Macklemore?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s some brainwashing at work here, for sure. Mostly that these kids were probably never taught basic Constituional Law or had a Civics class. And when they all get together, it creates a ridiculous in-group/out-group aggression. Cunts like Melissa Click who said, &quot;I hear that argument, but...&quot; to a journalist&#39;s stated freedom to document a public event are the ones most responsible. They&#39;re not the puppet master&#39;s hands, but they are the strings and crossbars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meh, SJW&#39;s are a boogieman. </p>

<p>The corporate media silencing dissenting voices for economic and political reasons is far more destructive than anything SJW&#39;s can collectively muster. There&#39;s been a trend since 9/11 for Americans to construct monsters we blow out of proportion to justify our overly insecure insanity and paranoid shitty behavior. When SJW&#39;s dominate the media then I will be concerned. </p>

<p>Stay focused on the real issues, SJW&#39;s along with those wasting time and effort reacting against them, are just the brainwashed puppets of the elite. The whole conflict is a steam valve designed to misdirect outrage away from TPTB.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let them play you like a fool. </p>
