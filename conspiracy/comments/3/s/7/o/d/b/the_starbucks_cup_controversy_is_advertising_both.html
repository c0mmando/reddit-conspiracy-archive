       These people who are mad at Starbucks were mostly hired by Starbucks to publicly "attack" them, which fits in nicely to the "war on Christmas" narrative. People are attracted to the controversy and Starbucks gets tons of exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's similar to native advertising. Native advertising focuses on buying upvotes and planting comments and upvotes to make certain narratives look popular, which is frequent on reddit. But because people are naturally attracted to controversy, the story gets repeated everywhere, so they don't even have to buy upvotes. It's like sex, it sells. People are naturally drawn to it through some primal instincts, and they use that knowledge to draw people's attention to their product. The Starbucks "controversy" is on reddit, it's on facebook, people I know mentioned it in person.
      </p>
      <p>
       The controversy is the commodity they use to attract viewers, but the controversy is largely falsely generated by Starbucks to attract attention. Most of the people being outraged come
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the original falsified outrage paid for by starbucks has been aired on fox news or whatever. They hire a company to find these vocal christian loons and stir them up about this particular story and then give them an audience by allowing them to speak on tv about this particular issue. This fuels the controversy which drives views. It makes it look like there's a bunch of people who are seriously outraged about this thing, even though there might only be 5 in total and they're being handed microphones and given interviews left and right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most importantly, this type of "advertising through controversy" generates
       <em>
        organic
       </em>
       views (and organic community-driven upvotes and comments) from places like reddit who are amazed that the controversy exists in the first place and upvote it to mock those people fighting starbucks (who don't really exist in any large numbers in the first place). So "everyone" is laughing at "everyone" being pissed at a company, and meanwhile everyone is repeating "Starbucks" over and over and talking about their cup designs. It's advertising. People need to get real.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many distracted ignorant people who are wasting so much time on simulated controversy and it's one big reason why our culture, society, and government are crumbling. They think they are looking at something that matters, but is in actuality completely unimportant. This is the circus of the modern day. These "organic" controversies, that are, in reality, largely advertising and distractions. You see this pattern everywhere once you start looking for it.

       Cutting out a distraction isn't the same as blaming it for a problem. We sure have a lot of them. Shitting on a guy for talking about how he made his life a little better by tuning out some of that noise isn't necessary.

       I worked at Facebook for three years and have heard all these arguments. People who cant handle it reasonably, I guess don't make an account? The other 99 percent of us use it to stay in touch with friends and family mostly. Outside of work I am not attached to a website, was never a problem for myself.

       Thing is, people create bubbles and you won't always get the truth from them about facebook, but the truth is that for most people, when they feel comfortable enough and open up, they'll admit facebook causes them problems. I counsel for a living and every client has issues because of facebook drama, and when I offer a disciplined break for 2 weeks from the site, they always end up better than before

       Cool that is great. Not everyone lives near their loved ones. No one is making you use Facebook. It does not mean that other people don't use it for its intended purpose and get joy/entertainment/companionship from connecting with friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find that people who say facebook is an obstacle in their life will likely just find something else to call an obstacle anyways, its a ridiculous notion.

       Of course its basically a medium, however, you're basically supporting a monopoly that is not for the people, the CEO is a douche who is a member of various elitist clubs, is pro tpp, and is recording everything you say and post with zero oversight while censoring free speech with various agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       With tech where it is now, IM via what's app, texting, phone calls, are all much more efficient without necessarily supporting a douche baggy monopolist and without getting pulled into the internet ghettoization drama scene of facebook and the psychological issues it poses to users

       If we are going to look at facebook, we need to keep in mind its entire context, do we not?

       Personally, its more efficient and easier to not be part of it for me, plus the monopoly and habits/remarks of the ceo speak for itself. I don't support apple (child labor), coke/pepsi, nike, chase, m0nsanto, or facebook for various reasons

       I'm actually anti-sjw, anti-safe zones, anti-monopoly, anti-bias bubble. I think you got your terms confused.

       I exist to question your biases to a point that you will also start questioning the bias bubble you live in, so you can know thyself, and question reality, and realize its better not to support monopolist douchebag elitists. Fuck SJW's

       ha jesus dude. Ok. Zuckerberg is not that bad, but you won't listen to what I say. A lot of the buzz you hear about privacy and monopoly is exaggerated in alternative media. Until you see it behind the scenes its tough to explain. He is not listening to your conversations and conspiring to take over the world I can assure you.

       Ok sure, i don't have behind-the-scenes access to facebook, so I lack that context. Sure, I can guess the culture working there is amazing fee flowing, contemporary, and ground breaking, however have you sat with Zuck and know the guy, what he's about, what he stands for, what his goals and plans are?

       There's a high percentage that Zuck is a sociopath. Go google Zuck's keynote speech at the Builderberg meetings and find out what those meetings are all about. That's the nail in the coffin

       When you grow up with a crew of 40 friends, have over a dozen ex gf's, a big family with lots of cousins, and your work decides to use facebook as well, things get a bit crazy on there especially with IM features and getting instant notifications and posts anytime anyone sends something. Its not that I spent all day on there but more like A.D.D. styles, every 5 minutes or so there was something to reply to, and the  bigger debates required sitting down and typing out lengthy responses, like explaining why Obama is a puppet

       I read a while back that Coke and Pepsi make a lot more money off of the "coke v. Pepsi" thing than they lose to their opposition. There's no real way to verify this, but It makes sense. Both sides play up the rivalry. That's obviously less of a controversy, and is hardly manufactured, but I think it's somewhat relevant.

       Oh FFS, you got left/SJW's fighting about mentally ill people being able to go into the opposite sex bathroom, and then you got the right/Christians saying Starbucks is declaring a war on "Christmas" by having plain red cups. Seriously, this country is a lost fucking cause.

       Regardless of what you feel about transgenderism being a real or created phenomenon, I'd be wary about buying into the label of "mentally ill" that's applied to them. Labelling people "mentally ill" has a long history of marginalizing certain groups of people and denying them rights, while the majority of the public supports such actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I give you two worrying trends. First, more and more people are being labelled mentally ill. While I think certain conditions are becoming more prevalent (and that alone is worrisome), another factor is a widening definition of the term. People who believe in conspiracy theories have and will be officially deemed mentally ill.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second trend is that every time gun control is brought up in the context of mass shootings, mental illness is brought up. Now, keeping firearms out of the hands of a schizophrenic who has homicidal tendencies might be a good thing in the short term (
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       ), but it sets up a dangerous precedent: the government can revoke your constitutional rights because it deems you mentally ill.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's to stop them from saying you can't drive a car, or work certain jobs, things which aren't even constitutionally guaranteed? What if they can restrict where you are allowed to live, with whom you may freely associate, etc? All of these can be argued based on the same logic: for the sake of public safety, we must restrict the rights of those whom we deem mentally ill and unsafe for society.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not about whether a transgender person is mentally ill; it's about what happens when we casually accept this label for groups of people with whom we disagree. This is one more line along which we will be divided, and a divided populace is that much easier to control.

       This should be the top comment, in fact this should be its own thread. The Communists did this in Russia, they called it "Sluggish Schizophrenia" one of the lesser known tactics of totalitarian regimes. The Fascists, Communists and Democratic Socialists all use the same playbooks.

       Do schizophrenics see things? Do transgender people see themselves as something else? Mental disorder. Not saying they should be locked up and sedated or killed or deprived of rights. They should be helped, just like other mentally ill people. However, they should not be held as normal and made into "normal" and "brave". There is an agenda. I do not encourage my schizophrenic aunt to pursue her delusions. I love her and communicate to the best I can. I think you misunderstand me/what I said.

       I think I get you, and I do see the agenda (or more likely, agendas), behind pushing the transgender thing. I don't think you want to deprive them of rights, nor that you feel they are lesser. I did not know your aunt was schizophrenic, and I meant no offense by using that in my example.
      </p>
      <p>
       My comment was not so much toward you as it was a tangent on what I see as a troubling confluence of trends, and a certain casualness of using the term "mentally ill" in general. I don't want to get into the specifics of transgenderism, and though that inspired my comment, it's probably not the best example.

       They are trying to get us all against each other and warp realities. Divide and conquer. I know what you were trying to say, because it's a slippery slope. First they came for x, and you know the rest of the quote. I'm a conspiracy theorist "nutter", so I'm "mentally ill", according to them. I get it, I get what you are saying. Conversing on a text forum is difficult, but I think we agree more than we disagree. Cheers, mate!

       No publicity is bad publicity. Get publocity and suddenly free exposure. Free exposure is good when you need free advertising. So what is happening is Starbucks is not meeting its targets and needs more people drinking their coffee. Solution: get more people to know about starbucks. With a simple cotroversy that is completely bullshit in the scale of cotroversies.

       It's just like last year or so (this may have only happened in Canada) where Starbucks made an 'announcement' that they are considering selling alcohol in 'select locations'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, this was a huge news story for a few days and of course absolutely nothing came of it, and no one has heard about it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was just a stupid thing designed to create news, and thus, boatloads of free advertising.

       This is a popular modern marketing tactic.

       That's why I give zero attention to both the bullshitters and the people who get uppity about the bullshitters. The trick to getting rid of most types of bullshit (especially the "I'm offended" kind) is to ignore them like the tantrumy toddlers they are.

       I had a suspicion that it was something similar to this.  Last week or so Ive never actually seen or heard anyone actually upset about the cup. It's been implied or attributed to people, but not once has anyone actually been upset. For the most part its been people saying how stupid it all is. Glad I'm not the only that thought something was off in all of this.

       I don't know how made up it is, but it's obvious they're giving it the media spotlight much more than it deserves which is fueling the flames and giving starbucks more exposure. That part is certainly no accident.

       They still have to advertise and get their name out to stay relevant. Coke is one of the most well known brands in the world and they spent $3.37 Billion advertising in 2014 alone.

       Part of the protest was people going to Starbucks and "pranking" them by giving "Merry Christmas" as their name so that the Starbucks employee would write it on the cup.

       It reminds me of people who manufacture persecution against themselves in order to bring about attention to real or imagined persecution. Like the Jewish girl who was caught putting swastikas on her own college dorm room door.

       I haven't seen anyone legitimately upset about this. It's a red fucking cup. It's still "christmas-y" even if it doesn't have a goddamn snowflake on it. It's also November; they could we waiting to put out the baby jesus cupholders until after Thanksgiving.

       This has kinda been a hot topic in r/atheism lately; however, I don't believe we (r/atheism) was paid off by Starbucks. (I understand what you're saying but I'm stressing not
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       people talking about it on unique platforms were paid off for it--although the social media falsification is a problem. E.g. Meek Mill &amp; Drake's "beef" was a publicity stunt to promote both of their upcoming releases.)

       Regardless of what you feel about transgenderism being a real or created phenomenon, I'd be wary about buying into the label of "mentally ill" that's applied to them. Labelling people "mentally ill" has a long history of marginalizing certain groups of people and denying them rights, while the majority of the public supports such actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I give you two worrying trends. First, more and more people are being labelled mentally ill. While I think certain conditions are becoming more prevalent (and that alone is worrisome), another factor is a widening definition of the term. People who believe in conspiracy theories have and will be officially deemed mentally ill.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second trend is that every time gun control is brought up in the context of mass shootings, mental illness is brought up. Now, keeping firearms out of the hands of a schizophrenic who has homicidal tendencies might be a good thing in the short term (
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       ), but it sets up a dangerous precedent: the government can revoke your constitutional rights because it deems you mentally ill.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's to stop them from saying you can't drive a car, or work certain jobs, things which aren't even constitutionally guaranteed? What if they can restrict where you are allowed to live, with whom you may freely associate, etc? All of these can be argued based on the same logic: for the sake of public safety, we must restrict the rights of those whom we deem mentally ill and unsafe for society.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not about whether a transgender person is mentally ill; it's about what happens when we casually accept this label for groups of people with whom we disagree. This is one more line along which we will be divided, and a divided populace is that much easier to control.

       Cool that is great. Not everyone lives near their loved ones. No one is making you use Facebook. It does not mean that other people don't use it for its intended purpose and get joy/entertainment/companionship from connecting with friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find that people who say facebook is an obstacle in their life will likely just find something else to call an obstacle anyways, its a ridiculous notion.
