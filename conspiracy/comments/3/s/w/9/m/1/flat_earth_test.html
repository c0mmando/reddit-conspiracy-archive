       I am not a flat Eather but it bothers me that this conspiracy hasn't been completely debunked yet. I think this could be a method to show the definitive truth. One of the experiments flat Eathers look to is an experiment done in a canal that shows no curvature. But I suspect this may lead to inaccuracies because water may react differently when filling areas on flat land compared to a large ocean. My idea is to do somekind of test along the beaches of the ocean. The water should follow the curve of the Earth at the ocean shores. So you could build some type of small towers at this point and then go down shore and build another tower and try to measue the curvature there using lasers or a particle acclerator beam or even long cables stretched between towers.

       If the water doesn't seem to follow the curve of the earth on canals, why should it follow the curve of the earth on ocean shores?  Perhaps the true way to test this is by looking towards the horizon of the massive oceans (which, by either gravity ... or upwards acceleration, whatever you believe, should either be precisely flat or precisely wrap around the earth.)  Are their claims of perspective being the reason things disappear have some truth to it?  Does a telescope truly "recover" the sight of a ship that sunk past the horizon?
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems to be the easiest of tests if you really wanted to know the answer (and one must perform it himself since there is no real reason to believe scientific or internet-found claims without a doubt .  To measure the flatness or rotundity using your proposed method will likely result in unmanageable sources of error/deviation from the actual value.

       There's something called light refraction though.. this is why scientists claim that things look higher at the horizon than they should. But flat Earthers don't buy this claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I think it doesn't follow with canals is because the localized gravity on land may prevent the curvature from taking effect. I think land filling valleys on Earth when geological formations were created may be totally flat for the same reason. And that flat Earth between mountains would cause the water to follow the same shape. The same with lakes too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the curvature would follow on ocean shores because the water would follow the contour of the oceans more rather than the localized gravity on land. There are gravity maps that show gravity is stronger at different places on Eath. The shores may be affected a bit but I suspect not as much as on land due to the formations I talked about previously.

       Can you explain that a little more?  Are you suggesting this as a solution to why a telescope might make an object that disappeared over the horizon, appear again (assuming that its true, which I find hard to believe but haven't done the experiment myself)
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Refraction would only be introduced if the local density above the water changes as one measures out towards the deep ocean/horizon.  This is certianly plausible, since perhaps it generally gets colder out towards the ocean, causing light to bend downwards as it passes through the gradient of increasing index of refraction.  But then why did the ship disappear in the first place?  Too small to see?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for local gravity and geological formation: It follows that the more flat a particular region is, the more curved it most be in another area.  You can imagine this as we live on something less discrete than this random image of a 3d shape (

       Yes. It's the same kind of thing that causes mirages on deserts. Water in dense atmosphere causes refraction of light - just like how light refracts through glass for the same reason. Scientists claim this is why the curvature of the Earth isn't as noticeable as it should be and why you can see objects you shouldn't if the Earth is curved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since I believe you can't see the curvature as easily on land or water on land then that leaves the ocean. But getting accurate measurements on an unstable ocean surface is problematic. This is why I think the ocean shore is the best place to do a test like this. You would have an unimpeded line of site on the shore as well because people don't build on it or you could measure from 2 different outcrops or "points" downshore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Refractions might be why a laser might not work.. but maybe if you use a high power laser pulse you could get around this problem.. or a particle accelerator. Or long cables you could measure in various ways.

       This still didn't answer my question.  I completely comprehend why refraction might make curvature less detectable.  But then we'd be able to reverse this affect by looking from the deep ocean towards the shore (supposing the temperature increases in that direction and the index of refraction decreases.)  Objects should disappear over the horizon faster.  (Closer to the measurer)
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless this still doesn't get to the idea that objects might very well reappear if looking through a telescope.  As mentioned in my first post, I am most curious in substantiating this claim that I've read in numerous places.  Perhaps its blatantly false.  But let's suppose the phenomenon happened.  Do you believe it can be explained by light refractions?

       I'm not sure that were are talking about the same thing. When you say "appear again" are you refering to how you can see an object through a telescope that you couldn't see with the naked eye?

       Yep.  That's the unsubstantiated, confusing claim I've read in a couple of places.  But it would have great ramifications if true.  And I don't believe it can be explained using refraction.  But also, my first paragraph shows that the earth would appear more curved depending on which you are measuring.  Also if in the very deep ocean, I don't believe refraction would be part of the equation at all.

       My understanding is that the object doesn't reappear... not sure how you interpret reappear. My view is that it's made visible through the telescope. The reason for this is perspective. The object is just too small when not magnified to be able to see it properly. The refraction is always there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also.. I get the impression you are saying that temperature is an issue with refraction and that's why it shouldn't work towards shore? I think temperature is just a small part of it but the refraction is always there.

       Refraction can't just always be there.  You'd have to at least suggest why it'd always be there.  If there are no local deviations in some physical property of the air above the surface of the ocean,  then I'd see no reason why it'd be there unless we begin discussing the potential electromagnetic field effects inherent in our earth-atmosphere system.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like the argument that refraction is "always there" stems from scientific explanation of one aspect of sunsets.  In this case, I'd agree refraction is always there, since light is traveling through greatly differing densities/temperatures of the atmosphere at steep angles.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for clarification, yes, i meant disappear/reappear in the sense that our biological eyesight had insignificant magnification to identify some far away object still in line of sight.

       Yes, that's the claim.. anywhere in the atmosphere there is refraction. The denser the atmosphere the more refraction. In space this isn't the case because there is no atmosphere. But our view of space is not accurate because of the atmosphere. I mean I am not saying there isn't a possibility that this is wrong a lie. But according to their claims it is consistent.

       Regarding this comment.. imagine you blew that geometric shape up dramatically.. I imagine the land areas on the Earth's surface being a more detailed version - many more connecting rods and geometric surfaces. And the connecting rods would be mountain ranges. The inner wells would be like concave troughs. Or flat spots or troughs with flat spots in the center. And shallow water would follow this gravity shape as well.

       Flat Earthers claim this is just due to perspective.... they also point out that the sun doesn't light the bottoms of the clouds as it should when going down. I don't know about this but that's their claim.

       Without fail, at the first mention or flat earth, your pet topic, you come running.  To see how low on the totum pole with this always makes me laugh.  The lowest of the low typically gets forum detail.  And as we've seen, you been on such detail for years.  Interesting, to ssh the least.

       So "easy" that you MUST debate EVERY single mention of it...EVERY single time.

       It's akin to a group of people regularly posting nonsense about how the sky is magenta and not blue.  Then seeing you have to respond to them every single time.  It's laughable to think this is how you naturally behave, and not a topic that you MUST own every single mention of.

       When the link above was clicked, it brought me to this discussion.  Thanks to you and your friends disruption efforts, the topic is now listed as being heavily shilled.  I read down through the comments, and sure enough exactly as expected, you're playing the exact same role with flat earf here that you ALWAYS do.  Rockran right into this thread to tell everyone how wrong they are.

       Says someone who can't even keep themselves believable for one single post.  As soon as you enter as a 7 day old Redditor, you INSTANTLY expose yourself.

      <p>
       You can have every problem in the world with my approach.  But it doesn't matter.  Your manufactured problems, used in an attempt to attack me for exposing both you and your little limited hangout shill Snowden sadly don't amount to shit.

       I've watched you walk through half a dozen or more attempts at attacking me and my position on Snowden.  Watching every single one or then fail, as you transition to the next flawed attempt.

        Sidetrack opponents with petty name calling and ridicule … Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as “kooks”, “right-wing”, “liberal”, “left-wing”, “terrorists”, “conspiracy buffs”, “radicals”, “militia”, “racists”, “religious fanatics”, “sexual deviates”, and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues.

       If you want to use light you have to consider whether or not light bends in the atmosphere.  In fact it does bend in the atmosphere, but not in the way you might think.  In order for you to be able to see objects over water at the distances they are visible with a spherical earth of circumference 25000 miles light needs to bend by an amount nearly equal to this curvature.  But, if you test how light bends with a device such a theodolite you find that it in fact bends the other way, up through the atmosphere!  Read about that here:
       <a href="http://www.wildheretic.com/bendy-light-the-evidence/">
        http://www.wildheretic.com/bendy-light-the-evidence/
       </a>
       in the "Theodolites" section.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea you propose sounds a lot like an experiment that was performed with a mechanical device on a beach called the rectilineator experiment.  It showed that the earth curves up, rather than down.  Description of that here:
       <a href="http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/6/">
        http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/6/

       Much of the evidence in the area of Flat Earth is not actually proof of a flat earth, but proof against the spinning globe.  I think that the spinning globe model is wrong, but I think the evidence for the Concave Earth model is stronger than that for Flat Earth.  Flat Earth suffers for the "Southern Problem".  How do the sun and stars work for the far South?  For example to have a long, 17 hour, summer day at the tip of Argentina with a flat earth and sun rotating around the North pole, the visible sun distance of the sun must be huge.  This does not completely rule out a flat earth since there are possible models involving dome reflection to make the sun and stars work, but it cannot work as a spotlight.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Concave model is much more complete and the empirical evidence is fairly strong.  I think it is possible that flat earth is an obfuscation, offering a false choice between the official model and the standard flat model.  It is an interesting subject, that is for sure.  People who do nothing but shout it down are missing something I think, there are too many problems with the official model.  A large problem is the size of the lie, it is just beyond consideration for most people.

       I think it is odd that the moon is set up in such a way that we only ever see one side of it.  I am fairly certain that we have never landed on it.  I'm not sure whether it is possible to land on it or not.  The portion that is visible to us does appear to be a curved surface.  Whether or not it is a complete sphere, I don't know.

       If you look at the edges of the disk or sphere depending how you look at it you can see that the "craters" are all oval shaped at the edges.. this shows to me that the moon is spherical. Could it be concave somehow and that is why it has craters in perspective? I'm not sure.. but it's also possible that the moon could be shaped differently than the Earth.. I don't know.

       Yet it's magically exactly the same perceived size as the sun, just exactly 400x the size, and 400x the distance.  And moves at almost the same speed across the night sky.  Just some more of those crazy "coincidences," right?

       I am leaning towards some advanced civilization putting the moon there at some point much more than thinking the Earth is flat. This is just my view based on the evidence. Some claim the moon is made of a super thick titanium shell.. which is the ideal material for space/aircraft. And it's said to be hollow...

       I don't think we are controlled by aliens or anything. I just think that the the universe has been around for maybe eternity... I am in doubt about the big bang and the supposed age of this planet. Even if the planet is as old as they say there is time for a lot of stuff to happen here we have no idea about. What I have heard about the moon and the weird coinceidences  and oddities make me think it's not natural.

       Claims that the moon has a very thick shell of titanium and appears to be hollow based on seismic readings. Evidence such as the moon being perfectly aligned to exlipse the Sun perfectly.

       Whew do you base this titanium shell on?  NASAs Apollo rocks (that were very likely limited to the small samples collected during VonBraun's expeditions to the North Pole during the pre-Apollo days).  The ESA satellite impact years ago showed that the makeup was extremely dissimilar to that which was clamed by NASA.

       The official explanation as to why the one face is always toward us is very evidence based and logical.  Do you understand it?  It is however, auite clear that the moon is not what we've been told.  To think it's aliems however is incredibly foolish.  Queue aliem agenda stalker bot from Top Minds in 3...2...

If you possessed a higher level of intelligence, I would help you understand the source of much of this.  For some here, it's sadly the default response.  Can't explain something..."

       <strong>
        What is not irony however is that people such as yourself...those who push that conspiracies don't exist...that Snowden is NOT a Limited Hangout actor...That Zionist Sanders isn't 100% controlled and is "really just out to help you" is also pushing the tired aliem agenda nonsense

       Though I am not a flat earth advocate per say, I have come to believe there is more to the story than we have all
 been taught. Nothing can prove heliocentricity, and the proof we have of earth being a ball is not all that convincing once you realise all those nasa pictures are fake composite images.

       Yes.. the Bedford level experiment is not accurate in my view because it is on land which could cause inaccuracies due to variations in the gravity  effects on land. I don't think this would be an issue or as big an issue on ocean shores which is why I think tests should be done there.

       That experiment is so flawed it does not have to go into alot of processing and serious thought...It was done by a man in the 1800s and he only measured a length of a canal that was 6 miles long....
      </p>
      <p>
       6 MILES...not 60 not 600 not 6000 but 6..and said there was no curvature.?.
      </p>
      <p>
       THink about it..the earth is some 24,000 miles wide right? something like that..if the earth curved at 600 miles ,even then the world would be the size of a little bigger than mercury..and at 6 miles your talking about a moon and not a planet at all..
Plus it goes to show that some will go as far to say the earth is flat because of NASA's lies...
.Do i believe NASA lies? of course, all the time especially when they say they can spot a planet a million light years away and tell us it has water on it and that it has oxygen and yet they never show you a real picture of the planet but an "artist rendition" aka cough cough MADE UP..And yet also they just now are showing real pictures of Pluto for the first time...
So a planet thats millions of miles away is now being seen for the first time yet they are jerking us off by saying that they can tell that a shiny bright light thats billions of miles even millions of light years away has anything on it? and at that saying it exists when they ALSO say that everything we see is most likely not there because the light is actually just arriving to us from its vast travels through space..
      </p>
      <p>
       So again does NASA LIE. no doubt about it..But is the earth flat?
NOT LIKELY.. Since it is a fact if it was, i should be able to see Tokyo from California and Paris from New York but i dont.

       If they truly believe that then how can they possibly believe the earth is flat? We have observed and tested that celestial bodies to indeed exist and that there are billions of billions of them. There is no point to try and convince the willfully ignorant.

       They claim that those celestial bodies aren't what people claim. They say they are anomalies in the dome that covers the flat Earth or other objects outside it I guess.. everything else is made up by the Freemasons and all the others are either in on it or too afraid or stupid to speak up.

       If you look at the edges of the disk or sphere depending how you look at it you can see that the "craters" are all oval shaped at the edges.. this shows to me that the moon is spherical. Could it be concave somehow and that is why it has craters in perspective? I'm not sure.. but it's also possible that the moon could be shaped differently than the Earth.. I don't know.
