If anything he violated JSTOR&#39;s TOS and did not commit &#39;hacking&#39; or &#39;wire fraud&#39;--that&#39;s just incorrect.  If you are logged in, then running a spider / scraper script to download a bunch of articles is &#39;hacking&#39; in no ones definition other than the government&#39;s.

    <div class="md"><p>No kidding it was a trumped up charge. My view is it seems entirely made-up. Why would Swartz go to a server closet to download files he could download with a script? Also, does MIT actually mirror the archive? He is said to have &quot;used MIT&#39;s data network to bulk-download a substantial portion of JSTOR&#39;s collection of academic journal articles.&quot; Am I missing something here? Why would he go to an MIT server closet to download files that could be downloaded from any computer connected to the MIT network?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to the indictment, Swartz surreptitiously attached a laptop to MIT’s computer network, which ran a script named &quot;keepgrabbing.py&quot;,[1][7] allowing him to &quot;rapidly download an extraordinary volume of articles from JSTOR.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to be missing the point. With an institutional account, you don&#39;t need to login to the JSTOR archive, all you need is an IP address that JSTOR recognises as an IP address on the network. So no need for a &quot;shell script or python script to login and wget every document&quot;. Swartz did not need to go to a server closet and plug his laptop into a switch to get access to those documents. All he needed was to use any computer anywhere on the MIT network, and then write a script that would download the documents. He could use wget, or he could use something else. Either way, it makes no sense that he would have had to go into a server closet and plug a laptop into a switch to get documents he could have accessed from anywhere on the MIT network. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely agree with you. When I watched the doc on Aaron, I kept thinking to myself that if I was in his position facing these ridiculous charges, I think I would just run away to south america or something. Since he was such a computer whiz I feel like he still could have kept up his internet activism as long as he had a laptop and a wifi connection. Plus he had the money to fake his death and or escape if he wanted to. I know it&#39;s not the most noble choice but sometimes self-preservation is key.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is truly the proof that reddit is no longer what it once was or stood for. It has been co-opted,  just like the governments of the world have been. </p>

<p>Money has taken over. reddits owners have come up with a different way of monetizing the website, instead of bombarding us with advertisements, they are much more subtle. Corporate posts that make the front page are certainly paid for. As it has been shown that upvotes can be purchased. </p>

<p>I also believe that reddit is selling influence. Making it appear as a consensus exists when in fact it does not is simply a matter or money. It&#39;s still coming from advertising budgets. It&#39;s just a bit different kind of advertising. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised at all if reddit is found to be running groups of shills for hire. They will spread any message you want, for the right price. </p>

<p>It&#39;s sad to see what this website has become. It is not what Aaron Schwartz intended. There is no doubt about that. </p>

<p>But then again, that&#39;s probably why he&#39;s dead, I don&#39;t know</p>
