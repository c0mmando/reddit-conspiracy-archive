<p>We are trying to provoke China by sending warships into disputed waters we have no claim on.  China stated those actions would not be taken lightly.  So we send more warships to the area.   </p>

<p>Has the US lost their fucking mind?  </p>

<p>We are sending ground troops into Syria when we were not asked to be there, and in fact the UN has told us to get the hell out.  </p>

<p>We openly admit to arming the people the Russians are there fighting.  And sending more air to air fighters to the area.  </p>

<p>For what?  To provide air cover for Al Queda and ISIL?  Terrorist groups we now have a soft spot for.   </p>

<p>The idiots running our foreign policy have demonstrated over the last decade that they don&#39;t have a clue what they are doing, and they do not deserve one more chance to fuck this county up. </p>

<p>China is not a threat.  Syria is not a threat.  Iran is not a threat.  Russia is not a threat.  They do not want war, but OUR government is leaving them no choice.  </p>

<p>They will destroy us in a conventional war, and we have nuclear weapons.  What do you think is the next move?</p>

<p>Write, e-mail, call, go to the office&#39;s of your congressman in DC.   Take to the streets.   Today, tonight, right now.</p>

<p>Let them know they go to war, their will be war here to get them the hell out of there by any means necessary.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post! The US is doing everything it can to bring on WW3 because 1)the economic fiat money game is crumbling (were running out of bubbles to blow up and burst) &amp; 2)people are waking up to all the corruption and something is needed to boost nationalism. We will position ourselves accordingly, and when the time is right, a massive false flag and corresponding propaganda will bring this country to a fascist fury of crazed nationalists and war hawks. </p>

<p>I think once the next big event happens, the US is gonna be exposed in all of its false flags and provocations ala some massive Snowden-esque data dump, which will pour gasoline on the moral of the US; berserker mode.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people simply won&#39;t believe WWIII/nuclear war is possible because it would mean &quot;The End of the World&quot;.</p>

<p>They believe that the leaders of nations like Russia and the US will always do everything they can to avoid nuclear war because it would be equivalent to committing suicide.</p>

<p>This is far from the truth. It&#39;s a well known fact that most nuclear nations have deep underground installations designed to ensure the survival of that nation&#39;s leadership in the event of nuclear war.</p>

<p>The US, in particular, has many vast underground bunkers where high level government and military officials could live in comparative luxury for years.</p>

<p>In short, they could fight a nuclear war knowing full well that they would be among the survivors. They might also be thinking that there&#39;d be lots more room for those who survived once 90% of the rest of the population is gone.</p>

<p>A normal person would hope that WWIII will never happen. But power hungry psychopaths that know their survival is assured? For them, nuclear war might even seem desirable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I honestly haven&#39;t thought much about that; I suppose because there is literally nothing that myself, or anyone else could do in that case. I don&#39;t necessarily think that WW3 would escalate to nuclear holocaust, but then again we haven&#39;t had a major world war since MAD is kind of the ethos. I mean the US dropped the bombs on Japan, so it&#39;s definitely not that far fetched to think it could happen again. You are right about these underground bunkers also--- I feel like those in power are too lazy to rebuild &quot;civilization&quot; in that event because they wouldn&#39;t have the slave labor to do the actual hard work. Haha I dunno--- nuclear war / massive bio warfare, those are just things that I can&#39;t concern myself with too much because they&#39;re literally endgame scenarios for pretty much everyone. </p>

<p>I&#39;m working my days now to deligitimize the Status Quo by pointing out contradictions and supporting alternative solutions within advanced technology and open sourcing which can make &quot;their&quot; power over the people obsolete. Supersede the Status Quo, one bite at a time, little by little</p>

When the bread runs out, they bring the circus or the war games. The upside for them is that they get to kill off millions of people and later blame us for it.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree in theory with most of your post except this part:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The idiots running our foreign policy have demonstrated over the last decade that they don&#39;t have a clue what they are doing, and they do not deserve one more chance to fuck this county up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it&#39;s very dangerous to believe the real shapers of this country&#39;s policy are inept, clueless, or idiotic. We first must realize that important and long-term decisions are not made by elected officials, but by members of the deep state, billionaires, and/or secret societies, depending on what you believe. These people have very different motives and drives than the rest of us (or at least their scope makes them different in practice), and do not consider loss of human life to be a deterrent to their goals. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that petitioning Congressmen has the ability to make the changes necessary in the time frame needed, though I will not discourage anyone from doing so. I think only a massive shift in consciousness has the capability to turn the tide, yet I&#39;ll be the first to admit I don&#39;t know the mechanics of how that would actually work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your point, and I think we&#39;re talking about different people. When I see &quot;the [people] running our foreign policy,&quot; I am thinking of those people within central banking, MIC, etc., and not the politicians who work for them. </p>

<p>I think the politicians are making a gamble that they can become rich and powerful by doing the bidding of those still more powerful. The people who actually run things don&#39;t give a shit about their lackeys, and would throw them under the bus in a heartbeat. I think the gamble likely does pay off for some, but those who are surprised when it doesn&#39;t truly are idiots.</p>

<p>Will not help, the people at war without goverment are within our goverment themselves. </p>

<p>America is literally at war with itself. This is why I&#39;m trying to tell you, there is nothing we can do because they don&#39;t care in that sense about the people.</p>

<p>The reality is, </p>

<p>The Old is oppression and wants control over the people but more so certain groups of ethnicity. </p>

<p>The New is equality but still wants control over ALL people and in turn will be forced to fight the old for that idea to exist, thus having to do the one thing that all of us hate, WAR.</p>

<p>Therefore, even if the we stopped doing stuff as you stated above, it wouldn&#39;t matter because this is about power and ideas, not money. Those actions would only hurt the people.</p>

<p>God is Mighty but the Devil isn&#39;t so shabby himself.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to do anything because it will happen when the forces come together regardless of what you do. The titans will do battle, this is inevitable. </p>

<p>You can do whatever you like but it will have no effect since the people we are dealing with are</p>

<p>(A) One side has shown it gives zero fucks about your opinion or efforts.</p>

<p>(B) The other side is tired of side (A) to the point it will do anything to to stop it.</p>

<p>So yes, protest, go out and withhold taxes, do all the things you need to do but none of it will stop the forces from colliding at some point.</p>

<p>In the first part you deal with people you could &quot;enjoy&quot; disliking but the current generation is far worse because they are the end product of the system, face less, no moral whatsoever, no belief than their own profits.

<p>Wrong, what you witness was the power going from the white supremacist, back into the hands of minorities. The death of European capitalism is soon to come as well, this in turn will spark WW3.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is, the civil war never ended. This due to Rothschild&#39;s having a heavy hand in the South and it&#39;s politics. Many of America&#39;s southern politicians are first cousins to the Royal Crown.</p>

<p>The Royal Crown being controlled by Nazi&#39;s itself</p>

<p>You begin to see why the Rothschild&#39;s or the Red Shield (Litteral English Translation.)</p>

<p><strong>Hitler was Funded by Rothschild&#39;s and The Bush Family and boasted White Supremacy</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why the October Revolution was headed by Ashkenazi Jews which called them selves the RED ARMY</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why the Khazar Theory is coming to the forefront</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why it is was a Rothschild that signed Israel in to exsistance while also headlining political Zionism</strong></p>

<p>But this was already predated to happen...</p>

<p>What you have said here is fact but not what is currently going on. WW3 is inevitable as these events seem to become more and more apparent. </p>

<p>While my theory does change often on and on, it is becoming more real everyday as I watch the headlines.</p>

<p>This is simply the basis of my theory, I have much more but explaining it is very hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know... it might be too late unless they get help, BIG HELP from the rest of the world and after what US has been doing to them selves and the world i doubt that help gonna come, shame tho. US has used divide and conquer on their own people for decades now... just look, there are too many docile, greedy, emotionless, materialistic, uninterested, ignorant, fearful etc. in the majority but those that want a better for everyone are just too few. I think something drastic needs to happen to make those in power to think twice about what they are doing or even bring them down.</p>

<p>Also what has been going on in the world is sad and its not about USA anymore, the humanity at its core is at stake here... this wont just go away when you go to sleep and wake up. If you want a better world for yourself, your loved ones and everyone else you gonna need to fight for it while you don&#39;t twist your common sense, morals and ethics to do it... essentially yourself! I truly hope things turn out good for the WHOLE PLANET in near future where humanity puts this insanity to rest and moves on to things that truly matter on personal and global level.</p>

<p>THEY use war as means to prevent potential competetors like Russia and China from becoming strong. This is their standard MO. </p>

<p>THEY do not want direct conflict between the UK/EU and Russia/China. They would prefer to use the US to fight these countries. Or, even better, start a fight between, say, India and China.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post. The US&#39;s meddling and subterfuge in Syria and Ukraine, and their trolling of Iran, China, Russia etc is part of a strategy that goes back almost a century. Here&#39;s a quotation describing the US&#39;s longstanding foreign policy objectives, which might sound familiar.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;The American President increasingly used his influence to create conflicts, intensify existing conflicts, and above all, to keep conflicts from being resolved peacefully.</strong></p>

<p><strong>For years, this man looked for a dispute anywhere in the world... that he could use to create political entanglements with American economic obligations to one of the contending sides, which would then steadily involve America in the conflict and thus divert attention from his own confused domestic economic policies.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>This not a description of Obama, or Bush (although it could be), but Franklin D. Roosevelt. And the man who described the US President in this way was Adolf Hitler. The full speech is here. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G57GKUtWzNs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G57GKUtWzNs</a></p>

<p>Everyone should ask themselves which country benefited the most from WW2 and then try to entertain the idea that the United States may have planned this all along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US is sending in warships to give China the message it&#39;s not allowed to do whatever it wants. Theyre building little sand islands and trying to claim that everything around it is their territory. You don&#39;t get to do that. If the US created tiny islands next to Europe and South America and tried to claim their territory as their own you would call for their heads. But when China does it America is the bad guy? China is trying to claim territory that belongs to other nations. And their doing it for the same reason you accuse America of going to war, for oil and other profit. Why do you think that any of those countries would destroy us in a &quot;conventional war&quot; whatever that means. Are you talking about a WWII scenario with fighting in multiple theatres? Are you talking about a veitnam situation? An iraq/Afganistán situation? If you put the US against any military the US wins. The only threat could be China because of sheer numbers, but they still wouldn&#39;t win. We have the war fighting experience China doesn&#39;t. We have the superior technology. We know how to fight them in an urban environment, in a jungle, or in a desert. They don&#39;t have any practice with waging a modern war. </p>

<p>The fact Iraq is about to request Russian support in their fight against terrorist groups like ISIS and Al Queda also makes the US look like the assholes of the world.   </p>

<p>They denounce ISIS yet arm them.  And escort an ISIS convoy  into Syria with an Apache helicopter.   </p>

We aren&#39;t trying to claim any islands as our own I don&#39;t think you&#39;re understanding that. We are protecting the territory of our allies who do have claims to those islands. Syria and China are two different problems no one is going to stop paying attention to Syria unless a war breaks out which isn&#39;t going to happen with china. I really don&#39;t see how Russia made the USA look stupid in your eyes, if we sent in fighter jets and decimated them then you would be crying about what is the US doing in a place they don&#39;t belong. You obviously don&#39;t do educate yourself much more then reading sensational reddit titles because that wasn&#39;t an Apache helicopter. I agree that the US should have stayed out of the middle east. But we&#39;re at a point where we aren&#39;t fighting a group of rebels or terrorists or a foreign country were fighting an ideology. The US isn&#39;t just going to leave and let these group rampage weak countries and just wait for the next attack on the west. A lot of people seem to forget that the US isn&#39;t the only culture they hate, they hate western civilization. While the US is the biggest player in the game so we get the most hate, what happens when Germany or the UK, or Switzerland or anyone else in Europe gets attacked? There&#39;s more at play here then you want to admit. </p>

<p>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...
