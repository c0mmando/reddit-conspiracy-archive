       Given the 2015 attacks in Paris on 11/13, the

       </a>
       is a pretty big deal coincidence.  The Templars became the Freemasons through Alchemy and Rosicrucianism--it's a long running occult / gnostic tradition going back to the mystery schools of near to middle east.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's even more meaningful if you consider it was Friday the 13th, which is often linked to the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar#Arrests.2C_charges_and_dissolution">
        arrest, confession, torture and execution of Templars
       </a>
       accused of worshipping Baphomet
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At dawn on Friday, 13 October 1307 King Philip IV ordered Jacques de Molay and scores of other French Templars to be simultaneously arrested.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They were later tortured into confessions and some were later burned at the stake based on those confessions by Philippe de Marigny.  In France.

       If anyone rolls their eyes at this, research the mystery schools OP mentioned before you dismiss it entirely. Secret societies have been the hidden guiding hand of the progression of man since pre-history.

       Very interesting observation. Who knows if it's the Masons, or someone else with knowledge of them, trying to point us in the right direction, or to just blame them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, after reading some of their literature, I can't help but wonder if the Masons themselves are under attack by dark occultists, or Illuminati (the bad one's).

       That is a good point, and I'm not a high level freemason or a mason at all so I really don't know.  I think this is a problem with secret societies--they have to bear the burden of their secrets, which is blame and abuse by others for things that don't make sense in the world within the context of ultrarich and ultrapowerful people who have been recorded as saying they had the motiviation and the means and the plans to carry out wars, false flags and atrocities for self gain.  So why wouldn't we implicate them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a gesture of revelation, good-faith, and
       <em>
        trust of the common citizen
       </em>
       on the part of freemasons is needed to assuage fears of police state and draconianism.  Something like a
       <em>
        total, final end of the drug war
       </em>
       would do it, allowing decriminalization of all plants, animals, mineral and fungi and restoration of sovereignty of a person over their own bodies in their own homes.  Secondarily the passing of laws allowing open and concealed carry of a firearm for every citizen over 17 without any history of violent crime, specific types of mental illness such as psychopathy, use of stimulants or psychedelics.
      </p>
      <p>
       IF they are so powerful, they need to address in a meaningful way the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       events of 9/11.  You see, per my username, I'm a truther and I believe that Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld and any who assisted them (secret societies) subverted the intelligence community and using their own resources against them, along with help from ISIS ('israeli secret intelligence service' aka mossad) to bring down the towers.  At this point, we've got triangulation (well really it's more like 100+ points of triangulation) as proof but the vast majority of america won't accept it because of psychological barriers--deeply felt cognitive dissonance and suspension of disbelief blinding them from Truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this model is NOT the truth, then freemasons need to do a better job of helping us get to the truth, or at least one that is much more acceptable than what we've been given.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another model is that Bush's administration was so incredibly inept that they actually interfered and let all of our enemies gang up on us and blow up a bunch of people while stealing lots of things simultaneously.  This would have to be a coordinated effort of every intelligence agency on earth, which means that our intelligence agency was completely out in the cold, which means we totally suck and there's no hope for our future.  I don't buy this model whatsoever.

       By that logic it could be the SUN since the SUN shows up every day with a 1 in 1 chance of being the culprit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is a birthday is a personal event that occurs yearly, not a symbolic event that happened once in history.
