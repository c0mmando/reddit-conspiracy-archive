       I was thinking about anti-intellectualism and the limiting of ideas in our national conversations. Our society is made more restrictive by limiting the number of things we can think about. If certain ideas are "beyond the pale" or "not worth thinking about" or "offensive" or whatever emotional label we can use to cordon them off, we can banish entire arenas of thought from our mental landscape if we accept these ideologies running through our culture. Ideologies increasingly promoted by corporate-owned media.
      </p>
      <p>
       5 media companies own 95% of American media. In 1983, that number was 50. The diversity of the message is limited, and with this russian nesting-dolls game of corporate consolidation that has become all the rage over the last 30 years, people are now trapped in what is effectively a pro-corporate echo chamber, regardless of which channel you watch or popular website you go to.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most irritating thing about all these ideologies is the strain of anti-intellectualism that has become so fashionable in the last decade or two. It's cool to be dumb, and it's annoying to ask too many questions. Our education system reinforces this, by training people that they're dumb unless they happen to be among the top 5% of students. These students then inevitably become attached to this system that rewards them, so it effectively makes all the most intelligent students very pro-authority, pro-"the system", because the system has always worked well for them. Then they are comfortable joining the military, working for the government, or working for large companies. So they are "captured" by large bureaucracies as a mindset, and become dependent on them to function and maintain a sense of self-value. This serves the status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the kids who
       <em>
        didn't
       </em>
       succeed in the system, well, they now hate the system because it told them they were failures. So they want to rebel against the system, not learn about it and work within it, but they're often too poor to do anything but remain agitated wage-slaves. Especially if you trick them in to taking out a bunch of debt, then they're trapped forever. They don't see legitimate ways to act to improve their situation on a long-term basis, and so all this pent-up energy gets put in to trivial spectacles like sports. They get the rage out in a way that doesn't challenge the power structures, and everyone is satisfied. Except the people stuck in the wage-slave lifestyles, of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, all these causes bleed in to the same effect: Anti-intellectualism. America hates people who are smart. People who ask too many questions suck. People who have "moral issues" with things are losers. Etc, etc. These are the ideas of a person who was wrung through the ringer of the school system and the media and the society we live in. These all feed anti-intellectualism, which serves to maintain the status quo. If smart people are never listened to (in terms of social organizing and things like this), then difficult problems will take much longer to fix. This serves the interests of the people already in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, some food for thought on a Friday evening. Curious if anyone else has anything to add.

       I agree with you. Americans have been trained to worship the body and physical excellence, and to mock or hold in disdain intellectual excellence. That's the culture that has been injected into our brains by those who control the media, for the past 60+ years or so. We celebrate the muscular dummy who can barely form a coherent sentence, and we make fun of the intellectual who reads, writes, and thinks.

       That's very true. I wonder if it has to do with seeing human workers, and thus the ideal human, as a machine.

       I don't know what to do about it, people get angry and frustrated with me because I still ask "why". I've had people flabbergasted simply because I asked why I couldn't use a side entry door to a store when they asked me not too, it wasn't in a confrontational way, they just weren't used to people asking why, maybe they had even forgotten why at one point.
      </p>
      <p>
       That reminds me OP, I cannot remember the name of the study, but there was supposedly an experiment with monkeys where in they had them all in a cage, and they would put a banana on top of a ladder in the middle of the room. They would then hose all the monkeys if any one of them tried to get the banana, they learned the correlation and quickly they developed a new behaviour, the other monkeys would gang up and attack anyone who dared reach for the banana. After a while of this, they eventually replaced one of the monkeys, now of course this new monkeys has no idea they will all be sprayed with water when he inevitably reaches for the banana, so when he does the other monkeys immediately attack him but he doesn't know why, and it's strange maybe to him and his monkey senses that there is food right there yet no monkey will reach for it. He learns that is simple "how it is". One of the other monkeys gets less dinner one night to encourage him to try to go for the banana, when he does of course the other monkeys attack the new monkey, with out knowing the reason behind it, will attack with the other monkeys. He now learns you attack whomever reaches for the banana on the ladder without ever having been hosed down like the rest of the monkeys. They then slowly did this with each monkey, replacing them 1 by 1 until none of the original monkeys were in the cage, none of these new monkeys were ever sprayed, not a single one of them knew the actual consequences of reaching for the banana on the ladder, yet when anyone of them was hungry enough or brave enough to reach for it, the rest would of course pounce to attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that is what America is, we are just experimental monkeys in a cage.

       Your monkey analogy is apt. It makes me think of the phrase "form over function". Society is just going through the motions, a long ways from the original intent of many. It takes someone to wake up and maybe try to reach for the banana again.  Maybe the hose will be off this time. Maybe there's some trick to get around the hose. Persistence pays off because it reveals subtler options for action. If groupthink is holding us all back, then why do we adhere so strongly to it? It's a conundrum.
      </p>
      <p>
       We want to learn from group wisdom, but it turns out most "group wisdom" is actually billionaire-serving traumas in disguise propagated through the media and repeated by an ignorant culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully the internet will wake us up from our groupthink slumber.
