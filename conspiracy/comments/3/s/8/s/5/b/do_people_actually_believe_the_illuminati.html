<p>At this point is seems that the Illuminati theories are some of the most prevalent, but at the same time they&#39;ve basically reached joke status so I was curious as to how they were actually regarded by people supposedly more &quot;in the know&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Illuminati is real, they reorganzied after they were banished from Europe, the same way the Knights Templar did (in Switzerland). Are they shape shifting aliens? No. But do they control? Yes. People find it so hard to believe, but what does a corporation do with it&#39;s board? A small group of people getting together to decide direction. To think elites do not do this, is delusional and defies logic/reason. Are they in control of everything? No. Variables nigga and various cliques. Look into the Bavarian Illuminati and the coming to America and Yale. All funded by English drug trade. Happy rabbit hole falling....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satan is for the masses. There is no Satan, however (getting esoteric), there are two bloodlines, Cain and Abel. One of &quot;God&quot; (Abel) and one of &quot;the Serpent&quot; (Cain). Both have the same mothers, Eve. The serpent wasn&#39;t a snake, and it didn&#39;t tempt Eve with an apple (or fig), they procreated. Cain killed Abel because &quot;God&quot; Favorited Abel over him. Abel was a servant of the &quot;Father&quot;, while Cain (A bastard/monster) was more interested in the arts/science/math/etc. Look into Canaanites-&gt;Gentiles ;).  </p>

<p>What the serpent or god truly was, idk. I&#39;m not a Vatican bishop and do not have access to their vaults. But this is what the Free Masons and other secret societies know. Look into the <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/sta/sta18.htm">Hiram legend</a>, because this is what they look into. </p>

<p>Are they using music to manipulate people/social manipulation? Yes. To what end, I do not know. All I know, is that Satan isn&#39;t real. Like the firey place where a devil sits, lol..... </p>

<p>Happy rabbit hole falling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally false.</p>

<p>They were a bunch of anti-monarchic, anti-papist, meritocratic, idealist, Renaissance men. They formed a club to bring down the royal families and the pope in Europe. They helped found America. They didn&#39;t do a half bad job.</p>

<p>Are they still around? </p>

<p>There&#39;s dozens of groups claiming to be them but none of them are. So no. I don&#39;t think they still exist, though influential groups pretend to be them from time to time.</p>

<p>Of course their battle against the Pope is why they&#39;ve been called Satanists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wanting is not the same as scheming. Unless you can actually show me where they were conspiring to establish one world government (as opposed to simply stating it as an objective/desire) this statement really doesn&#39;t really help. </p>

<p>You&#39;re stating their prior existence as a fact, so I would take that to mean evidence of your belief is easy to come by. Perhaps this conversation would be more fruitful if you could provide some proof of this? That way we can move away from vague generalities, they don&#39;t usually do well in conversations over the internet, especially not with so much disinformation around.</p>

I&#39;m off to work now and i don&#39;t have time to find all the links i remember, but if you want something to read about this you could start from the rothschild timeline, <a href="http://www.rense.com/general88/hist.htm">http://www.rense.com/general88/hist.htm</a> ( it&#39;s hosted on many websites ). I didn&#39;t crosscheck all the information admittedly, but you can easily find documentation on many core instances ( to say one, the power grab at waterloo ).

    <div class="md"><p>There is an elite group running things, but the structure of the organization remains unclear.  </p>

<p>For example, many people believe in a Judeo-Masonic configuration, but at the same time, not every Jew and not every Mason is in on it (perhaps the majority of Jews/Masons don&#39;t even believe in the conspiracy)</p>

<p>So what is the actual structure and how is the top of the pyramid configured?  Various ideas are proposed, but it is very speculative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The modern idea of illuminati is absolute rubbish. The illuminati were an upstanding society of philosophers hundreds of years ago. TPTB have taken over their symbolism and spread it everywhere to tarnish the image of the true illuminati.</p>

<p>However many of the illuminati conspiracy&#39;s are oribably quite accurate if you replace illuminati with TPTB. Things like the new world order certainly. The illuminati also wanted a NWO but more as an alternative to the old world order. TPTB just want to gradually push the old world order into public view as the NWO.</p>

<p>If your interested in history of the illuminati then I would reccomend looking into Pythagorean Illuminism. Yes that&#39;s the same Pythagoras as in the Pythagorean theorem. There is also Faust, but he may have been a mason, in not to sure.</p>

<p>Edit: I meant Goethe not faust, faust was a character in one of his stories (good read) and he was a mason not illuminati.</p>

<p>Being away from the limelight has a huge advantage to them, basically it allows them to implement their agenda without being impeded by the public. They just let their puppets deal with the fallout.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Generally speaking Illuminati conspiracies go much further than stating that an overarching group controls world events. In fact such a general statement could be applied to many different conspiracies. </p>

<p>I am more specifically referring to the vein of Illuminati conspiracies that claim Pop Culture is littered with satanic messages and subliminal mental programming. However, I am interested in views on the Illuminati in general even if they differ from that interpretation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a point. But no, I don&#39;t go into such symbolism. People will start using illuminati symbolism just because it is popular, so its hard to say whether the actual illuminati planted these things or its just &quot;art&quot;. This is the curious case of art imitating life or life imitating art. The chicken or egg problem. Anyway, good question, and thanks for being clear and balanced in your question.</p>

<p>PS: The pyramid and eye on the dollar sign however is kind of a hard clue to overlook though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The more you research families like the Rothschild&#39;s the more some type of &quot;Illuminati&quot; seems to become a reality. That being said, I have a hard time signing on to the idea that a group of global elite want nothing more than to oppress the population of the world for the purpose of achieving a global government/society which will then further oppress &quot;the people&quot; (NWO). </p>

<p>I could see their hunger for money and power as being a means to get to the one world government because with so much global opposition to the idea they might see it as their only way to get us there, or the path of least resistance sadly. However, what would the global elite stand to gain by suppressing the people of the world once they have already established the NWO? </p>

<p>Money would, in theory, be of no purpose to them if they already control everything and there will be no more power for them to gain either. So what would they stand to gain by stripping the people of their wealth and power once we reach a NWO or global society? There has to be something I&#39;m not considering maybe?</p>
