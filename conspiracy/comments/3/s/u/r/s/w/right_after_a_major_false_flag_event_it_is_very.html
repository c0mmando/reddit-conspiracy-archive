    <div class="md"><p>Yes, there are a couple of subs that are totally obsessed with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, not because &quot;stupid&quot; stuff is posted here, but because subjects are raised and topics are discussed that <em>some people</em> don&#39;t like being discussed.</p>

<p>Their goal is to make a mockery of this sub, ridiculing the participants so that lurkers will be reticent to participate - lest they also be ridiculed.</p>

<p>Given that motive, their best interests would be served by making shit posts and then brigading them with upvotes. That way the garbage rises to the top, while &quot;taboo&quot; subjects are buried.</p>

<p>This way the prevent &quot;sensitive&quot; material from being seen, and they supply themselves with more material that can be used to mock.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a simple game, and quite effective, sadly.</p>

<p>Here is an archived link with lots of articles making the connection between Isis and CIA.</p>

<p>The thing is you are half right. For years it has been a part of the US&#39; Foreign Policy to arm+train dangerous factions for political purposes. We did it in Afganistan to fight to Soviets, we did it multiple times in South America with the Contras and other death squads to overthrow democratically elected governments. We have been arming and training rebels in Libya, Egypt and Syria for years. The West wants Assad out of power and ISIS very conveniently gave US a reason to go there and take him out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can this be written as anything but support for ISIS forces? Well let me tell you, since you didn&#39;t even bother the read <em>the very article</em> which you linked to me, this goes to show how people like you are telling something and hanging on to it without even critically examining the situation yourself.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s begin.
First of all, were you aware that the Kurdish group called &#39;YPG&#39;, the very ones Turkey is attacking, is essentially tied to the widely recognized terrorist group called PKK? A group of terrorists that have since the 70&#39;s been targetting and killing Turkish civilians? A group that&#39;s massacring entire Turkish villages. And for what? They want to gain independence and form their own nation. That&#39;s why in their mind it is ok to kill off as many Turkish people as possible.
To quote the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Y.P.G. is perhaps America’s most effective ally in Syria against the Islamic State. But American officials, though they will broadly acknowledge that they are working with the Y.P.G., <em>take pains not to detail just how closely the forces are working together, given the group’s ties to the outlawed P.K.K.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Openly admitting that America is working with the same terrorists that murders the Turks.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s continue:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kurdish fighters have been coordinating with the American military since last October. From cloaked rooms in northern Syria, members of the militia known as the Y.P.G. have relayed intelligence and coordinates for potential airstrike targets to an American operations center hundreds of miles away. <strong>The resulting strikes have in turn helped the Kurds seize a broad stretch of territory along the Turkish border from the Islamic State.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you start to see where this is going? The YPG and PKK terrorists don&#39;t care much about ISIS being defeated as much as they are fighting against them for their own gains, which is to gain control of the regions south of the border of Turkey. And by having control over those regions they can further form a threat to Turkey from those locations.</p>

<p>It is no wonder at all why Turkey is attacking the &quot;Kurds&quot; (this is what the media calls them to create the illusion that Turkey is killing random Kurds instead of attacking terrorist Kurds which are alligned to known terrorist groups). These strategic games go deeper than at first glance. Erdogan is not a stupid man, he knows what those YPG Kurds are up to and what their intentions are. He is merely thwarting their plans. Erdogan and Turkey is in <em>no way</em> supporting ISIS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As other people have pointed out in other threads, identification is required in France. Surely that&#39;s a more logical conclusion than false flag? Or maybe, just maybe, the terrorist wanted people to know that he was from Syria, so he brought his passport? How does passport immediately point to &quot;huge fabricated event&quot;? Surely logic tells us that there are much more obvious conclusions that can be drawn before deciding that passport=conspiracy?</p>

<p>I&#39;m merely picking apart your stupid argument that a <em>terrorist</em> would carry around an easily identifiable collection of documents so the whole world would know who he was and where he came from.</p>

<p>If I were involved in something like this, I would carry around false papers all the time to deflect and to send attention in the opposite direction of where it should go.</p>

<ul>
<li>ID is required in France. No ID might mean a trip to the police station.</li>
<li>One of the objectives of point of large-scale attacks like this is for people to know who did it. Especially with suicide attavks. If you want to get away with a crime then of course you wouldn&#39;t carry ID. If you want to commit an orchestrated attack and die in the process you don&#39;t take chances with being stopped by police.</li>
