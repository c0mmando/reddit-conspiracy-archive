       The fact is that Jimmy Savile was a known pedophile for decades.  Everyone within the BBC was aware, it was an "open secret" that he was using his position to fuck children, and yet nothing was ever done about it.  What does this say about the BBC?  What does this say about the people who worked there, knew what he was doing, yet said nothing?  What does it say about the mainstream media or journalism that there weren't calls to boycott BBC over this, or investigate whether others there were involved?

       and what does it say about the enforcement institutions that are there to protect the people from this kind of thing? or the people who knowingly let this kind of thing happen? Are their hands tied by simple self interest in that exposing this would endanger their lives or the lives of their families? Or is it as I fear; that they are prevented from stopping it because the highest echelons of power are corrupted by this very same behavior?

       I think you and I already know exactly what all of these things directly imply if not outright prove.  I mean for fuck's sake, the FBI doesn't even track statistics for missing children.  And we have a spying apparatus that probably has copies of the nudes my ex-girlfriend sent me eight years ago, yet somehow it can't uncover massive pedophile rings involving thousands of people, hundreds of thousands of children, and spanning the entire globe?  The explanations and excuses all fall apart under even the most paper thin scrutiny.  The truth is obvious: there are pedophiles (or those who
       <em>
        use
       </em>
       pedophiles) in positions of incredible power at all levels of society and all over the globe.

       Pretty much all they need to do to actively protect the pedophile rings, the satanic cults, the child trafficking gangs, is to just ignore them completely.  They probably still keep records for blackmail purposes, it would be the smart play, but other than that just bury them in a database somewhere and act like they don't exist.

       Of course sir, I was merely satiating my desire to ask the kinds of questions mainstream media should but doesn't.

      <p>
       Naturally my mind wants to ask "what solutions?" but my cynicism (or perhaps current understanding of society) knows that all such efforts are useless until you can separate Americans from the comfortable little box the State so desperately acts to protect. The sportsball game, on-demand video, the latest video game...

       I think it's inevitable that as your understanding of society improves, your cynicism does as well.  It's like each layer you peel, the stronger the stench from the rotten, maggot-infested core becomes.  We need to stop falling for the propaganda, stop reacting to it.  I think it's that simple.  We care because we're told to care, we watch because we're told to watch.  We need to just stop - let the state fade away into inadequacy and irrelevancy and atrophy as we literally just stop paying attention to it while building lives and communities of our own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Easier said than done though of course, and a change like that won't happen overnight.  I just don't think wasting energy
       <em>
        fighting against
       </em>
       the system is going to do any good.  When we fight against something we legitimize it, we "pick a side", and I think that's what the powerful want.  They want a reaction, an emotional reaction, they want us to pick a side.

       I'm sure you would agree that a 17 year old missing is a lot different from a 6 year old missing, right?  How many of those "under 18" were under 12?  Of course you can't answer that because we aren't given those statistics, like I said.

       Wow, look at the back pedaling! No. You actually said, "The FBI doesn't even track statistics for missing children." They very clearly do. Whether they release a full statistical breakdown of ages for your consumption is a completely different claim.

       You consider a 17 year old a child?  I don't.  There are no statistics tracked for the number of
       <strong>
        children

       missing, children meaning small children - those preyed on by pedophiles.

       Jimmy Saville's victims were aged from 5 to 75. Not just below some entirely arbitrary age chosen by ambiguously_ironic. Sorry, past what age do you think it's okay? 17 is clearly fine. What about 15? 13?
      </p>
      <p>
       And, again, your claim was not that the numbers are not released. It's that they "Don't track" them, insinuating incompetence or, worse, some dark conspiracy. The truth is, I absolutely guarantee you, the FBI
       <strong>
        does
       </strong>
       know the age of every missing child.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, this (Saville) thing is a conspiracy I can absolutely get behind. But seeking to inflate it beyond the actual scope is as bad as those who downplay it.

       If you don't understand what I'm saying or what's being discussed in this thread then I probably can't help you.  I'll try to elaborate one more time though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedophile rings and missing children should theoretically be one of the top priorities for the FBI, right?  So in that light, you would expect a ton of record keeping and data regarding number of kids missing, how old they were, what states and towns they went missing from, what time of day they went missing, which day of the week and month of the year they went missing, anything to find patterns because finding patterns is how you solve crimes and (we assume) the FBI wants to solve crimes, especially when it comes to little kids being kidnapped for nefarious purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet what do we actually get?  Vague data in a few tables for "missing persons under 18".  No detail, no way to differentiate between how many aged 6-7 went missing vs. 9-11 vs. 15-17, no detail about which places in the country experience the most missing children, no detail about which times of year are better and worse than others, etc., etc.  Obviously they have to give
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       data but the point is that they lump them all under the same "under 18" umbrella.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The truth is, I absolutely guarantee you, the FBI does know the age of every missing child.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Of course they do.  That is in fact the point I'm making so thank you for making it for me.  They just don't release any of this information to the public, instead choosing to use vague tables like the ones you linked to which tell almost nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a recent example, did you know the FBI was aware that Jared Fogle was a disgusting pedophile for over 4 years before taking any action at all?  How many children did he rape and defile in that time while they sat there and did nothing?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you still don't see what I'm getting at, then we'll just have to agree to disagree and go our separate ways.

       But I'm still waiting to hear at what age you think pedophilia "doesn't count". We've already established 17-year-olds are, apparently, fair game, going by your quote:

        You consider a 17 year old a child? I don't.

      <p>
       Even though one of the victims of the man you called a "disgusting pedophile" was 17?
      </p>
      <p>
       Man, now I'm REALLY curious to hear how low you set the bar to be considered a child.

        The fact is that Jimmy Savile was a known pedophile for decades.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Indeed.  Rumours over his "proclivities" ended his wrestling career before he even became famous, while there are records of a police investigation into his conduct as far back as the early 1970s.  It was
       <strong>
        always
       </strong>
       known.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for how Savile became that way in the first place?  How did he become so warped and depraved to begin with?  I genuinely believe that there was serious sexual abuse within his family during his formative years, and probably incest.  His attitude towards his mother was frankly very suspicious and creepy, while one of his brothers was also a sex offender (albeit not so serious).  You do have to ask what on earth happened in that household for
       <em>
        two
       </em>
       children to end up that way.

       Yep that seems to be the common denominator for the overwhelming majority of pedophiles, and even a huge number of violent criminals: they were abused in their childhood.  It doesn't excuse it but it may help explain it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you start digging deeply into MK-Ultra/Monarch programming, you start to hear suggestions that programmers have the best success with very young children and that intense physical and psychological trauma is necessary to create the initial mental fractures.  Ritual abuse would, presumably, be a very good way to invoke trauma in a small child if you were trying to do something like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it isn't like there's no basis for any of this in the case of Jimmy, there is evidence that he was a

       Yep.  This realization years ago was for me the main catalyst to entering "the rabbit hole" or whatever metaphor you want to use.  Once I realized that the most powerful people in the world were either protecting pedophiles or were pedophiles themselves, that thousands of children per year were being kidnapped and tortured and killed and sold, I knew the world wasn't what I had thought it was - or been told it was - growing up.

       Although the mainstream media didn’t recognize the crimes committed by Jimmy Savile until after his death, there were many instances throughout his career where he was accused or implicated in child abuse cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       In most cases, he was able to avoid a whole lot of legal trouble and public scrutiny due to his media celebrity and his close ties to the power of the royal family.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fallout from the Jimmy Savile case has probably just begun, but the backlash has already been considerable for anyone who has dared to speak out on the issue, with some people at the BBC even losing their jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the midst of these revelations, there has been an increased attention on pedophilia in the entertainment industry and in state institutions like charities and children’s homes. There has also been an increased attention on old cases that Savile may have escaped from during his career.
      </p>
      <p>
       One case, for example, involves a pedophile ring that was being run through multiple North Wales children’s homes in the mid-1980’s. This ring was exposed when Labour councillor Malcolm King blew the whistle after learning of the child abuse through working so closely with the schools.
      </p>
      <p>
       In one interview, punk rock legend Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols revealed that he was banned from BBC in the late 1970’s for speaking out about what the famous broadcaster did to children.
      </p>

       I work with a woman who volunteered to help for the great north run years ago. Jimmy made an appearance at the event, his aides told her to "Keep him away from the kids". She didn't fully understand why until it brought to light after he had died. They'd known about it for years. My only question is, why cover it up? Surely other people could have done what he did?

       You answered your own question.  Because covering it up meant that no one else at the BBC was investigated and that none of Jimmy Savile's rich and powerful friends in the corporate world/government/aristocracy were investigated.  I mean, he was a "procurer" after all, where were they gonna get a fresh supply of kids from without a monster like him having so much access to children?

       I think it's inevitable that as your understanding of society improves, your cynicism does as well.  It's like each layer you peel, the stronger the stench from the rotten, maggot-infested core becomes.  We need to stop falling for the propaganda, stop reacting to it.  I think it's that simple.  We care because we're told to care, we watch because we're told to watch.  We need to just stop - let the state fade away into inadequacy and irrelevancy and atrophy as we literally just stop paying attention to it while building lives and communities of our own.

       Easier said than done though of course, and a change like that won't happen overnight.  I just don't think wasting energy
       <em>
        fighting against
       </em>
       the system is going to do any good.  When we fight against something we legitimize it, we "pick a side", and I think that's what the powerful want.  They want a reaction, an emotional reaction, they want us to pick a side.

       I'm sure you would agree that a 17 year old missing is a lot different from a 6 year old missing, right?  How many of those "under 18" were under 12?  Of course you can't answer that because we aren't given those statistics, like I said.
