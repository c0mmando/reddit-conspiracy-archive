<p>Ontop of that it keeps like minded individuals in one place and doesnt spead opionons against the narrative into other places. Coupled with the fact that a smear campaign against the anti-narrative is easily spread when there is a handful of isolated targets.

<p>I wonder if this post will also get deleted like the #1 post on r/worldnews, that got deleted 1 hour ago, because it was about the UK. </p>

<p>This is an article about Sweden, so should it be posted in r/sweden?  </p>

<p>If they want to silence dissent by silencing certain opinions, they&#39;re going to find we&#39;re more than capable of playing their game of jumping through all the hoops of political correctness and <em>implying</em> much without outright saying it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Though they probably can ban you randomly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly, they will. Dissent must be silenced. Most boards don&#39;t want a legitimate argument, because <em>argument</em> is a violent word. They don&#39;t even want a <em>discussion,</em> because those imply there are other viewpoints aside from their own that may be correct or more valid than theirs. No, they want <em>safe spaces,</em> echo chambers, for their voices to be heard and none other.</p>

<p>Anything that goes against the narrative is obviously in the wrong subreddit.</p>

<p>I accused <a href="/u/KVillage1">/u/KVillage1</a>, arguably the most well known pro-Israel user on <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, of being a shill. </p>

<p>I provided a slew of links about Israel&#39;s hasbara program as evidence and that was somehow used against me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, they can&#39;t have any attention drawn to what they&#39;re doing. If you want to manipulate the opinions of a group of people, it&#39;s critical that they don&#39;t realize what you&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>In fact, any awareness of manipulation tends to produce the opposite effect. The people running these shill teams know this and no doubt how bad things could backfire if more people started catching on.</p>

<p>Ps. That&#39;s my issue with the shill thing anyways. I think it&#39;s wrong that someone is running a program to systematically manipulate the content and comments of a subreddit with over 9 million subscribers.</p>

<p>Where someone is getting their opinion from has nothing to do with the quality of their arguments and shouldn&#39;t influence counter-argument or rebuttal.

<p>Meh. That&#39;s already happening. Adverts and mass media is all about persuasion, sometimes to tell a story and sometimes to sell a story. It can be obvious or subtle.</p>

<p>If I found out that default subs were infested with paid proponents of certain theories - I&#39;d be amazed that it was either kept quiet, or happened at all - given the colossal waste of money I think it would be. I mean, come on, <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> ? It&#39;s not worth spare change.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about persuasion, it&#39;s about encountering others who believe a certain thing - you&#39;re more likely to consider an idea the more you see others adopting it. It&#39;s bottom-up rather than top-down.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how I see the theory of how it would work here, I guess. But again, proof, evidence etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, not one word about the page with the search results basically proving that shilling goes on in a systematic, large-scale way. So either you ignored it, or you are avoiding any mention of it. Instead you&#39;ve jumped on the one thing I said that was meant to show you that I can admit the possibility of being wrong about something. I wasn&#39;t saying &quot;Oh ok, you&#39;re right&quot; But admitting that it&#39;s my opinion... which may or may not be correct. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m asking for you to listen one last thing. It&#39;s important because this explains how shilling works and why someone would bother paying for it.</p>

<p>Ok, there&#39;s a well known tendency for people&#39;s opinions to change if it means going along with the majority. You sound like a well educated person, so I&#39;ll assume that you know about this experiment. They take a group of people and show them a picture that has some curved lines. Line 3 is obviously the most curved. But in the experiment, everyone else says line two.</p>

<p>An amazingly high percentage of people will also say line two even when they knew it was line three. This is the power of group influence.</p>

<p>Now take this concept and apply it to the internet. Do you see where this is leading? Let&#39;s say you read a story and think someone is doing something wrong. But then, in the comments section, you see a bunch of comments all saying &quot;wow, those guys are heroes&quot; or something like that. A lot of people&#39;s opinions will be influenced according to the same principle that was proven in the experiment.</p>

<p>Why bother doing this? As you asked earlier, what&#39;s the point of spending money?</p>

<p>Well, a lot of people read stuff online. If they all started getting pissed off about something that someone was doing, political (or diplomatic) pressure might be brought to bear on the wrongdoers. This is where paid shills come into play.</p>

<p>Head off negative perceptions or opinions as (or even before) they are formed. Very efficient and relatively low cost way of managing public opinion. Like the old saying goes &quot;An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.&quot;</p>

<p>So tldr; a little nudge on the lead animals can steer the rest of the herd quite effectively.</p>

<p>Of course, that&#39;s just my opinion too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can confirm...a few months ago I was banned from <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> without a warning for a minor insult (&quot;idiot&quot; / &quot;shill&quot;). I supplied the insult after a user (Sleekery&#39;s sock puppet dtiftw) made a character defamation attack on someone else who wasn&#39;t there to defend himself, from a link I purposely planted to see if he would do it. He did it, so I called him an idiot. Not moments later, Sleekery shows up to complain about my comment and defend his sock puppet, so I call him a shill. Got banned for it. When I tried to appeal nicely with a mod, he basically said fuck off here&#39;s your permaban. Awesome sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny how the truth can piss people off sometimes. Yeah, worldnews is setting a pretty low standard. It&#39;s all about conforming to the hive mind and anyone who tries to offer a dissenting opinion gets a hostile reception.</p>

<p>I almost got banned too. Same thing. There was/is some pretty obvious jidf/Hasbara shilling going on and I was razzing them about it. </p>

<p>What happened? They kept on arguing a point. I knew I was dealing with some shills because who else keeps a thread going back and forth over 10 times over some article about Palestine?</p>

<p>Anyways, they kept on at it until I told the guy &quot;You&#39;re not an idiot, but you&#39;re a long way from being a genius.&quot; Apparently that was close enough to being considered a personal attack that I got a warning.</p>

<p>So I didn&#39;t get banned. But I noticed that there were a whole bunch of replies to any of my comments over the next 2 weeks. They were all new usernames I&#39;d never seen before and a couple of them were &quot;jedi-type&quot; usernames like mine is. I actually got the feeling they were hoping to draw me out into another argument (and say the wrong thing) so they could get me banned from the sub.</p>

<p>Instead, I just decided to lay low for a few weeks and I&#39;m still there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you&#39;re right. On the other hand, there are a few sure signs that indicate (but don&#39;t necessarily prove) you&#39;re dealing with a shill.</p>

<p>One, they&#39;ve got a post history that&#39;s over 95% Palestine/Israel</p>

<p>Two, they&#39;re 100% uncompromisingly pro-Israel</p>

<p>Three, they really like to argue and just love having the last word.</p>

<p>Four, they like to use complex rationalizations to support their position. </p>

<p>Five, they have a list of talking points that they commonly use. I&#39;m not going to bother listing a bunch off the top of my head but one example:</p>

<p>Occupied territory should legitimately belong to them if they gained it during a war. &quot;They attacked us and lost, so we should own it now&quot;.</p>

<p>Six, they&#39;re always right and everyone else is always wrong. Being right justifies practically any action. It&#39;s an absolutist mindset and it&#39;s common in shill comments.</p>

<p>So these are 6 things you can look for. Any one by itself isn&#39;t proof. Think of this like you were a physician making a diagnosis. You see a bunch of signs or symptoms in the same patient and the presence of these is what leads to the diagnosis.</p>

<p>Not every diagnosis is correct. But someone who has a lot of experience and education tends to make the best ones. </p>

<p>But hey, feel free to disagree my young friend. Or read what I just wrote, then go over to worldnews and see if you don&#39;t start noticing the same things.</p>
