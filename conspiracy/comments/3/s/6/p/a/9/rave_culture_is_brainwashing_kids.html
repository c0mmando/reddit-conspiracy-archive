        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Recent spike in popularity with raving and drug culture is getting out of hand. I went to Ezoo Ny and i realized that there is a large percentage of the crowd are on heavy drugs like molly, shrooms and acid. And all these people are looking up at the DJ like he is some kind of god, and when the weird voice that talks before each DJ speaks people seem to listen to the bullshit spewing out of this weird robotic lady voice. She claims that this place is &quot;love&quot; it is forcing this false sense of community and false love.</p>

<p>Music without drugs puts people in a very slight trance, now imagine crazy high pitched music with a combination of drugs, Lightshows, and weird imagery that is being played behind the DJ. Tomorrowland is the biggest rave that happens every year in Belgium, over 200,000 people go to experience Tomorrowland. Doesn&#39;t this seem like a great opportunity to brainwash a bunch of drugged out people? There is something fishy about rave culture, its seems too good to be true. 
I want to know what you guys think about this, sorry about if this post was everywhere I wrote this in class when i was bored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree with both of these comments. I was a raver back in the day and enjoyed a fair amount of pills while dancing my socks of. The thing is the majority of people are there for the same reason, to dance and to share something in common, music connects us all in one way or another. The added benefit of ecstacy that makes you feel euphoric and empathetic towards other people, especially added with dance music is nearly a spiritual experience. </p>

<p>Just my opinion on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Music festivals are a place where like minded individuals go to not be scrutinised for their counter culture ideas. Most promoters of music festivals hire acts that draw crowds. So if someone like pretty lights can bring in 20 thousand people, the promoter can charge 200 dollars a head, and with the money from ticket sales hire on other acts to fill time spots, and give local musicians more exposure. </p>

<p>Electronic music has for the most part stayed very much underground when it started popping up in places like Detroit, Germany, NYC, Goa, in the mid 80&#39;s and spread like wildfire. It is dance music, thats all. There is nothing sinister embedded in the beats. Some of it is designed to sound &#39;creepy&#39; or &#39;dark&#39;. But like any music it is listened to by people who can relate, or feel the music for what it is.</p>

<p>Lastly I&#39;ve personally worked many gfestivals as a paid stage hand with stage/lighting/sound production. We have never worked with any band that attempted to brainwash their audience. Everyone (with the exception of a few people) were grateful and respectful. Because stagehand work is long, dangerous, and with limited pay. You do it because you love it, not because you have some sinister means to control people.</p>

Raves have been around for a long time. Some have been infiltrated and some not. And my initial reaction to hearing what mdma is now called was pretty funny... Molly... makes me laugh. It wasn&#39;t always called that, right? At least not where wadis be...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I understand it (raving days are <em>long</em> behind me) molly is &#39;pure&#39; MDMA crystals, I tried some a while back and it didn&#39;t seem nearly as effective as the pills back at the birth of rave though and I did enough of it for a good dose, apparently.

<p>Raves and such music events have always been &#39;popular&#39;, and there are theories about governmental agencies seeding drugs and testing new substances on those attending.
