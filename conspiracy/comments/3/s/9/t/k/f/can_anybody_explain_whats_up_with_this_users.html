       Hey :)
      </p>
      <p>
       There aren't any backroom deals between reddit and me or else I'd get myself unbanned from certain subreddits ;p
      </p>
      <p>
       The question of am I getting paid is a tricky one. Let's say,
       <em>
        hypothetically
       </em>
       , that I was getting paid to post on reddit. First of all, I don't even know if that's allowed, so admitting to it could potentially get me banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, let's say,
       <em>
        hypothetically
       </em>
       I was getting paid by a certain donor base. I'm not sure how happy a group of people like that would be about getting outed as financing these types of campaigns.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can tell you this for sure though. There do exist groups that pay people to post on social media, and run various campaigns. Sometimes it's as simple as a company like Coke going to one of these 'Social Media Advertising Campaign' companies and asking for help getting more pageviews on a certain website.  That Social Media company will recruit a group of people to post links on various platforms and encourage others to visit the site. Coke will pay the Social Media company a certain about based off a percentage increase in pageviews. The Social Media company rewards the people posting links with giftcards usually. The more people click on your link (which has an identifier to make it unique) to the website, the bigger the giftcard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Campaigns can get much larger than that as well. I got a free XPS laptop from Dell for working for them in college. All I had to do was man a desk in the Student Union for a few hours during student orientation. I also had to promise to bring and use it prominently in class (which I did, but they also never checked)

       I used to love Louis CK until I heard these accusations that he basically molests up-and-coming female comics. Don't know if it's true but I really hope not. Still makes me stop thinking he's so funny.

       And he even has the story wrong.  The accusations are that he would pull his dick out in front of female comics and jerk off in front of them.  He isn't being accused of physically molesting anybody.. just being a giant creep.  And, again, there is 0 evidence of it anyways.

       That is some very light hearted language to use... CK may or may not do weird shit but that has absolutely nothing to do with his comedy. Seriously, how does his comedy change based on vague and undocumented allegations of 'basically molesting' people? SMH

       Agreed, what I would like to see is an Admin's response to this thread. Here we have all the proof we need that people are gaming Reddit, along with an admission that some user's post are subjected to a different upvote algorithm based on submissions, creating the Power Users that killed Digg.

       It's not sitewide, it's based on subreddit.  Basically to prevent you from building up a bunch of karma in your own personal subreddit, and then using that to spam the hell out of the rest of the site.

       I'm sure you're a nice guy so forgive me if I say anything that you find offensive, but I'll try not to.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are doing is essentially whoring yourself out to corporate America or maybe a political group, going off of your name. Which I happen to like fwiw. The internet is a special place where there is a bit of an equal playing field for most. However, when people start corrupting social media with what is essentially subliminal advertising, it kinda ruins it. Part of me does appreciate the clever new take on advertising. But it makes it tough to trust things when corporations are getting their mitts into everything everywhere. Im very anti advertisement and prefer small local business to big corporations, so maybe im the odd man out.

       You answered this question when you didnt have to though, so I thought I'd speak my mind as you seem like a friendly and reasonable person. I'm not telling you to do anything. I just want you to understand what exactly you are doing for a living and maybe, just maybe, you might rethink it. Its up to you, but think about whether you are happy with what you are doing. Have a nice day if youve made it this far. :)

       Thanks for the reasonable response despite your disagreements :)
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand how you feel about the pervasiveness of corporate and special interest groups wielding influence online (and elsewhere). Companies are always looking at new and more effective/efficient ways to advertise.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've turned down campaigns before. Shortly after working with Dell, there was an opportunity to make some easy money from a certain Pornographic Magazine. They wanted people to slide CD's full of pornographic promotional material under students' dormroom doors. The next week I found one on the floor in front of my door. They just had someone else do it, and I missed out on $200.
      </p>

       I, myself, and the smallest business you can be, an individual. So I do sometimes take advantage of situations to benefit myself, but I try to make sure they don't disadvantage anyone else.

       So you hypothetically admit you get paid by some entity to post on Reddit/social media, and you have an all uppercase name such as
       <a href="/u/CANT_TRUST_HILLARY">
        /u/CANT_TRUST_HILLARY
       </a>
       .
I would have to say that with the amount of views you receive, irregardless of the content, that you would be actively working toward giving Hillary a social media disadvantage?
By posting with that user name, you are -hypothetically- being paid to be an asshole. Enjoy your shekels.

       Well I think what happened is he/she didn't want to be caught at the college handing out porn. It's a little weird to be that guy. So it's anonymous, but they could still be caught.

       You say you are a business of one, just yourself, so you don't work for an ad agency. I guess ad agencies get ahold of you then.

       So given this hypothetical context would you know which interest is behind the hypothetical paycheck or would you have to guess?

       If we were to pretend for a second that your username is part of the campaign as well as your political posts I'd imagine there would be people on both sides of the political divide who would be interested in Hillary failing. Her democratic opponents and the opposition wanting the most outlandish candidate possible to win to make their own crazed candidate look sane.

       I doubt anyone was paying him initially (like a campaign). He probably just had a "clever" idea with his username and hates Clinton. Seeing how easy it is to get karma, now he is probably trying to create a market for his account by pretending that people actually did pay him.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was approached prior to the creation of his account to be paid for his work, his behavior makes no sense. He acknowledges that admitting it could possibly get him banned, and even acts "relieved" when you state he doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, if you look through his history, every single time he gets username mentioned he hints that he's paid.
      </p>
      <p>
       So he's either the dumbest paid redditor on Earth or full of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's just trying to create an illusion that he been paid to post so much on Reddit (masking his no life status) and hoping that he can probably approach or negotiate with some businesses in the future in hopes of getting paid work.

       So you're overworked and underpaid like the rest of us. You think that your work for social order is invaluable, but you actually know just how replaceable you are. You could have gone big time, but sold it all away for that sweet immediate corporate check because, let's face it, you've lost complete hope for humanity. And no one can blame you but yourself.

       If I had to throw an answer out there, I'd guess it was more than one person using the same account. Either that or it's someone who's been given links to post and these links are "assigned karma" instead of being upvoted.

       Thanks for reminding me. I just plugged the username into Snoopsnoo.

      <p>
       Snoo just going round and round. No results. I've used it before and it has worked perfectly. Not this time.

       28 minutes later, Snoopsnoo has still returned zero result for u/CANT_TRUST_HILLARY . I've never had this happen before.

       And this thread is starting to get hard hit with downvotes. Doesn't seem the kind of topic that would be heavily downvoted by r/conspirators?

       I really wish reddit would just be more honest about their scoring, various censorship techniques, advertising policies, and all the other shenanigans that go on around here.

       FTR, I came across this post (hadn't heard of snoopsnoo before) and started playing with it. CANT_TRUST_HILLARY is now on it. It probably just took a while to analyze everything because they post so god-damn much.

       When I went (which was ~47 minutes ago), it said "refreshed 12 minutes ago" now it says "19 minutes ago." So it appears to be decently frequently. If I had had to guess, I would have said a day, but it appears that is way over the actual amount.

       Last time I used it on myself, it hadn't updated for over a month. I'd guess it doesn't update until someone asks it to. That's how I'd do it if I were the programmer, personally.

       Yeah, but my guess is that it doesn't update
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       time someone asks, but "caches" and reports that, in case there are a bunch of people who all request the same data around the same time. How long between updates, I can't say what the algorithm is. It could be strictly time based, it could be based on time and request amount, it could be based on the user's stats. . .who knows? Well, I assume the author does.

       The honest problem with reddit being open about vote counting is that it would make it even easier to figure out how to rig.
      </p>
      <p>
       Openness and transparency is not the easy solution one would like it to be when the internet is overrun with marketers, propagandists, and provacateurs from every direction, all of them working to influence people's opinions and behaviors.

       It just gets the last 1000 comments/submissions using the public reddit api and parses them for various things like - place names, frequency of certain words used etc. There are several sites like this -
       <a href="http://www.redditinvestigator.com">
        www.redditinvestigator.com
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="http://www.redective.com">
        www.redective.com
       </a>
       etc. You can make one easily if you know some coding.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you're using these with accounts with lots of karma, it wont work properly because of the limit of data allowed to be pulled by the reddit api.

       One of the big tactics these karma whores use is to constantly delete and resubmit post until it takes off. You still keep all the karma from those deleted post though so that's probably where the extra karma is coming from.

       Are you masterfully deducing that from my 93 link karma?  Even if he had that's gonna average max 4000 per which, if that were even half the karma would mean 115 front page posts in 90-120 days, so probably a little more than once/day.  Does that seem likely to you?  In the week I looked at I didn't see any significant post scores.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Looked long term.  Apparently he has a ton of 5k+ posts to non-default subs like /interestingasfuck and /gaming.

       well, i know people who routinely get 10-20k in karma over a two day period, i've done it several times myself. Somebody just the other day got 100k in a week.

       And I'm not aware of reddit being able to 'assign karma' to a post, however they can assign a post a different algorithm than others. They mainly do it to test out new ones before implementing them site-wide.

       GallowBoob did it.   Plenty of people can lob multiple links at Reddit and get a tremendous score.  There are plenty of subreddits where the topics overlap to such a degree that you can get to the Front Page with the same link from two different subreddits in the same day.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not really all that difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you checked out karmalb.com?  There are plenty of accounts with a huge amount of link karma just tossing up submissions like skeeballs.

       This isn't even the biggest deal either. There's a user called gallowboob or something like that. He made it past 6 million karma in about 6 months.

       100k never really was that much of a big deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, people overrate just exactly how hard it is to get karma. Linking is easy enough-- you just need to know what reddit will like and figure out an adequate title as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, this also means it's practically impossible to shill, even from such accounts. It's not like they're celebrities, people don't usually care about who's posting, just about what's being posted. Unless it's someone really high profile, like gallowboob. But then the response tends to be more hateful than anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's probably shilling going on yes, but not from the really high profile accounts. They're just too out in the open, being watched too closely.

       They can change vote weight for each user (For example, shadowbanned users have a big hit to their vote weight. When they downvote a new post, it goes to 99% upvoted instead of 50%)

       There are a few accounts like this that frequent the front page. High submission count, high karma, less than a year old. They seemingly "batch-submit" content skimmed from old submissions, usually using identical titles. I caught one posting the top rated comments from the original and another that was responding to
       <a href="/r/AskReddit">
        /r/AskReddit
       </a>
       threads with copy/pasted yahoo answers for comment karma (seemingly to "balance" their post history). It's just your average farming efforts. For what end result? We're still trying to determine that over at

       I think the end result is to later post "viral" things that promote brands or companies or whatever.

       Also if you have a bunch of these high karma accounts, you can have an army to upvote other accounts and not get caught or shadow banned as quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say you have a few hundred high karma accs, can then upvote newer accounts you just created to the front page to raise their karma, thereby creating more high karma accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that you can lend your services to corporations to downvote or upvote brand/corporation friendly or unfriendly posts.

       I'm not sure why some people have trouble admitting that paid-for content is everywhere. Native advertising is a thing. This is just native advertising 2.0. And there is so much publicly available information on shills. See

       So do you mean that users actually go to someone's profile, check their karma score, then upvote based on that? Sorry I'm ignorant on this stuff, I just post what's on my mind, rather than contemplate whether people will upvote me or not.

       I'd say someone bought a program that would submit frequently and is just running it.

       I'd guess no one is just watching it, but maybe checks it daily to make sure it's still running. Maybe add a "sincere" post or response.

       The guy who introduced me to Reddit back in the day said he's been gaming Reddit for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       He said in the early days he had a spreadsheet with thousands of accounts with notes on each users profile. This is what he did to make money off this little scheme:
      </p>
      <p>
       1 - create random accounts. Maybe some had distinct tastes for specific subreddits, others would post in 20 different subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 - gradually grow karma so as not to get on Reddits bot radar and get banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       3 - use accounts to upvote other low karma accounts, but in a very random manner so as not to make it obvious they were gaming the system
      </p>
      <p>
       4 - sell said accounts (usually in bunches of 1,00 or more) to marketing companies who then post favorable articles about their own companies via the accounts to generate buzz about their products which will seem more "organic" and more subtle. This allows them to upvote, promote and make it seem like their articles are gaining traction organically and can subvert the Reddit bot cops.
      </p>
      <p>
       5 - repeat as necessary
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure he's still doing it. Last time I spoke with him (about 2013 or so), he said most of this was pretty automated now with JS and he was still doing a lot of business (a few grand a month) to various marketing companies. He said as long as you had some serious randomness, it was easy to avoid detection and keep it going.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a bad gig if you can get it.

       Addiction is a type of illness and they may be addicted to the karma. Karma seems to loosely translate to peer approval, which is a powerful motivator, example: high school.

       I think it's an agency or hybrid bot or something. No normal person would be able to find and post so many submissions alone all day.

       This way once they start posting viral shit for brands, it's harder to spot him or call him out on it since "he just posts so much stuff".

       5 year old account. Just started talking about vaccines pretty much  every single day about 45 days ago.

      <p>
       Probably bought the account from some dude for 50 bucks.

       Makes sense too. If I was a NGO or something that pushed vaccines, I'd probably hire a few guys to use Reddit. It's such a great tool to spread info.

       50 bucks? If I were going to sell this account to some vast conspiracy to spread misinformation about vaccines, I would demand a lot more than that. The accusation that I would sell out so cheaply is the most offensive thing you've accused me of yet!

       Trollabot's trust score is questionable. Nobody knows how it works.

       Myself, I rank at over 100%, so I'd take that as an indication that

       is broken.

       Too smart, it's the marketing companies that are selling upvotes. Maybe they're giving a kickback to Reddit to allow it though. This thread seems to confirm that Reddit at least knows about it.

       <a href="/r/WorldNews">

       ?  So you don't have the courage to reply to my previous replies, but you just have to say "lol" in this new thread topic? Hmm... figures. Whatever, there's always
       <em>
        "one"
       </em>
       who's the trouble-maker/bad-apple in the bunch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, if you read the post by the person that the OP is outing, s/he is more or less saying that there's a group of them paid to post stuff online. Get with the program, or get out. Your "lol" is useless.

       No, you just steal content from elsewhere, post on imgur, and not credit any original artists or websites. Also known as Freebooting. So thank you for punishing those who create content by not even attempting to credit them.

       Fair enough, I did say try ;p
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainly what I meant is that I won't take a top post from
       <a href="/r/aww">
        /r/aww
       </a>
       and post it to
       <a href="/r/pics">
        /r/pics
       </a>
       . I'll sometimes post to multiple subreddits at one time though (like if it's a post about Fallout,
       <a href="/r/fallout">
        /r/fallout
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/gaming">
        /r/gaming
       </a>
       might like it, and not all users overlap both subreddits).
      </p>
      <p>
       I figure the upvote/downvote system will sort them appropriately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now in this case,
       <a href="/u/slapshotten11">
        /u/slapshotten11
       </a>
       has pointed out that this gif was already posted to
       <a href="/r/wtf">
        /r/wtf
       </a>
       . I did not know that bc I don't visit that sub, and karmadecay didn't say anything when I ran it through there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those posts don't look like they're going anywhere anyway. I guess I could delete them and maybe save reddit some space on their servers, haha. But they'll just fade into oblivion with no harm done.

       My assumption is that its simply people with no life. CANT_TRUST_HILLARY might just be a rabid Bernie fan who decided on that name. I tried an experiment where I completely followed CANT_TRUST_HILLARY's formula and reposted shit to numerous subreddits all day and I had over 10k in 3 days. Its like feeding a goldfish

       I think these accounts are always odd that have a ton of karma in a short amount of time. However, in this case, their best karma gains come from a Green Bay Packers subreddit and
       <a href="/r/gaming">
        /r/gaming
       </a>
       . They do the worst in
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       . They certainly could be trying to build legitimacy for posting in the future or selling the account but, as it stands, they don't really do anything.

       When the shill accounts first started showing up on reddit in numbers, they would have an innocuous history, lot of gaming and sports. Then suddenly, when they were sold, they would start posting to politics or conspiracy.

Simply by varying the format of the username just about anyone could fabricate a unique name of their desired subliminal message, and just repost the most popular links as fast as possible all day long.

       Are you masterfully deducing that from my 93 link karma?  Even if he had that's gonna average max 4000 per which, if that were even half the karma would mean 115 front page posts in 90-120 days, so probably a little more than once/day.  Does that seem likely to you?  In the week I looked at I didn't see any significant post scores.

       Yeah, that is a possibility, I agree. It's just not happening with this account as of yet, at least not effectively.

       And he even has the story wrong.  The accusations are that he would pull his dick out in front of female comics and jerk off in front of them.  He isn't being accused of physically molesting anybody.. just being a giant creep.  And, again, there is 0 evidence of it anyways.
