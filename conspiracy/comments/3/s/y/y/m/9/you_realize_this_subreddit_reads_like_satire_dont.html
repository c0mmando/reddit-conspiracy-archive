       The TSA serves the purpose its supposed to serve, they harass the populace as they are trained to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you don't understand what social engineering is and take what you are told at face value, doesn't make you right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your entire thought process has been co-opted. Government says TSA is to keep you safe,, so you believe that. Government simultaneously wants you to blame any failure on incompetence rather than malice, and you believe that too.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then you turn around and expect others to believe what you have been lead to believe and get angry when they don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you get angry because you fear that you may be wrong.

       I don't think the majority of the people are "okay" with their harassment...if they were "okay" with it, it wouldn't be considered "harassment".
      </p>
      <p>
       I think many people understand the government bullshitted them into giving up their rights, but individually are too afraid to say shit. I think some others gave up their rights for the belief they were being kept safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether you or anyone "appoints" us; i.e. grants us leave, to use our brains and ask reasonable questions isn't the issue. We are free to do so. If you have decided to forego the hardship of using your ability at critical thinking because you are afraid where it may lead, that's your lose.

       To paraphrase Tupac, who paraphrased Shakespeare, a coward dies a thousand deaths. In the long run, you just get used to not questioning anything, but it doesn't mean you are removed from the consequences.

       It's not about finding explosives or ammunition on civilians, hence why they're incompetent at it.

       It's about creating a culture of fear, which they achieved.

       Also even with access to nearly all communications the combined intelligence teams in the world cannot stop a team of all-powerful mercenaries who live in the desert, operate 1980's Radio Shack equipment, drive Toyota trucks and on a consistent basis one-up the multi-Trillion dollar funded military of a coalition of countries.

       The number of different interests, state
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       corporate, that engage in this tactic is kind of mind-blowing. Sometimes you'll see the same "agents" engage in it for different interests. It's really interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess they all do it because it's historically been so effective--instead of rendering a single journalist or source as unreliable, you render anyone who questions any piece of the narrative as a nutcase. Sandy Hook was the first time I noticed it, but if you dig back, it's been used forever...

       IMHO, "lizard people" relates to psychopathy and the "reptile" part of your brain which only works towards self-interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       The story of St. George and the Dragon is supposed to be about a spiritual warrior slaying the animal within himself (the dragon or the snake) and attaining self-mastery. Instead, for a thousand years the Catholic Church told us it was about a dude killing a big lizard with a sword. Similar..

       I would suggest that you look at the answers in your thread - as a few of us are saying, your basic premise is flawed. Outlandish conspiracy theories are floated exactly to dispel attention from the more mundane and commonplace conspiracies that happen on a daily.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there were multiple conspiracies surrounding 9/11 - just dig into it a little and use a little critical thinking (don't pay attention to the disinfo, again) - who flew out of the country immediately and who allowed it?
      </p>
      <p>
       To close your eyes to the the fact that people conspire together to meet an end goal (typically money/power) is to walk around in denial, never bothering to watch the news, work at a company, hang out with friends or family. To be angry about others recognizing these events for what they are and/or attempting to "connect the dots" isn't healthy.

       I would hope so. It's interesting that whenever an event happens, the usual suspects come on here and in other forums, throwing around crazy suppositions about crisis actors and disingenuously conflating the terms "false flag" and "hoax." And like clockwork, mainstream media will pick up the stories and go "Har, har, look at the crazies! Nothing to see here, folks!"
      </p>
      <p>
       But here's why this happens - the "stupid" conspiracy theories very quickly tar
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       who wants to investigate what really happened as batshit crazy--which keeps regular people from deeper investigation, from trying to find out what the
       <em>
        real conspiracies
       </em>
       are and, of course, anyone from taking their totally legit accusations and discoveries seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's remarkably effective. My spouse, not a conspiracy theorist, has figured it out, when any event happens and you see this massive rush of so-called "conspiracy theorists" claiming it was a "hoax" with "crisis actors,"
       <em>
        there's a real fucking conspiracy behind it.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The stupid conspiracies are manufactured to muddy the waters. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if the large number of users yelling "false flag hoax!" are actually a very small number of plants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another tell-tale sign of this use of black propaganda - anyone who says anything against it quickly gets attacked and downvoted - again giving the impression that everyone here believes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't fall for it and learn to see it as the smoke that leads to fire. :)
