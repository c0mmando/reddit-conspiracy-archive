Though there are deadly poisons they are probably harder and riskier to come by then guns, having to set up a cart, pass whatever regulations and get licenses you need to vend food, and even then what if you don&#39;t eat it?

    <div class="md"><p>There is a psychological difference between killing someone with poison and killing someone with guns and explosives. Poison is by nature subtle. It slips in secretly it does not make a loud crash and bang. Np matter how many people you poison, it will not make a huge bang on TV. Walking into a cafe and seeing body parts strewn, lakes of blood, and people In shock and agony will <em>never</em> happen with poison. The point is to induce fear, it is half a show, half actual threat and violence. They could have coordinated all 8 attackers together instead of multiple smaller separate attacks, but the point is to cause  CHAOS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had an extremely similar thought just after I&#39;d heard. Obviously I was appalled by the violence, but I also thought, &quot;what dunces.&quot;</p>

<p>Europe is being invaded and conquered by &quot;refugees&quot; without a single shot being fired. If the goal of ISIS really is to restore and expand the caliphate, then if you ask me, continued patience is the logical path to achievement. In another five years, their numbers, coupled with Europe&#39;s demographic implosion, well, they could just ELECT to adopt sharia. An attack like this seems sloppy and boneheaded. Everyone knows what the only outcome could be: the West would unleash hell in response. When the sleeping bear you awaken is <em>France</em> (pardon me, but the country with more white flags than any other), it proves the point. Even the blind can see the paradox in strategy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Strange, I agree.  However, I&#39;ll play devil&#39;s advocate just to try to eliminate other possibilities.  </p>

<p>Perhaps it&#39;s because of the lack of challenge in attacking random, unsecure places.  A group of people in a cafe or a bar are an easy target compared to a politician that has security around them LOOKING for the kind of people looking at or studying a target as well as carrying out an attack.</p>

<p>Also, attacking random citizens really accomplishes the &quot;Terror&quot; aspect of terrorism quite well.  If politicians, who are notoriously hated by 50% of the community and untrusted by almost all, is killed a random citizen might not associate or even care.  When it&#39;s <em>random</em>, indiscriminate, and takes place in locations where any &quot;average&quot; person might go, then that has an entirely different feel to it by the general public.</p>

<p>Just some thoughts. </p>

And there are more targets than just rulers and serfs you know.
What about army bases, police stations, political buildings or simply infrastructure needed to sustain a country, like power stations, water treatment plants, food production plants or transportation of goods.<br/>
That is if one really wanted to cripple a country, yet all these supposed terrorists manage to do is blow up or shoot crowds of nobodies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well...in conventional warfare you would be absolutely correct.  All of those things you mentioned would be high level targets. If country A is fighting country B.  However, that&#39;s not what we have here.  </p>

<p>Just look at it from their (the &quot;Terrorists&quot;) perspective. We have a small group of extremely motivated people who sneak into another country and are limited to hand-to-hand combat skills, sharp weapons, guns, rudimentary bombs, and their faith.  That&#39;s all they have.  They sneak into someone else&#39;s country and MIGHT be able to gather some of those things back.  </p>

<p>They can attack those things you mentioned but, without a standing army to reinforce the damage they&#39;ve done, it&#39;s just a one off attack.  That doesn&#39;t really do any good strategically.  What does?  Well...these days it&#39;s publicity.  They&#39;re the living breathing externalization of the phrase &quot;There&#39;s no such thing as bad PR.&quot; They WANT the world to know that they&#39;re attacking.  Notice how highly public these targets are?  Notice they are the first to raise their hand when a jetliner goes down?  Notice they hang their flag when they attack (this happened in Sydney, not sure about Paris)?  They are intentionally doing things as publically as possible to draw attention to their cause and recruit others to it.  </p>

<p>I suppose the part that I&#39;ve never understood (and indeed what makes me curious and to keep coming back to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>) is WHY they do these things when they know full well how technologically advanced their enemy is with surveillance and weaponry.  They know first world governments will not hesitate to eradicate them. So why do it this way?  That&#39;s the part that continues to confuse me.  Perhaps they know they&#39;ll all die but they&#39;re playing the long game of hoping that their sacrifice in the name of their god will eventually inspire enough people to rise against the &quot;infidels&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that. But as you say, it just garners more hate towards them.
And if that hate grows big enough, the entire population will support whatever the establishment wants.<br/>
Just look at how the Americans were after 9/11, foaming at the mouth ready to slaughter whoever. Or what happened to the Japanese after Pearl Harbour (camps and all that).</p>

<p>Its just that, this kind of &quot;attention&quot; dies pretty quickly and requires multiple continuous attacks to keep going,
and it requires the full force of the media to grow to such levels in the first place.</p>

<p>Their reasoning confuses me as well, there seems to be no other goal than to satisfy their revenge.
Its like hate has infected them to the point that all they are able to think and do is &quot;kill kill kill&quot;.</p>

<p>That is if all these events are actually done by people from the regions they claim to be. 
Which i personally doubt, i just look at who benefits the most and go with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably better to upvote when someone answers your question and contributes directly to the conversation you started as opposed to simply trying to shut out things that you don&#39;t agree with.  Just a thought.</p>

<p>Anyway, I don&#39;t see what&#39;s not to &quot;agree&quot; with about what I&#39;ve said.  Terrorists choose to attack civilian populations because of the reasons I described...they&#39;re pretty obvious.  </p>

<p>AFAIC, the question isn&#39;t whether or not I&#39;m right or wrong it&#39;s whether or not your theory that there may be something more sinister behind the reason that it ALWAYS seems to be civilian attacks has any merit.</p>

<p>Second, the goal of terrorist attacks is to show that government of the country is incompetent because it is unable to protect its citizens from attack. Another goal is to disrupt economic life in the country. </p>
