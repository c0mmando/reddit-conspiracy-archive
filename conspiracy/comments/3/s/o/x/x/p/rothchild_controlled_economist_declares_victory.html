<p>Why are vaccines being pushed so strongly in a country which lacks clean drinking water and basic sanitation services? UNICEF blames Chad’s recurrent outbreaks of disease, including meningitis, on this vital, common-sense need. Why have major organizations spent $571 million on a vaccination project, when wells to provide access to clean drinking water have been constructed for less than $3,000 by the International Committee of the Red Cross?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The primary reason for handing out vaccines to 3rd world nations (and who knows, maybe even first world as well) is population reduction. No, this is not a conspiracy theory or misleading. This is the actual reason as reported by Bill and Melinda Gates. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gates began consuming data that startled him. In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. “It goes against common sense,” Gates says. Most parents don’t choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die.</p>

<p>“If a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,” says Melinda.</p>

<p>In terms of giving, Gates did a 180-degree turn. Rather than prevent births, he would aim his billions at saving the kids already born. “We moved pretty heavily into vaccines once we understood that,” says Gates. - <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2011/11/02/the-second-coming-of-bill-gates/">http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2011/11/02/the-second-coming-of-bill-gates/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find it strange that, in this case, they are only giving out vaccines and not bothering with the water supply. If the goal was to decrease mortality so that mothers have fewer children, vaccines are clearly not a priority in many situations, and should only be a small part of a wide range of things done to decrease mortality for 3rd world nations. </p>

<p>Um, there are millions that care, can&#39;t imagine what type of sub-human would believe death by rich elite men who control the world would be a &quot;meh&quot; situation?</p>
