       The same exact methods your boys employ, as you're claiming to not be yourself.

        Personal attacks when fact based debate is the only thing required.  (Using the widely exposed "seek help," no less)
       </li>
       <li>
        Over the top demands for solutions.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       You've already exposed yourself 100% here.  The fact you did this while attempting to promote the fictional character, Edward Snowden, says much about his highly questionable message and motives.  Just another low intelligence attempt that has fallen flat on its face.  Watching you have CTRL V responses increase has only served to further solidify this fact.

       Personal insults are all you have.  You're unable to debate or provide evidence that supports any of your propaganda based claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've already clearly established Snowden to be a CIA sponsored limited hangout.  He worked for them.  He still works for them, playing the exact same character we saw years ago.  Wearing his characters costume any time he's in camera.  That same missing eyeglass nose pad continually gives it away.

       You've brought nothing to the table.  You behave identically to your fellow "conspiracies don't exist" apologists.  And then you wonder how people instantly identify you, disregarding every single lie you've made.  Is it dismissive?  Absolutely.  But without any substance or value, this is exactly what you deserve.

       What was it you initially tried to claim?  That I was being played by calling out Snowden for his clear as day acting.  His entire existence being a limited hangout.  As you and Dusty post the exact same thing of me, withing minutes of each other.  The exact same approach.  On a dead thread.  As if someone was telling you exactly what to say.

        Snowden is real guys.  I'm serious.  In my entire 7 days of owning this account, I've only found it necessary to to out and reply to every mention of Snowden being a CIA sponsored Limited Hangout, just to tell them all how wrong they seem.

       Yes, I'm cointelpro.  You've already been exposed, very eartly on, and what ammo do you then try to use for yourself?  Parroting back the exact same bullshit.  If you want questions answered, ask them.  A half page of CTRL V isn't going to cut it, I'm afraid.

       Perhaps someone might direct him to the nearest LensCrafters.  Maybe he doesn't know how to get there.  Maybe he's too busy hiding out, or releasing secrets or something.  Maybe he has been to LensCrafters Russia but they won't fix his glasses because he didn't buy them there.  Or maybe it's code.  Not sure.

       Leaked exclusively secrets THAT WERE ALREADY WIDELY KNOWN.  This could not have been any more limited hangout if it tried. The proof, once again, is in the results.  Or lack thereof.  With his gr8, as you try to say," exposure," ABSOLUTELY NOTHING CHANGED.

       It's nice to see the masses all clearly recognising that if someone is shown for hours up in hours on the corporate propaganda networks, he/she is in on it.
