</blockquote>

<p>Could be, they&#39;re looking for a real-world example of how quickly social media reporting of this sort of thing spreads. For example, if China were to launch missiles and some citizen saw/photographed/videoed it, they would have an idea how fast word would spread via social media. Or, should America launch, how much reaction time they would have to <em>shut it down</em> before word got out to the public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s not much to flex.  We already have ICBMs and everyone knows it.  Those things can carry a nuclear warhead clear across oceans and strike practically anywhere in the world from the comfort of home.</p>

<p>If the govt did indeed test something, they knew it would be seen best at night, footage would pop up.  And it&#39;s being used to distract people, and track how these sightings are reported.  Especially in the event that the missile was NOT ours.. get it?  And best to test it over a city that&#39;s a main target, like LA because it has the biggest population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But with so many actors and warning systems poised to go off as soon as a nuke explodes, it seems like no group on earth could be totally sure how it would play out from there. Nuke goes off somewhere, US automatic systems launch on Russian and China, their automated systems respond, life on earth takes a turn in a new and unexplored direction.</p>

<p>I think this uncertainty is exactly why no rational actor would set off a nuke. But there are plenty of rouge groups, religious nut-jobs and straight up nihilists out there. I&#39;m all for the UN programs to dismantle nuclear weapons, leaving 1000s of these around the world, some hidden 50+ years ago, is probably a bad idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TIL Israel has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho_%28missile%29#Jericho_III">Jericho III ICBM</a> with a range that has been estimated at 11,000km (highest estimate) and can carry a 1000kg payload (maybe not for 11,000km.) </p>

<p>A 1000kg payload could contain a nuclear warhead of similar yield to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B28_nuclear_bomb">B28 warhead</a> (<a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/yield-to-weight.png">Source on yield/kg</a> ).  New York City is 9200km from Israel, provided a missile was fired from within Israel.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Israel would nuke the USA with an ICBM, but it is possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, we&#39;re talking about a country surrounded on all sides by people who want them gone from this earth.  Their mindset is totally different than ours when it comes to how things should be done in the middle east, IMO.  But of all of our allies, Isreal has staunchly supported the USA, and I think we, as a country, should be better at supporting them.  This whole ISIS thing, Iran thing, etc, is a slap in the face.</p>

<p>I say this knowing I could be wrong bc all we know, or I know, is what is reported and my research done on those reports.  So much happens behind the scenes none of us are privy to.  </p>

I apologize I can&#39;t post a link, based on classification purposes.
