       I think it's entirely plausible, understanding how information flows and how fast it travels can be a great asset.

       It looks like this test may have been a little bit of both, guess all we can do is wait and see.

       Could be, they're looking for a real-world example of how quickly social media reporting of this sort of thing spreads. For example, if China were to launch missiles and some citizen saw/photographed/videoed it, they would have an idea how fast word would spread via social media. Or, should America launch, how much reaction time they would have to
       <em>
        shut it down
       </em>
       before word got out to the public.

       However, many ignorant viewers categorized it incorrectly. Could that have been accounted for? Yes. Was that intended? Maybe. Does that help the military? No clue.

       There's not much to flex.  We already have ICBMs and everyone knows it.  Those things can carry a nuclear warhead clear across oceans and strike practically anywhere in the world from the comfort of home.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the govt did indeed test something, they knew it would be seen best at night, footage would pop up.  And it's being used to distract people, and track how these sightings are reported.  Especially in the event that the missile was NOT ours.. get it?  And best to test it over a city that's a main target, like LA because it has the biggest population.

       So?  If you think China and Russia aren't aware of the missiles we have or are developing then you're sadly mistaken.  Why do you think countries hack each other so much?
      </p>
      <p>
       And honestly, it doesn't matter if it carries 14 warheads.  We already have unparalleled destructive power, so saying that one missile is going to cause some paradigm shift in how we are seen militarily is ignorant.

       But with so many actors and warning systems poised to go off as soon as a nuke explodes, it seems like no group on earth could be totally sure how it would play out from there. Nuke goes off somewhere, US automatic systems launch on Russian and China, their automated systems respond, life on earth takes a turn in a new and unexplored direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this uncertainty is exactly why no rational actor would set off a nuke. But there are plenty of rouge groups, religious nut-jobs and straight up nihilists out there. I'm all for the UN programs to dismantle nuclear weapons, leaving 1000s of these around the world, some hidden 50+ years ago, is probably a bad idea.

       TIL Israel has a

      </p>
      <p>
       A 1000kg payload could contain a nuclear warhead of similar yield to the

       I simply don't believe that China or Russia would take that step as they both know that it would result in mutually assured destruction. Where that other country would just make it appear that one of those countries made the first move and hope to stay out of the fray and watch the destruction.

       Well, we're talking about a country surrounded on all sides by people who want them gone from this earth.  Their mindset is totally different than ours when it comes to how things should be done in the middle east, IMO.  But of all of our allies, Isreal has staunchly supported the USA, and I think we, as a country, should be better at supporting them.  This whole ISIS thing, Iran thing, etc, is a slap in the face.

       I say this knowing I could be wrong bc all we know, or I know, is what is reported and my research done on those reports.  So much happens behind the scenes none of us are privy to.

       Interesting, thanks for the link. I've read through the D5 tech manual for weight compensation purposes after missile launch. I apologize I can't post a link, based on classification purposes. We've had British on our boats, I remember specifically when my last boat did our test missile launch, but I do believe the brittish have the capability of carrying 14, so I think the wiki is right there.

       Perhaps it's because LA is where Hollywood is located. Hollywood celebrities have the most number of followers so videos/sightings would spread massively and quickly. If one were to give a visualization/heat map of the most connected(online) demographic, would it be LA? Anyway just speculating.

       not even close. its grid wars. the target of the "test" is your collective aura. the earths (and humanity's subtle bio-energetic field) you know when you're randomly thinking and then something makes you look up and theres this pretty girl there? you felt something and then you looked. Thats your aura, identity and consciousness. muscle flexing, and scaring people is just a bonus. they want to kill you identity, and future. there is alot of literature about our auric field. the best place to learn and start to take some power back is at arhayas.com.  if you choose to pretend that its spiritual mumbo jumbo, can you really be mad at your governments for stealing something from you that you'd rather pretend doesn't exist?

       Just wanted to clear that up. I didn't say anything about China or Russia. I think there is really only one country that would nuke America in a first strike attack, and it is neither China nor Russia.
