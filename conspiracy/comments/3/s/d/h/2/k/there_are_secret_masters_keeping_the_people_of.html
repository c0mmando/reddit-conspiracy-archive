<p>Divide And Conquer is a great strategy. Those who have divided us know.</p>

<p>The only way to escape our chains is through opensource, the sharing of tools with everyone without bias, and the teaching of eachother how things work.</p>

<p>There is some logic to what these hidden masters have done in preventing people from using things that are far beyond their ability to understand and would be likely to cause dangerous combinations. Toward solving this, we should educate eachother and build up from the basics whenever possible, rejecting tech that we ourselves wouldnt be able to figure out if we took the time to learn. We should not let monkeys operate digging equipment unless they are first smart enough to build that equipment if the parts were laying around. But we should also not whip the monkeys when they start experimenting with putting such pieces together. We must be allowed to learn without going through a process we dont trust because it has kept us down in secret ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sometimes wonder how much of our true potential is lost to these scum. I think humanity can create heaven on earth if it wasn&#39;t for the devils running it. Somehow the worst of us always climb their way to the top. Ever wondered about that pattern?</p>

<p>Btw, i wish it were that easy to reorganize ourselves, but life man, it holds us down. There are just 24 hours in a day. 8 hours for sleep, 8 hours for work. The rest 8 hours for all the other work you need to do (commuting, cooking, misc etc). There isn&#39;t so much time in a day for people to think and act outside the box, unless they really tried.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Corbett Report has a lot of good answers:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cynd4AINc70">Solutions: Agorism</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32sUG8eEyA">Do You Give a Damn?  HERE&#39;S What We Can Do</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ienCCcRPlq4">Open Source Ecology Could Change Everything </a></li>
</ul>

<p>I am a technology expert.  Corbett is on track with a lot.  Here&#39;s my recommendations for what it is worth:</p>

<ul>
<li>Learn and Use Bitcoin (I recommend paper wallets, buried offsite in weatherproof capsule)</li>
<li>Learn and Use Linux (I recommend <a href="http://linuxmint.com/">&#39;Mint&#39;</a> for desktops, CENTOS for servers, Tails / knoppix / puppy for old laptops (a live os))</li>
<li>Use Open Source software tools for daily use, like (vlc, audacity, libreoffice, gimp, firefox, filezilla, etc), because other software spies on you</li>
<li> Use Open Hardware when its available, because the Mobile alliance and manufacturers are globalist lapdogs who place chips that are backdoors for intelligence mafias</li>
<li>Google / FB are run by intelligence and they steal ideas.   Run your <em>own cloud technology</em> for backups and high availability of your data.  This could be as simple as an encrypted area on a file server maintained by a company such as digital ocean and using rsync.</li>
<li>Use firefox with privacy extensions enabled:  noscript, adblock-plus, taco, flashblock, https-everywhere, user-agent overrider, world IP</li>
<li>Opt out of google&#39;s convenient services.  Make your life harder so theirs is also.</li>
<li>Use chrome ONLY FOR NETFLIX and AMAZON VIDEO in linux as it&#39;s the only thing that will work.  This is by design.  The wildvine HTML5 DRM extension is Google&#39;s so of course they aren&#39;t going to allow it for any other browser.  <em>This forces the user into using chrome on linux, since no viable microsoft silverlight drm is available for linux (yes, I know about pipelight, it&#39;s a steaming pile of janky, halfbroken shit imo).  It&#39;s clear through my experimentation that chrome is listening to your microphone also (like fb), but we&#39;ve also known that every website you go to in chrome is being transmitted to google through the thinly veiled excuses of &#39;malware protection&#39; and &#39;autocomplete&#39;</em></li>
</ul>

<h2></h2>

<p>Non tech options</p>

<ul>
<li>Listen to alternative media and donate to them generously so they stay around.</li>
<li>Go onto reddit and point out state propaganda when you see it.  Combat memes, tropes, narratives of abusive social psychology exploits by shining a light on them, or using counter-tactics of culture jamming to disrupt the cognitive dissonance of others in forums.</li>
<li>Learn how to garden, switch from reliance on grocery stores to things you grow in your garden.</li>
<li>Grow only open pollinated seeds, and replant seeds so you get more resistant crops (landrace crops)</li>
<li>Borrow from seed libraries and return your exceess.</li>
<li>Guerilla gardening.  If seed library is full, then make seed balls and throw them in empty lots to grow lazy public gardens.</li>
<li>If you are on disability / food stamps, buy seeds and food plants instead of food.  Plant or have a caretaker plant your seeds.</li>
<li>Learn to upcycle waste and sell for bitcoin or trade for needful things.</li>
<li>Join community gardens and volunteer</li>
<li>Join coops</li>
<li>Join agorist / anarchist groups.  Anarchy is not a bad word and it&#39;s not about rioting.  It&#39;s about counter-economy and organic groupings, intentional communities and self-governance.</li>
<li>Listen to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as your news source, as all other subs are filter bubbled.</li>
<li>Listen to TED talks, but with a grain of salt and like anything, with skepticism</li>
<li>Be like Thomas the doubter.  Doubt stuff.  Trust but verify means you don&#39;t trust, but you have to pretend really well as trust goes both ways.</li>
<li>Never lose faith in humanity.  Remember that there&#39;s lots of people out there like yourself who think the world is run by psychopaths, but so long as you never stop fighting they cannot win.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>How minds work is a good start. I&#39;m building games, music tools, and visual effects that connect with basic kinds of AI (like boltzmann neuralnets) so anyone will be able to take these pieces and build new things with it, in a way they understand, visually as a new way of thinking based on math instead of needing word based language. I&#39;ve often been confused how to simplify it, but I think it can be done. When people understand the basics of how minds work, and how to build new pieces of minds that fit together across Internet and merge with our own thoughts, other things will start to make more sense.</p>

<p>-Political</p>

<p>-Social</p>

<p>-Intellectual</p>

<p>-Spiritual</p>

<p>Many masters use humanity as &quot;training-ground&quot;, both for personal gain, but &quot;angels&quot; also use us for elevation through indirect contact, and not direct speech, as to not offend, or get caught.</p>

<p>Get educated in the Mysteries, as to get to know the drills, and to protect yourselves against spiritual vampires, and to elevate yourself to a higher understanding of things.</p>

<p>Forget not mister Milton William Cooper. He has put together some old, but still valid observations that needs to be looked at for the younger generation, for perspective purposes:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hourofthetime.com/wordpresstest/milton-william-bill-cooper-mp3-collection/">Entire library</a></p>

<p>Also check out the series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYGFfvhnV2k&amp;amp;list=PLF05201F9DA35C234">Mystery Babylon</a> - Mr. Cooper goes through what has happened to humanity for the last 6000 years.</p>

<p>Mr. Cooper was a desperate man - he was the first to put most of what was available together in a coherent storyline, and almost alone in his endeavors. Even though his tone is direct and often angry, his message is still a valid one. </p>

<p>My best advice, is to be open minded with all you hear and read nowadays, and don&#39;t attach too much emotions into what is going on. I have met many walls myself, and even contemplated suicide once it dawned on me what the heck has happened to us.</p>

<p>Use this time in history to get to know all the aspects, outer and inner, as to be better able to make proper decisions in the time to come.</p>

<p>This is good advice.  Those with power on this planet want a reaction.  Doesn&#39;t matter whether that reaction is positive or negative as long as we pick a side (one of the two sides chosen by them) and fight to defend it against the other side.  I think the trick is to simply sit there cynically, not buy into the farce, not react.  Let the power structure atrophy and fade away into irrelevancy on its own when we all collectively stop paying attention to it.</p>
