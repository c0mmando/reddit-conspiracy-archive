<p>Do you have any rights over your own facial image?</p>

<p>When a security camera in a mall records your face, do they own that copy of your face?  Can they do anything they want with it?</p>

<p>Can <em>I</em> go into a mall, take candid photos of strangers, and use those images in advertising or to make graphic designs?</p>

<p>When someone &quot;tags&quot; you on Facebook, you can of course request it be untagged.  But you can bet 500 Million Dollars that the Facebook supercomputers will never forget that you were tagged in that photo, once.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll try to answer this from a non-lawyer&#39;s understanding of media law (I work in film and tv, these are things I&#39;m fairly familiar with)</p>

<p>In your Elvis and Marilyn example that&#39;s twofold - there&#39;s the copyright on the image (likely not taken by you, and license terms if you licensed it are unlikely to allow that use) which is pretty straight forward.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s also a right of publicity. It protects people&#39;s rights when it comes to certain types of commercial exploitation. But in general your chances of successfully making a claim in that case will be related to your existing public profile and the nature of the use.</p>

<p>So a bar publishing photos on Facebook of famous people who&#39;ve been in is unlikely to be in for much trouble. But if they to one of those photos, of Arnold Schwarzenegger for example, and put it on a billboard and &quot;I&#39;ll be back... at Moe&#39;s Bar&quot; then they&#39;d expect to hear from lawyers.</p>

<p>You do not, explicitly, have any rights over your likeness.</p>

<p>But you have certain privacy rights. So anyone can photograph you in public (or usually &quot;a public space&quot; of which a mall would be one) and you have no reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>

<p>But if one of those photos were published in a newspaper accompanied by the caption &quot;police believe pedophiles have been watching kids at Hillside Mall&quot; then you and others identifiable in the images would want to talk to a lawyer.</p>

<p>This is also why you only ever see waist down shots of fat people in news stories about obesity. But you&#39;ll see normal footage of identifiable people in stories about trivial things.</p>

<p>A mall probably could use images of you in some contexts. Although it would depend a lot on what they were. A billboard with you in a crowd showing the popular food court is fine. A billboard of you alone is dubious. </p>

<p>Also publishing footage of you as a suspect in a crime is somewhat dangerous - they&#39;d better be sure they&#39;re identifying the right person.</p>

<p>You can probably take photos in public and do commercial things with them, but how identifiable the subjects are and the context in which you portray them will be important.</p>

<p>Aside from copyright which is a simple matter of rights belonging to those who create things, the rest of these issues are a lot of gray area.</p>

<p>The issues are usually around how the use of images would affect your perception with the public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are circumstances where you have no rights to it and they include most instances for non-celebrities.  1) You have no reasonable expectation of privacy.  that means you are clearly visible from a public area.  Security cameras, people photographing foot traffic, is all public domain.  This is the principal that leads to courts upholding the legality of filming police officers.</p>

<p>2) You have signed away your rights to photos including those of yourself.  This is true of the user agreements for Facebook and most sites that involve sharing photos.</p>

<p>The instances you&#39;re talking about with celebrity photos is different.  The are taken in private settings, usually by a paid photographer and the photograph itself is private property whether the rights are owned by the subject, the photographer or a third party.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a little unclear about using uncopyrighted photos for things like TV and video games.  On the one hand video games require the assent of athletes to use their likeness, but I highly doubt that Mel Gibson gave his assent for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7d2xwCJU_Kw">this</a> and there was no lawsuit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why the best way to win against all governments is to open source your work. There are alternative means to monetize it than selling it outright.</p>

<p>Yes it&#39;s counterintuitive but you must have faith in others that they will support you, and no you won&#39;t become as ultra rich as you would have been in the 80s if you had a proprietary tech that was game changing.  Then again, unless you were a blue blooded episcopalian philedelphite american ruling class freemasonic dickbag, like others have said, you&#39;d probably have had your patent frozen even then, taken by the dept of energy and you&#39;d make nothing (or suicided, or pedojailed--which is worse).</p>

<p>The best thing to do today if you have a legit discovery that can help the world, is to open source it and make sure you release it simultaneously via sourceforge, tor hidden tor service, freenet, securedrop and wikileaks (and buried in a time capsule on a usb drive) so it&#39;s incredibly difficult for the feds to triangulate and remove forcibly without some widespread event to cover their activities.</p>

<p>Then, once it&#39;s out there, if you so choose, then you--&#39;Knife&#39; Matsushida (example pseudonym)--can step out of the shadows as the consultant.  Or you can design a totally anonymous consultancy in a tor hidden service and work from there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll give you a few simple answers for this</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1.) He who enters into public spaces has no expectation to privacy. Whosoever taketh photos in public owns those photos and the rights to them, supposedly.</p></li>
<li><p>2.) Whosoever taketh photos on private property must obtain permission from the property owner beforehand, otherwise those photos belong to the property owner.</p></li>
<li><p>3.) Whosoever agreeth to ye olde EULA and uploadeth thine photos to thy facebook or other social media waive any and all rights to those photos and they do hereby subsequently become the property of facebook or other social media, so sayeth the EULA so mote it be.</p></li>
<li><p>4.) Whosoever seeketh to obtain thine driver&#39;s license or other government issued identification or papers must be photographed and have thine photograph entered into ye olde federal and state databases, the contents of which belongeth to thine state and federal governing bodies.</p></li>
<li><p>5.) Whosoever does contest these stipulations may bring forth a case before yon judge, however, beware ye those who enter here for there be lawyers and they are well paid.</p></li>
