      <p>
       Our culture is owned by a very powerful few, it is not generated by us. Many of you know this, but it needs to be repeated again for those who are unsure or do not know.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how we are controlled, because we do not even control our own culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       CNN does not deliver news, it delivers propaganda. MSNBC delivers Democrat propaganda, Fox News delivers Republican propaganda. Both have endless material of the other being idiots, because they
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       both idiots. Statist, pro-coporate, anti-american fear-mongering idiots who are all told what to say by AP and Reuters. 5 of the 6 media companies in the infographic as well as AP and Reuters are controlled by Zionists, which is a religious ideology that believes that Jews have a special right the land around Israel, which gives them justification to keep attacking Palestinians. Basically Zionism is a religious shield behind which the Israeli government hides behind while it commits atrocities. It really has nothing to do with religion or race, just with power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even TV channels that seem innocuous have an agenda simply because they're run by corporations which are profit and power-seeking entities, run by power-seeking people. BET strongly guides African-American culture by creating a culture that African-Americans see as organically African-American, but it is corporate and consumerist. Perfectly materialist. It also controls how
       <em>
        white
       </em>
       people perceive blacks in America. It does not empower them or us. It is divide and conquer, it drives a wedge between the races. Because blacks in America do not own the media, they do not own the culture. So it is corporate culture, it is consumer culture. Almost all our media is, I'd guess 95%. This isn't to say it's without entertainment value, or that it isn't good drama or good comedy or what have you. This isn't about that. This is about the bias within those shows, certain ideas being unrelentingly omitted, creating a blackout of information in certain areas of knowledge in American culture. Like Noam Chomsky says, “The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans control other humans not with physical fences, but instead fences of the mind, wherein certain areas of thought are cordoned off. If we buy in to the ideologies given to us by the powerful, we end up believing these cordoned-off areas are that way for our own good and so we never explore them out of fear or "respect". Christianity and many other religions are also very guilty of this. We may be afraid of talking about these ideas in public. We may be afraid of thinking them to ourselves, even in the privacy of our own minds! Who needs a physical fence when you can control what a person is afraid to think about, and therefore do? Reinforcing a culture of anti-intellectualism also strengthens this attitude, it makes people fear the cordoned-off areas more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disney Channel, Fox News, MSNBC, HGTV, Golf Channel, ESPN. It is corporate media and therefore promotes corporate culture. There are occasional bright spots like The Simpsons or The Daily Show, but even these things are controlled to some degree by the censors and by what is needed to maintain their high paychecks.
      </p>

       Buy this, buy that. Feel bad for x (your hair, your lawn, your friends), fix it by buying y (shampoo, lawnmower, alcohol). The strategy of Problem-Reaction-Solution. Create a problem (or the appearance of one), people react in a negative way, then you sell them the solution to fix it. It's a predictable and profitable pattern of human behavior, and boy do they know it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duCSoK4F6Dc">
        Create your own culture. Create your own music. Create your own YouTube channel. Share it with everyone. This is how humanity advances, by simply outgrowing corporate culture. Aren't you tired of it? I am.
       </a>

       Let's step outside the boundaries created for us by all this fear, and be who we want to be. Say the things we really wish to say, even if it's "socially improper." The truth is powerful, and the powerful don't want us to say the truth. Too bad. I've had enough beating around the bush. This is real life, and we only get one shot. This isn't a dress rehearsal. I'm not going to spend it being afraid of reasonably stepping outside the perceived boundaries of our American corporate-owned culture. Are you?

       Exactly this. The masses don't critique or think of media and its fallout as seriously as they should, neither are there rigorous regulations to ensure media isn't controlled by a few.
