<p>Actually scratch that. Threats are now being made to the school/black students. The bad &quot;I&#39;m coming to campus and doing .... tomorrow&quot; kind of threats. </p>

<p>The protesters have been packing away their tens as fast as possible so no one will be there for people planning on  protesting the protesters. Hopefully we are not in the news tomorrow.</p>

They get laughed at and trashed by the media.  But a few people make some general accusation of racism and all of a sudden heads at the school are rolling and the media is on board cheering on and rallying the social justice warriors.  Fucking pathetic.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It looks to me like the sub allows posting and voting? Was it changed? </p>

<p>But I did some digging and I found something veeeery interesting which leads me to believe this entire thing is a government psyop from the start. </p>

<p>Why, you ask? Take a look at the moderator list of <a href="/r/Mizzou">/r/Mizzou</a>. </p>

<p>Most of the mods are inactive. But then we have the others... </p>

<p>WorseThanHipster is a confirmed shill who moderates subreddits such as TopMindsofReddit, VoatInAction, TopMindsofVoat, and two mostly empty subs, but subs that also further prove his shill-ness - namely FreezePeach and FreezePeachInAction. </p>

<p>quippe is a 4 year old account that hasn&#39;t posted until two days ago, which... I see, that&#39;s when he &quot;temporarily closed&quot; the subreddit. Shill farmed account confirmed. </p>

<p>jschooltiger moderates AskHistorians which is one of those subs which doesn&#39;t allow any sort of discussion that goes against the &quot;official story&quot;, so basically another shill-modded sub. </p>

<p>onesun43 is the only other moderator that is active and isn&#39;t immediately suspicious. All the other mods haven&#39;t posted in months or even years.  </p>

<p>So basically the shills are trying to stir up a race war once again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was /pol/ and black people hyping up drama to try get out of an exam today. </p>

<p>People were claiming the kkk were chasing black students, /pol/ hyped it up, someone blamed some random youtuber trying to create a new Ben Garrison, a random &quot;news&quot; site picked it up. </p>

<p>CNN or somthing ran a story saying it&#39;s all nothing. /pol/ was trying to convince people the police were working with the kkk when someone said the kkk stole an emp and took out all the campus electronics and that&#39;s where I stopped following it.</p>

<p>The whole thing was stupid. The protests are bullshit to begin with. A backwards swastika written with Poo that no one has actually seen and there are no photos of and some random guy said someone off campus called him a nigger. Better start protesting. </p>

<p>/pol/ was trying to see how far they could take thier delusions of oppression in order to red pill people and students were trying to dodge an exam.</p>

<p>Edit: I should mention all of this happened on twitter and the &quot;threats&quot; were made on yik yak and also happen to be memes.</p>

<p>We&#39;re witnessing their full, horrifying endgame right now. Keep the people complacent with consumerism and interpersonal drama while the elite of the elite sap away at the massive but rapidly decreasing accumulated wealth of the United States built up over centuries of not being destroyed in warfare (it&#39;s one treasure more valuable than all the others). It took decades to set up the conditions, starting with Bretton Woods, but all that waiting paid off since they are now all but untouchable.</p>

<p>Without its accumulated wealth, the US is going to start looking more like Argentina, which faces no existential threats but is just devoid of any real amounts of money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>The anti-semitic stuff is BS.</strong> </p>

<p>Yes there was a shit swastica, but this all started from black student groups complaining of racial slurs and other slights </p>

<p>Many of the protests have been led by an organization called Concerned Student 1950, which gets its name from the year the university accepted its first black student.</p>

<p>The real reason anything happened was when at least 30 black football players announced they would not participate in team activities until Wolfe was gone. The school stood to loose $2milliion from missing that game and acted quickly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ugh, this is such a shitshow.</p>

<p>There are people riled up on both sides....and of course there are only two opposing sides because media+polarization = divided population / bad democracy / $$$.</p>

<p>So anyway, they probably shut it down because the (imo) racist reaction to what appears to be the (probably) unjust removal of the prez and chancellor has triggered a flood of bomb threats, death threats etc. Race baiting. And just gross racist trolling. Since the mods on r/mizzou are basically non-existent I doubt they could handle a fraction of the action. So in my opinion....as much as I hate to see any sub censored it&#39;s probably a lot better than the non-productive shit-show that would have been that subreddit.</p>

<p>And just to elaborate further: I don&#39;t know enough about the situation. But whatever you think of it - the racist reaction is probably worse. I personally don&#39;t think what the students did was very productive....but activism is sometimes misguided. And even when misguided, potentially illuminating and worthwhile. I&#39;m glad there are passionate young people trying to make changes to the world around them. And racism is a for-real deal in Missouri and the U of Missouri. The saddest part to me is that nothing would have happened at all if the football team didn&#39;t get involved, because if they didn&#39;t play Mizzou would have lost millions of dollars in just one weekend.</p>

<p>The tired old, &quot;no bad tactics just bad targets&quot; bit, eh?</p>

<p>It&#39;s all been heard &#39;round here before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all what I said. I don&#39;t particularly like the tactics either. But I think there are lessons to be learned from it. And I&#39;m glad young people are passionate about something. And although it&#39;s not on the top of my list, I think racism is a very valid thing to address. How they did it....yeah, probably mostly shitty.</p>

<p>Instead of just participating in the two minutes of hate and condemnation I&#39;d rather focus on progress. How to better address these issues and activism and what can be learned from this because when the media dust settles there will still be some very upset students and plenty of racism to go around. So best case scenario this leads to some actual positive change.</p>
