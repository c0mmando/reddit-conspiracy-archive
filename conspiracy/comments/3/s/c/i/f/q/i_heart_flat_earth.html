       I do think the sky is dome-like, I also suspect our whole world (earth &amp; sky) is a maybe ball - but we are a flat-ish surface within - like an iris in an eyeball.

       I've seen pics of a hollow earth - basically the whole thing turned inside out. it doesn't work for me because there is still the issue of what makes the force we experience as gravity. even if you flip it to the more sensible centripetal force explanation - that only works against a circle - not a sphere - because the top and bottom are never going to get equal force as the widest area - spinning on a pole. (which is same problem for normal SE., even if gravity were real it should be stronger at equator and almost nonexistent at poles imo )

       Like I said, there are holes in the official model and FE. Frankly, I'm of the impression that they are lying to us, but until I can rocket myself up and see it for myself, I'll never know (SE,FE,CE), sigh.... I find this stuff fascinating though and am more open minded about this stuff than others here. At the end of the day, I'd say don't fall into any "belief" system, whether FE, SE, CE, etc. Cheers!

       oh - welcome to a divisive topic :) tho - no need to fall strictly on either side yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you google "flat earth theory" you'll get a taste of the scope - it's kind of a movement, a lot of stuff out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       both of your questions are great I think any answer for either is still conjecture. there are different speculations - the best I've seen is that  lying about such a basic thing is a means of maintaining psychological control - and keeping channels open for other lies. such as when a cult leader convinced his followers of totally bizarre stuff - that never seems to be relevant to the cults ultimate purpose -- the more you can get a population to accept knowledge that counters their natural instincts - the more you can keep getting them to accept whatever you want to tell them and they will not rebel physically or even psychologically.
      </p>
      <p>
       but - that's really just a guess to try to make sense of the why. and it's not what the theory is about,
      </p>
      <p>
       the theory is about just examining the spinning ball model and comparing it to our real world. physics. geometry. sun. water. all that stuff - reexamined brings up some huge questions about if we are indeed a spinning ball.
      </p>
      <p>
       the link above gives a nice overview of a lot of those questions.

       the model of the flat earth is like a dinner plate or a pizza. the north pole is the center. antarctica is the outer crust. (nobody has ever crossed antarctica by land or air so the idea it is a solid mass or is crossable has never been demonstrated, also circumnativating it takes a LOT longer than anticipated )
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway to to answer your question. you can fly in a circle above a circle and end up where you started. the idea is when you think you are flying in a circle around the ball you are really flying in a circle above the flat circle earth.

       Mainly the spotlight effect of the sun and moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       have you seen the explanation they give for this? I actually find it really solid, that the sun is about 3000 miles up and about 30 miles across. and you can measure angle of sun rays coming through clouds and they are always at angle that seems to confirm this approximation. if you like tell me what specifically bothers you about the idea.

       ha. maybe antarctica is the "island"? yeah -- midnight sun is a real deal breaker. makes perfect sense at the north pole but if midnight sun occurs in the south - well that throws it all on it's head. I agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       for one night when I learned about it I was like --- whuuuh I dunno what to think now/ . I know it's not a ball but this midnight sun thing tho.
      </p>
      <p>
       then as I went deeper I saw that the midnight sun down south is really not verified.

       Right. I mean, people really do have to see things for themselves. That video you linked could go either way. I do not take people's word for things. I want to travel to Antarctica and explore, but I'm not allowed and told, just take our word for it, it is as we tell you. Same with space. That's what I hate when people say, "oh, you never been to China so it doesn't exist". I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but until I go there, I wont take your word for what it is. I really think we need an indie team to go to Antarctica and that island and test this shit, post/stream it online and we can end this shit. But that will never happen.....

       oh I so agree. I've got a friend who's been there twice, but just on this boat tour, it's like ten grand a trip. I want to be rich too. anyway. she said she never saw the midnight sun - but she was only there for brief time each time etc.

       I totally think they are faking space travel too.

       but yeah -- all these best guesses - so much would change if we can actually go/try to go ourselves,

       I bet in time some flat earth folks can pull some real cash, I don't think it's so beyond reach to set up a camera in antarctica at least, I'm looking forward.

       Maybe because flat earthers make anybody who questions the official line look like an idiot by association. Or it may be that there are a LOT of causes that require action, and some people are wasting their time on one that is, essentially, a massive punk. I'm just guessing. I can't say why Mizzay hates flat earthers. I don't. I just ignore them. I doubt that anybody who thinks the earth is flat has anything to add to any conversation I might have.

       thanks for your answer, for the record questioning the official line will always be good. even when the those who do it have vast differences of opinion on what the real truth is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I find it interesting that in questioning (what you do question) that you have identified a new acceptable boundary of what is acceptable to believe/question. you want to replace the old party line with a new party line but it will still be a line. and you will be the guardian of where that line is? IMO - this is not a true change you are championing, just a changing of the guard. IMO we should be able to investigate any knowledge given to us by authority, that we do not discover ourselves, not just some knowledge but all knowledge should be verifiable.

       I've seen pics of a hollow earth - basically the whole thing turned inside out. it doesn't work for me because there is still the issue of what makes the force we experience as gravity. even if you flip it to the more sensible centripetal force explanation - that only works against a circle - not a sphere - because the top and bottom are never going to get equal force as the widest area - spinning on a pole. (which is same problem for normal SE., even if gravity were real it should be stronger at equator and almost nonexistent at poles imo )

       Mainly the spotlight effect of the sun and moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       have you seen the explanation they give for this? I actually find it really solid, that the sun is about 3000 miles up and about 30 miles across. and you can measure angle of sun rays coming through clouds and they are always at angle that seems to confirm this approximation. if you like tell me what specifically bothers you about the idea.
