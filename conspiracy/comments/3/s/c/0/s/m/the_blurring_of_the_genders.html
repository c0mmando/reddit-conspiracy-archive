       The whole blurring of the genders, blurring gender roles, and confusing people is all part of a multi-pronged agenda. Here is how I see the agenda unfolding. A lot of the food, drugs, and pollutants are causing a wider array of defects and effects on the newer generations. This may lead to imbalances in hormones, or deformities. You combine this with the new wave of media which is trying to blur gender roles/lines you are lefts with millions of people that are disenfranchised form traditional gender roles. They then seek labels or groups to latch onto, which is shit like pansexual. This allows for younger confused audience to think it's ok to be sexually attracted to a car tire, and make no attempts at normalcy or to seek mental health advice/help. I think with all these new labels it also makes people create new "labels" for things like sexual deviance, which make it appear as a sex preference, which undermines the criminality of the acts.

       I'm more threatened by TV as a whole than this whole gender/sexuality thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck who ya like, dress how ya want. Live life fully.
      </p>
      <p>
       TV definitely sells us who to like and how to dress. I agree with that point. I'll also agree that lots of programming is still totally bigoted, racist, classist, sexist, capitalist, statist, and all that ugly jazz.
      </p>
      <p>
       I prefer cartoons, comedy, cspan, and films. I don't in fact own a TV. Booyah.

       I agree, I have no dog in the fight, my husband and I are in the UK and all our neighbors have different preferences, and a lot are immigrants and we don't discriminate their beliefs. But I will say when 15-20% of all TV "programming" has to do with weird gender bending stuff, and kids are sponging this stuff up, you can only imagine the effects of the milk and twinky digestion combined with the beta cuckold programming

       Where does 15-20% of TV have to do with gender-bending?  You have Bruce Jenner's show and?  I mean.. RuPaul was big on TV decades ago... Rocky Horror Picture Show was also decades ago... Cross-dressing and transgender shit isn't new.  The only thing new is now everyone who gets enraged by it has the outlet of the internet to talk about it on.

       So where are you getting this 20% number from then?  Just guessing at a figure you think is accurate?  Monty Python sketches had guys playing the parts of women... was that gender-bending or was it comedy?

       To old farts in the 60s maybe that was funny, I don't know. Comedy may be an outlier there - I am speaking to all the media. The new way to pacify adults, and to mold and influence their behavior, is to make cuckold sound cool. That way, they are more docile.

       Cuck definitely doesn't mean what it used to.  That word is used for anything now.  Cuck-servative is a term that is actually used by people describing conservatives who negotiate with liberals.

       Top 50 tv shows on air in 2014-2015. How many include gender-bending "stuff"?
      </p>
      <p>
       OITHNB has a transgender character, so I'll give you that. American Horror Story gets pretty far out.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... 2 out of the top 50? 4% of the top fifty, and that excludes the thousands of programs that have nothing to do with the spooky issues you're afraid of being brainwashed with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: look out, gay characters in #23 and #42!

       The butt hurt in this thread is so strong. We are based in the UK and our sister is gay and we have no problems with their lifestye. What I am really speaking to is the programming that his happening, and the butthurt uproar that occurs when we bring this up.

       There's more too. It comes down to increased complacency. Messing with hormones will help to suppress natural orders and urges including uprise. 
Another point should also include the unnecessary usage of hormone-interacting-chemicals which have been integrated into items. Juice boxes for kids, water bottle for adults. One of the more common: BPA. Use resources to search for hormone interactions chemicals. It's deliberate poisoning and social engineering. If only people really knew the motives and outright lies within the food and water supplies...

       BPA was found to interact with hormone receptors and cause sexual changes to male mice. This was further studied and reasonably extrapolated to male children. This is what caused the BPA removal from hard water bottles. These hard bottles contained BPA and when heated would leach into the water and be consumed. Consumers brought this issue to some manufacturers (who care about the people who buy their products) and the chemical component was removed. Also see the large notices on some baby bottles that now say BPA free. However, BPA is still used as in other items: coating inside juice boxes and on certain types of receipt paper.
Forgot- BPA = bisphenol-a

       I like that you are skeptic, but if you truly would open your eyes it's not hard to see that the axis of the modern day media, writing, programming, is all orbiting a few key agendas. The blurring of the genders is clearly an agenda. Send all the strong men to wars, to be killed, so they don't stick up for their rights, convince the women to work all day and leave their children with the state educators, and have them destroy the family and use Visa™© debit. Then have the males docile from the food and water supply so they don't stand up for their basic human rights. It makes sense if you connect the dots.

       Outside issue to ask about Manning because this involves:
       <br/>
       1. Mental disease
       <br/>
       2. Possible blackmail
       <br/>

       4. Anti-war

       5. Leaks

      <p>
       Chelsea Manning is so many issues it's almost a red herring for this issue. I am speaking to media and programming and writing that is cuc generation.

       You seem to grossly underestimate the power of ideas and memes. If you influence an idea within a few people you can change the world. This is why people think that become cuc president they can "change the world" but they become cucs to their financiers, shadow gov, handlers, and 1,000s of "officials". A few anonymous people with great ideas and visions can change the world much more.

       Who said anything about Anarchism? Is this a bot? I am not saying anything bas about women. And my "sensibilities" are not victorian ear... they are modern and a lot of people feel this way about the media. It's not the media that adults see that matters. Their minds are already fucking goo. It's the kids that watch this and think it's normal.
