       I mean, more than usual, because everyone is obsessing about this starbucks cup, and typically people don't freak out over stupid shit like this unless someone needs a distraction for something.
Did I miss anything in particular? I saw stuff about the Trans-Pacific partnership in the news. Anything else?

       Sweetie, you know I support you, whatever you want to do, but you're not gonna find what you're looking for in these awful made-up places. The universe is a cruel, uncaring void. The key to being happy isn't a search for meaning. It's to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense, and eventually, you'll be dead

       Yeah this is a true statement. I swear to God I hate this phenomenon that when the media or shills claims something is a big thing being discussed by everyone while in actuality it is not a big thing at all. But because someone claims "everyone is obsessed over this" suddenly that idea is firmly implanted in people's minds and it becomes real.

       At most, it can tell you that I get my news in America. Which I do. But it doesn't tell you what source. It actually doesn't say anything about who I talk to. Really, I just thought it'd make a fun topic of discussion.
You came across as kind of jerk. I don't know if that was your intention, but you did. Mostly in the way you worded your comment.

       Ok, so it's just the news outlets you follow and not the people you interact with?  If that's the case, then your use of the word "everyone" is confusing.

       Um, ok.  If pointing out the fact that it's also somebody's own fault if they are willingly getting their information from places that are obsessed over this ridiculous topic, then I guess I'm a jerk.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason that certain media are going crazy over this topic is because of ratings, if people don't watch or care, they won't cover it.  It's pretty easy to change the channel, if the places you get your information make you think that "everyone is obsessing" over it, then you are actually actively contributing to the problem of the superficial media.

       They succeed in re-directing people's emotions and energy to worthless and empty causes like this cups thing. This proves their brainwashing and mind control techniques they have been subtly applying on people have worked.

       I'm not even sure I can adequately respond to all these comments. Wow guys. Thanks for commenting at all, firstly, nobody ever does anywhere I post on this site. 
Some of you didn't come across as very nice, but I expected as much from this category of discussion.
I think I'm in favor of the "Prussian Blood ritual", "MK ultra" and the commentary about being distracted until our inevitable deaths. I'll keep all of those in mind as I scroll through the news next time.

       I see zero reason to see this as above average shady - if anything I'm amazing and pleased there have been no heavily publicized school shootings for a couple weeks.

       The cup in it's self is a cool idea, a corporation that caters to the public should not align it's self with one religion more then another.
      </p>
      <p>
       People that expect that a fucking coffee shop of all places needs to cater to their "Christian" holiday is seriously crazy.
      </p>

       But yes of course it's all distraction, that's what the MSM does; feeds you story after story, just enough to coattail you away from what's really going on and divert your attention to bullshit.

       As a Christian, it sickens me that anyone is even arguing over this thing when there's dying people all over, people starving next door to them, and people in desperate pains of depression, anxiety, anger, etc that they could be focusing on. But no, that would actually require an effort beyond being an arm chair warrior. Ugh.

       That's exactly the point, is news media thinks that informing and stirring people over a cup is more important than reporting on the suffrage within the US borders and abroad.

       Sweetie, you know I support you, whatever you want to do, but you're not gonna find what you're looking for in these awful made-up places. The universe is a cruel, uncaring void. The key to being happy isn't a search for meaning. It's to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense, and eventually, you'll be dead
