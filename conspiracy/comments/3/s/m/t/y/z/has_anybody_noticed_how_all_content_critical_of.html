<p>Completely agree with you.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I fell out with a couple of mods here not long ago, but if I&#39;m going to be absolutely honest I&#39;ve never had a problem posting stuff here on the basis of its political content. Generally speaking, I see this sub as being fair and balanced. In reality, it is vastly overpopulated by critics of Israel, but I don&#39;t see that as a bias within the sub. It is more that this is the only place on Reddit where critics of Israel get a voice, so naturally they flock here, myself included.</p>

<p>Absolutely buddy. It&#39;s pretty obvious the investment they have put in.</p>

<p>Yes, they use a specific type of broken English when they type. You&#39;re right. You can learn to spot it after a while.</p>

<p>Some of them are literal masters at derailing debate. Also, at continuing to argue without having any sort of defendable point.</p>

<p>You made some great points there, man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best approach I found is not to get into a debate with them. Their whole goal is just to keep you occupied, busy and drag you down. Remember for them its just points and money. They are not debating for facts, knowledge, truth...etc its just to keep you occupied...</p>

<p>What I do is give short answers and make them do the work. Also what really annoys them is if you dont answer their questions and just repeat the same thing over and over. You are basically trolling them with the truth ;-)</p>

<p>Like for every answer just say &quot;Zionists are murderers&quot;..etc</p>

<p>Also try to keep it civil and non inflammatory because they will look at any excuse to remove the thread or get you banned. Thats also a win for them.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t a matter of simply raising suspicion. What can anybody do about it? They&#39;re posting in groups from different locations, and each of them will have multiple accounts and access to a VPN. You would have to change the entire voting and abuse formats to stop them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.  You have to work the margins to figure out how things work.  A good example in physics is that Newtonian equations are basically just a specific case of Einsteinian physics when the speeds are no where close to the speed of light.  Its like living in the valley where a bubble life has been made around you or going out traveling in third world countries.</p>

<p>In this particular case its not even particular important what I was saying but that I discovered for myself how things work and that path of discovery doesn&#39;t just go backwards on you unless you get bonked on the head somehow.  I have that achievement.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say that most are concerned about never saying anything extreme or unreasonable to the detriment of never discovering anything.  In my case what I posted no longer matters and what is still important today is the understanding that there was a coordinated group of people lurking in the shadows who were using sophisticated tools (that are considered simple now) to alienate me and to suppress my dialog.  If I were to explain this to people who have not noticed that something was even slightly wrong with either the subject matter or the methods then it is simply throwing pearls to the swine.  These people being family, friends or bar mates would simply dismiss the methods as pure egotistical delusion and then take exception to the content.  The mere fact that someone would disagree with you whether it was the popular consensus or a orchestrated attack would no matter to them because the basic state of people is to assume that the unlucky are sinful creatures and in addition they will mistake your experiments for a weakness of your character.  In the case of this particular subject matter it is assumed that you must be utterly consumed with hate to probe the subject matter so deeply that it provokes an immune response.</p>

<p>In this regard all who systematically alienate people are my enemies and those who discover are my allies.</p>

<p>Probably the source of the saying: ignorance is bliss. You can never go backwards and unlearn the things you don&#39;t want to know unfortunately. </p>

<p>It sounds like you and I have had some incredibly similar experiences, buddy. The Israeli takeover has been fairly recent though, I think. Certainly, 7-8 years ago I was not finding it difficult to find places where I could post content critical of Israel. But these days the places you can do it are shrinking all the time. </p>

<p>They might have fancy technological tools to play with, but at the end of day they are using force to control popularity and/or opinion, and that&#39;s the part that stuns me. I don&#39;t understand how or why so many site owners are letting them get away with that. It&#39;s the 21st century. Maybe I&#39;m just naïve, but I thought openly being told what to think was behind us.</p>

<p>Had precisely the same experience, and the same people are present over multiple sites. Some of them even recognise me by my posting style now. I have no idea who they even are, but that is how familiar they are with me.</p>

<p>Of course the flip side is that I suppose it is a compliment. If you are that much of a thorn in the side to them then it is because you are good at getting your point across to others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool.  Its not really an issue though unless you have very particular kinds of jobs within the system or if you travel to Israel.  They have crazy security and can and will even demand that you open up your notebook and to log them into your email.  Those people know too much and the whole place is basically a military-industrial security island in the Middle East.  They&#39;ve made themselves inseparable because technology (Intel technology for example) has been transfered to them that could not be transfered to anybody else (like not a fucking chance for China).  How it got that way is decades of doing but today far too many Western power brokers feel like the place must be beyond reproach.  If you follow the connections and ecosystem of the movie <em>Top Gun</em> then you will get an idea about what I&#39;m referring to.</p>

<p>What do you consider to be recent about the Israeli takeover?  It seems to me that simply their tools have evolved a bit more.  They&#39;ve been running the perception game since they came up with the Old Testament - a long time in business so to speak.

<p>I think that&#39;s the perfect description of what Israel is. Only it promotes its own interests rather than those of the US or anyone else.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The internet. They have steadily taken control of its political content as the power of advertising revenue has opened up and increased profitability for sites. Advertising revenue usually comes with conditions.</p>

<p>But more recently than that, they have convinced the general internet-using Israeli public to proliferate their propaganda for them. It isn&#39;t just that the Israelis lie to the world; they also lie to the other Israelis. They have played to a tune of national solidarity against anti-Semitism in order to convince the public that it is their duty to expedite Zionist propaganda. What Zionists have been very good at is convincing people that Zionists and Jews are the same thing.</p>

<p>Yes they will even ask Israeli citizens to do this if they please.</p>

<p>I could imagine that they used DMCA take downs a whole lot.  It doesn&#39;t seem like it takes a whole lot to abuse that.  I imagine that they have a number of centralized systems that people subscribe to and then it will use their accounts to downvote.  Basically it can be a custom browser or just an extension that does it through their own computer.  This type of attack is very powerful because its difficult to detect it automatically without investigation.  China recently did something pretty powerful against github by having [foreign Chinese expat] Badoo viewers slam into github with some Javascript that the government&#39;s &quot;Great Cannon&quot; injected into the website.  So its most difficult when the sources seem natural from all over the world.</p>

<p>Then they get alerts to go in and troll some forums and to muddy the waters.  Their level of organization is pretty extreme really.  I seriously doubt that there are any Christian countries or churches that are organizing its people in large groups to mess with global opinion.  I&#39;m sure that lots of Jews can be convinced that using asymmetric techniques like this is the only way that their small numbers can fight off the next Holocaust.  So they always do it for the dire preservation against horrible death.  Its like stifle all dialog or DIE.  That is the mindset that many of them live with.</p>

<p>A few of the more conscientious among them have forwarded some of the emails to the more left-leaning media.

<p>True, and unless their user security is being compromised (which I&#39;m sure it is too), places like Reddit just don&#39;t have the manpower to launch any real investigation. What incentive do they even have? Oh, some guy from r/conspiracy says the Israelis are brigading him? Why do I care? I can&#39;t see Reddit taking on the Israeli state, tbh, and of course the Israelis always deny what they are doing anyway, so the cycle continues...</p>

<p>Brother, you&#39;ve raised one of the most interesting topics in cultural studies generally. The effect of media saturation on political activity. It&#39;s a fiercely debated area of academia, with certain Marxist thinkers arguing that even sport contributes to the problem. </p>

<p>The really interesting thing for me though is how media is used to limit horizons and narrow the parameters of acceptable opinion. This seems to work contrary to the theory of democracy, which relies on a well-informed and politically active public in order to sustain itself as a viable solution to the future.</p>

If you can control that parameter then its pretty much game over.  Think of Bush Jr. saying &quot;Let us not consider any conspiracy theories&quot; after 9/11.  Basically he successfully narrowed the Overton window by a fucklot with a quick stroke.  I recall the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_theorem">Squeeze Theorem</a> where you can prove that a function must be a certain one (over a range) if you can demonstrate that all of its values must be between two functions that are identical in that range.  In (real) politics you can be assured that everything will go according to your plan if you can remove the capability of the people to discuss or even think outside of the prescribed range.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t studied Frank Zappa much but he has said some amazing things like &quot;politics is the entertainment department of the military-industrial complex&quot;.  Yeah, so making it all celebrity contest between a handful of carnival standups and then check a box and back to normal and even going so far as to deride other people with crude bludgeoning accusations if they don&#39;t believe it is the end-all-be-all of change.  Did you know that other states with a disillusioned populace have the concept and implementation of an invalid election if a single candidate doesn&#39;t win over a certain amount?  Its realized that the president is elected from the selected and sometimes the rulers need to toss a few more bones to the masses for them to tolerate it.  The whole duality of political choices in the US in particular will eventually fail but for now its just absurd what it has become.</p>

<p>Absolutely one hundred percent true. You can create a social stigma about positions which fall outside of your agreed spectrum, so that nobody ever wants to be associated with the labels you give to people holding those views (i.e. &quot;radicals&quot;, &quot;terrorists&quot; etc...) Kind of the modern political equivalent of &quot;The Emperor Has No Clothes&quot;. Hence, you can shut down dissent without ever even directly addressing it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a massively important point, because politics used to be party-centred. Now it is candidate-centred. Meanwhile, the thinking of the electorate is kept focused through the media upon only those topics deemed important and discussed by the candidates themselves, hence solidifying the fuck job. Like Herman and Chomsky said, consent is manufactured. Not consent about which way you vote or which opinion you take, but consent about which issues are important and which are to be ignored or propagandized.</p>

<p>They are almost certainly using bots. They probably have a nice little package provided for them courtesy of the Israeli Foreign Ministry. These guys are very slick. They get the nationalist Israeli donkeys to do all the legwork for them, and they just sit in an office writing emails asking Israelis to &quot;fight online anti-Semitism&quot; or something similar.</p>

<p>I can respect that, but at the same time I believe what anti-Semitism is has been twisted and inflated to serve a political purpose (i.e. pro-Zionism).</p>

<p>Generally, when you are arguing with the hard Israeli right, they will be sending throwaway accounts into the thread to provoke you and call you names. Then, when at some point you get angry and start calling them names back, they will send a better debater in to argue that this proves you are an anti-Semite. Some of their tricks are very slick, but please don&#39;t take my word for it: just look at the physical evidence. Go into r/worldnews and see how heavily weighted the comments are in support of Israeli policy and how much anti-Palestinian propaganda there is in there. For weeks now, the top thread has been about a series of street stabbings against IDF soldiers which the Israelis have been hyperinflating into &quot;terrorism&quot;.</p>

<p>I think true anti-Semites are very rare. In fact, since (as is often pointed out) Palestinians are Semites too, it could reasonably be argued that among the biggest anti-Semites are Israelis themselves.</p>

<p>In sum, I feel that forming an opinion about anybody strictly on the basis of their race or religion is wrong. I do not however, believe in ignoring clear and blatant evidence when it is put in front of me. It is my belief in this evidence which usually earns me the label of anti-Semite, because the word itself has for years been being used as a political sledgehammer by the Israelis to cut down any opposition to their fanatical and destructive policies. Think the Palestinians have a point? How dare you be so anti-Semitic? You&#39;re worse than Hitler etc...</p>

<p>I agree with you buddy. However, at the same time, it is a bit of a chicken and egg situation. You have to ask: are these people prejudice through experience or upbringing? Did they hate Jews first, or only because of the experiences they had. </p>

<p>As someone who has been on the receiving end of much abuse, I can tell you that it is sometimes hard not to develop these prejudices. There definitely are a group of Jews who are using the internet to disseminate propaganda, as you have yourself acknowledged. I genuinely believe that much of the grey ground is occupied by people who have just (incorrectly) assumed that all Jews must be like the ones they have dealt with. And of course, once someone starts throwing the word Jew about, much is lost in the translation of whether they are talking about all Jews, or just some of them.</p>

<p>I can say with all honesty that several of the most helpful and encouraging people I have ever met in my life have been Jews. But at the same time, I&#39;m not going to deny the JIDF is becoming a real problem for the world.</p>

<p>I thought I was simply stating a fact. Do you disagree that what I described is occurring?</p>

<p>You&#39;re not really making much sense. It isn&#39;t really considered incendiary here to point out what the Israelis are like. We all pretty much agree they&#39;re crazy zealots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool.  Its not really an issue though unless you have very particular kinds of jobs within the system or if you travel to Israel.  They have crazy security and can and will even demand that you open up your notebook and to log them into your email.  Those people know too much and the whole place is basically a military-industrial security island in the Middle East.  They&#39;ve made themselves inseparable because technology (Intel technology for example) has been transfered to them that could not be transfered to anybody else (like not a fucking chance for China).  How it got that way is decades of doing but today far too many Western power brokers feel like the place must be beyond reproach.  If you follow the connections and ecosystem of the movie <em>Top Gun</em> then you will get an idea about what I&#39;m referring to.</p>

<p>What do you consider to be recent about the Israeli takeover?  It seems to me that simply their tools have evolved a bit more.  They&#39;ve been running the perception game since they came up with the Old Testament - a long time in business so to speak.  Though I&#39;ll admit that lately I&#39;m more fascinated with sexual theory and Hearthstone than conspiracies, Israel or any of their poop.</p>

<p>Are you familiar with the Overton Window? Basically there is a bound parameter on what is acceptable thought.</p>

<p>Not until you mentioned it. Fascinating. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In (real) politics you can be assured that everything will go according to your plan if you can remove the capability of the people to discuss or even think outside of the prescribed range.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely one hundred percent true. You can create a social stigma about positions which fall outside of your agreed spectrum, so that nobody ever wants to be associated with the labels you give to people holding those views (i.e. &quot;radicals&quot;, &quot;terrorists&quot; etc...) Kind of the modern political equivalent of &quot;The Emperor Has No Clothes&quot;. Hence, you can shut down dissent without ever even directly addressing it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I haven&#39;t studied Frank Zappa much but he has said some amazing things like &quot;politics is the entertainment department of the military-industrial complex&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Zappa was a complete legend. Some good clips still of him on Youtube disparaging the music industry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, so making it all celebrity contest between a handful of carnival standups</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a massively important point, because politics used to be party-centred. Now it is candidate-centred. Meanwhile, the thinking of the electorate is kept focused through the media upon only those topics deemed important and discussed by the candidates themselves, hence solidifying the fuck job. Like Herman and Chomsky said, consent is manufactured. Not consent about which way you vote or which opinion you take, but consent about which issues are important and which are to be ignored or propagandized.</p>
