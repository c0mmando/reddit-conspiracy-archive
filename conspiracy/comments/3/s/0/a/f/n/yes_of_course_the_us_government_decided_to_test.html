       <a href="/u/jesusloves_you">

       has information making me more scheptical about the source of the phenomena:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Trident II missiles have a red flame, and Russian ICBM's have a stunning blue flame that leaves a huge blue trail long after the missile is gone. And this ICBM had a stunning blue flame that left a glowing trail in the sky for 15 minutes after the launch. AND HERE IS THE KICKER: ITS TRAJECTORY APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN ONE THAT WOULD HAVE MADE IT GO OVER SIBERIA/RUSSIA AND INTO MAINLAND CHINA. Figure the odds for that one. America would not test fire an ICBM on a trajectory for Russia!"

       heres my problems with the missile explanation:
      </p>
      <p>
       dont missles cruise at about 30,000MPH?  so in the time that it was being filmed, if it were launched around LA, it would have been somewhere near the rocky mountains by the end of the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, why the hell would you practice launching missiles over LA?  theres a few thousand miles of coastline there.   did they have to do it over one of americas most populated cities?  that would be unsafe and they know it, even if the missile were inert.
      </p>
      <p>
       i dont know what is in that video, but the facts dont add up and it doesnt take a conspiracy theorist to see that.  and now all the posts are getting downvoted if they go against the official story.  something is not right here.

       Is it really any wonder? People would rather believe an official narative then an alien conspiracy theorist. Even if the facts dont add up, the majority of people start looking at you funny when you say ufo (even by its official meaning.) Plus all the smarties on reddit think it is impossible to go faster then the speed of light, even though technology folds and its not to farfetched to think we might break Einstein's theory of relativity, and someone already might of.

         dont missles cruise at about 30,000MPH? so in the time that it was being filmed, if it were launched around LA, it would have been somewhere near the rocky mountains by the end of the video.

       It was launched from the ocean, and stayed over the ocean the entire time. Since it literally went into space, it was visible from San Diego all the way up the coast line to San Francisco.

       I Was There™. We all saw it. The government lied at first about the Navy testing something for the FAA (according to local news about an hour after it occurred).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they're lying again. This was not a missile. It left a huge plume in the upper atmosphere that glowed like the aurora for several minutes. The effect wasn't well represented in the video but to the naked eye it was more prominent.
      </p>
      <p>
       At that distance the scale is wrong for anything like that - we're talking about something high up in the upper atmosphere to be seen in other states.  The scale of the missile to make a ball of light that size has to be staggering.  IMO it remains a UFO (by definition) and the government is lying (standard operating procedure) by taking responsibility in order to quell the inquiries.

       Why did LAX have to reroute their planes for a week or two prior though? Normally I'm not a skeptic, but in this case with LAX recieving notice weeks ahead of time and being documented makes me think this was just a missile test

       Range estimates of the anomaly are low-earth-orbit to have been witnessed in Arizona.  At that range, what man-made object is capable of displaying that kind of illumination?  What are the scales here, and how large would the object have to be?
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to watch our own rockets through telescopes to get a view of that size to the naked eye.  Also where's the contrail/smoke trail from such a rocket?  I'm leaning towards "maybe-a-military-space-craft", but how large would it need to be to satisfy the scale of what we saw?

       Sorry to disappoint, but I watched it with a perfect view on the road down from Big Bear (so no smog in the way), and it never disappeared. After the huge glow disappeared it continued on slowly as a faint light in the sky.

       Something like that I could believe as well.  We just don't know whether they've moved to the test phase of the

        Could this also be the practical effect of a solar sail being deployed to capture enough sunlight in order to power a scaled-up version of the now confirmed EM-Drive?  Would the microwave propulsion system account for the aurora-like plume left in its wake?

       now confirmed? Negative, they still believe it to be some kind of testing error producing the thrust as far as i've read, and i believe myself to be up to date on what i've been reading.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though they have reproduced the thrust effect, i believe what i read was that they have to recreate the experiments now on a different scale or something, because of the interference of the equipment during the testing, even though the testing has been confirmed by several different teams.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think the brit who created it is also releasing a paper on his teams newest findings soon

       Okay? Lol. You're right in the sense that I'm not a an employee at LAX so my knowledge isn't direct. But that's a lot of employees and low level ones too that would have to be going along with the lie that flight patterns were altered for at least a week before the incident. 
I'm not saying maybe the military isn't testing something other than a missile, but when they say they are going to be doing testing in the area where this happened way ahead of time doesn't that kind of end the argument? Unless you believe it's possible for thousands of regular LAX employees could be in on the lie

       Of course it doesn't end the argument! LAX is a major national economic interest. You don't seem to understand how important it is for the business world to be reassured that everything is in order. One does not simply delay air traffic for a week just for some random military lulz. The military does not disrupt civilian life as a rule. The military does not under any circumstances make it's presence known to the City of Los Angeles in major spectacular fashion. Stop insulting people.

       The only reason I find it weird, is Instagram is the social media platform for sharing pictures and short videos. But apparently it happens to hashtags that blow up, So I've been told by like 6 people. To stop spam and porn Bots.

       Why would they launch it without telling people? They have already changed there story at least twice, if it was a missile I don't see why they would do this. But if it was a missile, why would they do it over such a populated area and why was it seen in multiple states? And why were scientists claiming it was a meteor shower?

       It's a military operation. I don't know if you're so out of touch to understand this but the military does not tell civilians what they're going to be doing if they don't need to. Obviously no one was hurt by this and planes were diverted, as the told lax they needed to be at least a week ago. You have to practice somewhere in US territory and they decided San diego was going to be it. There was probably a reason why but we are not military and we aren't told because we don't need to know. As for why some scientists were claiming it to be a meteor it's the same reason as you guys claiming it's aliens or hyper drives or whatever the fuck you come up with everyone is just jumping to conclusions.

       A) Launches like this are classified, foreign powers would love the chance to document how this missile behaves on launch and afterwards. Since we don't want potential weaknesses in missiles found, we don't tell anyone when we're launching. (or in the case of LAX, the give a broad enough time frame so that they can keep people safe, but also not tip off anyone about what specifically is going on).
      </p>
      <p>
       B) It wasn't directly over a populated area, it was quite a ways off-shore, the Trident is an SLBM, or Submarine-Launched-Ballistic-Missile.
      </p>
      <p>
       C) Tridents maintain a low orbit for a few minutes after launch (about the same amount of time people from other states mentioned seeing this), and then it was probably detonated (minus the nuke of course).
      </p>
      <p>
       D) Scientists speculate, if they specialize in meteorological phenomena, they'll see meteorological phenomena, not missiles. It's the same idea of asking an oncologist if your symptoms for the common cold are cancer, chances are, being an oncologist, he'll think it's lung cancer or something.

       Makes me wonder if it was some sort of high-power ASAT or ABM. Those have an incredible delta V compared to conventional launches, because they're designed as interceptors. That would account for the ball of light. If so, this is either a dick-swinging contest to tell the Russians and/or Chinese to back off, or it was a necessary launch and we just dodged WWIII for a little while. We'll probably never know.

       Riiiight, b/c the U.S. Is/are the bad guys in all situations and when they're not they caused the situation to begin with and international politics and history aren't complicated and confusing and I saw/read some things that totally makes me see everything for what it is!
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: forgot I was on the conspiracy theory sub. If you have a such a big problem with me saying international politics is complicated and history greater than what's just happened in te last 50 years can still affect today, then I'm just at a loss for words. And obviously when you're the most powerful nation in the world you'll have the greatest impact on the world and it's easy to look at all the bad things someone had done and forget all the good things someone had done. Sheesh, compared to Great Britain and Europe the US is nothing. The U.S. Has been having to deal with the shit Europe created for a long time. Maybe if Europe didn't rape and pillage just about everywhere on earth we wouldn't be in this mess. At the same time, maybe we'd be worse off than we are now!

       They aren't. The Russians can't be blamed for Ukraine because that was a coup on their strongest ally. In Georgia they were defending their ally, and Syria? They've been allies for decades and U.S funded rebels come rolling in. Stalin of course was an exception and attacked several countries to expand communism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only country China tried to take anyone over was Vietnam, and that was mainly due to the fact that they were promised the land by the Allies during ww2.

       So firing a missile near their own coast is supposed to scare Russia and China? Both who have no intention nor the capability to attack the Usa in any sustained fashion.

       dudes got pics and it looked like it was just outside the city.

       But then, full discloser, we heard that similar and maybe more intense phenomenon were seen in LA. At first consideration, no one would think that they are witnessing the same thing, I mean LA is 400 miles away. However, it's
       <em>

       an easier conclusion to believe that the incidents were related and not just a coincidence.

       My wildest hypothesis is that it was a wormhole opening in a fixed point in space.  Given the earth's rotation (~1000mph) in relation to the anomaly it would give ground-viewers the illusion of movement.  But then someone would have to confirm if the rotation is in the right direction because I lack the data myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also what kinds of measurable effects would there be to confirm this?  I'd hoped to get more out-of-the-box thinking in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately all of the phenomena must be taken into account to give an explanation but the missile excuse is 100% bullshit.  But we already know the US government has no credibility.

       If it were a wormhole that was fixed in space and you wanted to account for the rotation of the earth, you'd have to account for the movement of the earth around the sun, the sun around the galaxy, etc., which doesn't work out. What if we say the wormhole appeared in the sky but began orbiting the earth? Well, it looks like it has a similar velocity to the ISS, but considering the expansion of the smoke cloud, it would've needed a lot of explosion power to have made that, assuming that it is indeed at LEO (low earth orbit). Honestly, I'd believe it was the ISS that blew up before I went ahead and said it was a wormhole.

       fixed space? Okay you realize our solar system alone is moving over 20,000 meters per second and I don't even know how fast the rest of our galaxy is moving against the background of space but... No. If something exists in fixed space it passes by (or through) earth almost instantly so.

       sorry for coming off as a dick but I was just defensive cause I thought you were trying to spread disinformation. But if you just wanna brainstorm theories then mine is that this was a top secret government fighter craft that posses the ability to enter low earth orbit and re-enter the atmosphere multiple times. That's why I believe air traffic has been diverted for a week before this and all in a straight flight path from the mid pacific to over California and Arizona  from 30,000 feet to 100,000 feet. This could also be a missile like the official story states but something feels off about this one I think.

       No offense taken, its reddit and I've got a thick skin.  BTW I like your hypothesis better than mine now.  You're taking into account other observed data and correlating.  Another reason I love this sub.

       The question remains, at that altitude how big does the fireball (light or engine trail) have to be?  What is the scale of the craft?

       Okay, but an attack by whom and to what end-goal?  To any established state this would be suicide.  What then?  The Norks?  Don't think so, we already got Kim working with us behind the scenes.  A drunk Lt. in Guam even once told me we're working with the Norks and the evidence for this is out there.

       It's absolutely far-fetched, but having seen it with my own eyes it's not like the behavior of the missile videos.  There was no boost-phase trail whatsoever.  It just appeared, which is why at first I wondered if a satellite had burned up and it's fuel exploded; the more I think about that it makes no sense either.  A proper explanation must take into account all of the observed phenomena.

       Trident II missiles have a red flame, and Russian ICBM's have a stunning blue flame that leaves a huge blue trail long after the missile is gone. And this ICBM had a stunning blue flame that left a glowing trail in the sky for 15 minutes after the launch. AND HERE IS THE KICKER: ITS TRAJECTORY APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN ONE THAT WOULD HAVE MADE IT GO OVER SIBERIA/RUSSIA AND INTO MAINLAND CHINA. Figure the odds for that one. America would not test fire an ICBM on a trajectory for Russia!

       What nonsense is this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its blue because it was the 3rd stage igniting, burning fuel high in nitrates. It was at 6pm, and given that it was in its 3rd stage, pretty damn high up. Sunset in LA is at 5:07pm on the ground but not at 250km (Trident spec Sheet - Burnout of 2nd Stage, Trident D-5 @ 250km, velocity at separation 4.5km/ps)
      </p>
      <p>
       Sunlight reflects off nitrates giving a blue glow, the same way the sky is blue due to the nitrogen in the atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I don't have the exact flight ballistics of a Trident II missile in front of me obviously :D, so feel free to correct me if you know otherwise.

       It is a rocket, if you noticed the beginning of the ploom is skinnier then it starts getting bigger. This is because the rocket is leaving the atmosphere and the the plume can no longer stay together due to the vacuum. The reason it is so bright is because that's it's so high up that it beat the sunset. Keep in mind it happened right after the sun went over the horizon

       That Titan V is gorgeous, thanks for sharing.  I'd already looked it up for comparison earlier.  But sadly that is not what we saw last night.  Not even close.

       The object we witnessed was not traversing the sky at that speed.  Also it left a trail distinct and dissimilar to the rockets we see today.  edit: grammar

       It's because it's all based on perspective, those shots are perpendicular to the flight path, at least somewhat. From Arizona it just looked like a big circular haze; that is because we are behind its flight path

       in

        Florida

       , this tweeter could not have possiblly had
       <strong>
        any
       </strong>
       angle on last night's event.  I think you got caught in a troll-trap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nor does his posted video even remotely compare to what we saw off the west coast
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       <strong>
        over the ocean
       </strong>
       leaving
       <strong>
        absolutely zero rocket trail
       </strong>
       in it's wake as it tacked northwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       What it did leave in it's wake appeared to be some kind of ionized plume with a distinct glow that was more brilliant to the naked eye than the camera.  Nothing like the tweet video you posted above which is very clearly a rocket-trail.

       Just going to throw this out there: What if you are looking at it from a much more extreme angle behind the rocket as it flies away from the camera?  It would cause it to look very different from that sharp perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if the sun had just set, once the rocket got high enough, the rocket trail would seem to glow like it did because it would be catching the last rays of light from the sun at the higher altitude. When it transitions from what looks like a traditional rocket fireball to  the blue plume, it has probably reached that point in the atmosphere where the sunlight is still hitting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows though, just a thought.

        At that distance the scale is wrong for anything like that - we're talking about something high up in the upper atmosphere to be seen in other states. The scale of the missile to make a ball of light that size has to be staggering.
       </p>

      <p>
       That's just not true at all and you clearly have no idea what you're talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       It looks exactly like the exhaust being lit but by the sun from any other ballistic missile/rocket. Obviously it would be seen in other states.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cloud of exhaust expands and is incredibly high in the atmosphere. Obviously it would be seen across a large area around the west coast, have you ever seen a video of a rocket launch?

       Lol besides the countless videos that anyone can watch on youtube, I actually did see it in person from San Diego.

       But whether seeing it through video or in person, it's still pretty obvious to even a layperson that the event was consistent with a missile in the upper atmosphere.

       Obviously there would be a boost-phase rocket trail and you still don't get LEO do you?  We're talking 64-100 miles away at that size and brilliance would no longer be visible to the naked eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this was simply a 2nd stage of a missile it would not have been visible in Phoenix.  By the time that missile had reached the altitude to have line of sight on Nevada and Arizona it would already appear so small they wouldn't have even taken notice.

       Show me a single video of a rocket launch that has a visible rocket trail at night once it reaches significant altitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       The missile itself may be small to the naked eye but those gases expand very quickly and their brilliance is due to them being lit up by the sun against a pitch black sky.

       Rockets all leave trails in every phase.  A missile small enough to leave no visible trail is also not visible at altitude.  This was no missile.  This was no rocket.

       The trail is not going to be visible unless the sun is reflecting off of it. Once it reached sufficient altitude you started to be able to see the trail, especially once the second stage activated and the brilliant blue light reflected off the nitrates.
      </p>

       Making it look just like the Atlas V rocket in the video I'm sure you've already seen.

       The missile very clearly goes through all the different motions of a simulated test. Independent warhead launches and everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       It looks exactly like a SLBM. How do you possibly explain all those matching manoeuvres consistent with a Trident II?

       Nah dude it was a test missile. UFO's are cover up stories from the 50's and 60's when they were developing spy drones and misdirected people and other governments to think of UFO's (aliens visiting from another planet).

       Ufos are essentially either drones, test drones, military balloons, experiments, missiles or something military. So yea unidentified objects, I give you that but not aliens like men in black aliens was what I was debunking in my opinion.

       You know what I mean, for the most part it's always in the coasts or in Nevada/Arizona/New Mexico or places like in Marfa, Texas, always around military installations or border areas where drones are used for spying, etc.

       The stupid thing is to believe in ufos (in that I mean Men In Black little aliens from another planet hovering around doing a light show for humans, c'mon now, I'm a free thinker but these events are military in nature.)

       I was sitting on the beach in Carlsbad, San Diego CA. with a group of friends and we saw the entire spectacle from start to finish. I have a long video I took shot with my phone that I have yet to post. Other people around us were initially amazed as to what we were observing, but after the it continued to streak through the sky for over a minute or so, people started getting in their cars preparing to leave. The streaking light looked like it was about to fizzle out and disappear, and suddenly after it had been streaking through the sky for over 2 and a half minutes, it seemed as though it "exploded" and began to emit a bright blueish-green light. At this point many people around us had felt as if it was unsafe to stay, and the parking lot cleared out fast. This expanding bright light soon expanded to fill a large amount of the sky before it began to disappear. From the perspective that we had, the light originated from the south-west of us. Although it was likely hundreds of miles away, the scale of whatever this was made it seem like it was not too far offshore. The entire event lasted around 3-4 minutes, yet the residual glow in the sky hung around for quite a while afterwards.

       No, but that is normal behavior for meteors.  As they break up they expose different elements closer to their core.  This causes a shift in tail color.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looked like a meteor to me.  I wanted it to be an alien craft or something else cool but really it's pretty benign.  Unless it's some secret military tech.  Rockets don't look like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no doubt the navy was also testing something.....HMM.  perhaps the navy was testing shooting at meteors with lasers?  This would be a great way to keep population centers safe from any airborn threat, yet the population would freak out over testing.  They would also freak out if they knew they were under threat to begin with.  Keeping quiet causes the least amount of damage (riots).  Let the public  know years later they were saved from a catastrophic meteor threat? makes sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also why it's a global event.  Meteors don't give a shit where they land.  Which also syncs up with the meteor shower we're getting over the next month...

       We were sitting on the top of the carlsbad bluffs right on the beach in North County SD. It was an exceptionally clear evening/night so the viewing conditions were ideal. My buddy saw the light as it was rising over the horizon (far offshore where there are no land masses). Would make sense if it was a projectile launched from a submarine... but I've done quite a bit of research and have yet to find any sort of reasonable speculation that I am content with.

       I don't doubt it for one second. We were watching this glow expand very rapidly. We decided to leave our viewing location when it seemed as though this radiating glow had grown large enough that it reached the ocean.

       I saw it here in south Los Angeles, close to Orange County and it took up a huge space.  It tore up the fucking sky.  You could probably have fit about 100 suns in the space it took up.

       If it is just cell phone footage, he may be waiting to see if it is even needed. There is is relatively clear and stable footage shot from DSLRs above the city, would any one want to watch a cell phone video instead? Maybe he should hold onto it to upload after the event has been purged from the internet, or something.

       Serious question - Do we not have enough spottings or videos to deduce the general area where it passed over the coastline?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems easy if we just start with "witnesses in Cities-XYZ saw it in the southern sky", and "witnesses in Cities-ABC saw it in the northern sky" and work from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously it'd be good to have some shots from multiple locations that show the angle/distance from the horizon to get a little more scientific, but it'd be good to know where this actually passed over considering a lot of the discussion that I'm seeing is about whether it's safe to run a "test" like this over a population center.

This was also declared a missile,

       It looks like the Russians did an ICBM launch from a submarine, right in the middle of U.S. war games off the California coast.

       From what some missile experts are saying, blue flame is Russia/China, red flame is US. I also read somewhere that the LAX closure was new security measures that were put in place after China's 2010 launch off the coast of San Nicholas island went undetected initially by NORAD.

       Yeah, I know the official story, I'm local to SoCal...I'm just not buying it. Firing off missile tests from Vandenberg are very common and this was nothing like that. Also, this is the 2nd time in 5 years we've had a missile launch off the coast that was unannounced.

       I'm not buying it either as I stated throughout my post, but most of my comments got downvoted for stating so and for pointing out that there were
       <em>
        multiple
       </em>
       conflicting stories near the beginning of the reports. Definitely thinking there are plants in these threads trying to corral discussion. I'm more interested in what this person had to say:

       It was a big deal when it happened. There was speculation that it was the Chinese who fired it off but I had Naval Commander from Magu that I met (who I asked right after it happened) swear up and down that it was not the Chinese.  It still didn't convince me.

       Thanks for sharing the source.  Would it be fair to say the two events are not comparable in terms of witnessed phenomena?  I certainly don't see any comparisons and have also witnessed missile launches in California as far back as the early 2000's when they were testing out the anti-ballistic missile system.

       The one last night looked different than the one from 2010.  Although people have gone to great lengths to debunk it (supposedly AA flight 808 from Hawaii), other experts have said that it appeared to be an ICBM. The one last night was supposed to be a Trident II.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one last night definitely was higher profile, everyone seemed to notice it. The one from 2010 was launched at dusk and was harder to see.

       They issued Twitter messages and such telling people not to be alarmed or call authorities.  This is a routine reliability test conducted from a missile testing base well north of LA.  It was visible in Arizona and Nevada so avoiding being in sight of populated areas is not going to happen.

       I meant that the operation was based out of said testing ground.  Also, depending on the point of origin and direction (I haven't seen specifics on either) that's hardly impossible given that the range on that type of missile is over 4,000 miles.  Say bullshit all you want if it makes you confident it wasn't a missile test and that's somehow important to you though.  What motivation the military would have for lying about this I can't imagine.  They warned LAX and notified the public so it's not like it was a big secret.

       Someone else commented that they saw it from SD.  It was visible as far away as Arizona and Nevada, I just wonder if it was traveling south from these points south of LA as that would make more sense and it certainly has the range.

       What, should they have used a bullhorn, the emergency broadcast system?  There are only so many ways to tell people and this is after all a normal test activity.  The only reason they announced it as much as they did is so local police and such wouldn't be swamped with calls.

       The emergency broadcast system? Not an emergency.  Did they tell news stations?  I don't know, many wouldn't have cared and only the largely un-watched local news would be in a position to report it.  How many people still watch local news on network TV?  Also, the timing of these tests are classified so they may not have wanted to announce it until the day of the test, not leaving enough time for TV news.

       It's definitely a missile of some sort. Look, I love UFOs but this same exact type of missile was tested by the Chinese as well:

       Keep in mind that U.S. forces may be doing a huge whitewash right now, they are claiming it was ours, but I think that would be expected to keep Americans from panicking.
      </p>
      <p>
       One minute before America was supposed to test fire a Trident, Russia fires theirs in close proximity to where America's was supposed to launch from. What would this mean? It would mean: We can break your encryption, know what you were going to do, hide from you right where you are looking and do it on your own schedule! I would not be surprised if that is what really went on. That would be quite the chess board.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if this missile really was American, the fact one got fired at all, at $31 million a pop for the type claimed, would send an ominous message. And what was the schedule for these war games? Not on the drawing board before that shoot down over Egypt.

       That video is comparing the missile in launch to the object in Low earth orbit. Video is completely useless, different time of day, different altitude, different stage. Of course a missile in LEO is going to look different than a missile in launch.

       You could see the damn thing for thousands of miles in every direction, it wasn't local to LA.  If it happened over Florida instead of CA, nobody would have even bothered making a video, they're used to seeing these launches.  Vandenberg launched one of these under similar circumstances /time of day (Earth in shadow, rocket plume illuminated by sunlight) a couple years ago and it caused the exact same threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows why they were firing this missile when they did, maybe it was just a test. Seems like the "Just a missile test" after the fact is a bit sketchy, they've announced tests like this in the past ahead of time, but no idea if that's normal or abnormal.

       The story that the Navy disclosed is that was a test of a submarine-launched ICBM. In a real nuclear war, you don't have two weeks to prepare to fire the missile at a certain time, you have 10 seconds, so the exact time of the launch likely wasn't told to the crew of the submarine until minutes before it was time for liftoff.
      </p>
      <p>
       LAX was told to divert flights from the area during the  week-long window they expected to conduct the test, but giving more information would have removed the sense of surprise/urgency that make the test of crew readiness and missile systems valuable.

       Interesting story, my brother and family came to my house this morning to visit (mostly to see my 3MO daughter) and I mention "did you see the video of the UFO last night??"
      </p>
      <p>
       So naturally I play it on my tv and they start freaking out. We live in Las Vegas. They said last night around 6:00 pm they saw this directly overhead! They were super confused and weirded out at the time. My sister in law told their youngest daughter "it must be a helicopter" so as to not freak her out, even though they couldn't see it or hear anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       They said it looked EXACTLY like that, like a bright light shining through clouds (even though there are no clouds in sight last night). They said it lasted a minute or so then disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could this be the same event? They didn't say a direction of travel only that it was DIRECTLY overhead... Not west like the LA one

       That's not the problem. It's testing missiles at night, when everyone can see it, and not telling them about it. Do you understand how that would cause panic?

       Exactly my point, why wouldn't the public be warned that they are performing tests? Even if everything is true and it is just a test rocket, imagine what could have happened if people freaked out? Why do we never hear about test rockets until the next day?

       Because people typically don't panic because of something like this... Case in point.. this test happened and the public who saw it filmed it and put it online and nobody went running for their doomsday bunkers or started jamming up the highways trying to escape.  Why?  Because it looks like a missile test and other people are too busy filming it thinking they are seeing ET and that doesn't scare anyone into a panic either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now what happens if they announce ahead of time that they are going to be doing a missile launch test?  Thousands of online bloggers and Alex Jones start stirring up a story that this isn't just a test or that the reason they are running this test is because something BIG is about to happen with Russia, etc.  There is more chance of causing a panic that way because now you've given people time to think about what's
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       happening.  There is no way to go about doing something like this correctly because there will always be a contingent of people who don't believe what they are being told no matter what.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look what happened when they announced the Jade Helm training exercises.... It was months of people being convinced that the government was going to have troops pop out of abandoned Wal Marts and shoot them or round them up into FEMA camps.

       It's interesting how the immediate response to an unpopular opinion to shut down the discussion. Like global warming or undisclosed government covert operations or abuse of LBGT members of the military or evidence of police brutality and miscarriage of justice against minorities (Not trying to say these are necessarily equal but correlated in media coverage/government response and the resulting action)

       I saw the entire thing from start to finish while on the beach in San Diego. Had I been informed and aware that this was some sort of military testing, I wouldn't have minded it. Heck, I probably would have made plans to be exactly where I was, when it was expected to be launched so I could observe it. But nobody knew anything about what was happening. It induced a state of panic within many people around us. I know people who saw it nearby in Oceanside and they immediately called the police and locked themselves inside their homes.

       The launches are classified, if the Russians/Chinese were able to gather data on how the missile behaved, they could work towards exploiting vulnerabilities in the missile, and given that the Trident is an important second-strike (I think) weapon, knowing weaknesses in it's design would give them an advantage if there ever was a war where second-strike capabilities were necessary.

         Russia or China fired the missile at us as a warning to the US government, and the Navy is claiming responsibility to cover it up.

      </ol>
      <p>
       If I could just find the exact time the LAX flight rerouting order for this week was issued, and compare that to the missile time, then that'd be very telling. If the LAX order came after the missile, that would imply a reaction, which would imply #2 to be true.

       - missiles aren't angry tweets that nations fire at each other in casual fashion, just to get their attention.  Any such act by any nation would provoke a swift and severe response.  Being we're not ashes by now suggests Robert J. Oppenheimer is still right: that the very destructiveness of nuclear weapons makes war between nuclear-nations obsolete.

       Something is not right. I watch some asian live news channels all the time and this kind of big news is always covered by the media but I dont see or hear anything about this event from the media. It is all over the internet but none of the asian news channels cover this story. WTH is going on?

       Adding to the sea of comments. Am I the first to think that these rockets are space ships baling out on earth to colonize some other planet? They fessed up to having a working microwave engine. We could only imagine the tech they have behind the scenes. Moore's law and all that.

       What ever you want to call tptb they must have decided to go for it because WW3 is probably gonna kick off and if it doesn't, climate change will give us a solid fucking.

       SO, any readers of American Kabuki here?  A.K. had been delayed posting anew, but it came out today, in relation to the Missile launch.  Two missiles were launched  from the base underneath malibu, ca, and both were intercepted, through a joint S.A. (sphere alliance) and Earth Based military (US navy submarine) effort.  The one Missile that did make it out, and turned towards the East, was said to have the potential to make it To Central US targets, although aimed at the eastern seaboard, based on Trajectory.  The Base underneath Malibu was an advanced medical base, wherein replacement parts were cloned for "Public Figures" (This is where Hitlary's new retina was "growed" after her little 'plane accident" in IRAN, years back.  WOW it ALL REALLY is coming out now!

       All missiles launched generally have a self-destruct sequence if they veer too off course. NASA's manned rockets are included in this in case it looks like it might explode over a populated area.

       They happen routinely; the missiles are obviously not armed, and "next to" is a relative term when you're talking about missiles that are basically in low-earth orbit.  Submarine was somewhere off the coast of California, and the missile was visible across the whole coast and inland quite a ways.

       They would care because we're currently in a proxy war with them. We're flexing our muscles showing them that we're armed and ready for anything they might throw at us. Why else would they test it in front of people, every other US Military "test" is done in secrecy, let alone in direct view of 3.8 million people

       The Russians aren't interested in launching an offensive against the continental US.  They are simply trying to fight terrorism in the middle east, as we are no longer interested in doing so.

       I never said they wanted to launch an offensive as of now that doesn't make any sense. All I'm saying is Russia is protecting it's interests in Syria, something the U.S. has spent years, and billions of dollars trying to destroy, I'd be a pissed-off-putin.

       I don't know man I'm just brainstorming. With all the stuff that's been going on and the US having their noses in so many different places something is bound to get jacked up. When you take a step back and look at the big picture this is just another tally on the "what the fuck is happening" table.

       They and China are having a dick measuring contest. You know who goes to war? The USA and China in the  Fallout universe. Some use ICBM nukes on each other. I'm sure Bethesda payed them both for an elaborate PR stunt that would totally be practical to advertise a videogame. There'll be a video released any day after the Fallout 4 release where Obama and his cabinet are partying with the Chinese commie leadership decide to combine our nation's together. It ain't world peace but its a nice step towards it. One can dream.
      </p>

       Edit: I take my downvotes graciously. If anyone can't tell, I really want to play Fallout 4.

       They aren't. The Russians can't be blamed for Ukraine because that was a coup on their strongest ally. In Georgia they were defending their ally, and Syria? They've been allies for decades and U.S funded rebels come rolling in. Stalin of course was an exception and attacked several countries to expand communism.

       The only country China tried to take anyone over was Vietnam, and that was mainly due to the fact that they were promised the land by the Allies during ww2.

       The one last night looked different than the one from 2010.  Although people have gone to great lengths to debunk it (supposedly AA flight 808 from Hawaii), other experts have said that it appeared to be an ICBM. The one last night was supposed to be a Trident II.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one last night definitely was higher profile, everyone seemed to notice it. The one from 2010 was launched at dusk and was harder to see.

       - missiles aren't angry tweets that nations fire at each other in casual fashion, just to get their attention.  Any such act by any nation would provoke a swift and severe response.  Being we're not ashes by now suggests Robert J. Oppenheimer is still right: that the very destructiveness of nuclear weapons makes war between nuclear-nations obsolete.
