       It reads more like a rant that a professor fantasizes about giving than anything real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it gives the SJW community too much credit. Yes they want to tear down intuitions, but they have no idea what they want to create to replace them.

       I believe you are misinformed. "Tearing down institutions" is their ostensible goal. The real goal is obtaining power. It's cultural marxism, tearing down traditional power structures to put themselves in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been orchestrated by the elites. Divide and conquer. Destroy the nuclear family and sense of community. Get people feeling isolated and scared so they are easier to control.
      </p>
      <p>
       SJW's are Orwellian censors and are a cancer to a free and open society.

       Yes. They want to get everyone tip-toeing around terrified that anything they say or do might offend someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       We haven't got real political radicalism anymore. What we now have is cultural radicalism which is, in some ways, even worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there's a bit of a victim mentality in play as well. "Oh, I've just been offended... now the world has to either compensate me or change things so I'll feel better."

       "Power isn't something someone gives you; it's something you take."
      </p>
      <p>
       The victim mentality is to demand that someone GIVE you power. Rather than you accruing it yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like some aging Hollywood actress complaining, "Hollywood is sexist. They don't write good parts for women."
      </p>
      <p>
       Excuse me, but write your own script! It's not anyone else's job to write for you. I've never in my life heard a man say, "Women are evil. Why won't women write good scripts for men?"
      </p>
      <p>
       No, men write their own scripts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like Zach Galafiniakis. With his career in limbo, he wrote "The Hangover" and boom: He enters the A-list.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or Matt Damon. Relegated to character roles, he writes "Good Will Hunting" and bang: Academy Award-nomination and A-list fame.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've got to write your own ticket. Create your own vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lucille Ball did. From a B-actress with dwindling parts, she decided to start her own production company and became fabulously rich. Her company, Desilu, produced "Star Trek" as well as dozens of other top-ten hits like "I Love Lucy," "The Danny Thomas Show," "The Dick Van Dyke Show," "My Favorite Martian," "Andy Griffith," "Gomer Pyle," etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       She didn't wait for "some man" to make her a Hollywood player. She did it herself. (And it was possible even in the 1950s.)
      </p>
      <p>
       So don't whine to me in 2015 that "some man" should be responsible for your success.
      </p>
      <p>
       That you should be able to sit back and have some other person
       <em>
        hand
       </em>
       you power.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Power isn't something someone gives you; it's something you take."
      </p>
      <p>
       This lesson of initiative and enterprise is one that modern comedienne Amy Schumer took to heart when, like her male counterparts, she wrote her own script--and her own ticket into fame and success.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately this zeitgeist extends beyond the field of gender and stretches into the domain of racial politics, where there is a certain type of professional race-hustler who thrives off of teaching that lesson: That it's not up to Minority Group X to achieve their own success; it's up to the host population to grant them power. To hand over positions based on tokenism and quotas.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Power is something that White Society will give us."
      </p>
      <p>
       No, my race-pimp friend! Power is something you take.
      </p>
      <p>
       You make your own communities vibrant and economically successful. You don't wait around for hand-outs, subsidies and entitlements.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word "entitlement" is the watch-word.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an attitude of entitlement. That someone else is on the hook for doing for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       That someone else
       <em>
        owes
       </em>
       you. And that
       <em>
        they're
       </em>
       responsible for your success [or your failures] rather than you having the power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The single greatest racist propaganda making the rounds today is that "You're powerless. It's up to Whitey to give you power. You're dependent on him."
      </p>
      <p>
       That's designed to keep minorities subordinate, disengaged--weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say this as a Hispanic-American. Anyone who tries to tell me that I have no power and that my fate is dependent on some benevolent Outsider can go suck an egg.
      </p>
      <p>
       That person is a racist, and is bent on keeping me dependent and cut off from my true potential.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whoever waits around for someone else to "do for them" will be waiting around their whole lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not how the world works.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want a dynamite script for women? Write your own damned script!
      </p>
      <p>
       You want more women in science? Then enter a scientific field rather than signing up for the gender studies course:

        http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2015/06/stemwomen.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You should be the change you want to see in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is on the hook for "doing for you". That's a slave's mentality. It's the gospel of dependence.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, the first lesson of growing up: You have to provide for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my point of view: So-called Political Correctness is an ideology based on division. It's rooted in Divide and Conquer, where one portion of the American public is pitted against the other. Told they're
       <em>
        owed
       </em>
       . Conditioned to think they're "entitled". And that it's up to someone else  to "do for you". It's a toxic creed. A negativistic ideology. And one not designed to "teach a man to fish for life" but to beg for a fish for a single day. To not be independent, but dependent. To not be strong, but weak. It doesn't call out the best in us and spotlight our similarities; but it dwells on our differences, and amps up hatred based on dissimilarities. It divides; it doesn't unite. It preaches to young girls, blacks, gays and anyone else that they're permanent victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's the thing: Once you've brainwashed someone into thinking they're a victim, you've trained them to be powerless. Dependent.

       Excellent post and I agree with most, if not all, of what you said. As an ordinary person, I feel like political correctness/SJW's etc. are a toxic influence on society. They mean well for the most part, but there are some who are twisting thins as a means of advancing their own personal agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a conspiracy theorist, I can't help but wonder if this is a deliberate effort towards social engineering. Ever wonder why some societies have values that remain consistent from one generation to the next? Is there something wrong with that? If so, where does the attitude that "constant change is good" come from anyways?
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, social attitudes are like fashion. What looks good one decade seems ridiculous 20 years later. I think people in the future are going to look at today's idea of political correctness and wonder what the fuck were we thinking about.

       This is a psy op to change how people interact (online and in academic settings). It's very similar to the zionist campaign that has been run for the past century.

       This brand of 3rd wave feminism has been coopted by the same zionists who make up the new atheism movement (the people who shout down opposing political positions as "anti-science").
      </p>
      <p>
       The SJW movement is about censorship online and in academic settings.  It uses the same tactics of self imposed victimization as zionism (all injustices can be justified by the holocaust and all criticism is anti-semitic).  It's a great way to brainwash a group and get them to adhere to the narcissism of their own cause.  Social justice is no longer about protecting the rights of the marginalized and abused from the injustices of colonialism.  It's now about creating bubbles to protect people's inflated and conflicted egos.

       The zionists will use the movement against the muslims, arabs, africa and eastern europe by introducing international legislation against countries who don't protect women and transgender rights (this is an excuse, of course- not the real purpose of the legislation).
      </p>
      <p>
       This will also be a part of shifting language into newspeak as computers learn natural language processing.

       The amazing thing is that the whole lefty politically-correct "squeaky wheel" is this
       <em>
        miniscule
       </em>
       minority of people-- and the whole of their power is in making sure the normals don't realize it.
      </p>
      <p>
       To that end, the internet is the seeds of their destruction.  Communication is destruction for these people-- they simply won't be able to survive when 99.9% of the people realize that this whole progressive wave-- which got started when there were 3 network gatekeepers to decide the news-- is complete bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's time to go back to normal now.  The real question is, is the majority mad enough about the last 60+ years of bullshit to hang people from streetlights or not.

       Can I ask your reasoning for making these posts as self.posts, where your only text is a link to an article? I've seen you do it quite a bit, and I'm not sure why, as reddit's default functionality is as a link-sharing site.

       You may! I do this for a number of reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Self posts gain no link karma.
      </p>
      <p>
       An extremely important feature of reddit used to be that the
       <em>
        actual up and down votes themselves
       </em>
       used to be visible. A while back they changed it so you can only see the end result.
      </p>
      <p>
       So a post with 1 upvote and 1 downvote looks exactly the same as a post with 1000 upvotes and 1000 downvotes (obviously two
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       different scenarios).
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result, vote brigading has become even
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       rampant, because there's no way to really tell if something fishy is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I no longer post for link karma now. It's a farce. I'm not interested in participating in that aspect of reddit anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the strength of communities like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is in our discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all too easy to head straight to the article and bypass the comment section altogether. Making it a self post forces people to come here
       <em>
        first
       </em>
       and be exposed to the discussion here before they head over to the article.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I have time (I didn't today), I often paste the entire article (with sources) into the comment section.
      </p>
      <p>
       This also encourages discussion and further user participation, plus it makes the material more presentable by displaying the information without the various ads/blogspam that many sites (understandably) use to keep themselves afloat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope that answers your question!

       Here's an upvote.  I think you make a good point.  Personally, I think I would enjoy being called whitey if someone felt like doing so.  I think then I would know exactly how they felt and how I should treat them.  Things would no longer be fuzzy rather crystal clear, pure as the whitest snow.
