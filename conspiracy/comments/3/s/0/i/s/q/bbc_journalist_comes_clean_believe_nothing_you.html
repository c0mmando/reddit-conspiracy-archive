    <div class="md"><p>Watched SNL live last night.</p>

<p>First time watching television in years.</p>

<p>SNL news desk skit comes up.</p>

<p>Black woman ranting about white men being man-bitches and effiminate.</p>

<p>Next part of the skit has a graphic &quot;Burning more coal&quot;</p>

<p>Then we cut to commercial.</p>

<p>A series of ads for television shows and movies all with one concurrent theme: white men as racist cucks.</p>

<p>The mind programming is real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the same issue i have with the new daily show with Trevor Noah.  I gave him an honest chance, and for the first couple of episodes i enjoyed the show. They gave the kid some time to get accustomed to the show, and the audience getting comfortable with a new host. After about a week it got really really propagandist.  I would call myself pretty liberal in the sense of the word. Being liberal to me means you dont snuff opinions because they are different from yours, you open up your mind and accept a reason for a rationale whether you believe it or not, any intelligent individual can understand where the opinion comes from. The daily show with Trevor Noah is a democratic platform to bolster Hilary Clinton and demonize every and any conservitive idea. Mixed with white male shaming from the plethora of &quot;minorities&quot; the show seems to NEED in order to be progressive.</p>

<p>The nightly show or what ever the garbage is called is even worse. I watched one episode and couldn&#39;t believe how much white shaming was going on. You want to blame your issues on someone you&#39;ve never met because of the color of their skin? You are a racist, and it is extremely evident in these two shows. Its disgusting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man -- I couldn&#39;t agree more with everything you said. I was born in 90 and started watching Stewart since I was a teenager, before I knew what any of the stuff he was discussing really was, and I just liked him because he made funny faces and made me laugh. He also shit over conservatives, which over time I began to accept and identify with.</p>

<p>Years and years later as a 20+ year old I found myself spouting the same type of shit his show advocates, and when someone truly questioned my rationale, even in a non-confrontational manner, I just dismissed them as Stewart encourages. I supported the candidates he talked about in a good manner, and hated the ones the he lambasted. I didn&#39;t even know I was being propagandized, because he does it so well.</p>

<p>Years later, I started going down the rabbit hole. 9/11, you know the gist. For me, it illuminated that what The Daily Show is was just the alternative to Fox News, for young people. It is a propaganda mechanism just like MSNBC, just like Fox, and they each have their targeted demographic. You&#39;re totally right about The Nightly Show too -- that show helped me realize how fucking awful they are, because unlike Stewart, Larry has no fucking subtlety, and his show doesn&#39;t even try to hide the fact that they are blatantly biased towards just about every liberal talking point. I know to many this seems obvious, but those people have to understand that I really loved Stewart, and he was one of my heroes for about a decade. So to uncover this truth was really hard to accept for me, and it&#39;s good to know there are others out there like myself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey! I answered this in another thread yesterday, so I&#39;ll just copy my response:</p>

<p>Self posts gain no link karma. </p>

<p>An extremely important feature of reddit used to be that the <em>actual up and down votes themselves</em> used to be visible. A while back they changed it so you can only see the end result.</p>

<p>So a post with 1 upvote and 1 downvote looks exactly the same as a post with 1000 upvotes and 1000 downvotes (obviously two <em>very</em> different scenarios).</p>

<p>As a result, vote brigading has become even <em>more</em> rampant, because there&#39;s no way to really tell if something fishy is going on.</p>

<p>I no longer post for link karma now. It&#39;s a farce. I&#39;m not interested in participating in that aspect of reddit anymore.</p>

<p>Also, the strength of communities like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is in our discussions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all too easy to head straight to the article and bypass the comment section altogether. Making it a self post forces people to come here <em>first</em> and be exposed to the discussion here before they head over to the article.</p>

<p>When I have time (I didn&#39;t today), I often paste the entire article (with sources) into the comment section.</p>

<p>This also encourages discussion and further user participation, plus it makes the material more presentable by displaying the information without the various ads/blogspam that many sites (understandably) use to keep themselves afloat.</p>

<p>Hope that answers your question!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought the overall media enviornment have been alot healthier these days. Yes you have the old establishment like cnn cnbc rupert&#39;s whores etc,  but equally so on the otherside like RT,  xinhua,  al jazerra,  redit conspy (:)) etc. As long as people have easy access to both left and right,  they  can at least have the possibility of reaching a &#39;middle&#39; conclusion.
