<p>I do it all the time depending on the type of thread (game threads are generally sort by new, for example). I cannot speak for others, but I would assume a person would check the sort options before going on a rant about it and being incorrect in their assumptions, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, I also started to wonder because of the randomness of it all. There also isn&#39;t any transparency built into the voting system, which sucks. I think that would give reddit so much more credibility. I also don&#39;t know why most people don&#39;t question this, but I know that most people don&#39;t care. For example, nobody in my house has any clue of what is going on in the world. They tell me I care too much, but I can&#39;t really process their logic of not caring either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Makes me wonder if they&#39;ve even seen 2001 A space Odyssey.  The amount of money and technology needed to produce that film--which looks as stunningly real today as it was in an era (60&#39;s) that depicted space worlds with green women and glowing paper mache rocks--was far above Kubrick&#39;s pay grade at the time.  So that&#39;s why he got help from nasa, which claims to be not part of the military industrial complex, but parenthesis it totally is.  It&#39;s like discovering a new ocean or a cave to an inner world.  First thing that happens is you bring in military to &#39;occupy it&#39;.  Why would space / moon be different (it&#39;s not).  This theme is explored in the excellent film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1992167/">Kubrick&#39;s Odyssey</a> where the case is made that perhaps we <em>did</em> go to the moon but what we saw on television was Kubrick&#39;s work on a stage. It&#39;s overwhelmingly convincing.  One of the best conspiracy films I&#39;ve seen in fact.</p>

<p>edit: people who are closed minded to reevaluating our &#39;100% accepted truths&#39; are basically SJWs for authority figures, conventionalism and fashionable opinion.  And it&#39;s great to be right because enough people agreed and who did all the research, interpreted it but not you, said so while agreeing not to look at any contradictory research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So much groupthink in that thread, I was just about to link it here as well when I saw they locked it. Notice that there was a portion dedicated to ridiculing Flat Earthers. They&#39;ve been doing that a lot more often.</p>

<p>So many here think that Flat Earth is disinfo to discredit conspiracy by association, but just look at that thread (and any on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>): they blatantly believe that the official 9/11 story is true and that anyone that doesn&#39;t believe in it is already completely crazy. They don&#39;t need a &quot;completely outlandish theory&quot; to discredit this place by association when people have already been programmed to associate 9/11 truth with crazy.</p>

<p>9/11 is a very basic litmus test for me. If you can&#39;t see the obvious controlled demolition, you aren&#39;t thinking critically. You definitely won&#39;t be able to see to the truth on topics which are even more heavily propagandized and controversial, such as the Holocaust and the moon landings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how you think you can determine &quot;critical thinking&quot;, considering how you run away from any conflicting evidence for whatever conspiracy you&#39;re in favor of on a particular day. That&#39;s not critical thinking, that&#39;s cowardice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw a comment in that thread that said: &quot;There are 2 types of conspiracy theorists: ones that make complex things simple (moon landing was fake), and ones that make simple things complex (9/11 was an inside job, JFK was killed by the CIA).&quot;</p>

<p>What amazes me is that the guy who made the comment is saying that 9/11 was &quot;simple&quot;. Like, &quot;oh sure, a couple of cave dwellers hijacked some planes and threw them into buildings. Easy, simple, plain and done&quot;. Really? Because your own 500 page 9/11 commission report, which doesn&#39;t even cover WTC 7, would have to disagree with your idea that it was &quot;simple&quot;. As does the Warren Commission.</p>

<p>Not only that, but to believe that something like 9/11 was just so simple is simply absurd. The official narrative is a complex conspiracy theory. Yet the True conspiracy theory is just as complex. It&#39;s just harder to factor down and make it easier to digest. I&#39;m sure we all got to this point because there was something, or perhaps a few things that caught your attention that didn&#39;t add up with the official story. And then once we delved deeper we could see the total lie within. On our side, we have the oddball facts that don&#39;t connect with the official story that make sense when you consider the government is behind it, while the government simplifies their crazy conspiracy theory as &quot;19 freedom hating Muslims flew a couple planes into a couple towers&quot;. This is the reason why the general public will never accept the truth behind 9/11 until a proper investigation occurs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fingerprinting faked WMD&#39;s would have shown that they weren&#39;t actually produced by Saddam. These materials, by their existence and breakdown would tell exactly how they were manufactured. And the &quot;found&quot; WMDs would have to be inspected by UN inspectors, who would determine this. </p>

<p>To make convincingly produced WMDs for Saddam you would have to have a clandestine weapons program mimicking probable technology Saddam had knowledge/capability of. Then there&#39;s faking the sourcing of these WMDs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, any time people ridicule contrarian opinions, I always say something like &quot;Oh you must also believe that 9/11 was done by the 19 arabs in caves&quot;. That kind of shuts them up, because it is getting harder to believe that American leadership (Bush and co) had no motive for war. Americans need to see them differently from their rogue leadership. Just because they call themselves &quot;American&quot; doesn&#39;t mean they can steer the country in the direction they want to take the whole damn country, or else everything great about America will be lost to their pride, arrogance and unbelievably unsatiable thirst for more power and destruction. Went off on a tangent, but yea, I use that as a litmus test as well. :)</p>
