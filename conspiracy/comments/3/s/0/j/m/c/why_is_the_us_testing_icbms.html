      </p>
      <p>
       1) They've been having military exercises all week up and down the coast from the San Diego to LA area. Normally all I see is rotary aircraft, but there's been all kinds of fixed wing and rotary, which means they're coming up from SD and out of Miramar.  In that geographic area, you have an ENORMOUS concentration of military-mainly Marines and Navy. It's not uncommon where I live to watch the boats land Marines over at Pendleton.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) It was a test launch of the next gen for our ICBM submarines. New tech does have to be tested, and the ICBM subs are part of our nuclear deterrent forces. It was unarmed.

       There's no doubt that they've sent a message with the launch. The question is "what is the real message?"

       Is it: "we have big missiles and even bigger dicks"

       Maybe this is just an unusual instance in that it was A) a large missile, B) a night launch and C) relatively near a major city.  Also, maybe people forget these things relatively quickly as they are pretty much entirely unimportant.

       a picture from a Russian SLBM test.  There, now you have and from the same grade of missile.

      <p>
       From a NASA discussion board on the color of missile exhaust:
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the engineer's response. Here's the astrophysicist's:
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, in a LH2/LOX engine, you're creating a H+/O2- plasma in the combustion chamber, meaning the electrons are stripped from their atoms leaving an electron-ion soup. The hotter the plasma, the higher the transition energy as the electrons fall back back down to the ions, and that energy is released as light. The higher the energy, the bluer the light emitted.

       Which seems to be a rocket that malfuntioned, which caused a helical path that created the spiral shape shown in both our images.

       Spiral aside, your explanation about the blue hue does make a lot of sense.

       That's not my explanation it's that of someone who claims to be an astrophysicist.  That is a picture of the failed Russian missile test seen from Norway.  Presumably the failure and resulting spiral would have no bearing on the blue contrail that was released before the failure.

       Not really. The old version of this was to perform nuclear test detonations in reply to the same action from the other, so this is actually much less disruptive!

       It was a Trident II missile, which uses solid propellant. All of the launch vehicles using solid propellant are periodically test launched. Since you can't see the status of the propellant without causing destructive damage to the launch vehicle, and because non-destructive testing isn't very developed, the vehicles have to be launched to make sure the propellant is still acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're wondering, solid rocket propellant is sort of a rubbery consistency. It will break down over time. This could occasionally cause imperfections in the propellant allowing the burn to not go as planned (causing imbalances that may not be fixable with control systems, or other events causing launch failure). Basically, the propellants were created in batches, so we test another vehicle from the same batch to make sure things are looking acceptable.

       How is it that this looks to be an ICBM test to you? Can you post a video of other ICBM tests that look anything like this? We've had ICBMs for decades now; there must be something similar out there.

       I'm not a rocket scientist but it clearly isn't an alien spacecraft. There are no space shuttle launches on the west coast but they do have plenty of anti-ICBM defense bases locates there. I don't know what it was but I know what it wasn't. Aliens

       I still don't understand how you know it wasn't aliens. It could have been anything and even if the official story is true... Why are they so flashy about this missle test? Who are they trying provoke or send a message to? Its a worrying time.

       If not aliens, then I'd love to see anything that even suggests this was created by our technology, intentionally or as a byproduct, and the whys/hows of ICBM or anti-ICBM launches producing this phenomenon. I appreciate your speculation and attempts at a reasonable explanation, but if there are "plenty of" missile launchers on the west coast, why is this the first time we've seen this kind of "test" there?

       I would assume its a test of an anti-missile missile. Like a Missile defense shield sort of thing. If you haven't noticed. Russia has threatened to nuke the USA about 10 times in the last year. It's not even because they are the bad guys, they are responding in the only way they can to our aggressive actions over the past decade. Nukes are the only card the russians can play which has any hope of making the warmongering fuckers in charge of our country, to maybe think twice about their activities.

       Maybe it was a testing of missile defense.
      </p>
      <p>
       It reminded me of that footage from a few months ago of the rocket that went up and went out of control, then spiraled around.   Except this one, maybe got hit by the defense mechanism, so it just flared up and stopped making smoke at that moment, and just left the big smoke cone there.  That's what it kind of looks like.

       This doesn't necessarily have to be an ICBM.  If it's a multi-stage missile of any kind, it would cause this.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no real reason to test ICBMs, I would assume.  No country has the capacity to accurately take care of them in any effective way.  Could be new technology of some sort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: slight clarification - it could've been an ICBM, but I doubt the ICBM tech was what they were testing.

       Um, maybe because the navy advised LAX in advance that they would be conducting tests and to clear the airspace?  Or do you think that whoever (or whatever) launched the "UFO" gave the navy advance notice as well?

       I'm still not convinced that it wasn't some kind of ship being tested by the Navy but I agree with you that the Navy was involved in it, missile or other wise.
