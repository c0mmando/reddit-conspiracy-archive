<p>Here&#39;s a study that published in <em>The Lancet</em> that determined that glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, is a &quot;probably carcinogen.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jon Entine (Monsanto) vandalized that Wikipedia article on the &quot;Seralini affair&quot; and then proceeded to publish articles to Forbes.com about it. Entine has been fired from ABC News and Forbes.</p>

<p>But did you know it was Richard Goodman (Monsanto) who joined Elsevier, the journal that retracted Seralini&#39;s paper?</p>

<p>No worries though:</p>

<p>Richard Goodman and Wallace Hayes were booted from Elsevier/JCT as of March 2015, and their new editor-in-chief (Jose Domingo) has published papers stating that the safety of GM crops is not an established fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Critical changes have this year been made at the journal, Food and Chemical Toxicolgy, from which the Editor-in-Chief A. Wallace Hayes retracted the important paper by the Seralini team. The Editorial Board of the journal now has a new Editor-in-Chief, José L. Domingo, who has published papers showing that safety of GM crops is not an established fact; and the Editorial Board no longer includes Richard Goodman, the ex-Monsanto employee who became Associate Editor for Biotechnology not long before the Seralini paper was retracted.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The anti-GMO crowd should really stop using Séralini&#39;s bullshit to defend their cause. If he were right, plenty of studies would show the same results. Except, hundreds of studies show <em>opposite</em> results.</p>

<p>Board for Authorisation of Plant Protection Products and Biocides (Ctgb), Netherlands</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.ctgb.nl/nieuws/nieuws-berichten/2015/04/27/ctgb-oordeel-over-iarc-artikel-over-carcinogeniteit-van-glyfosaat">&quot;There is no reason to suspect that glyphosate causes cancer and changes to the classification of glyphosate. … Based on the large number of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies, the EU, U.S. EPA and the WHO panel of the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues concluded that glyphosate is not carcinogenic. It is not clear on what basis and in what manner IARC established the carcinogenicity of glyphosate.”</a></p>

<p>Forbes - March Madness from the United Nations</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/henrymiller/2015/03/20/march-madness-from-the-united-nations/">The data (and a selected set of data, at that) were reviewed to determine whether glyphosate is capable of causing cancer. As with common chemicals like sugar, salt and water, and foods like nutmeg and licorice, glyphosate at very high doses is capable of causing harm to humans. That’s what the IARC “2A” designation—“probably carcinogenic to humans”–essentially means. But one of the seminal tenets of toxicology is that “the dose makes the poison,” and the reality is that glyphosate is not a human health risk even at levels of exposure that are more than 100 times higher than the human exposures that occur under conditions consistent with the product’s labeling.</a></p>

<p><strong><em>1) German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment</em></strong></p>

<p>This group (aka BfR) was involved in the renewal of approval for glyphosate. Of course they will stand behind their assessment until the IARC data comes out. All they know at this point is the IARC may disagree with their previous assessment, but they can&#39;t validate until the data comes out. I found their statement a bit sloppy (grammar issues and repeats), but who cares right?</p>

<p><strong><em>2) Board for Authorisation of Plant Protection Products and Biocides (Ctgb), Netherlands</em></strong></p>

<p>This article, if you actually visited the link, refers to the BfR assessment above and nothing more. Can&#39;t even find the statement you copy-pasted from Monsanto.com which refers to this link. Trash.</p>

<p><strong><em>3) Forbes - March Madness from the United Nations</em></strong></p>

<p>Henry Miller wrote this. He is a climate change denier, former FDA official, supporter of big tobacco and fighter against GMO labeling. He helped defeat Prop 37 in California. He appeared in a &quot;No on 37&quot; television commercial where he told voters that Prop 37 &quot;doesn&#39;t make sense&quot;. Since the commercial depicted his credentials as &quot;M.D., Stanford&quot; and showed Stanford campus buildings on screen - a violation of Stanford&#39;s policy - they had to pull and re-air the commercial. Miller made an appearance in a FOIA request (along with Jon Entine, Keith Kloor, Kevin Folta and Val Giddings) which exposed an elaborate industry scheme to squash opposition to GMOs. Bonus? Miller wants DDT re-introduced. Sounds like a fun guy.</p>

<p>Her statement might hold some value if she didn&#39;t have her own personal investments at stake. Better than citing a Henry Miller article though.</p>

<p>Those organic food options are also probable carcinogens. Even if you eat no-spray (which is very difficult and unsustainable), the compounds <em>naturally produced by the crops you eat</em> are carcinogenic. Pears and apples have formaldehyde in them, for example. But most of the time, &quot;organic&quot; means the use of dangerous pesticides like copper sulfate, rotenone, pyrethroids, or similar.</p>
