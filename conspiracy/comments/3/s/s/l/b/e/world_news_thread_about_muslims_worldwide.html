        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BorderlineGeographer">Top commenter claiming that all those Muslims and Muslim organizations around the world condemning these attacks and showing solidarity with France are wrong because &quot;Muslims of Twitter are defending themselves&quot; (no evidence provided). The user hasn&#39;t posted for a year (their account was created a year ago) and only began posting a few hours ago.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/strai7s">Another user claiming to be a Muslim also hasn&#39;t posted for a year-ish, their account also only created a year ago, and has only just started posting a few hours ago that despite Muslims world wide condemning these attacks they are wrong because &quot;Muslims online&quot; (again, no evidence)</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MarquisDeGalliffet">Third highest comment has only been a user for 6 months and has spent their entire time shilling for Israel and claiming that Palestine is just a &quot;hoax&quot; by Arab leaders to attack Israel. Nothing suss there, no bias to see.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PM_ME_YOUR_CEVICHE">Fourth top comment has only been active for 2 months.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GetHenchOrDieDogging">Fifth is yet <strong>another</strong> user sitting on almost no karma with an account for only 4 months who posts consistently defending Israel and raging against Muslim immigrants. Their post is claiming that despite Muslims around the world condemning this and showing solidarity, it&#39;s untrue because of Muslims on &quot;Facebook&quot;. Again, no evidence.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dhamu_92">Sixth is a user that created an account 8 months ago and <strong>has only started posting a little over 2 weeks ago</strong>, claiming that Muslims condemning this attack and showing solidarity is &quot;trying to blame the West&quot;.</a></p>

<p>Gee, i&#39;m seeing a pattern here. How about you guys?</p>

<p>Notice how they&#39;re also desperately trashing <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> preemptively as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me too, I hate it, I hate the saying and I hate the implications of it, but Reddit is just so controlled at this point, and their ideology is very transparent if you judge it based on the posts the ban versus the posts they don&#39;t. They are see-through, yet so many people continue to have blind faith for this website as some sort of bastion of free speech on the internet. Maybe it was a 6 years ago, but not anymore. Now it is corporate owned, tied to companies that sell on the stock market and demand profit, and excommunicate any ideas that may get in the way of said profit. Including free speech. </p>

Once internet becomes the new &quot;Television&quot; they can truly corrupt it and push it forth as the bastion of &quot;public opinion&quot;.

Pass laws against internet free speech, pass laws to ban anti-government and conspiracy talks because it promotes &quot;terrorism&quot; or some bullshit like that.</p>

<p>Sorry, it was already done. That you somehow don&#39;t think the 6 top rated comments being obvious shills isn&#39;t evidence of shilling means very little coming from a user who just happened to come into <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for the first time and thinks ranting and raving that all the evidence provided &quot;isn&#39;t good enough&quot;.</p>

<p>insulted!</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a &quot;tactic&quot; to insult you. I&#39;m calling you an idiot because you&#39;re being so obvious, the fact evidence has already been provided and you have no actual counter has no relation to you being an idiot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still, being an asshole doesn&#39;t prove your point when all I asked for was more,  but you are so arrogant that you can&#39;t even do that.
