       I really hate the "Zionists control everything" narrative when it's applied to virtually everything as it too often is.  In the case of
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews

       , it has become so far from a representative sample of Reddit opinion because of Hasbara and JIDF types using Megaphone etc. that I am totally comfortable saying Zionists run

       Me too, I hate it, I hate the saying and I hate the implications of it, but Reddit is just so controlled at this point, and their ideology is very transparent if you judge it based on the posts the ban versus the posts they don't. They are see-through, yet so many people continue to have blind faith for this website as some sort of bastion of free speech on the internet. Maybe it was a 6 years ago, but not anymore. Now it is corporate owned, tied to companies that sell on the stock market and demand profit, and excommunicate any ideas that may get in the way of said profit. Including free speech.

       This is why the digital realm is so important to the ones in power. Once internet becomes the new "Television" they can truly corrupt it and push it forth as the bastion of "public opinion". To which they can manipulate and form in whichever way they want to justify anything they wanna do. Pass laws against internet free speech, pass laws to ban anti-government and conspiracy talks because it promotes "terrorism" or some bullshit like that.

       Still, being an asshole doesn't prove your point when all I asked for was more,  but you are so arrogant that you can't even do that. The burden of proof is on you OP not me. Obviously I want to buy want you are selling which is why I asked, but you are so full of rage and a dick about it for no reason, i'll leave it alone. Let's just pacify you and yes, yes those are shills . You found them out. Good work.
