        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Of course the passport survived the blast.  Just like the one that was found on 9/11 that survived the plane impact with the building.  And of course they were screaming &quot;Allah Akbar&quot;.  That is what the terrorists on 9/11 could be heard saying as well.  </p>

<p>Does anyone else buy this crap?  Same moves, different event.   </p>

<p>The US is already trying to offer it&#39;s help to make the &quot;terrorists&quot; responsible be held accountable.  By that I&#39;m sure they mean they want to use this to get a &quot;legitimate&quot; reason to get into Syria.  </p>

<p>The US would probably have the inside track to get the terrorists responsible, considering they have been funding and arming them for a couple years now.</p>

<p>The following is copy and pasted from whatreallyhappened.com - </p>

<p>Imagine that you despised your brother-in-law and wanted to kill him. But you didn’t have the guts to do it yourself so you hired a hit-man to do the job for you.</p>

<p>Would you still be guilty of murder?</p>

<p>You’re darn right, you would be. So let’s apply this same rule to US foreign policy: Would it be just as wrong to invade a country, kill its people and topple its government with militants that you funded, armed and trained as it would be with your own US troops?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not the same as a passport being inside of a plane which disintegrated on impact along with its target. If a couple several ton RR jet engines can melt, why would a passport be made of some unmeltable breakthrough plastic compound. Cmon use ya noggin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro but explosions leave fires behind. No way a booklet made of paper and coated with a minimal amount of plastic could survive. I agree with you that items can survive explosions, they&#39;ll either end up in pieces or almost unreadable. Also like that one anon was saying, who would bring a passport with them to a terrorist attack unless they are trying to frame someone or something? Think about it. Some of these terrorist have no photo IDs and majority use the generic name Mohammed. They don&#39;t do it for exposure. Only people that might recognize them are those in their same organization. I believe in the proxy armies theory because I&#39;ve seen with my own two eyes and I&#39;ve seen the effects it had on my country of heritage and those surrounding it. No country ever truly recovers after the US ravages it and gets what they want.</p>

<p>Where do you get your facts from? Paper absorbs energy very well. It isn&#39;t brittle. It won&#39;t shatter from a shockwave. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Some can. Not all do. Even if they all did,  that doesn&#39;t mean everything impacted by the shockwave is earmarked for ignition. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also like that one anon was saying, who would bring a passport with them to a terrorist attack unless they are trying to frame someone or something?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>France has strict passport laws. If you&#39;re visiting the country, you must have your passport on you at all times or you can be arrested/detained for failing to produce your passport. What would fuck up a coordinated attack more than you being detained for something as stupid as not having your passport on you? </p>

<p>You&#39;re under-informed and making statements in absoultes. Those actions are dangerous and how which hunts start. Stop, think, research before throwing accusations around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the real issue is how quickly they  &#39;found said evidence&#39;. Yes paper can survive fires and/or explosions, but the real crux is how they managed to find this small piece of id that just so happen to be from the so called terrorist, that survived the plan crash, the fires,  THEN the collapse of the towers which buried and strewn about everything plus the kitchen sink.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a difference between questioning a story and marking every single event as a government conspiracy. I follow this sub. I obviously have reservations about what happens behind the scenes. But these people having passports on them is in no way evidence. And I don&#39;t mean &quot;not enough evidence&quot;, I mean it&#39;s not evidence at all.</p>

<p>The time it took isn&#39;t evidence either. If there really was a planted passport, what does it matter when they say it was found? They could just as easily have said it was found right now. Or tomorrow. Or Monday. Doesn&#39;t make a difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there are a lot of unanswered questions, and we should not immediately jump to the muslisms-did-it conclusion.</p>

<p>For example, why did they take hostages, if their goal was simply to terrorize and kill as many as possible? </p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s been reported that not all suicide bombers do it willingly, and do it under threat to their families. They all didn&#39;t blow themselves up, either, so I would be referring to the gunmen that some witnesses described as appearing calm and experienced. </p>

<p>I am not immediately assuming it&#39;s a false flag, simply stating that we should not immediately assume it <em>isn&#39;t</em> one, based on hearsay CNN reports.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that they didn&#39;t execute all the hostages. Supposedly the police got most of them out.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I need a source to prove radical terrorists <em>could</em> rig up a remote detonator and send a patsy in to blow up, with his family held captive under threat of death, or worse. </p>

<p>Yeah, you have a point about them probably being experienced, and one shouldn&#39;t put much faith into hearsay reports from layman witnesses in any case. </p>

<p>The main point, is that a government, or generic conspiratorial shady power-cult,  with an agenda could quite easily fake this attack. You or I have no way of proving who did it. So we have to trust the gullible corporate media, and intuition. </p>

<p>When multiple parties stand to gain from an atrocity such as this one, all avenues of possibility should be followed, regardless if how &quot;crazy&quot; is might sound...in my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, you should be ashamed of yourself for consciously stating such an obvious lie how this place is full of David Icke and flat earth articles. I browse this forum every day and have done so even since before I signed up when I was a lurker and when it comes to flat earth stuff I see maybe 1 or 2 articles <em>a week</em> on that type of stuff and the threads are never grandly discussed by the majority but quickly dismissed.  When it comes to David Icke, I can&#39;t remember a single thread that dealt with his reptilian stuff in recent memory.
You&#39;re blatantly lying and you are doing it on purpose.</p>

<p>When it comes to this being a false flag, it boils down to this;
ISIS is a false flag operation by itself, so naturally anything they are involved with can be called a false flag. Their entire existence is a false flag. Here go wild reading this thread which has tons of links to sources that ISIS aren&#39;t who they claim to be:

<p>I never said the government is innocent. You&#39;re reading what you want to read and connecting more imaginary dots.</p>

<p>All I said was a passport isn&#39;t proof of anything, and gave FACTS as to why. Facts you&#39;ve ignored since post 1.</p>

<p>You&#39;re too proud to admit you jumped the gun on this article because you were ignorant to the passport laws. You&#39;re scrambling to save face by spouting off pointless, irrelevant shit and putting words in my mouth.</p>

<p>You think you&#39;re able to see the &quot;truths&quot; regular people can&#39;t because of your delusions of grandeur. You&#39;re not special, you&#39;re diagnosable. </p>

<p>Have fun connecting imaginary dots at every tragedy while you still can, since your mind is sure to give way to your schizophrenia any time now.</p>

<p>OP is saying this passport is evidence that the US government is behind this attack because terrorists have no need for passports. I explained why a passport being found at the scene is not only logical, but probable based on France&#39;s passport laws. Since when is using logic suspicious?</p>

<p>I asked myself the questions but was able to answer these questions with reason and logic. While I am using reason and logic, accusations that ignore all reasonable explanations are being thrown around simply because people aggrandize themselves. OP thinks he&#39;s too smart to be fooled and therefore sees through lies that aren&#39;t there. It&#39;s called being paranoid.</p>

<p>Those variables you brought up are the variables everyone starts with, you&#39;re not special for bringing them up. Everyone holds them in the back of their head when they claim it is suspicious and convenient for all these things to fall into place. It&#39;s not just a passport, after all.

    <div class="md"><p>The forgotten &quot;9/11 passports found&quot; weren&#39;t only &quot;the passport at the World Trade Center&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>The Mysterious and Bizarre Case of the Bukhari &quot;Brothers&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Two men with the last name &quot;Bukhari&quot; were originally said to be on the flight manifest for Flight 11.  The FBI insisted that ID cards of the two &quot;brothers&quot; were &quot;left behind&quot; magically in Atta&#39;s rental car.</p>

<p>But neither man was on Flight 11.  They weren&#39;t brothers.  <em>And one of them was already dead for a year.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adnan_Bukhari#Arrest">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adnan_Bukhari#Arrest</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Between 5:00 and 5:30 on the morning of September 12, FBI agents, backed by a SWAT team, stormed Bukhari&#39;s leased house at 4036 57th Terrace and arrested him, saying that <strong>identity cards of him and an Ameer Bukhari, mistakenly thought to be a brother, were found in a rental car</strong> the hijackers had left in Portland, Maine, though <em>it later turned out that Ameer had died a year earlier</em>, and had no relation to Adnan.</p>

<p>Agents evacuated nearby houses, citing concerns that Adnan Bukhari&#39;s house was rigged with explosives, and took him to Miami for questioning. While searching his house, <strong>they announced that they had found a copy of Ameer Bukhari&#39;s pilot license</strong> (the alleged brother), and a &quot;hazardous materials manual&quot;.[1] After passing a polygraph, he was released and later cleared of any wrongdoing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Questions:  </p>

<p>(1) The FBI <em>never backed away from their claim of &quot;finding IDs for the two men in Atta&#39;s car.&quot;</em> How did their IDs get there if they weren&#39;t involved?</p>

<p>(2) The FBI <em>never backed away from their claim of &quot;finding Ameer&#39;s ID&quot; in Adnan&#39;s house</em>  Since they weren&#39;t brothers &amp; didn&#39;t know each other, what is the explanation? </p>

<p>WhatReallyHappened.com notes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This poses a problem for our investigators - proving who was actually using these IDs is very difficult. It also creates the very difficult question: why did they have to steal so many IDs from pilots? Is it more likely to be someone trying to create the illusion that the hijackers flew the planes into the buildings?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems pretty clear to me. Leave a passport on one or more. Let the white nationalists know it was Muslims. Nationalistic fervor goes crazy. Whites in France go even further to marginalize non-whites. Radical groups clean up on recruitment.</p>

<p>Yet so few here and elsewhere even catch on to that. Much rather make it a super duper conspiracy involving multiple governments than look at the obvious. </p>

<p>They need to scream something to advertise their brand, which is Islam, so &quot;Allah Akbar&quot; will do the job. They do not have to go to the effort of thinking about what they are doing and why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They count on the public lacking an imagination and being uneducated in certain tactics. All you need to do is bring a body along, fitted with explosives, and detonate it.</p>

<p>Mercenaries are paid killers, they kill for money, they follow the dollar like far too many foolish people. </p>

<p>It is not too far of a stretch for those involved in this to hire operators to go in and just shoot people in certain locations with military precision because they got paid to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there are a lot of unanswered questions, and we should not immediately jump to the muslisms-did-it conclusion.</p>

<p>For example, why did they take hostages, if their goal was simply to terrorize and kill as many as possible? </p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s been reported that not all suicide bombers do it willingly, and do it under threat to their families. They all didn&#39;t blow themselves up, either, so I would be referring to the gunmen that some witnesses described as appearing calm and experienced. </p>

<p>I am not immediately assuming it&#39;s a false flag, simply stating that we should not immediately assume it <em>isn&#39;t</em> one, based on hearsay CNN reports.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Denial is a river that you are sailing down full speed ahead.  </p>

<p>If you are that dumb to believe that your arguments of what passport laws are in place, have any relevance at all to what our government has done, you better wallpaper your house with mattresses before the state does.  Idiot.  </p>

<p>Oh wait, that&#39;s right you are FBI.  Full Blown Idiot.</p>

<p>My bad,</p>

<p>Learn your history before acting like you know what you are talking about, because you obviously have no clue and don&#39;t have the IQ to waste anymore time on.</p>

<p>Thanks for entertainment, but that is about all you are good for.  </p>

<p>So as stated before, take your idiocy back to top minds.  If you haven&#39;t heard of them, you will fit right in with that group of scholars.   See you at the next Mensa meeting.  Google it. </p>

<p>Peace out dummy.</p>
