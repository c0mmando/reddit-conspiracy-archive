       When this was first brought up, geography was the rationale: "Israel is far away" etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If IS is, in fact, responsible for the attacks in Paris (and that's a fairly big "if" in my mind) then what's the reasoning behind the lack of aggression in Israel?

       A lot of crickets about the bombings in
       <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34805466">
        Beirut
       </a>
       on Thursday. Outside a mosque and a bakery. 43 killed, 200 wounded, worst Beirut has seen since 1990.  ISIS took credit for it and for bombings on Friday in
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/14/world/middleeast/iraq-suicide-bomb-and-road-blast-kill-26-in-baghdad.html?_r=0">
        Baghdad
       </a>
       (26 killed, ~46 wounded).
      </p>
      <p>
       So ISIS/Daesh takes responsibility for hitting three targets in two days (not to mention claiming responsibility the Russian airliner over Egypt), signifying a huge change in "strategy" for them - and we're not allowed to talk about them all or how or why they might be connected.

       The pace has no doubt escalated since Russia made its move into Syria. My question is, do you think that the intentions of western powers behind ISIS is to further draw Hezbollah, Iraqi forces, Iran, and Russia into Syria to further weaken their military's? And sanctioned these attacks to further those goals? Or do you think that these attacks are unsanctioned by western powers and simply the blowback of arming and funding unstable and radical groups like ISIS?
      </p>
      <p>
       To me it seems like Hezbollah has been weakened significantly by their war with ISIS, and drawing them in makes alot of sense. The Paris attacks are obviously going to be used to propagate "WAR AGAINST THE TERRORISTS!!!" without any context regarding the state of affairs in the middle east being offered. It does seem to me, however, a very risky move, as it still is going to be a hard road for those in power behind the scenes to convince the masses that somehow we need to fight Assad and Russia in response, even though they are both fighting ISIS. Mabye the French attacks are to be used simply to propagate completely closing the borders of Europe, essentially imprisoning Syrian refugees in a war zone, and to prevent the influx of Muslim influence in Europe, which would no doubt threaten Israel's influence on politics in Europe, in the long run. Or mabye, it really was the blowback of radicalized jihadists acting in France without any direction from the West. So many angles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The downing of the Russian plane is confusing, though, as I don't think their is any doubt that doing so would further escalate Russia's position in Syria. The West wants Assad gone, and really doesn't have the political capital right now to directly engage Russian troops in Syria, so drawing Russia further in to the conflict doesn't make sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The West tried with ISIS to remove Assad, but in my view, it looks like Putin moved in at exactly the right time and hijacked the ISIS narrative the west has been spewing to protect its interests, and it helps that they are doing so with the guidelines of international law on their side. To me, it seems that the west has two options, de-escalate in Syria, allow ISIS to fail, and most likely attempt some new angle in the future, or start WWIII.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm rambling, but whatever - to finish, for anyone who reads this, now is the time to start the anti-war movement in the United States. People are going to be talking about the attacks in France, we need to bring to light the fact that Russia, Iran, Hezbollah, Assad, and the Syrian Defense Force are all fighting ISIS. The Muslim world as a whole despises ISIS. The west props up Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey, but with barely any political capital, and the majority of the populous of the West hates those countries. Now is the time, as this blatant western imperialism dangles by a thread, and the warmongers and neo-cons are grasping at straws (we just want to spread democracy and protect the syrian people from that evil guy Assad. .  . .. - FUCK OFF).

       To be honest, I'm still looking at the pieces askance. Who benefits, who loses? I can see something and nothing on all sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see Kerry and his ghoul friends rubbing their hands together gleefully to push the Syria takeover timeline forward, but that's just one small piece.
      </p>
      <p>
       One other piece of this is that it will also put a thorn in the side of EU unification and undermines the power of the EU "bloc" if each country decides its own borders and tells the others to dangle - already Poland has rattled. This is probably something certain powerful interests might find useful. But I'm not sure it's useful to Western power re: oil as breaking the EU bloc is good for Russia and their pipeline dreams.

       Yeah seriously, its alot to take a look at and research, and its very interesting. The response by western nations over the coming weeks will be very telling to the intentions behind these attacks. Looking at it right now (with what I hope is a somewhat informed, objective perspective), really highlights the fact that the more you know, the more you realize how much you don't know. The angle on fracturing the EU, for instance, is something I hadn't really considered, but will now. Anyways, I love good, objective discussion on these things, cheers.

       Israel knows an "Islamic" terrorist army that hasn't said or done jack shit towards Israel is just bizarre. A lot of people know whats going on now. We know ISIS is doing the work for Israel, the US and the Saudi's. They have to know people have caught on to their game but the bastards keep playing the narrative as if they just don't give a shit if people know the truth. Enough people believe  the lie to make it worth their while.

       As Israel whines about teenage women 'lightly wounding' the IDF. I must say, Israel is very good at propaganda and branding, when it comes to counter terrorism and actual warfare, not so much. Backed by the United States, Israel could not defeat Hezbollah, and instead had to resort to attempting to brand them as a 'terrorist organization', a term that is in itself propaganda. There is no objective definition of terrorism, only different perceptions of violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The IDF is an army of Israeli teenagers forced by Israeli law to join its ranks. Counter terrorism? Shelling one of the most populated regions on earth from behind a massive concrete wall? Bombing UN refugee shelters populated with civilians and international aid workers under the guise that "mabye Hamas is storing rockets there"? - an idea they defend from the fact that Amnesty International reported rockets being stored at an abandoned school in Gaza. The IDF are complete cowards. Israel is a cowardice state, propped up merely by its support from the United States, its military aid, and its veto power at the United Nations.

       US government took on Israeli anti-terrorist tactics because the people who set up and control the DHS are Israel first zionists the days after 9/11 it was Michael Chertoff. Every one to lead the DHS since has been a Jew who keeps the billion dollar security business with Israeli firms going strong.

       How would you suggest they attack Israel?, Israel is not France, every 18 year old has an M16 and the country itself is hardwired to act fast if such events do transpire, not to mention it's extensive surveillance programs that monitor and track most mediums to avert any attack. Plus they don't have a huge oppressed muslim audience to cater to, which they fester upon when establishing cells for their operations. if anything, Israel's the hardest place for them to attack at the moment, a combination of an hyper-aware public and lack of supporters, not to mention that Israel's security forces are some of the best trained in the world, and certainly one of the most combat proven in the western world.

       It is perhaps noteworthy that Israel has NOT attacked ISIS - nor has it attacked al Nusra or the other Jihadist factions that have been battling Assad.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Israel HAS attacked Assad's forces - especially when the Jihadist's chips are down.

       I mentioned this elsewhere, but HAMAS hates ISIS with a vengeance, and vice-versa. ISIS have only had any success where there has been a military and power vacuum they could exploit. That isn't the case at all in Gaza/Israel. Also, they know Israel would not give two fucks about retaliating hard-core, both covertly and overtly.

       If Israel was attacked today a lot of Americans wouldn't care because it didn't happen to them, the pretext needs to happen in the homeland for any action to be taken.

       Can someone tell me if my understanding is correct? ISIS (or anybody wearing ISIS uniforms that would want to get rid of Assad) are basically just fighting Assad while Israel sits and watches. Then NATO airplanes come in and Israeli intelligence shows them some key infrastructure sites belonging to Assad and then says "drop bombs there". And then they all cheer about pretend that they killed ISIS bad guys. And ISIS never attacks Israel (its master), or gets defeated because they're just mercenaries financed by rich Israelis to topple Assad as part of the greater Israel/pipeline expansion project. And then Russian troops go in and within two weeks they've actually flushed ISIS out, which is not really remarkable since ISIS are just a bunch of unskilled low IQ goons and Israeli handlers fighting a cash strapped Syrian army. From this perspective the Russian airliner getting shot down makes sense, as the Russian military incursion is causing major frustration for NATO powers that are trying to pretend that they were actually fighting ISIS for the last few years instead of engaging in even more illegal imperialism - and they have to make it clear that Russia should stay out of this or it's going to blow their cover. Now Russia says they want to do a joint mission to fight Isis - but what he's really saying is - lets do a
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       mission...lets go kill your pets.
      </p>
      <p>
       OK, so the Russians kick ISIS butt in Syria, and ISIS, in response attacks France. Now, even if one makes the point that Muslims are not very bright, trust me, they’re not that stupid. Why would ISIS attack France, when their worry is Russia? Well, what happened afterwards? François Hollande declared the attack an act of war - this was the go signal for Nato forces to move into Syria (and I'm guessing Russia out so they can go back to attacking Assad). 
Furthermore, where does all of our information about ISIS come from? It comes from Site Intelligence, lead by Rita Katz, and is commonly believed to be a front for the Mossad. I mean, if site intelligence is just a Mossad propaganda tool, and the Mossad is willing to abduct real people and execute them on camera for their ISIS propaganda videos, who's to say that they aren't willing to do a real attack, on real Frenchmen, in France?... Jet fuel can't melt steel beams.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the primary agenda of the false flags is to demonize Muslims and drum up support for more military engagement in Syria. Since the attack is an 'act of war' they can make it a nato only mission - which pushes Russia out of the picture and allows everybody to go back to pretending to fight ISIS. The purpose of the engagement in Syria is to secure Israel’s hegemony in the Middle East by toppling Assad under the guise of “fighting terrorism”. This will allow further Israeli expansion and an oil pipeline takeover (this is also beneficial to America because of the petrodollar recycling scheme). And, the secondary agenda is to destroy the ethnic homogeneity of all European nations by promoting mass Third World immigration and waves of “refugees”.

       This is interesting. I for some reason thought Israel was behind ISIS, but did not know other people felt the same way. To me some of these   ISIS conscripts seem too well trained, like special forces. Also, their access to modern weapons reeks of a NATO traitor. I was thinking it had to due with Israel's interest in Syria conflicting with those of other western allies... but I forget how I arrived at that line of thought so nvm...lol

       The evolution of in-group morality, by John Hartung, MD, PhD
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Abstract:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The world's major religions espouse a moral code that includes injunctions against murder, theft, and lying - or so conventional 19th- and 20th-century Western wisdom would have it. Evidence put forth here argues that this convention is a conceit which does not apply to the West's own religious foundations. In particular, rules against murder, theft, and lying codified by the Ten Commandments were intended to apply only within a cooperating group for the purpose of enabling that group to compete successfully against other groups. In addition, this in-group morality has functioned, both historically and by express intent, to create adverse circumstances between groups by actively promoting murder, theft, and lying as tools of competition. Contemporary efforts to present Judeo-Christian in-group morality as universal morality defy the plain meaning of the texts upon which Judaism and Christianity are based. Accordingly, that effort is ultimately hopeless.

       It did not stop the war.  All valuable targets had already been destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tokyo had already been mercilessly firebombed.
      </p>
      <p>
       What it did was to threaten the rest of the world and of course it served as a starter pistol for an arms race with Russia.

       Nope.  What stopped the war was allowing Japan to keep her Emperor.
      </p>
      <p>
       We could have dropped 100 more atomic bombs (if we had actually had them -- we completely blew our load on Hiroshima and Nagasaki).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even after Germany fell, freeing up more troops for a massive land invasion.  Even after Russia announced that they were coming after Japan too, there was no surrender.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as soon as the Japanese Cabinet knew that they'd be allowed the dignity of keeping their Emperor -- they surrendered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had the Pottsdam declaration made that clear, Japan would have surrendered then.  Of course, then they wouldn't have gotten to play with their shiny new atomic toys -- so they conveniently left that out of the Pottsdam declaration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Japan would have fought to the last grandma wielding a teapot otherwise.

       Seeing as Israel is the advertised primary foe of ISIS™, we would have "expected" a major attack on Israel -- w/ hundreds (if not 1000's of dead Israelis) -- years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quite the opposite:  Not one attack on Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       But plenty of attacks on Israel's enemies:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Syria
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Turkey
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Lebanon
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Iraq
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       How "convenient" for Israel -- that ISIS™ (Israel's #1 enemy) NEVER attacks Israel !!  But further... is actually helping to secure "the greater" Israel by proxy!.
      </p>
      <p>
       i.e., ISIS™ is either really stupid, or a really well funded faction of CIA/Mossad.
      </p>
      <p>

       Daesh doesn't want a nuke being launched in a region so close to home. Israel is pretty trigger happy.

       Standard rationale, IDF is actually aware of the threat and looking for them. They DO racially profile there.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's infinitely harder to organize any kind of attack like that there.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what your left with is a bunch of pissed off kids with knives randomly stabbing people because that's damn hard to prevent without looking like complete assholes. Which they still do anyway.

       How would IS attack Israel? After decades of terrorism, Israel is very good at preventing coordinated terrorist attacks (Stopping lone stabbers is impossible). The most ISIS can do is shoot some rockets at Israel from Sinai, which they already did:

       I guess in a paradoxical way I can't really trust the Jew York Times to tell the truth, just like a typical hasbara douche, oh and that's not a fuck you to your race, it's a fuck you to your country and many of it's people.

       The evolution of in-group morality, by John Hartung, MD, PhD
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Abstract:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The world's major religions espouse a moral code that includes injunctions against murder, theft, and lying - or so conventional 19th- and 20th-century Western wisdom would have it. Evidence put forth here argues that this convention is a conceit which does not apply to the West's own religious foundations. In particular, rules against murder, theft, and lying codified by the Ten Commandments were intended to apply only within a cooperating group for the purpose of enabling that group to compete successfully against other groups. In addition, this in-group morality has functioned, both historically and by express intent, to create adverse circumstances between groups by actively promoting murder, theft, and lying as tools of competition. Contemporary efforts to present Judeo-Christian in-group morality as universal morality defy the plain meaning of the texts upon which Judaism and Christianity are based. Accordingly, that effort is ultimately hopeless.

       Israel strikes Syrian targets regularly - often using excuses such as claiming it is hitting "Hezbollah" forces (who are fighting ISIS).

       Attacking Israel would actually be a perfect pretext for those, just as attacking the US was used to justify invading Iraq and Afghanistan.
