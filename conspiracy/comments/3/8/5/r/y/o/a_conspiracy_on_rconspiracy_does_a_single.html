    <div class="md"><p>The question is... Does it matter and do we want an echo chamber? I really do not care if the mods believe in what I think is possible about the Flavian&#39;s and Christianity, as long as they are cool with me posting it. </p>

<p>What I do care about is whether they are free from their bias in their voluntary job and allow even the most fringe (ie. goes against what they believe/think). I really wouldn&#39;t want a mod who believes exactly what we all think. That could end up being a very bad place. The conspiracy theory crowd are all dispersed on many different beliefs/thoughts.</p>

<p>The point is, they need to be neutral and honestly, I do not care what their personal beliefs are as long as they allow open conversation and enforce the rules. Why does it matter if the mods believe the Saudis did it or if it was a Mossad/CIA job? They are not forcing people into a box, we all can discuss what we think (as long as you&#39;re not an ass and break the rules) and the mods are behind the screen just moderating. </p>

<p>It already is an echo chamber. It&#39;s always been an echo chamber. No where in normal society can you make half unsubstantiated claims that get made on here and get even a hundredth as many people agreeing with you. It&#39;s simply due to everyone who comes here having a similar critical disposition, so people are more likely to agree.</p>

<p>The preponderance of evidence points to there being about a 95% certainty that it was a controlled demolition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so your statement is 95% untrue. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an idea: If you&#39;re going to repeat anything about me (or anyone) in this sub, then how about quoting what I actually did say instead of spinning it with wording that implies something that&#39;s not true?</p>

<p>A moderator of 911truth won&#39;t go on record stating that controlled demolitions brought down WTC7.</p>

<p>Your obfuscation is expected and not surprising.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m shocked you won&#39;t say this sentence: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I, <a href="/u/sovereignman">/u/sovereignman</a>, believe the evidence that controlled demolitions alone, not fires, like NIST claimed, or debris, like others claim, brought down the 7 World Trade Center at 5:21:00 pm EDT on September 11, 2001.&quot;</p>

<p>A mod of <a href="/r/911truth">/r/911truth</a> won&#39;t conclusively state a controlled demolition brought down WTC7.</p>

<p>You just can&#39;t get away from that &quot;Official Conspiracy Theory&quot; garbage, no matter how ridiculous it looks that you won&#39;t go all in.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to at least engage <a href="/u/sovereignman">/u/sovereignman</a>. It&#39;s rather telling that this post is at +2 karma with over 46 comments. It&#39;s a topic that needs discussion, whether you think so or not.</p>

<p>That&#39;s 1 out of 6 mods. I guess I&#39;ll have to make posts asking every single mod  individually. It would have been <em>so much easier</em> to get it out in the open here, rather than keep asking the same questions and be obfuscated repeatedly.</p>

<p>Edit: words, lots more words</p>

<p>Edit2: You&#39;d probably rather be done with a 911 truth advocate asking a mod of 911 truth what most truth advocates know happened on 911. </p>

<p>We haven&#39;t even touched on the controlled demolitions of WTC1 and WTC2 yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I know is that WTC7 was in free fall for over 2 seconds.  Free fall means that an object is doing nothing at all but falling and accelerating, so it&#39;s impossible that any downward &quot;crushing&quot; <em>could&#39;ve</em> occurred, thus the explanation in the official story is laughable as it is in almost all other respects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember that fiasco. I tried to be neutral because I&#39;m not around here enough to know if it is weird or not that non conspiracy stuff is posted. I don&#39;t think it is a huge issue, I think that r/conspiracy is kind of turning into a &quot;hangout&quot; which is a nice thing. It is kind a safe spot for people to just interact on whatever they think is worth talking about, and if the community thinks it&#39;s junk they can down vote it.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that toe is doing it to be a douche though, I think it&#39;s important that members of /conspiracy ought to be as dedicated to finding conspiracies inside our sub as they are to finding them outside of the sub. We&#39;d be naive to think this place is insulated from its own shinanigans. Maybe Toe is doing what he thinks is best, the community might not agree, but it probably isn&#39;t best handled by turning it personal. I think that&#39;s were everything gets derailed. We as people are very quick to go on the defensive, myself included, when our OC line of conspiracy thought gets holes poked in it and challenged. Maybe just give Toe the benefit of the doubt. We should all just be giving each other the benefit of the doubt, it&#39;s a powerful favor we can all do for each other and it will really help original ideas flow freer. </p>
