<blockquote>
<p>Those who know the truth are the most confident to debate on its behalf. A case in point was the 9/11 Physics Debate. Behold, on the 911Truth side: mountains of irrefutable evidence; on the side of the official theory: pseudoscience and outright untruths. The oh-so-predictable result: no qualified takers willing to defend the view of the government/media establishment in an open forum.</p>

<p>The Association for Nine Eleven Truth Awareness (ANETA.org) sponsored a &quot;Physics Olympics&quot; debate between two top physicists in the spirit of the winter athletic events in Sochi, Russia.</p>

<p>The contestants would need to be PhDs in Physics from accredited universities and they would also need to be widely referenced by other scientists in scientific journal papers, as measured by the Hirsch Index. The two physicists would argue the resolutions:</p>

<p>The laws of physics were broken by the official story, and we need a new investigation, or
The laws were not broken; everything was explainable by the Nine Eleven Official Conspiracy Theory (NEOCT) put forth by the 9/11 Commission and NIST Reports.
The winner would be determined by audience vote and would receive $1000 towards the non-profit charity of his or her choice. The debate was originally planned for March 1st on Dr. Kevin Barrett&#39;s No Lies Radio Show via conference call for the convenience of the physicists, with equal time for each debater to speak.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The debunkers didn&#39;t show up. Surprised? Neither am I. Not a single debunker would defend the official NIST story!!! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got into a debate with the wider reddit user over this issue. As an emgineer the collapse of the WTC makes no sense to me. The whole steel beams weakened by flames, just doesnt add up. Nothing adds up. </p>

<p>Yet when I say impact of plane is insignificant to the flame retardent falling off people disagree, the ammount of fuel needed to weaken enough support so it collapses the way it did isnt enough etc. Yet here we are. Offical records are bullshit, and there doesnt seem to be a release of official reports anytime soon as there is still too many big players who are still ripping the rewards of this tragedy. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, the events around Flight 93 and the Pentagon are just as much smoking guns as the buildings are.</p>

<p>But yeah, after all it&#39;s the events around the WTC that still stir public interest so I&#39;m fine with anything resembling a public debate concentrates on these issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So how did someone put the explosives in the building. You know how much work that would take? How many explosives? How precise everything would have to be? How where the plane hits would also have to be where the explosion started exactly? How would that massive effort get covered up? Where did the cover up money come from? How was not one person who did this willing to come foreword and say look the government just gave me this check to not say anything about this but fuck that, I can write a book and do talk shows and make way more. Or did they pay like 500 million to each of the thousand people or more who would have to be in on it and somehow no one was ever suspicious of these massive checks being cashed or anything like that? </p>

<p>Don&#39;t cherry pick, address all of my questions or don&#39;t bother answering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a lot of assumptions. You assume that regular explosives were used, that the team that did it is still alive or not so morally indoctrinated as to think they did the wrong thing. You assume that the MSM would cover their confession if they were still alive instead of calling in a hit on them. </p>

<p>E Howard Hunt confessed to the murder of JFK. All of the people involved either thought they were doing the right thing in assassinating him, or were killed. His confession never went mainstream, has done nothing to change the narrative of the government, and it did nothing to spur other confessions. And even as a deathbed confession, we still can&#39;t fully trust it. He had a son to protect into the future. </p>

<p>We have official documented cases of high-ranking full-spectrum treason that have come to light without any ramifications. Operation Gladio, Northwoods, Mockingbird, etc, have all been documented. So what? People turn to the MSM and await their approved reaction. </p>

<p>A real conspiracy is thorium. We have the climate alarmists waiting to trample their brothers to avoid worldwide catastrophe, but if you mention thorium, they won&#39;t even discuss it. We talk about peak oil, we&#39;re willing to send ourselves back to the dark ages, but we won&#39;t teach thorium in universities, won&#39;t fund research into it and don&#39;t ask why. </p>

<p>My background is science and engineering. I Never heard thorium mentioned except as a waste by-product of mining for rare earths. You believe in the goodness of people, of institutions, and yet with energy as a governing factor of life, none of your institutions or good people are willing to dismantle their power structure with an energy source that they can&#39;t control. </p>

<p>Look into thorium. Look at when we realized it could produce nuclear energy (the same moment we realized uranium could), look at the initial funding thorium received vs uranium (1:1000), look what happened after operating a successful plant for a decade (it was mothballed), look at the known reserves (20,000 years for thorium vs 30-40 for uranium) and look at the synthesis of government dialogue when they yell climate change.</p>

<p>To assume that these guys give a shit, you need to assume that the government whose currency is the world&#39;s reserve due to petrol does not care about the petrodollar, that the government doesn&#39;t earn more per barrel than the company pumping it, that the government doesn&#39;t care that thorium would make for a more equitable world. </p>

<p>If no university will discuss thorium, if no climate scientist will discuss thorium, and there is no debate about it, then why would you expect people to discuss controlled demolition? Why would you assume you understand their motivations and tech? </p>

<p>Edit: it to thorium.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a renovation of all the elevator shafts completed within days of attack. These shafts give access to the columns required to perform a controlled demolition. It went on for months before it. Guess who is on the board of the company who ran that specific security assignment, Marvin Bush, brother if George Bush. That company also did the security for the Military base that the Anthrax came for at that same time. Can&#39;t make this stuff up, it&#39;s freakin hilarious. Oh sorry all coincidence&#39;s.</p>

<p>I have argued with you on many occasions, thankyou for saying that you have been and continue to give me credibility, while at the same time discrediting yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? The audience would determine the winner and you wonder why no one would show? What the hell is the point of an expert coming if it&#39;s just left up to the  audience voting on the winner. An audience that would obviously be composed entirely of people who believe it was a demolition. Why would anyone walk into a place like that for the chance of winning 1000 dollars donated to a charity. As if they have any chance of winning, as if there already haven&#39;t been countless professionals who disproved the conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>You tell us. You&#39;re the only one here saying it would require thousands of people. That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking you why you think this. You can&#39;t respond with more questions as if I was the one making the assertion, you made it.</p>
