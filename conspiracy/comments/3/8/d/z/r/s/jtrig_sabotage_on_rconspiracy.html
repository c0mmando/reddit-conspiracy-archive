       I am just a regular guy investigating the flat earth possibility. I get that it isn't relevant to the current political situation and I can see how one can come to the conclusion that it is psyop. Maybe it is. Maybe it is not. Who knows, really.

       Keep going metabolix, this is THE conspiracy. The current "political situation" that  is the psyop. Turn off your TV tune into nature by going outside and experiencing nature. Get yourself a pair of binoculars or a telescope and test out flat earth on bodies of water. Watch the sun moon and stars intently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Planetariums never have to adjust their stars. Constellations have not changed for millenia. If you were to believe and actually do the actual mental work of just one year of spinning around at 1000 mph at a 67,000 mph spin around a 93 million mile away sun that is stated to be moving around a galactic center at 670,000 MPH you would quickly understand that if all these objects were moving at these speeds not on constellation would repeat year after year as we see perfectly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also telescopes have databases of 40,000 objects that remain the same today as they did 20 years ago when they first came out.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the government would lie about and propagate this myth which has taken in billions if not trillions of our money which would be due back to us and unenslave us as a society, this is my purpose and reason, to unenslave even those who will beg and cry to remain chained to a sick society based of lies and parasitic behavior.

       Or you could use network tools like tracert and ping to go around the entire world in seconds. ATARI games like Asteroids where you fly off the right side and reappear on the left side aren't an actual description of reality.

       Anyone from the Flat Earth society is suspect, the real one is the International Flat Earth Research Society. The former thinks that the earth is moving up and there is no gravity but a constant 9.8m/s2 upward push (ridiculous and discredits true flat earthers). Check out

       It changes the fact that the government has lied to you and you now have proof in your pocket to fight it. It changes your perspective completely when you really get it. You are no longer some tiny ant crawling on a tiny dust speck in an infinite mess of stars and planets. You are the reason this place exists. The sun moon and stars rotate around YOU! Since day one you have been told you are a piece of shit nobody, a nothing to adhere to rules like a good robot. No you are the reason for this place. This is incredibly empowering when you really grasp it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will also let you know very quickly who you are dealing with when it comes to truth. If they talk satellites, galaxies, globe etc. you know they are either ignorant or putting forth the NWO agenda willingly or not.

       You are so right.

       I remember feeling that way thinking of the implications. I don't know if most of the government themselves know. Maybe none of them know, remember the monkey and banana experiment?. I can't believe how right the saying is, "If you repeat a lie long enough, it becomes the truth". I don't even think I'll come to fully start seeing the way as flat. Some things are drilled way too far down in our heads.

       It takes awhile I am in month two of it as in my mind changing from round to flat. I research the topic 4-8 hours or so per day as I find it fascinating and still trying to come up with ways to disprove it to myself but I am now 100% convinced and not because I want to be I made a proclamation 3 years ago to search for truth and only truth. This is the biggest truth as it simplifies life. When the answer is simple god is answering, the devil is in the details LOL.

       Lol sure bro. That's the normal reaction to something like this. No what's not insane is we are spinning around at 1000 mph and whirling around a star at 67,000 mph and that star is spinning around the galaxy at 670,000 mph and somehow this has no affect on the same exact precisely measured positions of the stars that are preprogrammed into telescopes and planetarium for hundreds of years with none of the constellations ever drifting apart the same ones for the 40 years I have been on this plane.

       Dude at these supposed speeds and distances yes it would change you aren't thinking about the issue at all in one galactic rotation our viewpoints and stars would not and could not be the same yearly pattern we have seen for thousands of years. Think about it in 12000 years we would be on the other side of the galaxy. No way we would have been able to keep the same catalog of stars. Our perspective would change so dramatically we would need Peta bytes of storage to catalog them all. But no same ones for thousands of years year after year with eclipses perfectly measured by the ancients and that same model still works today perfectly.

       I really just had questions... but atleast I know what crowd is dving me asking a question. The same ones that want to keep the topic on how evil one certain creed is, and anything else is a psyop because we're so important here on the reddit, changing minds and opening eyes daily... And since you're the master of debunking and calling fraud, just prove to me the earth moves and not the firment. Explain that as we hurdle through space for thousands of years, certain star alignments, known as constellations, because they're constant, ever has and will be, don't shift. I mean, what's the odds of the whole universe moving in such perfect precision to maintain these observations for literally thousands of years. But you're right. You do this community a service by dving ppl like me and telling them not to ask questions about all that stuff. Nothing that isn't full of hate is ligit. Everything is the evil jews.

       You have someone ordering you to downvote and move along nothing to see here. I am telling you people this is the ONLY thing to see and learn for yourself. Check out Eric Dubay videos on youtube, check out stars are souls, hell just honestly research it for a week and do mental experiments. If I were a psyop what would there be to gain? The only gain I want are more people waking up to the reality and the harsh truth that what we (you and me both) have to do is admit we were wrong we have been lied to and the earth is for us not the 1%. This place is ours to enjoy, to plant seeds, to eat plants and not sentient beings, to love and care for one another, for truth to be spread more than the current paradigm of lies.

       We agree on this but I do not believe in a savior god as Squarehimself does. I believe Jesus is allegory for the sun. Am I anti-Jesus? No, I think that there is plenty of truth in the teachings of Christ but I have 0 faith in being saved by this man/god, I truly believe it is up to us as physically incarnate spiritual beings to help free our brothers and sisters from the tyranny we are already seeing around us and growing at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth shall set you free, and flat earth is truth albeit at first a very hard pill to swallow. It is also one that is the hardest to spread, I have had my life threatened, loss of family and friends over this but I am not going to stop ever until this is known by the 99%.

       Sorry man this guy praises law abiding citizens. Laws are jokes, if you are a truly good soul laws are like treating an adult like a child, offensive and not required. He does not comprehend truly who Lucifer is either. Lucifer is the sun, Luceifer's son was Jesus Christ

       God's law is not a joke. It is the law of the land and an eternal law. If you wish to live, you must obey God's law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christ is not the sun, but the Son of God. He was the word made flesh. Lucifer rebelled for exactly the philosophy you support; he exalted himself above God's law. That's why we were created... to judge between good and evil at the end of time. All will bow before Christ and say "Just and true are thy ways, oh God." - even the wicked before they perish eternally.

       No my friend I am referencing the part where he stated only jurors can go to heaven and that in order to be a juror you have to be a law abiding citizen. It is Lucifer who writes these laws via his freemason sun worshipping children. Man's law is a joke based on moral relativism (he who writes the law must be moral) but this simply is not the case. Everyday hundreds of false laws are passed daily around the world. There needs to be only one law and that is truth. True people won't murder or steal or rape. They know that everyone around them are different expressions of the one creator.

Do not allow an authority to dictate to you what is true, especially for this issue.  Also, consider the post history of the OP and what his motivations are.

       I've really noticed a huge uptick in these flat earth posts in the past couple weeks. Before it was hollow earth, and now it's flat earth. They don't want to discuss and debate about their
       <em>
        theory
       </em>
       . They're like evangelicals, they want to push their
       <em>
        truth
       </em>
       down your throat.
      </p>
      <p>
       And not one of them has told me how flat earth is a conspiracy. A conspiracy is a secret plan or meeting by two or more people with the intent to cause harm or wrongdoing. I fail to see how this information could cause harm or wrongdoing. It would just be some ridiculous April Fools prank. I'm done discussing with them, and I do down vote all of their posts because all it seems to me is they are here to discredit this sub.

       I'm pretty late to the party but I took a brief look, and the pro-flat earthers seem to rally around some universal formula that describes a perfect sphere (something like 8 inches per mile).
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, the fact is our globe isn't a sphere - it's a WGS 1984, EPSG:4326 (oblate spheroid) which certainly includes flat sections.  This is most definitely an organized disinfo campaign to associate conspiracy with flat earthers.

       I've actually been waiting for the MSM to latch onto it for no reason, and start trying to make conspiracy research synonymous with believing the earth is flat.

      <p>
       If you start hearing the MSM or Facebook trying to make that assertion, keep your eyes peeled for what the other hand is doing.

       The MSM is not going to attach any credibility or publicity to it whatsoever (other than quips that are extremely dismissive) because it's the truth. They don't want anyone getting any ideas or looking into it.

       Anyone from the Flat Earth society is suspect, the real one is the International Flat Earth Research Society. The former thinks that the earth is moving up and there is no gravity but a constant 9.8m/s2 upward push (ridiculous and discredits true flat earthers). Check out
