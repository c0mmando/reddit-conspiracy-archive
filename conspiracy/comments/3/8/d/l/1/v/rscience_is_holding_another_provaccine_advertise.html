       is my shadowbanned comment. I've pasted the comment below:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The key question is whether or not the transmission of measles has increased to the point where it may once again become endemic in the United States
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why? The recent 'outbreak' of measles at Disneyland was not only
       <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2015/03/putting-measles-into-proper.html">
        a strain of measles that no vaccine offered protection from
       </a>
       , but there were no complications or deaths that occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="http://healthsentinel.com/joomla/images/stories/graphs/us-measles.jpg">
        mortality rate from measles
       </a>
       had dropped to 1-2% in the United States in the 1930s, long before any vaccine. In first world conditions, measles is a "self-limiting infection of short duration, moderate severity, and low fatality," A. Langmuir, "The Importance of Measles as a Health Problem,"
       <em>
        American Journal of Public Health
       </em>
       , vol. 52, no. 2, 1962, pp. 1-4.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CDC website claims the MMR vaccine gives a lifelong protection against all measles: how is it even possible for an outbreak to occur among the vaccinated then, as we saw at Disneyland? If the MMR vaccine gives lifelong immunity, why do you need to keep getting new immunizations for it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile,
       <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000359.htm">
        100% vaccination rates for measles will not prevent an outbreak
       </a>
       . There is no 'eradicating' measles if only enough anti-vaxxers get out of the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreso,
       <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/21228451">
        "with widespread administration of the measles vaccine, we expect that the incidence of modified measles will increase in the future"
       </a>
       , i.e. the more you attempt to vaccinate the more you will introduce measles into the population. The CDC link on measles notes a resurgence in measles in the 1990s in the US, and this is exactly what we would expect from increasing the rate of measles vaccinations.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the US, you have a
       <a href="http://healthimpactnews.com/2015/zero-u-s-measles-deaths-in-10-years-but-over-100-measles-vaccine-deaths-reported/">
        higher chance of dying from the measles vaccine than due to measles
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also indications that the vaccine leads to measles susceptibility in children. Breastfed infants of vaccinated mothers have nearly three times the risk of measles infection than those of naturally immune mothers. "Infants whose mothers were born after 1963 are more susceptible to measles than are infants of older mothers. An increasing proportion of infants born in the United States may be susceptible to measles," M. Papania et al.,
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10545585">
        "Increased Susceptibility to Measles in Infants in the United States"
       </a>
       ,
       <em>
        Pediatrics
       </em>
       , vol. 1045, no. 5, e59, November 1999, pp. 1-6. "Our results suggest that infants born to mothers who acquired immunity to measles by vaccination may get a relatively small amount of measles antibody, resulting in loss of the immunity to meales before the vaccination age," Hong Zhao, Pei-Shan Lu, Yali Hu, Qiaozhen Wu, Wenhu Yal, et al.,
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20444295">
        "Low Titers of Measles Antibody in Mothers Whose Infants Suffered From Measles Before Eligible Age for Measles Vaccination"
       </a>
       ,
       <em>
        Virology Journal
       </em>
       , 2010.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, measles can be treated simply with acute Vitamin A doses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given all of this, why are you personally afraid of an endemic measles, and why do you think vaccination is the solution?
      </p>
      <p>
       As a final question, which measles vaccine do you recommend? The MMR vaccine is currently still being recommended by the CDC. Meanwhile, The US government has been suing Merck for several years in an ongoing private case that alleges that Merck attempted to
       <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2014/09/10/did-merck-unfairly-monopolize-the-market-for-a-mumps-vaccine/">
        "defraud the United States through an ongoing scheme to sell the government a mumps vaccine that is mislabeled, misbranded, adulterated, and falsely certified as having an efficacy rate that is significantly higher than it actually is"
       </a>
       . Although this case has been ongoing for several years, all of the details are closed to the public and concerned individual citizens. Why should anyone take the MMR vaccine until they can see the details of seven years of litigation?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've posted an anti-vaxx comment and would really like a response, in the interest of furthering knowledge, regardless of which side of the fence you may be on.

       It doesn't look like any anti-vaxx questions made it through. Reading through the comments, the vast majority don't understand the anti-vaxx position at all: Jenny McCarthy was a useful propaganda tool.

       yeah, "flat earth society" has always been a parody for marginalizing people who question state science.  if there are people actually trying to push a flat earth theory, they're either really high or they're just trying to stir the pot.

       So... you dont believe anti-vaxxers because you are too wrapped up in logical fallacys?

      <p>
       Also a good portion of reptilian believers and flat earth believers are probably anti-vaxxers but certainly not the other way around. So your statement was false, and you actually have no reason to not believe anti-vaxxers.

       Straight startrails at the equator are consistent with the Flat Earth model, and if you had actually tried to understand the concept you could have answered that for yourself easily.

       I love this sub and most of the people in it. If you're being sarcastic you should stop. This is a forum to express and promote ideas. I can choose when to write a "smart" response or when not to. You should write comments to further discussion... not point out (sarcastically) whether or not I'm too smart for a sub. Don't judge me, you don't know my life.

        New Myths About the Measles Vaccine
       </p>
       <p>
        The first concern, which has been posted on anti-vaccination blogs, is that the vaccine protects against an “A” type of measles virus, while the kind that’s making everyone sick is a “B”-type virus. Therefore, the vaccine doesn’t protect against the kind of measles that’s making everyone sick.
       </p>
       <p>
        This idea is based in some truth, but it's wrong.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are different strains of measles virus. Each is given a letter and a number, for example B3 or D4. They refer to the genetic fingerprint of the virus. Since 1990, 19 different strains, or fingerprints, have been identified, according to the CDC, and scientists use these fingerprints to link infections during an outbreak.
       </p>
       <p>
        It’s also true that the vaccine protects against an “A” strain of the measles, while the strain going around in at least nine cases of this outbreak has been B3.
       </p>
       <p>
        But here’s where some people seem to be confusing the measles with the flu. With seasonal flu, the virus changes so much that they have to tweak the vaccine recipe each year in an attempt to alert the immune system to the circulating strain.
       </p>
       <p>
        The measles virus doesn't change as much. So showing the immune system one type of it through the vaccine is enough to protect the body against all types.
       </p>

       Authority is the bane of science. Believing anything on the word of authority is folly. It's not much different from believing a religion, because someone told you their book is the word of God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science, the process, is about skeptical, critical thinking. One tries to define a phenomenon and then disprove one's hypothesis. Science is not defending an idea by ignoring contradictory ideas and evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science, the religion, is about looking more intelligent to one's peers by parroting the latest "scientific" ideas of the time from trusted authorities. It is cowardly and not independent minded compared to science. One is relying on others for ones own thought and one can just blame that other if the ideas one propagates turn out to be false. Scientists don't trust, they test.

       Alright, another vaccination post, another opportunity to go higher....
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines are a bandaid, your immune system has already been trained to fight all these germs for thousands of millions of years, and the reason we fail to fight them today and have to go through epidemies is because of our way of life (urban density, terrible diet...)
      </p>
      <p>
       To make a long story short, your immune system works best at electronic balance. In your tissues is water, and a property of water is the amount of electrons it can give or take from its environment and/or visitors. As you might intuitively expect, either extremes will result in the destructions of your tissues, if you remove electrons from a cell, things will go wrong, if you bombard it with electrons, things will also go wrong. Electronically damaged tissues is a necessary requirement for a demographic explosion of pathogens to occur, whether viral, bacterial, fungal or algaeal. Interestingly, they all have four-polar opposite requirements, but none lies in the middle, and that's the key.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of our liquid intake today, including mineral water, is oxidizing. It goes everywhere in our body, and favors the development of virus/fungal infections  (and because of the polar nature of the repartition, prohibits the development of bacteria/algae infections). If you stop drinking oxidizing liquids (aka if you start drinking pure water), you leave very very very little room for infections, so little that your immune system will easily take all challengers (it has already defeated them multiple times along your lineage) and then you don't need vaccines to begin with, you naturally get their benefits by catching and beating all the germs live.
      </p>
      <p>
       Less than 100ppm mineral salts water, 1 liter minimum per day, whichever brand or purifying process you fancy, and you are done with infections. It takes discipline the first few weeks, especially when you come from a 2 liters of coke per day intake, but eventually, it becomes natural and effortless, and then you can laugh at all the people sneezing their way through winters and vaccines.
