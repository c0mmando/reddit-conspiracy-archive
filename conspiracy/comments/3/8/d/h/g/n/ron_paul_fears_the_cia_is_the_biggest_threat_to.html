        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-06-02/ron-paul-fears-cia-biggest-threat-americans-liberty">Source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>As the Senate scrambled to pass the USA Freedom Act this evening, reinstating the agency’s ability to spy on Americans, Ron Paul points out that <em>US intelligence organizations have always – and will continue – to operate outside the law;</em> with Daniel McAdams noting the CIA &quot;is sort of the President’s own Praetorian Guard.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="http://sputniknews.com/us/20150601/1022829335.html">As Sputnik News reports,</a> before Americans applaud a minor step toward transparency, Paul warns that they should <em>recognize the corrosive nature of the CIA, &quot;They are a secret government,&quot; operating way above the law, and are &quot;way out of control.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;[The CIA] is sort of the President’s own Praetorian Guard,&quot; Daniel McAdams, from the Institute of Peace and Prosperity, said on the Ron Paul Liberty Report. &quot;We know…that he sent assassination squads, he sent people to monitor Martin Luther King, and all sorts of things like this.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This is like his own personal army which is accountable to no one,&quot; McAdams adds.</p>

<p>As Sputnik News reports, according to Paul, the CIA could be an even bigger threat to liberty than McAdams suggests. A covert army that doesn’t answer to Congress, the Supreme Court, or even the president.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;That, to me, was the most frightening experience in Washington, is there were black budgets. We never knew exactly how much money was spent,&quot; Paul says.</p>

<p>&quot;Those secret budgets have allowed the CIA to carry out some pretty shady practices over the years. Chiefly, assassinations.</p>

<p>&quot;There are certainly a lot of theories about the CIA being involved in even domestic assassinations, and they certainly are now involved in presidential directed assassinations,&quot; Paul says.</p>

<p>&quot;The US has covertly and overtly influenced elections overseas a number of times,&quot; McAdams says. &quot;It’s a very open secret that the CIA infiltrates monitoring organizations like the OSCE with their personnel.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For some, the USA Freedom Act and similar legislation may be the best way to rein in renegade intelligence agencies. But as Paul notes, many laws already exist to implement limitations. These laws are routinely ignored.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;They are a secret government,&quot; Paul says of the CIA. &quot;Way out of control.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nevertheless, Paul ends on an optimistic note, pointing out that young Americans are tired of the status quo and fed up with broad government overreach.</p>

<p>&quot;In a true republic, there is no place for an organization like the CIA,&quot; Dr. Paul says, quoting former FBI agent Dan Smoot. &quot;I think he’s closer to the truth than a lot of what’s going on today.&quot;</p>

<p>We should also remember that BlackWater was an <a href="http://rt.com/usa/blackwater-cia-extension-prince-273/">extension of the CIA</a> and was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/10/AR2010021004029.html">responsible for problems</a> it created in Baghdad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found this link in another thread last night and watched this video. It is 3 hrs, but it is a quick and engaging watch. It fits well with your post because of the in depth look at the CIA, its inception, and its relationship with the mob. It is very interesting to see the past of the CIA and then read something like your post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really an offshoot, but the US brought in more Germans into the ranks of the CIA than there were Americans in it during Paperclip.</p>

<p>Add to that, the fact that many in the US financed the rise of fascism in Europe, and you start seeing some pretty hard to overlook coincidences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true, the Nazi spy ring in Russia was our only source of informations for many years. Now we know that they we&#39;re playing us against each others. Lies and exaggerations, thats all we really got in the end for our troubles (if you don&#39;t count the overblown budgets and government waste, and that sweet drug money, but we did trim down on all those freedom excesses) At the same time, the CIA almost exclusively recruited from the rich elite from the beginning to protect us vs socialism. They keep saying there is no class war, easy to say when only their side got an army. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CIA has been infested with people connected to Wall Street since its beginning. Look up &quot;Dulles CIA&quot;. This is why the CIA overthrew so many elected governments, the American business elites wanted it to be done. Perhaps business elites have made use of the domestic dragnet surveillance systems for their own uses too. How would we know when we accept such rampant secrecy, while simultaneously allowing private contractors to manage such covert systems? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just imagine Ron Paul pulls off a miracle and gets voted as the new President,  Once he&#39;s been briefed on what he can and can&#39;t do he&#39;ll do what all the other presidents have done.  Give the NSA, CIA and FBI more powers, ensure banks and insurance companies can rape you in the ass for even more money, change the name of Obamacare and quadruple everyone&#39;s medical insurance.  Basically, it&#39;ll get worse, it always gets worse!</p>

<p>The president has no power, they just do exactly as they are told.  They don&#39;t even write their own speeches, they have teams write everything they say for them.  Obama promised people equality, free health care, less invasion of privacy, less corruption, he promised to sort out Police departments etc.  Out of the two I&#39;d say Obama has the biggest cock, so is most likely to try to do something, he did nothing and Ron Paul will do even less!</p>

<p>Don&#39;t vote, just ignore all of them.  It makes zero difference whoever gets in &#39;power&#39;.  The President is actually less powerful than your fucking postman.  Look, if the powers that be want tyranny that&#39;s exactly what you&#39;re going to get.  It isn&#39;t worth giving any politician brain space, it&#39;s much like the belief in a powerful game changing God, no matter how much you pray he delivers nothing.  Politics is the same.  If Obama couldn&#39;t change anything then let&#39;s be honest, nobody can!</p>
