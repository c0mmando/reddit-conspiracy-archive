<p>The other day on The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett, they had a Flat Earther on, and holy shit was that guy ever smug for someone who believes the earth is flat. Even Richard, who always goes along with whatever his guest is discussing, could barely keep his contempt hidden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aliens are a conspiracy in that the amount of material produced to make them appear to be in government, or abducting people requires a conspiracy.  Quite telling is that the Disclosure Project is funded by our good friends, the Rockefellers (<a href="http://isgp.nl/Disclosure_Project_Steven_Greer_archive">http://isgp.nl/Disclosure_Project_Steven_Greer_archive</a> lots of other sources, not a secret).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I&#39;m sure there is life out there (space is pretty big) and I&#39;m even willing to believe that some other civilization could have visited before, or will in the future - yeah, I don&#39;t get the government thing.  Or believing that Nibiru is creeping up on is like a ninja. I don&#39;t get it.  </p>

<p>Also I don&#39;t know if it qualifies, but I also don&#39;t believe in &quot;the&quot; big bang (singular).  I believe there could have been multiple. If it happened once it could happen twice or three times.  Like I said, space is big.  No matter how colossally huge the big bang was, if you&#39;re far enough away you wouldn&#39;t even see it.  We also presuppose that it was the first.  What if it was the 2nd?  Or 200th?  What if they&#39;re was eons in between?  There&#39;s so many questions that hubris will never let us get to in any serious fashion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat earth, Chemtrails (please don&#39;t bite my head off), &quot;Jews&quot; being a central evil force, Judy Wood/noplane/energy weapons, obsessing over holocaust denial/revisionism, anything where heavy speculation of &quot;it didn&#39;t happen/crisis actors&quot; sets off BS detectors a bit, although less than the previous. I truly think a large percentage of conspiracy topics are deliberate black propoganda/disinformation for obvious reasons. Still also skeptical about &quot;vaccines&quot; being totally malevolent, although you certainly won&#39;t catch me getting any seasonal shots for 5$ at Walgreens...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the 9/11 Conspiracy: Basically the whole thing. If you take a logical look at it, theres simply no way the government would be able to do controlled demolition on all the buildings, no point in using a cruise missile over a plane, and just about every other point that is made about it can be debunked by logic, and just about all can be debunked by science.</p>

<p>Think of it this way, if it was used to justify the use of mass surveillance, force the invasions of Iraq/Afghanistan, wouldn&#39;t it be better to use a WMD such as a small nuke/chemical weapon rather than concealing the planes, missiles, controlled demolitions, and reporting aspects to all major new networks?</p>

<p>Edit: For the record: Just about all of the points of 9/11 HAVE been debunked, from controlled demolitions to steel beams to the &quot;Cruise missile&quot; that hit the pentagon.</p>

<p>Further edit: if you take it a look at it, THE CONSPIRACY ITSELF IS MORE OF A SCAM! Seriously, These &quot;Trutheres&quot; have made up SO MUCH PURE SHIT, 99% of it turns out to be bad photo-shops or entirely false. They all release these &quot;documentaries&quot; that spread the &quot;Truth&quot;, but THEY ARE MAKING MONEY OFF OF THIS.</p>

<p>Yes there is sketchy things about the 9/11 conspiracy, but most of them have been disproved, Including WTC 7 which collapsed due to fire damage that was not shown in many of the conspiracy theorists videos.</p>
