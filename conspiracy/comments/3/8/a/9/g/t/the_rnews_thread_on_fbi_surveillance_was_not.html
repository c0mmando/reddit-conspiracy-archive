<p>But, not before someone noticed that even before it got deleted, it was missing from the top of <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>.</p>

<p>That someone was able to make a comment IN THE THREAD ITSELF  ((you cannot make a comment in a thread that has been deleted)), </p>

<p>something like &quot;Hey, how come even though this post has 6000 Upvotes, it&#39;s down at the very bottom of this subreddit?&quot;</p>

<p>=== === === </p>

<p>Strongly suggests REDDIT mods were pressured by the government, to bury and delete the original <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> thread.</p>

<p>CONSPIRACY fans, take note!   </p>

<p>leads me to believe that the user who made the comment noticed that the post had been suppressed / pushed to the bottom of the listings, BEFORE the post was deleted  (((if the post had already been deleted, the user would not have been able to submit that comment!!)))</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this kind of thing fascinates me, i wonder a lot about information shaping - take facebook as an example, it has highly complex systems which determine what posts you actually see especially from groups - most people assume the reason for that is simply advertising but what if it&#39;s a bit more sinister, what if some stories aren&#39;t reaching the people most likely to be affected by them? </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example. there was recently a march through london which closed off parliament bridge but i didn&#39;t see anything about it on facebook before it happened, i did however see invites to the washington state marches that happened recently - as you might guess i&#39;m in london often but never been to Washington... I&#39;m also a member of various london bases protest groups such as occupy, and various anti-austerity campaign groups who were on the march...  weird, hu? </p>

<p>It&#39;d be really hard to say for sure if this was a coincidence, my fault, their fault, or some sinister bit of coding - but wouldn&#39;t it be the ideal way of censoring a post by only letting people who won&#39;t or can&#39;t react to it see it? It would be a simple thing to show it to people well connected to the groups but not people on the periphery thus limiting the expansion of the group. </p>

<p>I did see the &#39;fbi secret airforce&#39; story all over reddits front page, i&#39;m not an american - maybe if i was then i wouldn&#39;t have done? is that how it works? how could we tell if it was? </p>

<p>Maybe people are put into categories which determines vaguely what news they&#39;re more exposed to - of course we put ourselves into these to a degree but maybe it&#39;s moire overt also, maybe some computer analyses the metadata collected by the NSA and assigns tags which then shape our news - it sounds a bit absurd to imagine the government would do this but then the NSA, FBI secret air-force and all that surveillance stuff seemed even more absurd before we knew of it... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some idiots like a year and a half ago were talking about Marijuana On ESPN First Take&#39;s page and were completely uninformed. I replied with links and a lot of text. Every time I would submit, my comment would be removed. Im stubborn, so I typed it out again and copied it, so every time it would be removed I&#39;d paste it lol. I did it for about 30 minutes before changing a lot of my words up, using less &quot;key words.&quot; My comment stayed for a few minutes but was deleted again.
