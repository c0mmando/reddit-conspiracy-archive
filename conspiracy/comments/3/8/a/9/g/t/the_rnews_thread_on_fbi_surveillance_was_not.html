       something like "Hey, how come even though this post has 6000 Upvotes, it's down at the very bottom of this subreddit?"

       Strongly suggests REDDIT mods were pressured by the government, to bury and delete the original

       leads me to believe that the user who made the comment noticed that the post had been suppressed / pushed to the bottom of the listings, BEFORE the post was deleted  (((if the post had already been deleted, the user would not have been able to submit that comment!!)))

       I noticed this yesterday when the thread was linked here. There was no author and, despite it having thousands of upvotes, I literally couldn't find it on
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       . Reddit's turning into a PR arm for governments and corporations. More scary is the fact that the OP removed the thread, meaning he was more than likely pressured by either Reddit's admins or, worse, government agents.

       it's worth noting they can't possibly know that, all they can know at best is the Reddit servers report that it was removed by the user - if could be a server side lie or a hijacked user account.

       According to top Reddit scientists,
      </p>
      <p>
       in this case OP deleted his own thread,
      </p>
      <p>
       then ten minutes later deleted his own account.

       this kind of thing fascinates me, i wonder a lot about information shaping - take facebook as an example, it has highly complex systems which determine what posts you actually see especially from groups - most people assume the reason for that is simply advertising but what if it's a bit more sinister, what if some stories aren't reaching the people most likely to be affected by them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an example. there was recently a march through london which closed off parliament bridge but i didn't see anything about it on facebook before it happened, i did however see invites to the washington state marches that happened recently - as you might guess i'm in london often but never been to Washington... I'm also a member of various london bases protest groups such as occupy, and various anti-austerity campaign groups who were on the march...  weird, hu?
      </p>
      <p>
       It'd be really hard to say for sure if this was a coincidence, my fault, their fault, or some sinister bit of coding - but wouldn't it be the ideal way of censoring a post by only letting people who won't or can't react to it see it? It would be a simple thing to show it to people well connected to the groups but not people on the periphery thus limiting the expansion of the group.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did see the 'fbi secret airforce' story all over reddits front page, i'm not an american - maybe if i was then i wouldn't have done? is that how it works? how could we tell if it was?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe people are put into categories which determines vaguely what news they're more exposed to - of course we put ourselves into these to a degree but maybe it's moire overt also, maybe some computer analyses the metadata collected by the NSA and assigns tags which then shape our news - it sounds a bit absurd to imagine the government would do this but then the NSA, FBI secret air-force and all that surveillance stuff seemed even more absurd before we knew of it...

       Some idiots like a year and a half ago were talking about Marijuana On ESPN First Take's page and were completely uninformed. I replied with links and a lot of text. Every time I would submit, my comment would be removed. Im stubborn, so I typed it out again and copied it, so every time it would be removed I'd paste it lol. I did it for about 30 minutes before changing a lot of my words up, using less "key words." My comment stayed for a few minutes but was deleted again. Probably well over 20 submitted comments deleted. The censorship is real.

       leads me to believe that the user who made the comment noticed that the post was being suppressed / pushed to the bottom of the listings, BEFORE the post was deleted by OP  (((for if the post had already been deleted, the user would not have been able to submit the comment!!)))

       Honestly this place is a corporate and government shills paradise to manipulate public opinion, and it's becoming more and more obvious over time that is, really, what reddit is. Just one big public relations machine, with all of us as the marks. Looks like I'm going to be taking my business to voat.co more often. Let this place pull a myspace.
