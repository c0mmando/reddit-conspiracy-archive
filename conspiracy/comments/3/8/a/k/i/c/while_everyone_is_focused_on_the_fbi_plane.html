       I guess they can thank Chertoff for the airport cattle call for most of those aspects.  More than enough for drone identification through walls of just about everyone and why the scanners were only needed for a few years.

       The conspiracy is the conspiracy - it's all bullshit, all of it.  The Gvt leak secret documents on purpose, they have agents tell reporters things on purpose.  It's all designed to make you and me do precisely this - talk about them!  I worked in Gvt for 15 years and believe me, they couldn't run a fucking toffee shop, the highest positions are filled by utter morons.  On the tech side they employ people who get second and third class degrees, so they aren't getting the good technicians, they're getting the shit ones.  If Samsung can't do facial recognition properly yet then you can safely bet the farm on it that the Gvt are a million miles off from doing it.  They have fuck all!  Just a good line in bullshit.  They know we all fall for utter claptrap, so they just lie.  Take satellite imagery, for years we were told they could see you pissing up a lamppost.  However, the absolute best satellites are owned by private companies, and it takes several minutes to get a clear shot of ground level, because of atmospheric shit like clouds, dust, etc.  They can shoot in infra red, but the images are shitty, but can spot things like possible troop movements (big fuck off tanks and transporters) even then they must have an area of focus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop believing any of it.  Only a couple of years ago people were freaking out because airport X-ray could see your cock or pussy, based on fake sexed up images put out by the companies who make the devices, but the truth was it could just make out vague shapes, better than standard x rays, but sorry, no thick cocks or juicy pussy was visible.  It's all bullshit!  Yes, some things are doable, cloud seeding or adding nasty chemicals to aviation fuel.  But stop thinking the CIA have super tech, the cunts have only just ditched blackberries, they probably still use reel to reel..
      </p>
      <p>
       The best thing we can all do is simply ignore them.  Stop watching the news, don't even read alternative sites for 'news', if you see a politician on tv change the channel, if you see a political story change website.  Your life will continue just as it is, they only have power because you give it to them.  If you want them to fuck off just treat them like an annoying younger sibling, ignore them!  Don't vote, don't take any part in any political discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real conspiracies are your banks raping you in the ass, your medical insurance shooting through the roof, your gasoline costing way more than it should, your food companies making thousands of percent profit on your weekly shop, Apple employing slaves, charities all being set up as an expenses fund by rich people, religious and political groups involved in pedophile rings.  These are the conspiracies.    Things that truly effect your life in real ways.  Don't get hung up on the bullshit, the NSA are spying, great, more power to their fucking elbows and good luck with that.  Get the basics sorted before you even pay lip service to things that have zero effect on your life.

       You make a good point but I do think the CIA has high tech devices. They has access to technology we can barely dream of inculding warp drives and anti-gravity devices. They also have access to weaponized diseases and weather control including such things and HAARP and ebola.
