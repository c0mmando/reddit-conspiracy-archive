        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sorry for the jumbled mess of words. I&#39;m typing from my phone.</p>

<p>So Josh Duggar diddles little kids? I have a theory about the family. When Mr &quot;Pull Out Game Weak&quot; Duggar found out his son was molesting his siblings he waited till the statute of limitations on molestation ran out (3 years) before POGW Duggar took Josh to a close friend that he trusted who was a police officer to confess the crime. The cop who met with Josh Duggar was later convicted of child pornography charges and put in prison. Seem a little strange that the first legal authority that Mr Duggar took his son to see just so happens to be a pedophile? I think Mr Duggar knew to take Josh to that cop because he knew that the officer was a pedophile. Since pedophiles generally only trust other pedophile with their fucked up sexual desires the only way Mr Duggar would have know that is if Mr Duggar is a pedophile himself.</p>

<p>Okay, I laughed.  A lot.</p>

<p>Daddy Duggar gives me the creeps.  You know how you get the feeling that there&#39;s something about a person that&#39;s just not quite right, but you can&#39;t put your finger on what it is?  Yeah.  That.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s a pedophile; I don&#39;t even want to speculate.  But he&#39;s the kind of person I would avoid because...something is just off there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the misinterpretation that most people have with the word &quot;rights&quot; is that they&#39;re a tangible positive asset to the individual, when in reality, and the way they&#39;ve been defined by the bill of rights and the constitution, they&#39;re actually a tangible <em>neutral.</em></p>

<p>What I mean by that is this. Most people think of &quot;rights granted by the government&quot; as things that the government will allow them to do. The way your rights are defined in the appropriate two documents is actually things that <em>the government can not prevent you from doing, or things that the government can not interfere with you doing.</em></p>

<p>Think of it like this. You&#39;ve got a teenage son who wants to drive a car. You don&#39;t have the money to buy one, so he fires back with &quot;but it&#39;s my right to drive a car.&quot; Which you respond with, and rightfully so, &quot;no, it&#39;s a privilege.&quot; Driving a car is a tangible positive, it ADDS a thing to your life. You should never expect ANY &quot;rights&quot; from anyone that ADD things to your life. The only rights you should ever expect from the outside world - including the government - is the expectation that you are not blocked from obtaining those tangible positives for yourself.</p>

<p>So, the better response to your teen should include, &quot;actually, it is your right to not be prevented from obtaining a car, as you meet the consensus determined requisites to drive one.&quot;</p>

<p>So, both men and women share the same equal rights in the sense that neither gender should be prevented from obtaining the tangible positives they want. Men and women are, undeniably, biologically and mentally different, and as such, history has shown us that it&#39;s beneficial to treat them different in certain regards. Sometimes, too, history has fucked up: like <em>preventing</em> women from voting, which is a clear violation of rights.</p>

<p>The point I want to drive home here is that &quot;treating people differently based on gender&quot; does not necessarily mean that we&#39;re &quot;violating the other gender&#39;s rights.&quot; If both genders are not prohibited from doing things from the government, then they&#39;ve obtained equal rights. How women are treated differently than men is a completely different topic and shouldn&#39;t even be in the same sentence as &quot;rights.&quot; So &quot;women have a right to be treated equally as men&quot; is not true at all, because they don&#39;t - no one does. Take two men even: one individual man has no <em>right</em> to be treated equally as another man - so why would we say that the two genders have a right to be treated equally? Equal treatment is actually defined as a privilege. The correct phrase is &quot;women have the right not to be fucked with at the same level as men.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it though?</p>

<p>Is it?</p>

<p>Why am I going to treat an x like a y, when it&#39;s an x? Why am I going to treat a y like an x, when it&#39;s a y? That seems wrong to me. Example, dog breeds. Some require lots of space to play around, for others, a lap will do. Should the lap dog see no laps and open acres, while the other sees nothing but a high rise apartment? Everything is equal, right? No need to treat different breeds like they&#39;re different, just get a dog and they&#39;ll adapt to your living space, forget their inherent traits... they&#39;re &quot;social constructs&quot;. Right? Obviously not.</p>

<p>How do we know which dogs need what? Their genetics, and the patterns of their behavior. How do we know to treat x, like x, and y like y? <strong>Their genetics, and the patterns of their behavior.</strong></p>

<p>Equality is a scam. Women have always been the special class (second only to children, and even then, not always because they can make more (it&#39;s not &quot;Children and women first&quot;, is it?)), yet they scream from the rooftops to be demoted to manhood, so that they can be disposable and treated like shit, work all their lives, and probably die alone. Then wah, feelings, you can&#39;t say that (aka &quot;you can&#39;t make me feel that&quot;)... almost like, they were special.</p>

<p>Go ahead, downvote me Reddit. You fell for the scam, so now you have no choice but to double down, because to go back on your magical rainbowland beliefs would be <em>uncomfortable</em>... and we can&#39;t have your poor feelings dealing with discomfort...</p>

<p>Social construct my ass.</p>

<p>&quot;When you&#39;re used to being treated like you&#39;re special, equality seems like discrimination.&quot; How about we remove the glass floor in the work place? Do you want your mother/aunt/sister/daughter/niece doing long, hard, exhaustive, and potentially dangerous work when you are, by nature, better suited to those specific things? I would say obviously not, but equality says sure, that&#39;s fine.</p>

<p>That&#39;s dumb. </p>

<p>edit: Some of you probably haven&#39;t seen this. You should. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHgYPDvQFU8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHgYPDvQFU8</a> Cultural Marxism, there you go. Social justice, best to avoid, instincts and &quot;common sense&quot;, intuition, better.</p>

<p>Just, no.</p>

<p>No. </p>

<p>Black men prove you wrong by being successful, and <em>being able to pull their weight</em> (which, when put in a masculine situation, the average female won&#39;t be able to do (or, more specifically, would rather be doing something else, probably less intensive (both, most likely))). &quot;Business&quot; as people tend to know it, is white and masculine, but, there are black CEOs. Black people sold other black people into slavery. There were &quot;black CEOs&quot; before modern business came along. We&#39;re all descended from Africa, anyway. Why am I even... /sigh</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p><strong>Equal opportunity does not mean equal outcome.</strong> You cannot change millions of years by telling people it was just in their heads the whole time... when ironically, the truth is literally in their heads, and has been, this entire time.

<p>No.</p>

<p>The has been debunked by numerous sources, easily, across the entire internet. You have been misled by dishonest and manipulative data, promoted by people who don&#39;t give a shit about you really, only what they can gain from your &quot;democratic vote&quot;.</p>

<p>Women have the majority of degrees. And, since the middle of the 20th century, have accounted for more than 60% (these days, more in the 70% range), of all consumer spending.</p>

<p>So, if you guys make so little, not only would it be wisest for companies to hire women only (to save 24 cents per head, &quot;vagina tax&quot;, lol), but you wouldn&#39;t be able to spend so much. Where did that money come from? Certainly not from making .77 per 1. Where is all that oppression? Certainly not in the large abundance of &quot;higher educated&quot; women. Who are still demanding special treatment via social justice, because just womanhood isn&#39;t enough to push radical issues any more.</p>

<p>Put your emotional reaction aside for just a moment (because emotions should not shape a world view), and do your own research on the subject. Look at both sides, and see what they have to say. Or, rather, educate yourself on the other side since &quot;Team Woman&quot; has inculcated you to this nonsense, and you probably know that side very well.</p>

<p>Go watch Feminists debate on youtube (especially when they pull up this statistic). They lose. Every time. It&#39;s a scam. Ideological warfare. Turn our women against us, and watch men stop giving a shit. Everything will go to hell, and the corporations can have/do whatever they please because no one cares enough to do anything while being busy with in-fighting over race/two sided politics/gender/whateverisnecessarytokeepthemdistracted. It&#39;s already happening, and probably won&#39;t stop. So, congratulations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, and exceptions prove the rule.</p>

<p>I made less than a woman doing the same job, until my probation was over, now we make the same, despite the fact that she&#39;s picked up after by numerous men on staff as a result of not holding her weight in a masculine environment. I&#39;m trying to be promoted, which cuts into my actual work costing me actual dollars, she continues dropping the ball in her existence at a cost of nothing.</p>

<p>Try to call her out?</p>

<p>Emotions.</p>

<p>Does my anecdote invalidate yours?</p>

<p>The data you cite accounts for millions of people. Your world view is not their world vew, and many women can talk about how they make more as a result of being there longer, or having more responsibilities despite the job title being the same. <strong>You shouldn&#39;t have to choose between a career and children.</strong> Nor should you be told that a career is the only way to go. You&#39;ve all traded husband for &quot;the man&quot;, and now both heads of a home must work to survive in a fucked up economic system which takes advantage of everyone... Women in particular... You guys hold the majority of degrees? This means you probably also own majority of student loans. Look into what a racket the current post secondary education system is.</p>

<p><strong>These people who feed you nonsensical data do not give a fuck about you. At all.</strong></p>

People should earn their wage fairly; if she&#39;s dragging everyone down, she&#39;s a liability that is costing your company in reduced productivity.  See, I also believe in the equality of getting your ass fired if you are bad at your job, whatever genitalia you possess.  Right now, it sounds like your group is enabling her bad behavior.

<p>Arkansas law on sexual indecency with a child sucks! In Texas if you were raped/molested as a minor you have 2 years after you reach the age of majority to report it before the statute of limitation is blown. So if you were molested at the age of 8 you can report it up until you&#39;re 20. </p>

<p>Funny thing is, recently someone interviewed the convicted pedophile and he totally threw the Duggars under the bus.

<blockquote>
<p>But women can be just as strong as men???</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Just, no.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Black men are stronger, faster, and all around much better suited for intensive labor, therefore they should be treated as such. White men should only do work that is non-labor intensive due to the difference in racial phenotype.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. </p>

<p>Black men prove you wrong by being successful, and <em>being able to pull their weight</em> (which, when put in a masculine situation, the average female won&#39;t be able to do (or, more specifically, would rather be doing something else, probably less intensive (both, most likely))). &quot;Business&quot; as people tend to know it, is white and masculine, but, there are black CEOs. Black people sold other black people into slavery. There were &quot;black CEOs&quot; before modern business came along. We&#39;re all descended from Africa, anyway. Why am I even... /sigh</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Equality opposes both this statement and yours because instead of attempting to create limitations it welcomes adversity and change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.</p>

<p><strong>Equal opportunity does not mean equal outcome.</strong> You cannot change millions of years by telling people it was just in their heads the whole time... when ironically, the truth is literally in their heads, and has been, this entire time. Yet equality &quot;sounds good&quot; and &quot;feels good&quot;, and of course, don&#39;t want to be excluded, or called bad names, so sure, let&#39;s defend it. Right? </p>

<p>No.</p>
