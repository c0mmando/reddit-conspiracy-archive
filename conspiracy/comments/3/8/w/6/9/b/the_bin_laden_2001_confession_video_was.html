        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;Monitor&quot;, the name of a German investigative program similar to <em>60 Minutes</em>, asked two scholars of the Arabic language to independently analyze the claimed 2001 bin Laden confession video. The video, released by the US Department of Defense, was touted as iron-clad proof of bin Laden&#39;s guilt by the Bush administration. </p>

<p>There are numerous problems with the Pentagon translation. The first scholar, Abdel El M. Husseini, points out that the &quot;passages which are the most important, the ones supposed to prove bin Laden&#39;s guilt, are not identical to the Arabic sound.&quot;</p>

<p>Below follows a table comparing the Pentagon and independent translation of particular phrases in the tape. </p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th align="center"></th>
<th align="center">Pentagon Translation</th>
<th align="center">Independent Translation</th>

<tr>
<td align="center"><strong>Example 1</strong></td>
<td align="center">&quot;We calculated <strong>in advance</strong> the number of casualties from the enemy.&quot;</td>
<td align="center">&quot;We calculated the number of casualties from the enemy.&quot;</td>

<td align="center">&quot;We had notification since Thursday that the event would take place that day.&quot;</td>

<td align="center">&quot;We asked each of them to go to America.&quot;</td>
<td align="center">&quot;It was expected of them [inaudible] &quot;</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The first example indicates no prior knowledge on bin Laden&#39;s part about the events of 9/11. Dr. Murad Alami, the other independent translator, states that there is no instance of &quot;in advance&quot; in the recording.  </p>

<p>Neither of the two independent translators who examined the tape found any instance of those words. He adds that there&#39;s no potential for misunderstanding that portion either; there&#39;s a distinct difference between the clauses in the Arabic. </p>

<p>It would not be possible for an academic translator working for the Pentagon, therefore, to make what would presumably be a basic mistake in translation. </p>

<p>If we infer from the independent translation, it seems that the people in the tape were simply watching the live broadcast of the attacks and assessing the possible number of deaths, like everybody else. </p>

<p>The second example shows that there is no clear indication <em>which</em> Thursday that the suspects in the tape are talking about. </p>

<p>Quoting Dr. Alami:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Previous&quot; isn&#39;t there. In the original Arabic version, it&#39;s impossible to hear the clause that the event would take place this day or that day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The third example, &quot;We asked each of them to go to America.&quot; </p>

<p>Quoting Dr. Alami:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Using &#39;we&#39; in the translation is incorrect. In the original Arabic version that I heard it says: &#39;It was expected of them&#39;. What comes after that, sentence or subclause, is inaudible. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly what was expected of the alleged hijackers, then, is not known, from that portion of the tape. This could have been in any context. </p>

<p>These examples, amongst others in the tape, throw the tape&#39;s claimed value into doubt. </p>

<p>Dr. Gernot Rotter, scholar of Islamic studies at the University of Hamburg, leave us with this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regardless of the question if bin Laden was actively involved in the attacks or not... This tape is of such poor quality that many passages are unintelligible. And those that <em>are</em> intelligible, have often been taken out of context, so that you can&#39;t use that as evidence. The American translators who listened to the tape, and transcribed it, obviously added things that they wanted to hear in many places. Things that can&#39;t be heard - never mind how often you listen to it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The video itself may be genuine, but the Pentagon translation certainly isn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I pity you guys in america for a long time now because of your government, the world also suffers because of it. I just hope all the corruption will come to an end and that the Lobby will slowly come to an end too. That&#39;s what I dream for, may stay just a dream.</p>

<p>For example if we look at all the incidents that have been already revealed and confirmed to be true (the conspiracies) that people either don&#39;t know about them or don&#39;t even take into consideration after all those that they could still continue with such actions and the worst thing that they don&#39;t question anything. Just horrible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can ask the same question of the Pentagon translators. </p>

<p>Why does it take one, perhaps several, presumably academic level
translators to translate the tape (in the case of the Pentagon)? Why couldn&#39;t they just a grab a person off the street? They are six million people who speak Arabic in the U.S., after all. </p>

<p>Well, there are several good reasons.</p>

<p>First, the talent pool for translation is limited by the quality of the tape. There are several portions, as pointed out, that could not be accurately transcribed due to their being inaudible. There are other portions which would be only suitable for expert translation. Native Arabic speakers simply wouldn&#39;t be qualified for their native status alone. I would not ask a person off the street, even if they had some familarity with the language, to translate a legal document or other sensitive matters. That person would likely not be familiar with the required formalisms. And I&#39;m certain the bin Laden confession video is such an example of a sensitive document. </p>

<p>Second, linguistic scholars normally have a grasp on their language of study that native speakers of the language do not. This is not to mean they&#39;re more proficient in the same language, but there are a larger number of irregularities which would be captured by an academic-level translator that would fly over the head of a native speaker, simply because the linguists have likely studied the morphology, etc. of the language more in-depth compared to native speakers. A native-speaker of English buying into prescriptivism might tell you that &quot;ain&#39;t&quot; isn&#39;t a gramatically correct word...the linguist would disagree. </p>

<p>Formal speech, casual speech, slang, intended meaning, the subtleties of spoken language could only be effectively captured by expert level translation, someone familiar with the ins and outs of how people use language. </p>

<p>Thirdly, both translations were within a couple of months of the tape being found and broadcast. The tape has a limited channel of distribution. Likely it would be found by soldiers in the house in Jalalabad, then transported and sent to some federal agency for authentication, and then sent to another agency for processing (format conversion, subtitling, etc.), translation, and finally distribution. This limits the number of people who&#39;d handle the original audio on the tape. </p>

<p>&quot;Not one of them pointed this out before?&quot; It was pointed out within a month or two of the tape&#39;s release. The limited talent pool for translation, in addition to the limited distribution channel for the tape, means that there&#39;s only a few people who&#39;d handle the tape. </p>

<p>This further means that we don&#39;t know how the original audio on the tape was translated. The independent analysis shows that the Pentagon translators added words they wanted to hear which simply weren&#39;t present.</p>

<p>By your logic, the Pentagon should crowdsource translations of ISIS videos, since there are six million people in the U.S. who speak Arabic. They should thus expect the same quality in translation as with expert-level translation. But that would be silly for the Pentagon to do so, no?</p>
