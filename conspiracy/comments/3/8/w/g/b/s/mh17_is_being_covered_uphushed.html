       I don't know why you're being downvoted. MH17 was basically used as an excuse to demonize russia even though the actual evidence points towards kiev downing the plane.

       Downvoting is a usual practice for those with no arguments or whatsoever. But it is funny how every1 screamed about the MH17, while almost 1 year after the event, nothing is proved.

       Otherwise, how would they justify the through the roof military budgets in NATO countries and the U.S. itself. Or just the U.S. cant stand and doing nothing while Russia is slowly being reborn. You cannot just go and attack them to cut their rebirth, this is why they need to create a pretext. Then again how would they keep americans in fear if there is no fear of... communism, terrorists, revolution, bank crash etc.

       The evidences are against Russia and every time that the Russian version is debunked they invent a new version like if people in the were was so stupid to forget about the previous one, the Russian tv proudly confirmed the downing at the beginning cause they believed that it was an Ukrainian military plane then as soon as it was clear that they've committed a slaughter of western civilians they changed the news without any shame

       we litterally have the telephone conversations of the rebels that shot it down with saying to their FSB handlers that they just shot down another Ukrainian military transport, which was intercepted minutes after the downing of MH17. We even have video of them driving to the wreckage while on the phone with their Russian handlers joyous about what just happened - and then turn into not so happy campers when they find all the civilian passports.

       No we don't.  We have a

       The conversation is very clear and with a distinct Rostov-on-Don dialect state that they shot down the plane. There is no grey area or misinterpretation of the phone conversations and self published tweets hailing victory about shooting down a transport, published immediately after the event.

       Funny how the forensic evidence points towards a military aircraft taking down MH-17, and not a BUK launcher as is claimed by kiev and the west.

       Right. So where's your evidence again? EDIT: Downvotes for what? Asking for evidence? Really? I post a picture with evidence (however tenuous that might be) and get downvoted when I ask for anything competing? I can discredit any source, but if you don't have a competing source then don't downvote for me asking for it.

       the audio of the discussion on the phone has even been confirmed by one of the people in the conversation, Nikolai Kozitsin (pro russian cossack leader in lugansk).

       when asked 'do you know who shot it down?', he answers "a missile"
      </p>
      <p>
       RT quoting the makers of BUK who say it was shot down by a missile.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://rt.com/news/264205-buk-manufacturer-mh17-ukraine/">
        http://rt.com/news/264205-buk-manufacturer-mh17-ukraine/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "The BUK missile manufacturer revealed its own findings into the flight MH17 downing over Ukraine, effectively proving that a missile type consistent only with the Buk-M1 system was used – one that the Russian armed forces do not possess."
      </p>
      <p>
       so, you've got a seperatist leader, RT news, and the russian manufacturer of the BUK missile system all saying they believe it was shot down by a missile, not a plane.

      <p>
       Right, and in the very same article is claims that russian forces do not possess these types of launchers. Even if the claims are true that russian forces are aiding the rebels, it would stand to reason that the rebels could not shoot down a plane with equipment that they do not possess. They didn't start with BUK systems, and the russians do not have buk-m1s so therefore they aren't responsible...unless I'm missing an implication here?

       I don't accept anything. I look for evidence. Much of the evidence provided in the photos points towards either a SAM or possibly cannonfire or missile fire from a plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to your transcript/recording (vice lol) the commander believes it was a missile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, it's still not evidence that the russians instigated it as it's well known kiev has these types of launchers, and your source even indicates the russians/pro russian forces do not...
      </p>
      <p>
       On a side note, linking vice is like linking snopes. A mainstream rag with an agenda. Their hack job on ghaddafi and assad are evidence enough of this let alone all the rest of the shit they push.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your source that you are using as evidence still points out it was almost certainly the kiev government that fired:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Almaz-Antey has evidence that the BUK-M1 air defense missile system and accompanying missiles have been still deployed with the Ukrainian Armed Forces in 2005. According to their evidence, they had a total of 991 9M38M1 missiles at the time - Malyshev

       Ukraine never did this. the plane fell in a contested area, more in the separatist zone and separatist prevented investigators from getting to the crash site. Separatist also looted from corpses, removed parts of the plane, and other shady stuff.

      <p>
       What do yo mean by this? The US already has given what it had. Its already been proven it was separatist that downed the plane, the evidence is overwhelming. The report isn't finished yet.

       That's not what happened at all, and the black box does magically give you every answer.  They couldn't learn much from the black box considering the plane was hit and decompressed immediately.

       the Putler mercenaries blocked access to the crash site.

       Try using something else than Putler propaganda. I don't like the Russian lying narrative, which targets conspiracy theorist, being thrown around.

       You are blaming the civilians because Pulter mercenaries were to drunk or stupid to differentiate between a civilian plane and military? Like i said, in many war zones nobody has had a problem.

       as for your questions:
       <br/>
       1) what is your point wiht this question? whether there was a nolfy zone is irrelevant
       <br/>
       2) how would they know? (im not aware the Ukrainians made the plane change course. I thought the pilot controlled that).
       <br/>
       3) don't know. (dunno why why this would be important)
       <br/>
       4) do not know.
      </p>
      <p>
       see the answers? this is what happens when you ask these questions on a reddit sub: no answers, just more uncertainty.
if you really wanted to known the answers, you should ask these questions in places you'd actually get answers.

       Therefore i conclude you are shilling for someone, and trying to plant doubt in redditors minds.

       you arent seriously seeking answers. If you were you'd take a serious approach 
russian sites
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       say bellingcat's analyses are fake. its RTs job to d that.  (not that they are wrong about everything. But when its pro Russia you have to be skeptical.)
      </p>
      <p>
       1) the plane was shotdown. whether there was a no fly zone is irrelevant;
       <br/>
       2) globalresearch is poorly sourced opinion. we'd all like to know what really happened to mh17.
      </p>
      <p>
       you havent explained the importanc eof your other questions.
       <br/>
       Clearly you are not interested in truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       who are you shilling for? RT? Globalresearch? or are you a limited hangout for bush?
      </p>
      <p>
       only shills ask to skype as they know a persons location can be obtained from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       now: you should go and have a good think about what you're doing. is this really how you want to earn a living?

       Yep. Anyone that quotes Bellingcat is either:-
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the most ignorant people on Earth

      <p>
       or

      <p>
       Is deliberately trying to deceive people.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of Bellingcat's stuff is faked, fabricated or otherwise false.
      </p>
      <p>
       (And it's not just fake on Ukraine. His stuff on the Sarin gas attack in Damascus in August 2013 was a whole bunch of lies too.)

       Here is ZetaTalk on the MH-17 shootdown &amp; Ukraine's intentions:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        &amp;nbsp; Creating a tragedy to induce partners to enter into a war is certainly nothing new. The US has been accused of doing this at Pearl Harbor to allow the US to engage during WW II and the Gulf of Tonkin incident allowing the US to engage during the Vietnam war. Only months ago an incident with poison gas in Syria was shown to be an attempt to draw the US into a war with Syria on behalf of Israel. Despite the vote showing that the majority of people in the southeastern Ukraine region want to be considered Russian,
        <strong>
         the leadership in the Ukraine is furious that neither NATO or the US is fighting on their side.
        </strong>
        In that Putin was reported to be overhead on the same path as MH 17 just minutes before the shootdown, this is also an attempt to aggravate Putin to engage.
       </p>
       <p>
        &amp;nbsp; The world will resist these attempts, but the truth of who actually shot down MH 17 will likely never be admitted by the west.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        &amp;nbsp; This high level discussion is clearly about the Ukraine conflict, which has again heated up. Both sides are again pointing fingers and claiming the other side started the shelling. As it is clear that Kiev has never been truthful about the shootdown of MH 017, which was without a doubt brought down by those in Kiev with their SU 25 fighter jets so clearly caught on radar. The 30 mm bullet holes where the pilot of the plane sat are proof beyond a doubt. Yet the West does not provide this to the public, but rather continues to state that Russia is somehow responsible. The downing of MH 17 and Kiev’s attempts to frame the Russian separatists did not rally NATO to attack the separatists on behalf of those in Kiev, and NATO members knew the truth even if it was not publicly admitted...
       </p>
       <p>
        &amp;nbsp;
        <strong>
         The solution here is for the West to admit they have a problem child, and refuse to allow Kiev to use western media as a propaganda tool.
        </strong>
        This is unlikely to happen, but rather yet another standoff.

       Your correct.
       <br/>
       It has all the hallmarks of past CIA projects of the like.  Implicitly.  The agreement between Dutch, aus, Malay for releasing information, Ie air traffic control recordings and black box info, why Obama was so quick to address it even though there was no real connection to USA in terms of the accident or victims at all.  Why are usa so vocal? It was their job.  Another operation by design that was a huge fail.

       My two cents;

       Ukraine was using civilian aircrafts as human shields for its jet-strikes. The team (Russian/Crimean/Donbass soldiers) over the BUK was completely isolated, certainly radio-silenced, and relying only on their radar. How MH17 was apparently being "escorted", they mistook it for a carrier and shot it down. Only later realizing their mistake.

       A few points supporting this include how post-MH17 Kiev completely stopped with air-raids, there have been none since the incident. While initially successful, their airstrike capabilities were cut short by MAA and manpads, by using civilian aircrafts as shields and leaving the airspace open gave their jets both cover, and possibility to rise above the reach of manpads and Strela (?) systems. How despite western investigations and obvious outcries, Washington has done little to actually pinpoint a cultprit.

       Well... nope. BUK system is a complicated one and it need more than a dozen high qualified soldiers to do the job. Plus at the moment it was only Putin's airplane at the area with similar visual.

        That's your first strike there. Horrible website, that is discredited on its name alone.

       Discredited by the name "global research"? Ok.

       Ahh the classic "was discredited long ago" argument. Please elaborate.

       I'm still waiting to see evidence it was the rebels, I have already posted evidence it was kiev.
