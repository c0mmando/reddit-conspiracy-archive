        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ll keep it short and concise, but I have been getting ready to go to a wedding this weekend. I have not bought a suit in over 6 years and I wasn&#39;t planning on buying another one, but this past week I have been talking to my mom about making a trip to Joseph A Bank to buy a new white button down because my old one is a little tight around the neck.</p>

<p>5 minutes ago I made a random search for some Witcher game info and it gave a full ad for Joseph A Bank.</p>

<p>I am NOT a paranoid person (at least I wasn&#39;t until now). It has never crossed my mind that I might be being watched autonomously. But I had never even spoken about Joseph A Bank until this week and seeing it suddenly advertised on my phone has me incredibly perplexed and concerned.</p>

She never set anything up on her phone like her work schedule etc... Her phone recognized the patterns and times that she goes and leaves work... and assumes that she is going home...</p>

<p>That was really creepy... she disabled that &#39;feature&#39; on her phone... Just remember they are listening.. with gps they know where you go everyday and how long you spend there... </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Searched for places to get a suit made. </p></li>

<li><p>Instant messaged about a wedding on Facebook or any other social app/website</p></li>

<p>They don&#39;t have to be listening to your phone calls to know you need a suit. They just need to know that you&#39;re going to a wedding soon and you&#39;re male. It&#39;s probably a coincidence that it was a Jose Bank&#39;s ad, I mean it&#39;s pretty much either them or Men&#39;s Warehouse that you&#39;d see an ad for online right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s also possible that you may have communicated about going to the wedding by email (invites/calendar), which they certainly use to provide ads. You may have googled the location of the wedding, and if it&#39;s a place where weddings are commonly held, it wouldn&#39;t be had to surmise that you are attending a wedding and might need a suit. The algorithms are getting increasingly powerful and they can easily connect the dots based on seemingly unrelated information to deduce what you&#39;re planning to do.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t rule out that the phone is listening but there are other, easier, methods companies can target you with ads. <em>tinfoil hat salute</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>If any of your male friends on FB posted about a wedding or searched for suits you can bet that the advertisers paid to have ads shown to his IP address and those of all his FB friends.  When anybody does anything on FB, advertisers get access not only to all their information, but also those of all their friends.</p>

<p>Clarification Edit:  I&#39;m pretty sure some ad retargeting agency has figured out how to retarget FB friends.  I&#39;m not exactly sure how it could be done (gaining the friend&#39;s IP from a pure friend list).</p>
