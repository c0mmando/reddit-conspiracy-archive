       I'll keep it short and concise, but I have been getting ready to go to a wedding this weekend. I have not bought a suit in over 6 years and I wasn't planning on buying another one, but this past week I have been talking to my mom about making a trip to Joseph A Bank to buy a new white button down because my old one is a little tight around the neck.
      </p>
      <p>
       5 minutes ago I made a random search for some Witcher game info and it gave a full ad for Joseph A Bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am NOT a paranoid person (at least I wasn't until now). It has never crossed my mind that I might be being watched autonomously. But I had never even spoken about Joseph A Bank until this week and seeing it suddenly advertised on my phone has me incredibly perplexed and concerned.

       Your phone is constantly recording everything you say and the content of your conversations is being used to sell ads. This was proven by a kid that left his FB messenger on near telemundo for a night (he started getting all spanish ads the next day). Strange times right?

       This has happened to me multiple times.  My girlfriends phone, when she goes to leave work it tells her how long it will take to get home.  She never set anything up on her phone like her work schedule etc... Her phone recognized the patterns and times that she goes and leaves work... and assumes that she is going home...
      </p>
      <p>
       That was really creepy... she disabled that 'feature' on her phone... Just remember they are listening.. with gps they know where you go everyday and how long you spend there...

       Have you done any of the following things?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Searched for places to get a suit made.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Searched for your local Jose Bank's
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Instant messaged about a wedding on Facebook or any other social app/website
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         RSVPed to a wedding event on Facebook or any other "wedding plans" website
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Otherwise searched for, instant messaged about, or participated in any wedding-related stuff online?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       They don't have to be listening to your phone calls to know you need a suit. They just need to know that you're going to a wedding soon and you're male. It's probably a coincidence that it was a Jose Bank's ad, I mean it's pretty much either them or Men's Warehouse that you'd see an ad for online right?

       I can confidently say that I haven't searched for a Jos A Bank or signed up for any events. I've always known about the Jos A bank that I would go to so there was no need to search for a place to get a suit tailored etc. I rarely Facebook at all anymore so I haven't posted about it either.

       As others have said, it may be a commercial app on a mobile device scraping voice data, but never discount the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon...

       In other words, it could be a coincidence - the ad jumped out at you because you had Joseph A Bank on your mind.

       it's also possible that you may have communicated about going to the wedding by email (invites/calendar), which they certainly use to provide ads. You may have googled the location of the wedding, and if it's a place where weddings are commonly held, it wouldn't be had to surmise that you are attending a wedding and might need a suit. The algorithms are getting increasingly powerful and they can easily connect the dots based on seemingly unrelated information to deduce what you're planning to do.

      <p>
       I wouldn't rule out that the phone is listening but there are other, easier, methods companies can target you with ads.

       Yeah this is pretty common information in the conspiracy world. Certain apps record words. It's a major area of concern. You are not necessarily being watched it's just that these apps are looking to monetize what people speak about.

       It's a computer system that catches words for adverts. It has serious potential for abuse, but I don't think the data is actually being used for anything other than providing adverts. I don't think it should be happening but you fb peeps need to read you license agreements and choose not to use apps that gather to much information. Divest instead of protest. Take responsibility for you choices don't expect companies to do it for you

       Crazy how unexpected ads like that happen, right? After I talked to a marine recruiter before graduating high school I was seeing ads for the marines almost every time I opened up my browser.

       If any of your male friends on FB posted about a wedding or searched for suits you can bet that the advertisers paid to have ads shown to his IP address and those of all his FB friends.  When anybody does anything on FB, advertisers get access not only to all their information, but also those of all their friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clarification Edit:  I'm pretty sure some ad retargeting agency has figured out how to retarget FB friends.  I'm not exactly sure how it could be done (gaining the friend's IP from a pure friend list).
