        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The purpose of the conference would be two-fold. The first would be to warn the public of the impending financial crisis, and possible currency collapse. As well as to warn them of the complicity of the lamestream media.</p>

<p>The second would be to discuss possible strategic actions we could take against the TPTB. Below are some that I have in mind, specifically related to finance, but would love to hear your suggestions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Delay payment on student loans and/or credit cards this summer.</li>
<li>Remove faith from the banks and switch completely to physical cash and cryptocoins.</li>
<li><del>Change payroll settings with HR to withhold nothing for the tax man. You can still pay taxes when the time comes but there is no reason to let them hold on to the money in the interim -- this is a convenience offered by payroll companies but not legally required.</del> (legality issues)</li>
<li>Convert all / significant fraction of savings (incl retirement accounts) to physical precious metals, bitcoins, and other hard assets.</li>
<li>Sign an anti-violence, anti-suicide pledge. We cannot let the government keep up this charade of &#39;apparent suicides&#39; when people speak out against TPTB. Define a &#39;line in the sand&#39; -- e.g. detention camps, IMF bailout / adopting the SDR, abolishing physical cash / negative interest rates on bank deposits, debtor prisons.</li>
<li>Hold independent primaries for elections. This segregation of politics allows them to perpetuate divide-and-conquer strategies as a means of control.</li>
</ol>

<p>Conference will begin on June 9th, online.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is a great idea, although most people probably need a bit more time to prepare.  As for Bilderberg 2015 or any alternative conference, I&#39;ll be watching from the internets.  I&#39;m willing to help, but family, work, and finances play a crucial factor.  </p>

<p>However, I&#39;m willing to bet the 2016 Bilderberg meeting is most likely slotted for the Americas.  I would guess either Chantilly, Virginia or Ottawa, Canada.</p>

<p>For those who are interested, I acquired <a href="http://www.bilderberg2016.org">bilderberg2016.org</a>, and I am currently forwarding it to this thread.  Let me know if you are interested in starting something.  I&#39;ve been planning on attending the 2016 meeting for the last four years, after missing both 08 and 12.  </p>

<p>Now is the time to prepare for 2016.</p>

<p>Sure, think of it like a music festival with multiple stages.  One group could be discussing the history of the bilderberg group, at the same time another is discussing pictures of the attendees.  Each group working independently, yet cooperating with one another.</p>

<p>The other option would be an official channel/site/whatever where we establish an itinerary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was something of a bond fire sale last week and Greece looks poised to default at the end of the month. If they do, it will likely ripple throughout the system (Portugal, Spain, Italy, Japan all very close to Greece&#39;s debt levels). Debt:GDP ratios are at an all time high. There is also a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shmita">Shmita</a> year starting in September. This might not seem important, but looking at some historical dates:</p>

<p>1980: Silver Thursday (the Hunt brothers corner collapses)</p>

<p>1987: Market crash</p>

<p>1994: Bond market <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/macroscope/2013/03/18/fears-of-1994-bond-market-flashback/">massacre</a></p>

<p>2001: Dot-com firesale</p>

<p>2008: Liquidity crisis</p>

<p>All of these events were basically caused by over leveraging. In the Shmita year debts are forgiven, so this would cause people to &#39;cash out&#39; their owned debts before the trigger. The Shmita is still in force to some respect in Israel.</p>

<p>There is some talk this this will actually be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubilee_%28biblical%29">Jubilee</a> year, which is every 7th Shmita. Basically a &#39;great reset.&#39;</p>

<p>All of these events were basically caused by over leveraging. In the Shmita year debts are forgiven, so this would cause people to &#39;cash out&#39; their owned debts before the trigger. The Shmita is still in force to some respect in Israel.</p>

<p>There is some talk this this will actually be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubilee_%28biblical%29">Jubilee</a> year, which is every 7th Shmita. Basically a &#39;great reset.&#39;</p>

<p>I tend to agree with you, but only to a point.  Some of the people here are obsessed with anything and everything related to Israel.  Not a big fan of Israel myself (or any form of Statism) but, you take the good with the bad.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t think all of the &#39;members&#39; here are racist, Jew haters.  For the record, I am against any form of organized hatred.  This includes Nazis, Evangelicals, Zionists, Eugenicists, Plutocrats, Statists, Black/Brown/White Power Groups.</p>

<p>I believe in freedom and justice for all, not some.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jewish religious traditions do not have the force of law in any major financial center, including Tel Aviv (as minor of a financial center as it is). Furthermore, Jews make up a vanishing small percentage of the international population, so even if they practiced debt forgiveness anyway, it wouldn&#39;t have a particularly large impact internationally. Lastly, there are no records of any major jewish-owned or dominated financiers negating all debts owed them in recent history; it would be suicide in the modern economic system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>About cryptocurrencies: I&#39;m a huge supporter. This account was made for a series I did at the beginning of the year reviewing various cryptocurrencies (I took it down since; slowly republishing them). So this isn&#39;t coming from someone who is opposed to the idea. And I have what is a lot of value for me in them.</p>

<p>But people do need to be aware that they should be very cautious about getting into this. There are a wide variety of potential legal and technical pitfalls. It&#39;s very important to do your research before diving in.</p>

<p>With that said, I do encourage everyone to learn as much as they can about bitcoin and the alternative cryptocurrencies (everything else) and to slowly start putting their money in. Not only is it good to not jump in too quickly until you know what you&#39;re doing, but dollar-cost averaging (making consistent buys of the same value over time) is a solid strategy to avoid making mistakes in market timing.</p>

<p><a href="/r/bitcoin">/r/bitcoin</a> can be a place to start. It has a lot of noise, but given that we&#39;re in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, I&#39;m presuming the reader is capable of filtering for signal.</p>

<p>I&#39;m worried that when the dollar does finally die, debt from the previous system will be carried over into The New World Order currency, new laws will be put in place putting people in prison if they don&#39;t pay.  Better to pay it off during the old system if you ask me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Impossible? What would you call the events of 07-08? :p</p>

<p>Debtor prison is a valid concern.. in fact it has already started to happen in TX. Hard to say exactly how things go down, but I think the bigger strain on the system the more likely it will snap.</p>

<p>The NWO currency is the special drawing right (SDR) at the IMF btw. They&#39;ve already started &#39;printing.&#39; I think the next liquidity crisis is going to see the IMF bail out the Fed and the ECB (et al?), perhaps we should discuss how to stop that. That is the path to dystopia if you ask me, but I don&#39;t really have a clue how we can stop them from doing that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, more recently, the 2009 SDR allocations totaling SDR 182.6 billion have played a critical role in providing liquidity to the global economic system and supplementing member countries’ official reserves amid the global financial crisis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that the 2009 allocations were 182bn, of 204bn total; ie 90% of the SDRs were printing during the most recent crisis. Since the next liquidity crisis is going to be focused on the solvency of nations / central banks, I expect to see another exponentially higher round of printing.</p>

<p>What happens when a country makes their claim on the US and we don&#39;t have enough USD to send them? We will have to print them..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fear that comes with the feeling that one needs money and their lifestyle is what gives rise to the sociopathic tendencies of the top executives. It&#39;s a corrosive and caustic mentality and it will snuff out the child inside you, your true self. Find other ways to help move the alternative, conscious world forward and put your energy there. Deal in dollars until you don&#39;t have to, then just stop. Deal in anything else, deal with your spouse with love, deal with your neighbors with veggies and honey, and deal with the world with positivity.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
