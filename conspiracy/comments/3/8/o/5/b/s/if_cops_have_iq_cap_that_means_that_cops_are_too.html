<p>Realize there are lots of families, right now, subsiding on less than 20k a year. Hell, working full time at minimum wage comes out to what, 16 or 17k a year?

    <div class="md"><p>With student loans, small mortgage, and a car payment, 60k a year can feel pretty tight, especially if you are supporting family that can&#39;t find work.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m getting down-voted for this. How about this very plausible scenario:</p>

<p>rent: $1000
Car note: $300
student loan payment: $500</p>

<p>Take home pay after taxes: $4000</p>

<p>So $2200 for a family for a month for bills, food, and other shit. I&#39;m not saying that is poor, but I am saying that is not enough to walk around feeling like a rich man and to feel the tight budget once in a while.</p>

If you live a normal life like basically every other American, 60k would be awesome. Cause about half of us don&#39;t make that much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the time, we were in Texas. Rent, no mortgage until we are sure we&#39;re going to be in the same place for more than 3-5 years. This was a few years ago, but off the top of my head... 2 Car payments (economical cars) + insurance were about $500 a month at the time. My student loans are about $200 a month, and rent plus utilities were about $1000. We don&#39;t live in the ghetto, but we don&#39;t need a top-tier apartment with billions of useless amenities. A small house from the 1950&#39;s that needs some work is fine with us. We don&#39;t eat out a lot, but we don&#39;t cheap out on groceries, so $300-$500 a month for food. Phones and internet $150. She was working for her university, so she didn&#39;t &quot;make&quot; anything, but her tuition was paid for. We try to spend as much time outdoors hiking, camping, etc as we can, so its possible that where we really save is on entertainment. We don&#39;t go blow a bunch of money at bars, or movies, or whatever. I&#39;d rather take that money, use it for gas, and go somewhere to see or experience something new.</p>

<p>So, we always had extra money at the end of the month, which we saved away, and this totally saved us from some major financial hurdles that cropped up while moving.</p>

<p>Other ways we still save: we don&#39;t buy a bunch of new clothes, or furniture. We don&#39;t go out to eat unless she finds a groupon or something. Stuff like that. I can also make things, so instead of a gym membership, I just built my own squat rack and picked up weighs off craigslist as they popped up. People who spend money on a gym membership just so they can run on a treadmill blow my mind. I also made most of our furniture. Its not top notch craftmanship, but it is functional. </p>

<p>A little thriftyness goes a long way. And we are both just good at keeping mental track of where our money is going. Now I have a phone app that I use, and even though I still keep mental track, I&#39;m constantly surprised at the miscellaneous bullshit that we spend money on. I&#39;ll bet for people who don&#39;t have a grip on their finances that their percentage of miscellaneous spending is much much higher. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it does depend on where you live, no, 60k doesn&#39;t go as far as it used to.... but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that <strong>a lot</strong> of people make less than that. Much less, in many cases. </p>

<p>My state has one of the highest minimum wages in the country. Even if a someone was working one of these crappy jobs full time, 40 hours a week (which many employers don&#39;t even want to give these days, as they don&#39;t want to give  benefits as well) they would bring in less than 19k a year <em>before</em> taxes. </p>

<p>(It&#39;s only <strong>15k</strong> if you use the <em>national</em> minimum!)</p>

<p>So while 60k may not buy as much as it once did, it&#39;s still <em>over three times</em> higher than the some of the highest minimum wage workers in the country make, per year... and <em>four times</em> higher than the national minimum.  </p>

<p>And from the sound of it, you might be surprised at how many people work shitty jobs at, or close to, minimum wage, in order to survive. </p>

<p>I worked my ass off to get where I am, and I sure as hell wouldn&#39;t put up with any of that nonsense like you are. But I also wouldn&#39;t attack you for it, nor would I look down on you for living as well as you can.</p>

<p>I grew up poor. I lived on the streets as a junkie, and 20 years later I lost over a million bucks during the crash. You can make as much money as you want to, you just need a plan to keep increasing and you need time.</p>

<p>I know what 60k lives like, and it&#39;s very close to the bone; if anything goes wrong you might be absolutely fucked. </p>

<p>And hey, as a side note, I also have a bunch of cops in my family, and living like that for such shitty take home pay makes you fucking nuts and it can ruin a good man pretty quickly. I&#39;ll pass on all of that.</p>

Getting by on ~30k per year is more than manageable, no matter where in the world you live (manageable, not FUCKING AWESOME YIPPEE-KAY-YEY MOTHERFUCKER I LOVE THIS LIFE!). If you&#39;ve already racked up heaps of debt and need a way higher salary to cover payments, then you fucked up by getting too much debt in the first place.</p>

<p>You can spend 60k on one emergency hospital visit in less than an hour. You could get laid off, or your house could burn down. That&#39;s not close to the fucking bone?</p>

<p>I do appreciate living off of very little income, and yeah, no shit, I realize that the entire world basically does just that, myself included for many, many years, but after taxes, rent/mortgage, utilities, car payments/public tranportation costs, car insurance, car maintenance, medical bills, food, braces, college, school supplies, internet, clothes, insurance, etc. how much is left over?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most jobs don&#39;t allow you to carry a Glock-17 and a taser gun while working. You&#39;d be surprised by how safe being a cop can be if you treat suspects with respect. Most criminal suspects are either alcoholics or drug addicts who are, by their very nature, suspicious and paranoid. I&#39;ve talked to a lot of addicts, many of them my friends, who very clearly feared for their lives while being &quot;detained.&quot; Imagine walking home after a few beers and being told &quot;get on the ground!&quot; while staring down the barrel of a gun. A few people will try to run, regardless, but I know people who&#39;ve been beaten, pistol-whipped, degraded and told they were scum by police who automatically assume if someone is from a certain neighborhood, or his/her cousin&#39;s friend is in a gang, that person is automatically a threat to the cop who provoked the situation in the first place. Just because some of you have been pulled over in your car mid-afternoon and you meet a nice police officer, and he or she gives you a warning, doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s how all police act. I&#39;ve seen some truly disgusting conduct from police in the Orange County/Los Angeles area. I even know friends in the military, Iraq and Afghanistan veterans no less, who&#39;ve been harassed by police, highway patrolmen, and tried to intimidate people who&#39;ve literally put their lives on the line so that those same cops could get paid with our tax dollars. I&#39;ve seen hardened criminals joking with cops who were arresting them because they were being treated with respect instead of being told they were filth and low-lives. I don&#39;t know what the solution to that problem is, but I know accountability and respect goes a long way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, it&#39;s probably a lot of things, hostility at someone else who has the right to have a gun, authority &quot;threatened&quot;, petty competition or something, I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>When one of my friends got pulled over he said the cop who&#39;d stopped him had treated him like shit even after he showed him his military ID. And he was still told to get out of the car and get patted down and do the obligatory &quot;I thought you were drunk-driving&quot; routine.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a good excuse to pull you out of the car and &quot;pat you down for the officer&#39;s safety.&quot; By the end of this whole ordeal he got pissed and told the officer &quot;your little kingdom, or whatever the fuck, is this city,&quot; and with what all that implied.</p>

<p>That didn&#39;t amuse the cop, but obviously he wasn&#39;t drinking and wasn&#39;t doing anything wrong, so he was let go. That kind of thing shouldn&#39;t happen to anyone, period, but that&#39;s just an example.</p>

<p>&quot;Even assuming that half these deaths were homicides, policing would have a murder rate of 5.55 per 100,000, comparable to the average murder rate of U.S. cities: 5.6 per 100,000.

<p>Did you notice that 3 of the 6 highest paid OPD employees are Patrol Officers, and one is a Sergeant.  With 160 officers in a city earning more than the Mayor of that same city --- this isn&#39;t just the ones who have been there a long time.</p>

<p>You&#39;re half right, though. It is just like the military.   Find a project and spin it as important to homeland security, and there&#39;s no limit to how much money gets thrown at it.</p>

<p>Unless you are in a city with 200 residents, I don&#39;t think anywhere is in the $25K range for LEOs. Maybe in the early 90s but I want to see proof of this. Luckily it is public record.</p>

<p>The selection process for the police force is designed to weed out those that are <em>mentally incompetent</em> - And i&#39;m using that term as it was intended, not how you would like to use it. </p>

<p>That isn&#39;t mental incompetence, that&#39;s more likely a failure of training and standards (Assuming such knowledge is required for the job, I dunno, i&#39;m not a cop)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My objection isn&#39;t to imply I believe all cops are below average IQ. I&#39;m sure many, if not most of them are reasonably intelligent. My issue is the power dynamic we&#39;re all forced into. They are a protected class of citizen. They are above us in the eyes of the courts and legislative branches. The political parties in this country worship them. They&#39;re lauded as &quot;heroes.&quot; As if it&#39;s heroic to arrest people for smoking plants, ticket people for driving without a tail light, profiling people by the clothes they wear or the color of their skin. As if it&#39;s heroic to actively lobby against civil liberties and individual choice. The arrogance in their ranks is unfathomable. They give each other awards for doing evil. They promote bad actors. The &quot;good ones&quot; turn a blind eye to the bad ones. They pat each other on the backs for ruining lives. When they fuck up, they&#39;re given paid suspensions. Their word is taken over most anyone else&#39;s. They resort to violence all too regularly, because they can, and only rarely are they held to account. They&#39;ve been militarized institutionally. Many police officers today are veterans who are in no mental state to have the authority they&#39;re given over generally peaceful communities.</p>

<p>The issue is you people who are so quick to come to their defense. This mindless state worship is what has allowed the problems with police to become systemic and perpetuate to the point we&#39;re at now.</p>

<p>We have the Stanford Prison Experiment to cite. We know that even good people are corruptible when given unchecked authority over others. This is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. A lot of what I&#39;ve read here would lead me to think the average IQ here is probably lower than that of the average police officer, but I would expect the majority of people who come here to be more hesitant to throw their support behind government institutions, being as we know how evil and corrupt government can be. We should all understand the power dynamics at play here.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any reason to believe you&#39;re a shill, but police deserve as much criticism as we can assert. And, yeah, our criticisms should be backed by facts. This shit needs to change, though. I shouldn&#39;t have to fear the police. I&#39;m not a violent person. I hold myself to high moral standards. I should have no rational reason to fear the police. But I do, because every day these people are assaulting, raiding, kidnapping, and murdering innocent people. </p>

<p>I feel like the humanity is sapped out of most police officers when they put on their costumes. I don&#39;t know if the field attracts sociopaths and/or narcissists and/or people with chips on their shoulders, but they DEMAND respect while offering little to none (probably due primarily to the power dynamic previously mentioned). It&#39;s time we stop fearing our police. It&#39;s time for police start working to make us feel safe and comfortable. It&#39;s time they start working toward keeping the peace, not escalating situations to violence on a whim. It&#39;s time police are held personally accountable. It&#39;s time for qualified immunity to fall by the wayside. It&#39;s time police are forced to wear badge cameras universally, by law. It&#39;s time for the war on drugs to end. It&#39;s time to demilitarize the police. It&#39;s time to disarm the majority of police. It&#39;s time police are trained to resort to non-lethal and less-than-lethal methods at ALL times to restrain flighty, aggressive suspects. It&#39;s time police stop functioning as fundraisers for the state. It&#39;s time for police to stop being pussies. If they&#39;re afraid, they shouldn&#39;t become police. If they&#39;re so scared of the people in their community that they shoot on instinct at any questionable motion, statement, or suggestion, they aren&#39;t fit to serve.</p>

<p>It&#39;s time police stopped emphasizing enforcement, and start emphasizing keeping the peace.</p>

<p>The claim being made is broad and sweeping. As such, the evidence presented should be similarly broad.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I hate to say it but my police department <strong>Requires</strong> 2 years of college credits to even be considered for a job and I am not in some super rich area. People with 2 years of college credits will have a higher I.Q. then High-school graduates, not because High-school grads are dumb but your I.Q. increases with your education level. Like other people have pointed out, it&#39;s not how smart you are it&#39;s more of a measure of formal education.</p>

<p>It is true that most police departments only require High-school diplomas but hey, you only gave one instance and I&#39;m refuting your all &quot;police are intentionally dumb&quot; argument.</p>

<p>Besides, even if IQ was a measure of intelligence, it would have nothing to do with making split second descisons. When faced with an immediate threat, your brain doesn&#39;t have time to sit there and run through every possible scenario, and then pick the most logical course of action. Instead, it uses its flight or fight reaction, which is an instantaneous, animalistic response. Being smarter doesn&#39;t have anything to do with descison making on that level.</p>

<p>However, in the event that the officer would have a large amount of time to make his descison, his IQ is still irrelevant. Besides, it&#39;s a gross oversimplification to label the police, as a whole, dumb. Just because you have anecdotal experiences with dumb officers, doesn&#39;t make them all dumb.</p>

<p>Edit: Apparently I don&#39;t know what IQ is. Still doesn&#39;t change my main point. You can have a low IQ and still be competent </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no IQ cap.  A judge ruled in Connecticut that police forces do have the right to discriminate on intelligence if they so choose, siting that an intelligent person might become bored with police work.  That doesn&#39;t mean that police forces are actively doing this, and the tests required to join police forces are hardly IQ tests, so, you&#39;re kind of making a generalization of all police based on the practices of one police force.</p>

You start with higher pay if you&#39;re a college grad but it&#39;s far from a requirement. In fact a HS Diploma isn&#39;t even a requirement in many smaller municipalities if they really need officers.</p>

<p>Police forces have a relatively high turn over rate. Most municipalities start by asking for the best and brightest but if none of them respond to the want ads they will keep lowering the bar until someone reports for duty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it does not matter If it just a few. The few are spread out kind of equally. The problem is twofold. One: The type( and there is a type that they look for. Is the same type I would look for in a gang member enforcer. Two: Is the same problem I have everywhere. Schooling is a joke. and you pay a large sum for it to. And This really next bit makes me mad. Barring my ability to write I am very smart. but I dropped out of school in the 9th grade. A dumb redneck from nowhere. But still smarter than those who should be smarter than me. This is wrong and should not be this way. I know what I just typed makes no since. But I have tested this over and over. Over many different people in many different fields trying to find where I fit in the cods. And always the same. If I didn&#39;t have such awesome toys in technology to look forward in the years to come it would be wholly depressing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IQ bar? That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Having gone through much of the hiring process to be a state trooper (only to stop after the polygraph[inconclusive results, didn&#39;t fail]) I can confidently and tell you there is no measure of a candidates IQ. You make it sound like departments are hiring complete idiots and it&#39;s a job anyone could get. I don&#39;t know what the department&#39;s in your area are like but where I&#39;ve applied, even with a college degree the positions are very hard to get and extremely competitive. I highly doubt they would consider an officer whose IQ is &quot;too low they can&#39;t be held legally liable for their actions.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is the crux of the issue IMO.</p>

<p>A smart person is more likely to predict a situation before hand and likely a better reaction.  So instead of fearing for your life at anything that may happen on a day to day basis such as little dogs running away from you, or the guy walking away from you, a smarter person might be able to assess the situation before it becomes a survival instinct reaction.  Same with driving, a smarter person is more likely to avoid crashes and predict someones movement vs someone that just goes without looking and shock they hit someone or cut someone off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that cops have IQ caps is all the proof you need that criminals are running the system.</p>

<ul>
<li>Footnote: Another proof would be the de-centralization of police stations. Up until the 1970s and &#39;80s, police stations were rooted as the hub all throughout communities. Because of this, cops were first responders [not firefighters or EMTs]. Cops would be on the scene before anyone else. Then came a campaign to de-centralize police stations, and make them less responsive--and cop response times have taken a nose-dive. This technique to de-centralize them probably came from the same people who imposed an IQ cap, so that no Columbo&#39;s would exist who could ferret out tricky corporate crime of insurance scams. The new breed of police officer would get there 45 minutes too late, and only be able to go after low-level TV-snatching criminals.</li>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think this illustrates a big problem with the system today. We really shouldn&#39;t be walking up to cars at night. So I&#39;m with you there. If there is a car and they&#39;re doing drugs or having sex inside, then it&#39;s stupid to risk anyones life in enforcing morality laws.</p>

<p>Now on the other hand, if there is a real crime, like murder, then I&#39;ll approach a car at night looking for the murderer. So the issue seems to be that we need to get rid of the victimless &quot;crime&quot; laws and then cops would only be risking their lives in pursuit of actual criminals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I applied and went through the process of being a cop in a large city. Passed physical and background check. I failed the oral exam. Two scenarios they explicitly tell you that you must not use any prior law enforcement rules or intuition. I failed because it meant to me I needed to dumb down my thought process. I tried really hard to not do the right thing in the scenario by the book. </p>

<p>One of the questions was something along the lines of:</p>

<ul>
<li>There&#39;s been a string of daytime robberies in a neighborhood. </li>
<li>A resident in the neighborhood calls the police stating a man is going door to door knocking on doors and looking in windows. </li>
<li>Other neighbors say the man is going around asking for petition signatures (or some sort of activism)</li>
<li>How would you handle the scenario with no prior police knowledge or experience in your answer?</li>
</ul>

<p>Forgot what the second question was. </p>

<p>Point is, talked to a friend who works security who has cop friends. She said it&#39;s likely your answer was too smart of an answer for them. I don&#39;t remember what answer I gave, but she said it sounds like your answer was too intelligent for them. </p>

<p>I gave up my pursuit of becoming a cop when I heard that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why the hell does anyone need to be discussing this like a bunch of brain surgeons? Have you (if you are not a spouse or family of a cop) ever spent time with them? They are thuggish in nature. They WANT to engage in violence with unprepared gentle citizens. It is what attracts them to the current state of &quot;enforcement&quot;,. It is not that hard to realize that a more intelligent person will always look for a peaceful solution, as they realize that violence should always only be the last choice. So called &quot;cops&quot; are looking for excuses to create tension, controversy, and fear in hopes of being able to use force (what they desire from the outset) as a solution. Notice how, especially in the US, the more violent the action by the cops, normally the more &quot;mistaken&quot; they are about the target. Much easier to shoot an unarmed retiree, or mangle a baby in its crib with a flash grenade, than to engage a real violent criminal.</p>

<p>Police and military - paid fantasy vacation for psychopaths.</p>

<p>This is not rocket, nor psychological, nor medical science. This is an observation any 7 year old could make by simple observation. The problem starts when we let lawyers and doctors get involved. They can&#39;t help but show how really smart they are by trying to confuse a simple situation with jargon and deceitful use of language.  </p>
