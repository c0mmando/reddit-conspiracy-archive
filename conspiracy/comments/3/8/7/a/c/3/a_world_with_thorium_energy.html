        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-06-02 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/untumulted.html">untumulted</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Imagine a world without Fukishimas, without the petrodollar, without OPEC, environmentalists, climate change, fear-mongering over Iran, energy wars.</p>

<p>Imagine a world with a cheap, abundant, clean, harmless*, unmonopolizable energy that could run society for twice as long as known civilization.</p>

<p>We point out that oil is a monopoly leading to wars. We show that the Rockefellers use their foundation to further their ideology. We define an economic assualt on the U.S. as an act of war, and the very currency is based on petrol. We are headed to further consolidation of government through Carbon emmissions and we offer no solutions.</p>

<p>Thorium gives us such a world. It empties government bureaus and university seats. It silences ideologies and provides a means to uplift humanity to global, high-standard equality.</p>

<p>Now open a textbook. Listen to a professor. Look at budgeting. Look at India. India has stalled their thorium program in order to maximize other raw material resources: we can&#39;t sell (oil, uranium, wind, solar, hydro projects, government jobs, taxes,  etc) if we have thorium. And so that textbook will talk about uranium, fushion and all kinds of nonsense, but it won&#39;t mention thorium. Change textbooks, still no mention.</p>

<p>Is thorium a cure all? Yes. And we will get posters asking technical questions and pointing out limitations. Great, go point out those limitations out in a textbook, tell them to your classmates, talk to your environmentalist friends about the drawbacks of thorium. But the silence is deadening. </p>

<p>We need to recognize our inherent weaknesses and accept them as such. We all want recognition and unfortunately it&#39;s easy to point out starving people in Africa or Draconian China, and feel better by these examples. Don&#39;t be swayed by the desire to feel above others. In an equitable world, we raise everybody and ourselves in the process. </p>

<p>We will never have equality in a top down society. We need the tools to enable communities to lift themselves up. Tools that enable small self-governing communities to have a democratic voice in a self-reliant world.</p>

<p>With slightly over a $1,000,000 we funded and ran a thorium facility for a decade. During the same period, we used our financial instrument to indebt the Congo for decades so they could put in a road to nowhere, so they&#39;d be our punk forever.   </p>

<p>Until people understand that for much less we could have helped the Congo solve their energy problems forever, we are just discussing the details of not doing so. </p>

<p>What could I answer with just &quot;thorium&quot;.</p>

<p>A police state,
All government corruption,
Self-fattening charities,
Wars,
Tech,
Hunger,
Pollution,
Debt.</p>

<p>*Uranium is already safer than other forms of energy. Thorium eliminates the issues with uranium: weaponization of by-products, meltdowns, longevity of waste.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I think thorium and fusion are decades away at least, if they ever work.  And by then the price of renewables and storage will have fallen so far that fossil and nuclear will be wiped out of the market.</p>

<p>My understanding is that the technical issues are materials issues, not design issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>India stalled their program not on technical or material issues but on maximizing profit off of other resources first.</p>

<p>As I wrote above, if you wish to discuss the technical issues, please do so with your friends, this thread is not about technical issues, it&#39;s about the fact that government has spent decades not tackling this &quot;technical issues&quot; of thorium as well as the odd fact that the safe nuclear energy failed to be mentioned in textbooks, to be initiated to placate the nuclear energy scare, to save on nuclear waste management costs, or due to its far greater abundance. Instead, decades later after successful thorium plants have operated, we hear about technical issues. So discuss the technical issues with your friends, that way if you are selling disinfo, then at least they get to hear about thorium as a useful product of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but didn&#39;t lots of other countries pursue thorium ?  Or at least their scientists and nuclear authorities and power companies knew about thorium reactors and the work done at ORNL.  If it really worked, if it really was great, no US policy decision would have stopped them from using it.  Russia, China, Germany, Brazil, Japan, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nonsense.  Other countries ran thorium reactors in the 60&#39;s, 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s.  The technology was no secret.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium_fuel_cycle#List_of_thorium-fueled_reactors">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium_fuel_cycle#List_of_thorium-fueled_reactors</a></p>

<p>And scientists talk.  If there was some great success, there would have been no way to keep it secret.  Heck, the Soviets knew the deepest secrets of the Manhattan Project practically as soon as they were developed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Big difference between a prototype and commercial use.  There must reasons no one else picked up this technology and developed and deployed it.  I suspect it wasn&#39;t as successful as you say it was.  Others say that high-temp liquid corrosive radioactive fuel is very technically challenging, not at all clear such a reactor is feasible or worth doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the experts are saying LFTR is really hard.  Many countries explored thorium, some explored liquid fuels.  It seems other avenues worked better.</p>

<p>I&#39;d much rather we put that &quot;pocket change&quot; into developing storage for renewable energy.  Renewables plus storage is the future.  The energy generation is working today, we just need to increase efficiency and develop storage.</p>

<p>Thorium atoms don&#39;t just start splitting into power-generating nuclear reactions on their own, thankfully. They need a source of neutrons that makes them split -- thus, you need enriched uranium to &quot;prime&quot; the reaction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is you are acting quite shilly. Whether or not there is a proliferation threat is of no significance because we already have so many nuclear weapons and are the most likely to use them based on history. That there may be a small manageable amount of fissile uranium in use, is neither here nor there. It doesn&#39;t take away from the fact that thorium has been intentionally sidelined and hidden.</p>

<p>Pursuit of tech can solve its issues not burying an abundant resource for issues we deal with anyways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you should improve your reading skills before telling others to &quot;listen well&quot;</p>

<p>No one said that you need enriched uranium &quot;to keep it going&quot;,   you still need enriched uranium to &quot;prime&quot; the reaction.</p>

<p>And I know that U233 has never been weaponized -- that&#39;s not the issue. The issue (according to those who claim this) is that the uranium still has to be enriched, and possessing enrichment <em>know how</em> is it <em>itself</em> a &quot;threat&quot; of proliferation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But you have to start your reactor up with fissile material from somewhere. If you take a vat of Thorium and try to turn it on, you&#39;ll be sorely disappointed because it cannot possibly sustain a chain reaction, under any circumstances. So you start it up with denatured bombs or <strong>enriched U-235</strong> and then it becomes self-sufficient on Th-232 or U-238. <a href="http://www.whatisnuclear.com/articles/thorium_myths.html#myth2">http://www.whatisnuclear.com/articles/thorium_myths.html#myth2</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need to start looking at &quot;inks&quot; and designs and 3d printers and access to all three. </p>

<p>A Chinese company has recently printed houses, a mansion and an apartment building. They will be using sand to print next. </p>

<p>We have the ability to develop, design, and print a building of extreme complexity. We have the ability to make the &quot;inks&quot; universal, from on-site resources, like the sand they will use. Google rammed earth, hempcrete, cob, etc. </p>

<p>We can design passive systems right into the house. An example is a Thai architect who designed a passive air-conditioning system into his building. That design could potentially be uploaded to a printer anywhere in the world and use the locally available &quot;ink&quot; to replicate, modify, improve on it and make it more culturally/area specific.</p>

<p>We will be able to print whatever our ingenuity and ink will let us. This includes food systems and the meals we eat.</p>

<p>Thorium is an example of an abundant and critical ink. And of the kind of ink we need: one with manageable externalities. </p>

<p>The beauty of using onsite ink is that what waste there is can be recycled straight back to the site. If we use hemp, it causes no pollution and when and as it becomes waste, the waste becomes the raw ingredients. </p>

<p>This is what TPTB want to prevent. </p>
