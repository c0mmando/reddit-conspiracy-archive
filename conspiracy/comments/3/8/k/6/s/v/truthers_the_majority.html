    <div class="md"><p>I see conspiracy because no matter way you look at it, a covert plan to harm people is a conspiracy. The thing is, you pretend to know what happened that day despite an abundance of evidemce that has been withheld from the public domain while I admit that I don&#39;t know what happened. </p>

<p>Who&#39;s really full of shit? The one asking questions or the one repeating lies they heard from men in suits on television. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a battle between officials and dissenters. The world is not quite so black and white. Assuming a neutral position doesn&#39;t make you a hero. Especially after your earlier comments pushing the lies the MSM told you. </p>

<p>Honestly. I prefer dealing with shills because at least they have more integrity, albeit in a bad way. <a href="https://youtu.be/o1w_6nd0kj4">Scientists</a> know airplanes didnt bring about the collapse of the WTC buildings 1, 2, and 7. </p>

<p>And shame on you for bringing up those who oppose mandatory vaccinations with he same derogatory language you reserve for those who know we were lied to about 9/11. Mandatory vaccination programs have been used abusively in the past for purposes as diverse as genocidal sterlization to programs employed  to collect genetic material to identify bin Laden family members. </p>

<p>Again, yur crime is painting the world in black and white. Yes. Vaccines are a useful tool against some communicable diseases. But damn. The vaccine schedules for children in the US have multiplied exponentially. The risk of vaccines is small, but even a fraction of a percent applied to hundreds of millions of people will leave an inadvertently victimized minority. Oh. And let&#39;s just mention again the historically demonstrable risk for corruption that accompanies mandatorily scheduled injection of unknown substances unfavorable people.</p>

<p>And by unfavorable people, of course I mean the poor. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not pretending to be a victim here. I&#39;m acknowledging overwhelming evidence, from books written far away and long ago, to firsthand knowledge of heavy-handed &quot;justice&quot; against victimless &quot;criminals.&quot; May you never offend a constable. Evidence of injustice. </p>

<p>The only reason I&#39;m still even communicating with you is because I&#39;m befuddled by you dogmatics. How, in the face of all reason, despite every person who&#39;s ever lied to get ahead in this game, despite all the evidence indicating that our social systems promote psycopaths to positions where they can do the most harm, *how do you convince yourself so hard core that you KNOW 9/11 was bereft of insider involvement?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well aren&#39;t you just the whole goddamn bucket of psycho. I never said that I know for sure that there was no government involvement because that&#39;s impossible to know for sure without a complete knowledge of the inner workings of said government. I even stated earlier that we know the US government was at least partially to blame considering they provided the Afghan people with weapons, combat training and propaganda pushing Jihad against Russia. However, I know for a fact that, from the evidence available, the towers could&#39;ve easily been destroyed from just the planes and no government interference or &quot;planned demolitions&quot;.
