       Why are you derailing? There is absolutely something to discuss re: open source software being compromised. It's as compromisable as any software.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who reads every line of code? Who even remembers every line of their own code? Who knows all the bugs in their own code or can even poke enough holes? And what about compromised contributors? You don't think being a respected contributor to a piece of code used by every system ever isn't a person targeted for coercion? So, maybe they're totally ethical and awesome. They are going to say no to their intelligence services? Maybe. Maybe they will. Maybe they have. Maybe some have. Maybe some haven't. The point is, we don't really know - and there is plenty to discuss.

       That's the point of an open source community, people, like the mods here who are doing shit for free reviewing code (in mod sense, mod content) for the betterment of the community.

      <p>
       Are you in the dev business? Do you know what the hell you are talking about? I've been programming for the last 15 years and have been apart of the open source community. I've contributed, and talked to others on this matter. We do it because we believe in a way of life, free, community driven software. So... respectfully, piss off, if you have no idea what we are talking about.

       You can berate me all you want, I could care less. But hang around a few years and keep your eyes open, and you'll understand.

       Also, can you actually stop derailing and actually read and address the other poster's points? Because they're valid as hell and understanding them will make you a much better and less naive contributor.

       You can't argue shit, so you gotta quibble with people about whether they use bash syntax for != or whatever that guy used? Come on, man, you can be better, I know it. If you consider yourself a conspiracy theorist and you can't consider that software is pwned, I just don't understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you really are the "I can code! I can code!" guy you claim to be, you owe it to yourself to understand the field you're in. It's nice to think it's this happy disneyland of love, but it ain't, man. It's a fucking lucrative business and pwned by government the way anything else is. It's better than closed source, but don't lie to yourself about its boundaries and vulnerabilities.

       There is an active campaign to make open source look compromised by big interest. Over the years, open source have been fighting a battle and people are starting to make the switch. I find OP's post, kind of tarnishing the fight we have been fighting as if we are in the same boat as MS or Apple. It's a community effort and if you try to smear it, the community will come to it's protection, they want that, because open source means free, no profit and everyone can download/alter/re-fork it.

       Is open source software immune? No, it's not, but when I see shit posts like this discrediting a community ran OS, I'm going to question it. I'm a good conspiracy theorist in all right ;).
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, the government does not run or own open source software and you can read the code yourself (as long as your not lazy). Review it, change it, compile it and run it.

       This is the problem us anti-d types have.  systemd does none of these things in any meaningful way.  Free?  It comes from the only distro you have to pay for.  Alter?  Good luck having a system that works with any GUI.  Fork?  Why would you want to fork an "init" system that is basically the Windows Registry?

      <p>
       systemd is not an OS.  It is an "init" system that by way of hard dependencies, has attached itself like a parasite to the software ecosystem of Linux, leaving little to no alternatives and mocking those who attempt to create them, such as in the case of eudev and OpenRC.

       Look, if you can't see issues in something in order to fix it, you're responsible for its death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Software has bugs. Period. Open Source is better because we can see it, but that's not a fail safe. Look at OpenSSL, look at Bitcoin, look at systemd, look at ANY piece of software. Shit has bugs and nation states pay mad money trying to find those vulnerabilities and to keep them under wraps. Denying vulnerability because you're worried about some political vulnerability is nonsense. I guaranfuckingtee you that OSS is not going away, so it doesn't need Redditor astroturfing. Governments depend on it, governments contribute to it. Denying the risk of a bug compromising a daemon that essentially touches everything makes zero sense when you look at the big picture.

       I'm not debating that, I'm saying you said !== which is scripting language (ie. server/web), != is software programming, you know, c/c++ (which linux is written in). This shows me you have no idea what you are talking about in the software programming realm. Yea, shit can get over looked, but the open source community are more anarchist  than capitalist like Microsoft and Apple. Normal people (me included) look over this code and find shit. If there is a bug, we alert the community and fixed it. If someone was bought out, that shit would be quickly discovered and fixed. You say you know about opensource projects (may have experience) but do you have experience within the Linux community? My guess is not.

       Yes, I'm employed in server/web.  It pays more.  I'm more used to writing !== than !=.  Yes, I know how to write C/C++.  Personally, I think the only time you should use C is for OS and firmware.  It isn't a very safe language; managing your own pointers is a great way to ensure you have security holes.

       A tired programmer wrote shitty code, Apple had the same problem and they are paid to review it and never found it. Also, MS is dealing with a decade old bug, because a shitty programmer wrote shitty code. I'm a conspiracy theorist, but do you really think that the gov paid this programmer to write shitty code to bypass security? Did they do the same with MS and Apple?

       Anything that touches everything is a prime target. If you're actually a software developer IRL, it behooves you to see if you can get some security training. The best kind is offensive, IMO, so that you can envision more lines of attack during development. There are very few true kernel hackers for a reason--it's scary. You have a bug and it can compromise so much.

       Just because something is open source does not mean it is immune to backdoors.  Remember the deliberate weakening of the RSA algorithms?  How about Heartbleed?  An unnoticed "bug" may be a backdoor purposefully planted and it may be designed to work with technology civilian researchers are unaware of.  We have also seen the agencies attempt to bribe our most trusted open source security experts into ignoring or even creating these bugs, such as with Theo of the OpenBSD project.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this in mind, let's see why many suspect systemd of less-than-benevolent intentions.  First, in layman's terms:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Ignoring for the moment the various technical problems with systemd, I have my suspicions that its provenance and scope are cause for alarm.
       </p>
       <p>
        Systemd comes from Red Hat. Red Hat, in the Linux world, is the company with the largest ties to the US government and the various state security organizations around the world–including NSA. The US government (DoD) is Red Hat’s number one customer. Red Hat also happens to be Lennart Poettering’s employer.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Linux kernel, I believe, is clean. As long as Linus lives, you’re not going to subvert the kernel. Let’s just assume that is true for the sake of argument. If you can’t get into the kernel, what is your next option? You need something low level (PID 1?), ubiquitous, and vast in scope and complexity.
       </p>
       <p>
        This describes systemd perfectly. It was almost like it was designed to touch as much of a Linux system as possible. It has hooks into some many different subsystems and APIs that it’s almost impossible to build a modern distro with current software without pulling in systemd as a dependency. This happened almost overnight, and I think there are malicious forces at work here.
       </p>
       <p>
        We must remember Heart Bleed. Heart Bleed appeared to be an innocent mistake, and it was a tiny typo in one line of a C program. If it’s possible to do that much damage with a tiny little error, imagine when you have an attack surface as wide as systemd, written in a language like C that is almost designed to produce security holes when not written absolutely perfectly–and humans are not absolutely perfect programmers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Systemd is dangerous. It’s too big to be audited as quickly as its developed. It’s complexity adds as much attack surface to a Linux system as the kernel itself. We can’t get away from these facts. Shitfighting about init systems is a waste of our time. Sytemd is horrible because of where it comes from and how complex it is. Backdoors will be hidden in it.

        https://muchweb.me/systemd-nsa-attempt/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And technical reasons:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        systemd flies in the face of the Unix philosophy: "do one thing and do it well," representing a complex collection of dozens of tightly coupled binaries. Its responsibilities grossly exceed that of an init system, as it goes on to handle power management, device management, mount points, cron, disk encryption, socket API/inetd, syslog, network configuration, login/session management, readahead, GPT partition discovery, container registration, hostname/locale/time management, and other things. Keep it simple, stupid.
       </p>
       <p>
        systemd's journal files (handled by journald) are stored in a complicated binary format, and must be queried using journalctl. This makes journal logs potentially corruptible, as they do not have ACID-compliant transactions. You typically don't want that to happen to your syslogs. The advice of the systemd developers? Ignore it. No, seriously. Oh, and there's embedded HTTP server integration (libmicrohttpd). QR codes are served, as well, through libqrencode.
       </p>
       <p>
        systemd's team is noticeably chauvinistic and anti-Unix, due to their open disregard for non-Linux software and subsequent systemd incompatibility with all non-Linux systems. Since systemd is very tightly welded with the Linux kernel API, this also makes different systemd versions incompatible with different kernel versions. This is an isolationist policy that essentially binds the Linux ecosystem into its own cage, and serves as an obstacle to software portability.
       </p>
       <p>
        udev and dbus are forced dependencies. In fact, udev merged with systemd a long time ago. The integration of the device node manager that was once part of the Linux kernel is not a decision that is to be taken lightly. The political implications of it are high, and it makes a lot of packages dependent on udev, in turn dependent on systemd, despite the existence of forks, such as eudev. Starting with systemd-209, the developers now have their own, non-standard and sparsely documented sd-bus API that replaces much of libdbus's job, and further decreases transparency.
       </p>
       <p>
        By default, systemd saves core dumps to the journal, instead of the file system. Core dumps must be explicitly queried using coredumpctl. Besides going against all reason, it also creates complications in multi-user environments (good luck running gdb on your program's core dump if it's dumped to the journal and you don't have root access), since systemd requires root to control. It assumes that users and admins are dumb, but more critically, the fundamentally corruptible nature of journal logs makes this a severe impediment.
       </p>
       <p>
        systemd's size makes it a single point of failure. As of this writing, systemd has had 9 CVE reports, since its inception in March 2010. So far, this may not seem like that much, but its essential and overbearing nature will make it a juicy target for crackers, as it is far smaller in breadth than the Linux kernel itself, yet seemingly just as critical.
       </p>
       <p>
        systemd is viral by its very nature. Its scope in functionality and creeping in as a dependency to lots of packages means that distro maintainers will have to necessitate a conversion, or suffer a drift. As an example, the GNOME environment has adopted systemd as a hard dependency since 3.8 for various utilities, including gdm, gnome-shell and gnome-extra-apps. This means GNOME versions &gt;=3.8 are incompatible with non-Linux systems, and due to GNOME's popularity, it will help tilt a lot of maintainers to add systemd. The rapid rise in adoption by distros such as Debian, Arch Linux, Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE and others shows that many are jumping onto the bandwagon, with or without justification. It's also worth noting that systemd will refuse to start as a user instance, unless the system boots with it as well - blatant coercion.
       </p>
       <p>
        systemd clusters itself into PID 1. Due to it controlling lots of different components, this means that there are tons of scenarios in which it can crash and bring down the whole system. But in addition, this means that plenty of non-kernel system upgrades will now require a reboot. Enjoy your new Windows 9 Linux system! In fairness, systemd does provide a mechanism to reserialize and reexecute systemctl in real time. If this fails, of course, the system goes down. There are several ways that this can occur. This happens to be another example of SPOF.
       </p>
       <p>
        systemd is designed with glibc in mind, and doesn't take kindly to supporting other libcs all that much. In general, the systemd developers' idea of a standard libc is one that has bug-for-bug compatibility with glibc.
       </p>
       <p>
        systemd's complicated nature makes it harder to extend and step outside its boundaries. While you can more or less trivially start shell scripts from unit files, it's more difficult to write behavior that goes outside the box, what with all the feature bloat. Many users will likely need to write more complicated programs that directly interact with the systemd API, or even patch systemd directly. One also needs to worry about a much higher multitude of code paths and behaviors in a system-critical program, including the possibility of systemd not synchronizing with the message bus queue on boot, and thus freezing. This is as opposed to a conventional init, which is deterministic and predictable in nature, mostly just execing scripts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ultimately, systemd's parasitism is symbolic of something more than systemd itself. It shows a radical shift in thinking by the Linux community. Not necessarily a positive one, either. One that is vehemently postmodern, monolithic, heavily desktop-oriented, choice-limiting, isolationist, reinvents the flat tire, and just a huge anti-pattern in general. If your goal is to pander to the lowest common denominator, so be it. We will look for alternatives, however.
       </p>
       <p>
        systemd doesn't even know what the fuck it wants to be. It is variously referred to as a "system daemon" or a "basic userspace building block to make an OS from", both of which are highly ambiguous. It engulfs functionality that variously belonged to util-linux, wireless tools, syslog and other projects. It has no clear direction, other than the whims of the developers themselves. Ironically, despite aiming to standardize Linux distributions, it itself has no clear standard, and is perpetually rolling.

      <p>
       The NSA did not weaken RSA.  Instead, RSA Security adopted Dual Elliptic Curve and Random Extended.  Dual Elliptic Curve has a NSA backdoor.  DEC is a random number generator.  Meanwhile, Random Extended is an extension for secure sites the NSA can use to break keys generated by DEC.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are not the same thing as the RSA encryption or decryption algorithm.  Dual Elliptic Curve can be used to  generate the  keys to be used in the encryption &amp; decryption algorithms.    However, RSA can be used without Dual Elliptic Curve and Random Extended.  In fact, RSA was used for decades before DEC and Random Extended were developed.

       That statement is deliberately disingenuous because there are  implementations of RSA that do not use DEC and Random Extended.

       And, conversely, there are some that do, due to the standards set forth by the RSA body.  I'm not trying to be disingenious, I'm trying to point out that subversion has happened to a supposedly trusted open-source entity.

       Coincidentally, a fine example of subversion is to claim, "RSA adopted an algorithm that was deliberately weakened" when there are still strong implementations of RSA that do not use DEC and Random Extended.

       Have I ever claimed otherwise?  All I did is state that something, which did indeed happen, happened.  And used that as grounds for an argument to not just implicitly trust open source software on the basis of being open source.  Same as I did with pointing out heartbleed.

       Can you list them? Because that would help the discussion. The ad hominems don't move the discussion forward in any way, but a point by point refutation would actually be worthwhile. Most people know to read past/discount ad hominem like you've been posting here, so, if instead of ad hominem, you listed your issues, your arguments might be taken serious by readers and thought about a bit.

       Good luck, there are a lot of really naive people on Reddit. I've had this argument with folks before, "But the code is open!" "Did you read it?" "No, but others can!" "Uh, okay, do you know the developers personally?" "No, but others do! It's OSS! I can code!" "But did you read the code?" "No! It's open source! It's open! People can read it!" "But have they? Have you?" "No, it's open! Open Source!"
      </p>
      <p>
       It breaks my freaking brain and makes me sad. It's better that it's open than closed, for sure, but it's like people who know plenty about fucked up shit hidden in plain sight have their common sense arrested when it comes to software...

       This is the same classic logic that let's all other conspiracies thrive. "Someone else must have confirmed it". If everyone believed that we will be all believing an unfortunate lie. And worst, like you said, its hidden in plain sight!

       There is an active campaign to make open source look compromised by big interest. Over the years, open source have been fighting a battle and people are starting to make the switch. I find OP's post, kind of tarnishing the fight we have been fighting as if we are in the same boat as MS or Apple. It's a community effort and if you try to smear it, the community will come to it's protection, they want that, because open source means free, no profit and everyone can download/alter/re-fork it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is open source software immune? No, it's not, but when I see shit posts like this discrediting a community ran OS, I'm going to question it. I'm a good conspiracy theorist in all right ;).
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, the government does not run or own open source software and you can read the code yourself (as long as your not lazy). Review it, change it, compile it and run it.
