Then something might get done.  As long as they have a small army and food testers as bodyguards.  Lets repeal the Federal Reserve Act too while were working on this.  I think that would solve most the worlds problems right there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The handful of people that own and operate the Fed would still behave the same way if the Fed disssolved. There&#39;s also LIBOR. I&#39;m unaware of the how dissolving the Federal Reserve prevents Global banks and global corporations race to the bottom, buying politicians in the US or any other nation, or USA CIA/black ops replacing Soverign governments. Also, China, Russia, India, would not grow to fill any void left from a retracting USA? Every gap the US leaves in Africa, China fills in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea that a guy who couldn&#39;t get a licence to fly a Cessna crashed a 747 into the first floor of the pentagon at 500mph without skimming the grass is laughable. And then they won&#39;t let us see 90% of the available footage of said plane. That in a nation that owns the world&#39;s first and second largest air forces and NORAD at no point to a fighter jet even get to look at any of these planes is laughable. I don&#39;t like to say it was an inside job, but way more fuckery happened that day than any official account gives credit for. </p>

<p>Then you should have a look into the subject of how fast planes can fly at various altitudes.  I always wondered why the air traffic controllers viewing the high-jacked 9/11 planes made such a big deal about their <em>speeds</em>. I was more concerned with how the planes were high-jacked, how people who were atrocious pilots could fly them with such precision, etc.  But the air at WTC-level is not near as &quot;thin&quot; as the air that at 30,000 feet.  In short, commercial airliners simply cannot travel 500+ mph at WTC-level.  They vibrate to the point of disintegration.  The analogy I saw in a documentary compared a runner running the 100 meter dash on a track, and the same runner doing it under water, to put a visual on the difference in air thickness.  Not to put too fine a point on it, but commercial jets simply cannot do what they are purported to have done on 9/11.</p>

<p>And I agree with you regarding the thermite residue and smoldering metal.  Absolutely, they are smoking guns, as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>right but .. theres so much video evidence.. of those airlines being flown into the building. thats why the speed argument doesnt make sense to me.</p>

<p>The idea that the very terrorists who were on those planes were allowed into the country through exceptions by the administrations lawyers is pretty much proof positive that they were allowed to do what they did on 9/11.</p>
