        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m writing today specifically to citizens of The United States of America. </p>

<p>For too long has your society rolled over to Oppressive implications such as the Patriot act. I may not know the full extent of US politics considering I am Irish but to me and the rest of Europe it is becoming blatantly obvious that you are living in a country (who&#39;s sole founding basis was liberty and freedom) that is built on oppression, fear and warmongering.</p>

<p>I am writing today to maybe convince some citizens to speak out or at least ask questions of your corrupt government that is run solely by corporations that can sway legislation in their favour.</p>

<p>Its ridiculous that some people listen to the likes of fox news and CNN who clearly follow the lead of the leaders. US media is propaganda and fear mongering on an epic scale.</p>

<p>Since 9/11 and the gulf wars you have been stripped of your liberty&#39;s and imprisoned for exposing some of the greatest injustices on the planet. For example a hero in my mind, Edward Snowdon exposed the hypocrisy of your governement , due to the NSA you have no privacy in your life. You might think &quot;Who cares? I&#39;ve done nothing wrong in my life&quot; but the horrible truth is that your OWN country, your pride does not trust you enough that they have to imprison anybody who ever tried to bring change.</p>

<p>You might think I sound like a conspiracy nut, but if you&#39;re government is willing to experiment on its own people (Mk Ultra) or assassinate a president who tried to bring peace (JFK) are they really working for you?</p>

<p>Your once great country is becoming a prison for self expression and determination. </p>

<p>Edit: I appreciate the feed back but it amazes me how people are condescending me because of my age  our generation is the future and people my age need to realise the flaws. People don&#39;t realise how discouraging this could be for other people and posters my age.</p>

<p>You claim to be doing woodworking, but according to our tracking software you purchased fertilizer,  and  3 months ago you bought stump remover, there is a chance you might be a dissident of the United States so you will now be put on the watch list, now all your key words are being thoroughly investigated</p>

<p>Also remember they are not just looking for terrorists they are also looking for people who speak out against war or the US, they are getting rid of the people who give a shit, so all thats left is people like you who don&#39;t give a shit, and you can do whatever you want to people like that,  like doubling gas prices for example, or starting another war, if you don&#39;t give a shit about nsa surveillance then you won&#39;t give a shit about that, and that&#39;s what they want, a stockholm syndrome money generator that fuels the war machine</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually it&#39;s not part of every day life for most Americans.  They don&#39;t think about much at all.   You see, when a Country is born, the doctors attach a mask to its face.  The citizens of the new country and the rest of the world get to see the pretty mask and even get to pick what gets drawn on the mask.  They make it very pretty, with lots of bells and whistles and distractions of all kinds.  Meanwhile, the face behind the mask sets about the deadly business of providing for the consumptive nature of the Country.  Karma is Karma, Sin is Sin... Bada-Bing-Bada-Boom, the hidden face becomes quite ugly with rotten fangs and all manners of physical perversion.  Luckily we only see the mask.</p>

<p>You should find out who the doctors are and write them a letter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we can narrow the search to those behind the central banks because money rules the world;  it runs the corporations, the governments, it orchestrates the wars, the false flags, the culture of consumerism and reality show/mainstream media mass hypnosis.  Just look to who owns the central banks. It is the root of all that ails us.  It is the viper&#39;s nest where mental slavery is hatched.  To attack the problems of humanity, the head of the snake must be cut off.  There is no use trying to write a letter appealing to their sense of humanity because they view themselves as a different and much superior species than us mere human beings.  In their minds they are entitled to it all and we are only here to work in the world to keep them comfortable in their gated wonderland of opulence and greed.  Greed&#39;s ugly twin is Power.  You can find them in the secret societies and secret meetings, wearing crowns; you can find them behind the disappeared children and black-mailed authorities who hide their crimes for them.  Their smoke screen is complete.  They are hidden from direct view and immune to all the laws of all the courts and even those of basic human decency.  </p>

<p>The only way to fight is to withdraw and refuse to engage in anything related to making it easier for them.  Reject the status quo and be prepared to live a life of austerity since only those who play the game can get ahead.  However, austerity and isolation is a small price to pay for full consciousness and freedom from the cradle to grave programming that keeps us all on the wheel going nowhere.</p>

<p>Our young Irishman&#39;s passion and concern is well-founded. However, he should not think for one second that this has nothing to do with his country.  It is a global scourge and it began hundreds of years ago in Europe, before the america&#39;s were conquered.  We are all in this thing together.  When the owners finally have their one world order established, it will include his fair island and every other place on this big blue marble because where central banking takes hold, the soul of that country has been forsaken.  The only ones left are Cuba, North Korea and Iran.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know you&#39;re 14, and you think you have everything figured out, but you posted this to a community that is already aware of what you&#39;re talking about.  (Although it is nice to see a 14-yr-old able to figure this out.)  The problem is our consumer culture.  The powers-that-be use this to their advantage.  The news and reality shows merge so that where one ends and the other begins becomes obscured.  People in this country are fed an engineered dialogue that shapes their schemas, and leads them to attack those whose schemas are not the same as theirs.  They internalize the bullshit, make it their own, and salute it as they salute the flag.  They think they are being &quot;American&quot;.  They are just being morons.  We live in a country of crooks and saps. The crooks are at the top, and the saps are down below.  Then there are those like us who live in between.  We hate the crooks for being crooks and the saps for being stupid.  You come here and show us a way to overturn this embedded paradigm, and you will be a true hero.  Until then, cut your condescending shit.</p>

<p>Good luck! Although Ireland is a hero of mine and I have my doubts about Snowden, Europe has her share of corruption and propaganda. </p>

<p>Quick question since you&#39;re young and Irish and I only heard this yarn yesterday... Have you ever heard that the Tuatha Dé Danann were pygmies, further, that St. Patrick chased these egalitarians from Ireland?</p>

<p>A fellow redditor sent me into this rabbit hole yesterday after I made public my realization that people today hunt, enslave, and cannabilize egalitarian pygmies in Africa. </p>

<p>Oh, and we don&#39;t sell out. We&#39;re bought at birth from our parents by the state. We are property. </p>

<p>Seriously, though, what a cop out. This kid is just parroting back the same tired tropes that everyone has heard a thousand times, and I think it&#39;s pretty presumptuous of him to act as an expert on US policy when he is a fourteen year old on the other side of the planet.</p>

<p>So I, who has been criticised more times than I can count, who has been left blue-in-the-face and livid at the inability for my fellow countrymen to wake up, who has spent the bulk of my life trying to get others to see the truth--I am the problem?  Why don&#39;t you leave your cozy little country with a population half as big as the <em>state</em> I live in and show us how to do it, little man.  You have a good, basic insight, but that&#39;s where it ends.  I don&#39;t feel helpless, I just don&#39;t give a shit anymore.  You don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like, and you&#39;re certainly too young to be passing any type of judgement as you did in your comment. So why don&#39;t you have some nice soda bread and butter and go back to your cartoons.</p>

<p>Edit:  When you get older, you&#39;ll realize the only person you can change is yourself.  And even that is hard.</p>

Your comments about Ireland are bullshit, we are one of the most liberal society&#39;s in the world as evidenced by the recent legalisation of Gay marriage. If I had a concern about my country I could go down to the local fine Gael office and voice my concerns and I would be listened to as I have been before.</p>

<p>We also have a very high level of freedom of speech, it would be an outrage if anybody got arrested for speaking out. Do not talk about a small country that you have no idea about and try not to use stereotypes from the 80s/90s that were put in place by the now hated Catholic Church.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes me sad when someone like <a href="/u/catlad2">/u/catlad2</a> makes a thoughtful post calling for action against the US gov and media for being corrupt and oppressive, and instead of being supported by by this community that should better than anyone just how true that is, he gets people cutting him down and saying &quot;you&#39;re too young to comment on politics&quot; or &quot;you should worry about your own country&quot; and so on. That makes me sick. We need people like this kid to call others to action. It doesn&#39;t matter what country he&#39;s from. All too often I feel like people on this sub want to talk about corruption and oppression but when someone calls them out and asks them to actually do something about it or stand up for something they throw a temper tantrum and start attacking the people they should be supporting. It especially annoys me that people are harping on the OP because of his age, I mean grow up people. Everyone is welcome here. we need to stop being so jaded and cynical here if we want to continue to grow the community. </p>

 We, Europeans, shouldn&#39;t criticize how poorly US citizens handle their government since we cannot handle ours, we must keep that in mind. 
Forget about them kid, we have much to do here in the EU ( no offense towards US people ). 
Best thing to do is not paying attention to govs. We must organize ourselves locally, out of their reach. Once small, yet strong, communities will have grown, we will start building larger ones again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One needs to look back at our founding fathers. George Washington was a freemason, Jefferson wrote that all men were created equal while owning slaves and having children with his owned slaves. The answer my friends is freemasonry in all of its veiled forms, elk lodges, rotary clubs, shriners. They all act so formal and righteous on the outside yet are corrupt to the core on the inside. The suffering these folks have caused the entire planet is overwhelming. They worship the sun and have made heliocentrics out of most all of us. The reality is geocentrism, the sun moon and stars rotate around us. At first you may laugh snicker or name call but this is the biggest conspiracy the planet faces. Instead of Ronald Reagan stating what would humanity do if there were an outside threat I say impossible the threat is internal it is in our minds, it is in the buildings (look for the upside down pentagram where the Whitehouse was built by freemasons. They worship Lucifer, the sun and have been able to sway the world into thinking so as well. You are not a worthless human on a dust speck spinning around another tiny star in a galaxy of stars. It is just us under the dome with everything rotating around us.</p>

<p>Trust me any person that does his own research will come to the same conclusion as you. But when you try to make a change such as contacting legislature and local government your plea will fall on deaf ears. You see these men we elect are not people that we elect at all. They are all paid government pricks that have bought, fought and done terrible things to get to the place of power they are now. No conventional peaceful method has worked. As you can see in the news some people are becoming fed up with this. As are most of the people I associate with. Trust me it wont last much longer. History has a funny way of repeating itself. What happened in 1775 may be what we are heading towards again. Except less muskets and less leadership. I think it will be an all out riot instead of a revolution. </p>

<p>If Europeans could end their ECB, I can guarantee you that would mobilize US citizens to do the same thing, and vice versa.

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of these responses sound like people wanting to call you &quot;son&quot; or people wanting to tell you to fuck off, blah blah. One of the best things about the internet is that you don&#39;t have to be a 14 year old Irish male. You can be an anonymous individual who deserves the same respect that you give to others, and a chance to voice your ideas and questions, in an open forum based on the sharing of information(knowledge). Don&#39;t mind the dickheads or the detractors. </p>

<p>I talk to a shit ton of people from different walks of life, and what you are talking about is not as simple as the People of the United States fixing a mistake. We are ALL under the control of a system that is not bound by national borders. It operates on a global scale, shifting in certain areas to better exploit local populations, resources, legal and monetary systems, etc. </p>

<p>This system cannot be changed &quot;from the inside&quot; or by direct confrontation. There are people in the U.S. (many, despite how it may seem) who see that their parents were sold a lie, and that only a complete dissolving of this corrupt system is the solution, but it cannot be done overnight. </p>

<p>You must educate yourself and keep high spirits, and reach out to others. Focus your mind and skills and inspire others to do the same, while those actions weaken the system exponentially. When the system becomes weak enough because we no longer give it money, let it feed us, or tell us what we can or cannot do or learn, it will lash out like a drowning monster, and attempt to take us all with it. All we have to do is let it drown and not succumb to its grasp. Just keep learning and be kind to others. Network with intelligent free thinkers who do not bow before ignorance and &quot;power&quot;. Whether the system lives or dies, things are going to get a fuckload worse than they are right now before they get better. Many people will be murdered, starved, poisoned, and worse. Just make sure that you and your friends are there to build a good version of the world when this one comes crashing down. </p>

<p>I am in between your generation and the one that bought the big lie that secured the current chaos America is serving the world, and I have been on file since I was 15. There are lots of people here who know what the time is and are not giving up. the world will be a very different place when you turn 18, so hang tight!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And you know why? </p>

<p>Because I promise your biggest exposure to Americans is through AMERICAN MEDIA. 2/3rds of Americans know quite well the Media lies, so should you. </p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe America is dead, take a look at the puppets up for presidential election. Every single one of them is saying things that would have been deemed unacceptable last cycle, but they&#39;re all blowing with the wind for 2016. Because the most important thing is to get elected, NOT actually govern. </p>

<p>And now that I say that, you&#39;re right. I&#39;m reminded that reddit&#39;s <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> represents AT BEST 3% of reddit. And reddit represents AT BEST 10% of the American public. So this place is hardly a gauge of American opinion. Much to the benefit of our class &quot;betters&quot;. </p>
