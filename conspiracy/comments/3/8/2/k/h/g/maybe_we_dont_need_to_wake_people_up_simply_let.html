       This is harder than it seems.  If you ask chicken if they are happy, they will say yes.  They have food, water, and a roof over their heads.  They will never see that slaughterhouse next door.  Even if you show them pictures.  They have to want to see it.  You cannot force them.

       This. Even when confronted with the fact that most of their news is controlled or even fabricated, they avoid seeking out real news entirely. I am always told, "I don't want to think about it. Its complicated or stressful" to which I always tell them,"Just because you put your head in the sand, does not make it all go away. At least try to investigate it for yourself."

       Thanks for this. Now I understand the full meaning of the phrase "fair and balanced." It's a fuck you to the people which no doubt inspires toasts of 50 year old Glenfiddich  and a round of fine Cubans in certain circles.

       Easier to convince them of that than say "9/11 was an inside job". It is already public knowledge that they are privately owned companies. So it is not "free" in the true sense of the word. They will admit to that.

       So you're one of those semitic self hating anti-semites. The most dangerous of all.

      <p>
       I hope you know that I'm just pulling your leg man, I'm actually 25% Ashkenazi. Equating Anti-Zionism with Anti-Semitism takes the same mental acrobatics as equating Anti-KKK with Anti-White. One is a huge group of people with diverse thoughts and beliefs and the other is a cultish radical group of violent racists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if anyone who spoke out against the KKK was deemed an Anti-White terrorist, how fucking stupid would that be? Same deal, different words. The only difference is that the KKK was never in charge of a country.

       Doesn't exist, homie.  The only unbiased news you can get is news that you witness firsthand.  Even then, a humans natural bias will influence what you see.  Just gotta do your best to sperate facts from spin and "truth."

       Alt media is already discounted by the average American, especially 'tard sites like InfoLiars.com and Veterans30%IsLiesToday.com

       I think as more millennials cut the cord and move away from the CNNs and Foxs, we'll have a nation of more informed citizens. But we still will have to rid ourselves of the Kardashian type social media.

       Those people who would care, already know they can access media from all over the world, can read direct reports by reporters and civilians on the ground all over the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       But most people don't really care much as long as the economy keeps going, they have a job and a house and can raise their kids.  The media just reflects their interest, mainly gives them weather and sports and local car-crashes and house fires and stuff.

       The first thing that anyone of us needs to do is educate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yourself, then others. You need to throw away everything you think you know about yourself, the world around you, and come to terms with what is
       <em>
        beyond
       </em>
       you. You need to identify with what you are trying to accomplish, understand your intentions and probable results, and act in a manner that does not violate others to accomplish it. You need to identify that which is not working and remove it; the pain you will experience is called growth. Do not throw away things that are working; instead improve them.
      </p>

       No man can tell you what truth is, but you can know.

       You are trying to "wake" people correct? It's directly related to your post. You are talking about educating people. This is your stated intention. In order to educate them in this instance you need to educate yourself to make sure that you aren't spitting ridiculous nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is their media controlled? By what means are these carried out? Is there certain phrasings or language that people should look out for? Are you trying to tell them that they are propagating false events, or trying to steer events into a certain narrative? How are narratives deconstructed?
      </p>
      <p>
       The one-word encapsulation I offered to this idea of helping to wake others is educate. If I was to approach you in the street you should be able to answer all of my questions convincingly or you have already failed the first step. You need to refine and test your statements for effect and consequence, you need to able able to talk to people or you are shooting yourself in the foot before you even begin. Why would I not immediately dismiss you if you cannot formulate a proper response to a simple dialogue?

       Education is a life long process, and there are multiple ways of educating one's self... for example, trying out the strategy that I suggested in my post.

       What strategy? That's what I've been getting at the whole time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your "strategy" is vague and undetermined. You aren't even attempting your own ideas. You are actually saying "you guys should..." because you aren't contributing anything other than some half-baked vague argument with no points, corroborating data, or clear objective.
      </p>

       Wrong. I said "Maybe" inferring a suggestion. I just wanted feedback to the suggestion in question, not some random, unsolicited advice from an internet stranger. If you have something to say, stick to the point.
