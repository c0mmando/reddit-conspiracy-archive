    <div class="md"><p>Yes,  the fact they also made themselve immune from prosecution for insider trading.    Its a source.    What do you want,   a taped conversation :)</p>

<p>The Patriot Act will be renewed.   Once they fix it to protect themselves.    One Hastert is enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds about right.  I just didn&#39;t know if you had actually read this was a provision in the actual bill or not.  If there&#39;s really an immunity clause in there protecting politicians from the spying grid, I&#39;d love to see it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Immunity clause......   In real life,  did Hoover need an immunity clause?   No,   in real life the chips being played for keeps were not the chips on the table.     </p>

<p>That is really a shame for the rule of law.    There is a rule of law by which losers can be hauled off.    But the lead players have means to escape the rule of law.    Many carry their powers to the end,  most do.    But that is due to a consensus.    Loyalties.    Favors continued through generations of dynasties.    The ship holds together by this consensus,   and punishments are reserved for those who threaten the ship.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the ideal of democracy,   this consensus is operated in secrecy.   The greatest need of secrecy and privacy is by those with the most to lose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Former House Speaker Dennis Hastert accused of hiding sex abuse of former student.   NSA spying provisions may have helped nail this crooked politician.    Has other politicians scared,  demanding immunity in private.   NSA also knows this.    </p>

<p>Citizens are entitled to privacy,   but how much secrecy do we want out politicians to have when they are conducting the peoples business.    Maybe we should keep the NSA just to let us know what the politicians are doing.    Also as a condition for corporate charters,   we should have the NSA track corporate activities,   since the corporations have a license to feed off the slavery of citizens.    Hey,  maybe the corporations should be there to serve the citizens,  and maybe corporate secrecy has it limits?    Don&#39;t they need to earn the right to live,  prove their worthiness to be chartered by the public?</p>

<p>Things really are upside down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This doesn&#39;t make sense to me. If you&#39;re a politician, and you&#39;ve done something wrong in the past, what difference is it going to make if you stop the spying going forward? They already have you.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s for future crimes, I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;re smart enough to know that the surveillance is going to continue whether they renew the bill or not.</p>

<p>If anything, holding their vote ransom for immunity only serves to burn bridges and piss off the NSA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This morning I read that they are working up a new legislative work around.     Probably written by lobbyists for the military contractors,  Israel,  etc.    New legislation is rarely fully read or comprehended at the time of passage.    It will have the necessary changes in it to satisfy the various interests.</p>

<p>But you are right,   politicians will always be at risk.    That is the deal they sign up for.    Obviously,   some have been more untouchable than others.    Connections,   money,   back scratching.   Kind of like Rome.    House of Cards.</p>
