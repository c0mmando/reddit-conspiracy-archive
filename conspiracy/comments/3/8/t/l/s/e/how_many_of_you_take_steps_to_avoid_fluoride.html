       I'm curious. My wife recently bought fluoride free toothpaste and she said it was difficult to find and the only one in the store.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also we own a Brita water filter but haven't yet made the step towards a reverse osmosis filtration device.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, how serious are other members of this subreddit in your guys attempts to avoid fluoride?

       Here are a bunch of sources of fluoride:
      </p>
      <p>
       Toothpaste, conventional grapes (also raisins/wine), pickles, green/black tea (major source), mechanically deboned meat, some pharmaceuticals, close proximity to certain factories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say you cut out the fluoridated water, F toothpaste, green tea, and several foods high in fluoride. Your daily fluoride dosage would go from around 3-5 mg (could be way higher) to near zero. 5 mg was the dosage of F given to people with hyperthyroidism, coupled with low iodine. If you have a relatively low iodine intake, you should notice a metabolism boost from cutting the fluoride out.

       Yep, cold showers are better. You shower for much less time (saving water), it relieves symptoms of depression, and lowers F dose. It's not particularly pleasant, but it really wakes you up quickly.

       When you get used to it it's very refreshing, and is MUCH better for your skin , hot water will loosen up and strip away your skins natural oils, this is why you need moisturizer all the time.

       This.

       You absorb far, far more fluoride from bathing in fluoridated water than you do from brushing your teeth, hypothetically, 50x per day with standard fluoridated toothpaste.

       Just make sure you get enough iodine.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're referring to some kind of detox method, I'm not so sure it will work or if it's a good idea. Your time would be better spent by thinking about other areas of health. Most of the F that remains in the body goes to bones (mostly benign, high levels may cause brittle bones), and the kidneys pull some of the F out of the blood. As long as you limit your daily intake, your blood F levels should be pretty low.

       I personally just consume foods high in iodine. I used to take over 20 supplements, and I'm down to about 6 or so. It's a lot cheaper to eat correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
       One example is selenium. 2 Brazil nuts raises your selenium as much as taking a standard selenium supplement.

       Thanks! I'll look into it. I thought cryolite was the main source of fluoride on conventional grapes, which is why I normally suggest organic if the person needs to consume grapes.

       Q. Does the ZeroWater filter remove Fluoride?
A. ZeroWater filters are not certified for the reduction of fluoride however fluoride is an inorganic compound. The TDS meter is designed to detect inorganic compounds. Fluoride levels in water are usually around 2 to 4 ppm, which will show up on the meter as 002 to 004. So when filtered water reads 000 it is not likely that fluoride is present in water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you? This clearly states it cannot reduce levels, only that it is "likely" to detect them if they are.

       I'm very cautious of fluoride due to the various negative effects I've heard it has on humans. I've been a user of fluoride free toothpaste for years and can't remember the last time I drank from the tap. Although in small amounts I imagine it's not too harmful, I still stay away from the stuff as much as possible.

       I moved to BC, where they do not fluoridate the water supply, from Halifax, where they do. I use a water filter (zero water) to eliminate as much as I can, and then another water filter (sante via) to reintroduce minerals to the water post filtering. Zero Water does not officially eliminate fluoride, but it comes with a ppm stick that you can use to test the water, and a new filter should bring it down to 0.00, which they say "should mean fluoride is eliminated".
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually I want to use a RO system but this is what I have for now. I didn't know about green tea / fluoride, definitely something to consider. I feel better now having moved to BC, but, there's lots of reasons for that so hard to say if it's the fluoride. There's lots of other crap in the water, run off pharmaceuticals, heavy metals, etc. No matter where you live, you should filter.

       I just looked Primo water brand up and it says it is 99.99% pure water that does NOT have fluoride in it.  It looks like it could be a pretty good alternative for someone who can't get a reverse osmosis in their home.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone is interested they have a
       <a href="http://store.primowater.com/Files/StoreLocator.aspx">

       I purchase distilled exclusively.  A mere $25/mo is a small price to pay.  Don't believe the idiots who claim it "strips minerals."  Consume your minerals elsewhere in your diet.  Appreciable results after the first month.

       You're basically flushing away nutrients from your body drinking distilled water unless you added a powdered substance or something. It doesn't matter how many nutrients you ingest if drinking distilled because it will be flushed right out.

       Absolutely untrue.  Do some learning before you speak publicly.  Trace minerals DO NOT need to be sourced from water.  If your only source of these same trace minerals is found in the water supply you consume, you have far greater iasues than water purity.

       Not even close.  I don't know which quack DO you've been listening to, if you think anything but pure water is the epitome of what you should consume.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's have a little thought experiment.  You believe that because water can absorb other minerals and substances, it will further "leach" the same from your body.  You body then absorbs some or these trace materials, therefore allowing, as you claim, in drinking tap water, more trace minerals to be absorbed and pulled out by the water.  I'm afraid it doesn't work like that.  Distilled water is absorbed a lot more quickly into your bloodstream than tap, spring, or filtered water, because there are no minerals from the water to slow the absorption process.
      </p>
      <p>
       So not only am I avoiding fluoride, I'm also avoiding pesticides, chlorine, drugs, and other harmful substances.  You may want to look into such benefits for yourself.  And push come to shove, if you're unable to discover the truth on your own, beneficial trace minerals can very easily be re-added to the distilled, 100% pure water you consume.  Enjoy.

       Again, absolutely untrue.  As stated originally, if you ARE NOT receiving your minerals from your diet, you would continue that deficit while consuming distilled water.  There is absolutely nothing harmful or inherently damaging that will ever come from consuming 100% pure distilled water.

       It is water's chemical composition and physical attributes that make it such an excellent solvent. Water molecules have a polar arrangement of oxygen and hydrogen atoms—one side (hydrogen) has a positive electrical charge and the other side (oxygen) had a negative charge. This allows the water molecule to become attracted to many other different types of molecules.

      <p>
       When the water comes from natural sources, it's like using fine sandpaper. When distilled, it's like a fresh sheet of coarse sandpaper.

       Your claimed understanding of chemistry is quite shallow, I'm afraid.  But now that you've established your lack of molecular understanding, why not show us people who have been adversely affected by consuming pure water.
      </p>
      <p>
       With how easily available pure water is to the masses, along with the large numbers of consumers who consume distilled water, by your logic, there has to be multitudes of people injured by such consumption.

       We voted fluoride from our water in our city and then I distill all my water and use Tom's toothpaste. Before that I had an RO since 2008, I'm also the flat earth guy (the final conspiracy and the most important/essential to grasp) and have been off fluoride for 7 years.

       All huge lies have an expiration date.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's put it this way; if you watched transoceanic flight become a reality...basically routine (despite being far far too advanced for the technology of its day) and then, one day, it simply
       <em>
        disappeared
       </em>
       , never to be repeated by your country or any other country, would you be slightly skeptical?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, the company that supposedly did the initial flying, came out and publicly stated "...well, even with today's technology, we can't really do any more of that transoceanic flying until this little problem of deadly amounts of radiation that you have to fly through is studied further and worked out..."--would THAT sketch you out at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       People are finally figuring out NASA's big lie...and where all of that Vietnam-era black-budget money came from to boot...

       Read through my posts or check out ifers.board.net and flat earth conspiracy video by Eric dubay on youtube. This will be your best explanation as I don't want to be the authority on this I want you to think it through for yourself.

       The amount you post about it makes me think you do indeed want to be the authority on the topic.

       Also maybe make your own posts about it instead of hijacking every other post you can find.

       Also maybe get a username that is less obviously chosen to be inflammatory.  Except I'm relatively sure that it is all intentional.

       Yes, but the curve of the Earth is difficult to spot except where it is completely flat with some background, like mountains.  Surely you've seen a ship on the horizon....why do we see the sails first as the ship approaches shore?

       Actually, looking at a ship through a binoculars or telescope has the same effect -- you see sails first.  You don't see the curve of the horizon due to it being so small when zoomed in like that.  You need a larger perspective, which is why viewing a highway recede into the distance on a perfectly flat plane of salts works so much better:  you have the correct perspective, wide viewing angle and distance, and a straight line to make the curvature obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the earth is flat, why is gravity felt equally and in the same direction everywhere in the globe?  A flat earth would have a center of gravity at the center of the disc.  You would only fall "down" if you stood at the center of the disc.  Anyone living away from the center wouldn't fall "down" but rather towards the center of the disc.

       That's because gravity has never been proven. Just because we have an equation that shows 9.8m/s2 does not prove two objects regardless of mass and size attract each other. You need to give up gravity and focus on density and buoyancy.

       OK, so you can't answer that question.  Let's try this one. If the earth is flat, why don't commercial flights just fly in straight lines between destinations?  Why do they curve?  This makes perfect sense on a globe, but I'd like to hear your explanation.

       They do curve look at the globe flights they are ALL arcs, these arcs when de-balled or de-sphered turn into straight lines.

       Yes, exactly.  Note that in the Northern Hemisphere they all arc Northwards? Why? Euclidean Geometry dawg.  On the surface of a sphere a straight line between two points is a curved line.  Arced flights are the most fuel-efficient path on the surface of a sphere.  Thanks for confirming round earth.

       We have tides due to sun heating up the oceans and interconnected bodies of water smal lakes don't have high and low tides.

       Can't see north star due to distance earth is 50,000 miles in diameter. You aren't superman you have a viewing distance limit.

       It has a magnetic north in the center from mount Meru to other magnetic mountains I cannot say for sure because I have not been there.

       Dude, the wobble takes like 23000 years to move from one extreme to the other.  Ancient star maps show a different North Star and current models expect a different star in another few thousand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sun heats the oceans causing tides?  LOL.  Please explain this further, how does it work?
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, I can see much farther than 50,000 miles.  I can see the sun which is millions of miles and even stars which are light-years away.  Vision is just light reaching your eyes, sending signals down the optic nerve to be interpreted by the brain.  Your explanation is laughably bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your explanation of the magnetic field is no explanation at all.  Laughably bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Water never truly levels out.  It curves at a rate of 8 inches per mile since it is attracted to the center of the Earth's mass.  When you fill a pot of water that is 12 inches across, the curvature is there but incredibly small, so small that it is negligible.  This question poses zero difficulty for the standard model.  If you don't understand I can explain further or maybe just ask your Jr. High science teacher.

       But what you're saying doesn't make sense.  If it went beyond my vision, the sun would become a tiny dot before disappearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       In real life the sun disappears over the horizon, it does not become a small dot.  It is cut into 3/4, then 1/2, then 1/4 of it's original vertical size, not total size.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have an extremely open mind, and have spent hours looking over the evidence for flat Earth, but saying the sun goes beyond the capabilities of my vision simply doesn't make sense because it doesn't become a small dot.

       Then, the company that supposedly did the initial flying, came out and publicly stated "...well, even with today's technology, we can't really do any more of that transoceanic flying until this little problem of deadly amounts of radiation that you have to fly through is studied further and worked out..."--would THAT sketch you out at all?

       People are finally figuring out NASA's big lie...and where all of that Vietnam-era black-budget money came from to boot...

       Q. Does the ZeroWater filter remove Fluoride?
A. ZeroWater filters are not certified for the reduction of fluoride however fluoride is an inorganic compound. The TDS meter is designed to detect inorganic compounds. Fluoride levels in water are usually around 2 to 4 ppm, which will show up on the meter as 002 to 004. So when filtered water reads 000 it is not likely that fluoride is present in water.

       Did you? This clearly states it cannot reduce levels, only that it is "likely" to detect them if they are.
