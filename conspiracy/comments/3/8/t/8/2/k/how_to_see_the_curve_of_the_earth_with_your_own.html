       When I was a boy on a Florida vacation, an old guy was walking around telling the kids how to see the curve of the Earth.  He said to start by looking at the waters color at the shore and then look out to see where the water met the clouds.  Slowley look all the way to the left, keeping your eyes on the line where the sky and water meet, then slowley look all the way to the right.  Once you can see the line where the sky and water meet turn your head quickly all the way left then right.  You will see the curve of the Earth.  It isn't flat.  Never was.  Still isn't. Won't ever be, exceept in the heads of idiots.

       Flat Earth theory is used for disinformation tactics, along with a couple of other exaggerated conspiracy theories. It's purpose is to steer potential conspiracy theorists away from hubs like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , and make them feel we are all loonatics.

       No I am not a disinformation agent, this is the truth. Loonatics believe everything they are told, believe in authority, pay taxes, and question the sanity of others who don't buy the social norm bullshit.

       The believers in a flat earth, in my opinion, have been sent by our opponents to brand us as fools.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there are any legit flat earthers I think you can successfully prove your contention by just cruising on over the the edge of the earth with your camera and reporting back  to us  from there.

       The Greeks knew the earth was a sphere, and measured the diameter within 10 percent, 2500 years ago.  Educated people never thought the earth was flat, common misconception and unfortunately for some reason a large number of idiots have taken it on as an internet "cause".

       Genuine reply to when I said that: Discovered by the Freemason/illuminati Pythagoras. Of course the masons wouldnt be founded for thousands of years and the illuminati even longer.

       You can't argue with them though, they are religious about that 'theory' (though I don't want to call it that)

       Hey, look.  I've flown across the Atlantic
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       Pacific oceans.  I've seen the glass walls they built to keep in all the water of the oceans and seas.  It's just like a fish tank, man.  We just live on the big rocks that poke out of the water a little bit.  It's funny though.  Some of us actually own aquariums.  So they have aquariums inside aquariums.  Can you believe that?  Before they made those glass walls a wee bit taller though, boats and ships used to tumble right over the lip if they went out too far though.  It's a shame though.  You'd think they'd be able to see the lip approaching and turn around cause they went too far.  Hell, there's nothing outside the lip.  I've seen it.  It all just goes black.  Like a void.  Those ship captains who sailed right over the edge, what were they thinking?  They must've been asleep....
      </p>
      <p>
       But on a serious note, anyone who thinks, feels, believes, even considers that the world is flat, doesn't deserve the air it takes to keep themselves alive...

       The thing I don't get about all of this is. IF the earth was flat wouldn't there be picture evidence of the edges of the earth, because you know out of the billions of people living here I'm sure at least ONE person would have made it to the edge..

       Try to explain sun setting behind the horizon and timezones if the earth is flat like you and others claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the fact that startrails are circural near the polar regions are tend to straighten out near the equator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, try to explain seasonal changes in weather across the globe, metheorology (it would be impossible to predict the weather, create weather models, etc. if the earth wasn't a globe and we didn't have Coriolis effect).

      </p>
      <p>
       He puts his real phone number at the end of the video. Maybe he can answer some of your questions or maybe you can call him out.

       I do encourage you to watch the video. He does raise some rather interesting questions about this topic. Let me know how the chat goes if you decide to contact him

       Btw ,the link you provided is competely filled with falsehoods, I just don't have enough time to disprove them all, besides, they have already been disproved. It's called science. He says there is no proof for Earth being round, when even the ancient Greeks were able to arrive at Earth's circumference with an error below 10%. Sigh, I'm done with your trolling.

       Thanks for acting like a typical redditor and assuming what I believe and automatically falling into the "you're wrong and I'm right." argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe in the flat earth. Nor do I believe in the globe. The reason I don't believe in either is because I have never seen conclusive proof for either with my "own eyes" and neither have you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never been to space and I'm very confident you have not. We have never seen the earth with our own eyes and likely never will. The only reason I'm even replying is because you seem like a douche,
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm most certainly not on a particular side of this debate. However being a douche is no way to win an argument. Respectful conversation is the only way to speak no matter how crazy the conspiracy or subject is.

       I won't call myself a flat earther like I wouldn't call myself a 9/11 truther, because those are names someone else gave to me.

       9/11 while important is a mere drop in the bucket to how deep the deception goes. There are hundreds of videos on flat earth some are controlled opposition most are not but this is the conspiracy that sets humans free that I'm 100% sure of. Even if George Bush came out with a confession tomorrow humanity would not be free this will though.

       first off it's "Slowly" not "Slowley" which you misspelled twice. Spell check is built into every browser now a days you have no excuse. 
About your argument... It's absurd. Moving my head quickly from left to right doesn't prove anything how do you know you actually turned your head in a perfectly flat line and not a curved line. 
Also if you can't see when you are sitting still, then you can't see it while moving your head around.

       To be honest, I am afraid this is an illusion. Let me be clear, the Earth is obviously a sphere, but the horizon always appears absolutely flat (ie "horizontal") to somebody standing on the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an analogy, if I were to put my (empty) waste-paper basket over my head, with the rim exactly at eye level, and turn around keeping the basket steady, the rim will be appear to be a single, horizontal line. The same thing applies for the horizon - what you are seeing is the circumference of a circle, but because your eye-level is essentially on the same plane as that circle, the circumference of that circle appears to be a straight line.

       The line of the horizon is about 75 miles long.  What you will see is about 75 miles or arc of the circumference of a sphere. That is about 1/335th of the total circumference.  Draw a straight line from one end of the arc to the other, then measure the height at the center point to the top of the arc. The height is enough to be seen with the naked eye.  But first get your head out of a waste basket.

       We cannot see the arc because we are standing on top of it - the surface of the Earth thus it appears to us be a two dimensional plane. If you go somewhere with a 360 viewable horizon, and were to trace that horizon onto a transparent strip, you would get a completely straight line. The curvature is in the third dimension and we can't see that because the horizon appears to us to be in two dimensions.

       I thought we had both been members of this subreddit long enough not resort to insults but obviously not. Your unresearched and (predictably) erroneous assumptions about my age, education and nationality are almost as amusing to me as your childlike belief that the curvature of the earth is "visible" when looking at the horizon.

      <p>
       I've tried to give you nice simple analogies but this clearly hasn't worked, so how about a couple of images?

      <p>
       You appear to think a
       <strong>
        360 degree view of the horizon
       </strong>
       would look like this:

       Then please show me a 360 degree panoramic image of the horizon (using a 50mm lens or above, not a fisheye lens) - taken by a person standing at sea level (as per your ludicrous anecdote) - which appears to show a "curve" or even your speciality, a "wave". Hubris is a bitch, my friend.

       One of these days you will be standing next to a body of water where you can't see the other side of it.  Do the scan.  You will see the curve, just like all the many before you.  I can imagine your embarrassment, but I can't imagine the dilemma your two dimensional  thought processor will have wrapping itself around the three dimensional observation before you.

       You may think you see a curve, but as I told you politely in the first sentence of my very first comment, you don't - it's
       <strong>
        an illusion
       </strong>
       . One that fooled your child's mind then, and sadly still does now. Oh, and the horizon for someone standing at sea level is about
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon">
        3 miles away
       </a>
       , incidentally, not 35 miles, so this is yet another random assertion of yours which is completely off the wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and from that wikipedia article: For observers near sea level the difference between this geometrical horizon (which assumes a perfectly flat, infinite ground plane) and the true horizon (which assumes a spherical Earth surface)
       <strong>
        is imperceptible to the naked eye.
