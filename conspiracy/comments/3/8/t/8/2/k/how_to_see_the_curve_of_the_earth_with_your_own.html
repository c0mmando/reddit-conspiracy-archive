He said to start by looking at the waters color at the shore and then look out to see where the water met the clouds.  Slowley look all the way to the left, keeping your eyes on the line where the sky and water meet, then slowley look all the way to the right.  Once you can see the line where the sky and water meet turn your head quickly all the way left then right.  You will see the curve of the Earth.  It isn&#39;t flat.  Never was.  Still isn&#39;t. Won&#39;t ever be, exceept in the heads of idiots.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, look.  I&#39;ve flown across the Atlantic <em>and</em> Pacific oceans.  I&#39;ve seen the glass walls they built to keep in all the water of the oceans and seas.  It&#39;s just like a fish tank, man.  We just live on the big rocks that poke out of the water a little bit.  It&#39;s funny though.  Some of us actually own aquariums.  So they have aquariums inside aquariums.  Can you believe that?  Before they made those glass walls a wee bit taller though, boats and ships used to tumble right over the lip if they went out too far though.  It&#39;s a shame though.  You&#39;d think they&#39;d be able to see the lip approaching and turn around cause they went too far.  Hell, there&#39;s nothing outside the lip.  I&#39;ve seen it.  It all just goes black.  Like a void.  Those ship captains who sailed right over the edge, what were they thinking?  They must&#39;ve been asleep....</p>

<p>But on a serious note, anyone who thinks, feels, believes, even considers that the world is flat, doesn&#39;t deserve the air it takes to keep themselves alive...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for acting like a typical redditor and assuming what I believe and automatically falling into the &quot;you&#39;re wrong and I&#39;m right.&quot; argument. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in the flat earth. Nor do I believe in the globe. The reason I don&#39;t believe in either is because I have never seen conclusive proof for either with my &quot;own eyes&quot; and neither have you. </p>

<p>I have never been to space and I&#39;m very confident you have not. We have never seen the earth with our own eyes and likely never will. The only reason I&#39;m even replying is because you seem like a douche, </p>

<p>I&#39;m most certainly not on a particular side of this debate. However being a douche is no way to win an argument. Respectful conversation is the only way to speak no matter how crazy the conspiracy or subject is.</p>

<p>To be honest, I am afraid this is an illusion. Let me be clear, the Earth is obviously a sphere, but the horizon always appears absolutely flat (ie &quot;horizontal&quot;) to somebody standing on the surface. </p>

<p>As an analogy, if I were to put my (empty) waste-paper basket over my head, with the rim exactly at eye level, and turn around keeping the basket steady, the rim will be appear to be a single, horizontal line. The same thing applies for the horizon - what you are seeing is the circumference of a circle, but because your eye-level is essentially on the same plane as that circle, the circumference of that circle appears to be a straight line.</p>

<p>We cannot see the arc because we are standing on top of it - the surface of the Earth thus it appears to us be a two dimensional plane. If you go somewhere with a 360 viewable horizon, and were to trace that horizon onto a transparent strip, you would get a completely straight line. The curvature is in the third dimension and we can&#39;t see that because the horizon appears to us to be in two dimensions.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried to give you nice simple analogies but this clearly hasn&#39;t worked, so how about a couple of images?</p>

<p>You appear to think a <strong>360 degree view of the horizon</strong> would look like this:</p>

<p>You may think you see a curve, but as I told you politely in the first sentence of my very first comment, you don&#39;t - it&#39;s <strong>an illusion</strong>. One that fooled your child&#39;s mind then, and sadly still does now. Oh, and the horizon for someone standing at sea level is about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon">3 miles away</a>, incidentally, not 35 miles, so this is yet another random assertion of yours which is completely off the wall. </p>

<p>Oh, and from that wikipedia article: For observers near sea level the difference between this geometrical horizon (which assumes a perfectly flat, infinite ground plane) and the true horizon (which assumes a spherical Earth surface) <strong>is imperceptible to the naked eye.</strong></p>
