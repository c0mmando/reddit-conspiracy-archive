        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have to say firstly that I am familiar with the Cecil Hotel. I&#39;ve stayed there, my boyfriend used to live there in around 2006. I have been in and around the Cecil a few times but can attest that the security there is pretty tight. The guards I remember being rather fascistic. Going through my bags, etc. as I was &quot;a guest&quot; to my BF who lived there for a time when he was down on his luck. I am not a religious person whatsoever, but rather pretty empathetic to the &quot;atmosphere&quot; of an area. I was unfamiliar when I first visited, to the grim past that later came to light in the wake of more recent events regarding the year 2013. </p>

<p>I remember visiting my BF (we are gay) and being kinda turned off by the fact that I had to use a public restroom as the rooms themselves do not have restrooms in them. Rather, there is about an 8 foot by 10 foot room with a lousy bed and a window that faces a brick wall. And IT IS HOT IN THERE. Los Angeles style hot. There is a sink in each room, but that is all. One is not permitted to cook, rather they are made to go to the lobby to purchase 7/Eleven style chow that is microwaveable and usually stale. But having to use the restroom which was a single toilet deal but located down the hallway and around the corner was a bit of a hassle--however, when nature calls...... I actually didn&#39;t think much of the place walking the hallways to find the restroom. It was definitely in need of a good dosing of Febreeze fer shur...and the rugs were 10 years past their prime of being past their prime. But I did my business and started to head back to my BFs room. I felt a hot rush of air in the hallway. Very strange. Like an oven door but humid unlike the the surrounding air in L.A. which is not that great for people who prefer wearing contact lenses. It was sticky and I actually got flushed with blood as if I had taken a shot of whiskey or something. This startled me and I hurried back to the room. I mentioned the issue to my BF and he said the place was creepy and he would sometimes hear people either fighting or even women screaming from floors above on some nights (L.A. is not that pretty sometimes especially right off of Skid Row).</p>

<p>Long story short, after that date I got this intense interest in wanting to go back with a tape recorder to see if I could capture anything. I have never sought such a pastime previously in my life...but there was something about that rush I felt in the hallway...not a headrush nothing like that. I hadn&#39;t had any coffee, so it wasn&#39;t caffeine. It was a &quot;spot&quot; in the hallway. Hot and in retrospect very angry. I felt it rushed me. I don&#39;t feel like I walked into it. I never went back after that save once or twice but never to spend the night. I had my BF move in with me feeling unsettled by the place in general. I didn&#39;t like the way the security treated me like I was some sort of criminal. They had camera screens at their booths and they were kinda like the typical machismo cops-for-hire, thumbs in belts types with their chins out to appear bigger....but they were not benign either. In retrospect I think of them as hostile to both me and to my BF who was an actual &quot;tenant&quot; there. He would often have to argue to get them to unlock his room that he would be locked out of during his workday shift if he forgot to pay rent in the morning instead of when he returned. They were real jerks and it was &quot;clamped down&quot; in tone. I even commented that I felt like I was being checked into a prison the way they were treating me.</p>

<p>Due to these factors, it&#39;s no wonder I never returned and I also motivated myself to help my BF get out of there. The place was/is bad news IMO. It&#39;s right in front of Skid Row. There is prostitution, drug use, likely human trafficking. It&#39;s the part of L.A that leaves many uneasy (I was used to it however, in what to expect there, at least and I realized too that so long as you stay in the light, no one really messes with you, and when you&#39;re not in the light, just act crazy).  After that, many years passed and I forgot about the hotel for the most part. Every now and then I would think to myself...&quot;I should go back with a tape recorder or something&quot; (but it&#39;s likely the fascist security would confiscate it from me).  My BF and I later separated in 2009 and I went on with life. Then early in 2013 the hotel came up again with the death of Elisa Lam.</p>

<p>It was with Elisa Lam that I learned the long weird history of the place. But after being grossed out by the whole story and being that there was nothing one could do as it was in the hands of the police where it belonged, I let that too soon slip out of my mind as I ended up moving out of L.A. rather unexpectedly within four months of the Lam story. But at the time I remember thinking &quot;I should have gone back there with a tape recorder!!&quot; And I remember thinking another thing. That place has tight security. And then I watched the video and noticed what looked like a foot or a shadow of a foot, pivot in one slice of the lower left corner. I was intrigued but the death ruled accidental, I also put it to rest in my head. However, being a critical thinker as well, I couldn&#39;t get that shadow of the foot pivoting out of my head after Elisa herself has exited the frame to the left of the screen. To the left of the elevator is a door to stairway access, FYI. I thought that if that foot was the person responsible, they&#39;d be right-handed for as precisely as the shadow appears to pivot, the long held open elevator door closes. I assume this is the person turning the key to the elevator upon pivoting to permit it to close. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen the footage of the sped up version to match actual seconds and I agree it appears footage is missing. I had a feeling on the day her body was found that it was a security guard or janitor and definitely more than one person...but rather two people. I never suspected a hotel guest. Anyway....back to me forgetting about it. I had long forgotten about the Cecil and Elisa Lam due to my abrupt move...until two weeks ago when through Facebook my ex BF contacted me and we started talking about the Cecil. After that conversation, I did a search for the hotel and found a link to a blog that is a precise description of the experience one has there. It was an article from 2008 called &quot;A Dump with a Future&quot;</p>

<p>That link is: <a href="http://www.joeydevilla.com/2008/11/03/a-dump-with-a-future-or-my-review-of-the-cecil-hotel-los-angeles">http://www.joeydevilla.com/2008/11/03/a-dump-with-a-future-or-my-review-of-the-cecil-hotel-los-angeles</a></p>

<p>Amused by the write up I continued to scroll the article and finally hit the comments. The comments abruptly end in 2010. All of them agreeing for the most part the place is a dump. Plus one comment by the hotel manager giving some reason for the decrepit state of it...But then something else is present AFTER the &quot;abrupt end of comments in 2010. All of these now much later after the Elisa Lam story occurred. However...there is the comment that caught my eye that kicks off the point of this whole missive. It was posted the day BEFORE Elisa&#39;s body was found. It was posted in Chinese. It was posted by someone going by the name (Chinese symbol for) &quot;Little&quot; Abby. It asks a question with a Chinese character it asks Elisa&#39;s ethnic Chinese name with a question mark. The post was the first comment to the random blog I stumbled upon, in three years since the previous one and it was made the day PRIOR to the finding of Elisa&#39;s body and it was asking the question &quot;Elisa?&quot; (essentially, but in Chinese)</p>

<p>That link is: <a href="http://www.joeydevilla.com/2008/11/03/a-dump-with-a-future-or-my-review-of-the-cecil-hotel-los-angeles/#comment-55822">http://www.joeydevilla.com/2008/11/03/a-dump-with-a-future-or-my-review-of-the-cecil-hotel-los-angeles/#comment-55822</a></p>

<p>I found this creepy. I decided to do a google for &quot;Little Abby&quot; and came up with nothing. So I added to the search and did one for &quot;Abby &amp; Elisa Lam&quot;....and results got a hit. A link I didn&#39;t click as my computer warned it had a malicious virus attached to the site. But from the Google description that was appearing that returned the results was the name Abby Lam. The person was from Shenzhen, Guangdong. I did a search for that city....and found out it is synonymous with human trafficking and prostitution. Why did Elisa stop in L.A.? And who is &quot;Little&quot; Abby Lam from Shenzhen, Guangdong?? And why did she post Elisa&#39;s Chinese ethnic name with a question mark to a blog about the Cecil Hotel that hadn&#39;t seen activity for three years, on the day BEFORE Elisa was discovered dead? And if the video was edited, what/who was edited out of it? Is the top floor of the Cecil Hotel involved in some form of human trafficking ring or prostitution circle run by the creepy security? Do they let the LAPD screw hookers there thus have leverage? Who knows. Either way, it&#39;s a weird connection I wasn&#39;t quite expecting to find.</p>

<p>WHO IS ABBY LAM? And what does she have to do with Elisa? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really very interesting.  I&#39;ve had this whole ordeal tabbed on my radar since day one. I&#39;ve read that very post/thread, and that specific post never caught my attention.  Kudos.</p>

<p>Also your insight into the security, from your specific perspective, is invaluable.  This has always, to me, felt like a solo act on her part or one organized by a group.  A cabal of alpha security types reads better than one of out of town hostellos or local impoverished or listless roustabout hobo types.</p>

<p>That door to the stairway you&#39;re talking about: would someone familiar with the camera layout choose to stand there if trying to impede the door without being photographed?  How is it being done so the impeding mechanism is not visible in the tape?</p>

<p>So she&#39;s from Canada right?  Does any know when her branch of the family immigrated, and from where? She kept a blog and a bit of a travelogue online, and supposedly had frequent contact with her family...so plenty of people knew where she was even though her tourism was a tad esoteric. </p>

<p>The day before her body was found more people than ever before had to know the last place she was- she&#39;d been missing the longest.  Maybe it&#39;s extended family rooting around on the web desperately trying to make contact with her? Or maybe even a stranger?</p>

<p>It&#39;s all so chilling.  So many elements of the thing the right kind of creepy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My ex sent me a photo that was from a site in Chinese (I believe, I cannot read such characters without Google) But interestingly...in the photo in front of the elevator she was standing at, is a mirror that is NOT in the footage. Why was the mirror taken down from in front of the elevator?? It would have reflected a person standing there had it not been. How do I post a photo here? I don&#39;t see a way to post and I&#39;m kind of new to reddit. Any suggestions? I would love for you all to see that mirror on the wall that in the footage is missing. (but why?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Notice in the image however- to answer your question...that YES....someone COULD have been both blocking the door AND holding the elevator with a key at the same time. Preventing her from leaving. </p>

<p>I notice that whatever she is afraid of &quot;at first&quot; is to the right. That is what she hides from initially and peaks around the corner at. Then someone comes from the left and she settles down a bit. Is this because it is a security guard and she assumes she&#39;s now safe? And what scared her?? Did she hear someone in a room to the right of the elevator screaming for help? Or was there a body there? That she maybe didn&#39;t really notice until an afterthought struck her in the elevator? (like Laura Palmer&#39;s mom in Twin Peaks thinking back on Bob hiding behind the bed??) </p>

<p>What made Elisa look to the right? What scared her? We can see in the imgur picture the elevator (on the top floor at that point) is being held open by someone easily out of camera range. Easily able to tell her &quot;follow me ---the elevator as you can see--- is broken&quot; or something to that effect. When you see the video seconds matched correctly, her movements no longer appear awkward, but direct and normal for a person feeling stress and confusion about perhaps something that is to the Right of the elevator also out of our range of vision...</p>

<p>It is when Elisa leaves the camera view for the final time that we see that brief &quot;Foot&quot; shadow (making me think whoever it was moved out of the doorway to permit her to pass and being right handed unlocked the elevator at the same time, thus for a moment necessitating a position of body that would permit the foot to fall into view) ...and then the door to the elevator closes as if nothing unusual has happened whatsoever ...</p>

<p>But it is likely- by that time we see the elevator door close, Elisa is now in the stairwell, already on the top floor of the building -with whoever it was that could turn off both the elevator with a key and persuade her (as she had no other choices due to the fact something to the right of the elevator was scaring her from going that way... and to the right is the only other elevator in the building). </p>

<p>At the time we see the elevator door close whoever was with her someone who could shut down security alarms to the roof-access via the stairwell, whoever was with her knew the angles of the security cameras and where to stand to avoid being seen at all.....by the time we see the elevator close it&#39;s likely whoever was going to kill her was standing directly behind her or in front of her in the stairwell... and the door back into the hallway she just came out of was inaccessible to her -blocked now by whoever was going to murder her, as were the stairs to descend to another floor. The only way she could go was &quot;up&quot; ...and it is likely not so much &quot;willingly&quot; -as much as &quot;playing along to see what happened and to see if she could get through it without harm&quot;. </p>

<p>But then we hear the account of the long term elderly resident who --if anyone would know of an unusual raucous on the floor above that night, it would be a resident of 30+ years.... and that raucous was followed by immediate flooding? The Imgur photo proves there was someone likely in the stairs, holding open -both the door and the elevator- in one easy action and leaving Elisa no other option but to either follow into that hallway leading to the stairs, ....or head &quot;right&quot; into the direction we see in the first part of the video that has her terrified for some reason. Why we may never know. Did she hear or see a murder or something take place she wasn&#39;t supposed to, up on the top floor--- far away from the 4th floor where she was booked to spend the night*? </p>

<p>(*Even I didn&#39;t &quot;wander&quot; the halls of the Cecil Hotel or check out the floors. As a visitor there&#39;s no reason to, first off the security was so off putting, and secondly, it&#39;s all smelly and dirty. And you can hear people arguing or vomiting, etc. etc.) Elisa would NOT have been led there through &quot;curiosity of architecture&quot; for example, as it&#39;s 100% cheap and a filthy dive of a place once past the remade front lobby. So &quot;something&quot; got Elisa on the top floor ...where she exited the elevator and then returned to the elevator.  At that point, to then be scared by something to the right and out of range of the camera. </p>

<p>MOST Probably --knowing just how elevators often are and how people tend to use them, she may have just gotten onto an elevator that was already being called to the top floor (for some reason) thinking she was getting on an elevator going down. The rest of what played out may just be terrible circumstance of that one coincidental error of entering the wrong elevator. But I have ZERO doubt in my mind that it is the security of the building involved IN NO SMALL WAY. That the police are unable to OR unwilling to recognize the missing footage that is clearly visible to so many people... and the police that are unable to recognize the intrinsic layout of the building within that missing footage, that would easily permit a more rational explanation that she was &quot;talking to someone in the stairwell door&quot; than to a hallucination... says to me.... that it is likely that the LAPD themselves are involved in this cover up on some level for their own interests. Be it locally in the jurisdiction of the singular unit assigned to the region, or in some way much larger that we can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to comprehend, are partaking in whatever illegal behaviour that the hotel has going on within it. </p>

<p>--Be that a Mexican Drug Cartel (very likely, as even my ex-neighbors were involved with one-- or so they claimed and had tattoos that led me to kinda believe their claims) or be it a child or illegal prostitution ring, or be it human trafficking. Elisa Lam saw something that night after exiting and reentering the elevator on the top floor. She saw something to the Right of the elevator and it terrified her. It scared her until something came in from the left (doorway) to settle her nerves. She likely thought that whoever came from the stairwell was there to help in the situation ...but was more likely a part of whatever had visibly scared her to begin with.... 
R.I.P. Elisa Lam</p>

    <div class="md"><p>your guess is as good as mine. i think they must have dirt on the local squad or something.... i mean maybe i watch too many movies, but IMO i could imagine a cop or two using that hotel as a place to get favors for themselves and keep it on the DL for the guards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been following this case since I came across it a couple months ago.  I have watched the original police released video and the one brought up to real time, both countless times.  I even came a cross a post by a body language expert who has studied the video. </p>

<p>First, I don&#39;t think she was afraid when she first approached the elevator. Her demeanor seemed playful and childlike, like she was visiting someone on that floor and had a good time. Perhaps, after visiting on that floor, Elisa and her new acquaintance were returning to her room on the 4th floor. I believe she thought the person was following her to the elevator and she did some silly things, the pushing of a few floor elevator buttons, for fun. Unlike what some reports say, she only pressed the middle row buttons, with the last one pressed being the open door button. She then went to hide in the corner as an attempt to &quot;scare&quot; her friend after scoping out real quick to see how far away this person was from the elevator.</p>

<p>But, this person did not follow her directly, as she thought. Her first few moves to leave the elevator still seemed playful and she still had it in her mind to surprise this person. But, by this time, they still haven&#39;t appeared and when she re-entered  the elevator, she seemed annoyed. Perhaps out of annoyance, she presses the same buttons several times then re-exits the elevator.</p>

<p>She then starts talking, perhaps to someone down the hall to the right of the door, but perhaps it could be to herself, trying to fathom why her friend hadn&#39;t arrived yet. She then leaves the elevator, most likely returning to the room she was at before coming to the elevator.</p>

<p>Her state of dress is of interest as well, she is wearing flip-flops, baggy shorts, a white blouse that has half tucked in, a red sweater, her hair down and she is without her glasses and purse.  Why does she not have her purse with her?  That seems rather odd, Women I know go no where without their purse unless they are at home. </p>

<p>Your post explaining the security of that hotel put a couple pieces together for me. I firmly believe they are involved somehow, either by a guard (most likely) or by someone friendly with security, friendly enough that they were willing to alter video evidence for them.  My bet is on the guard.  Elisa probably went back to the room and couldn&#39;t get back in, perhaps caused a commotion at the door that spawned security to the scene. Whoever responded to that is most likely the person who took her to the roof and made her undress and jump into the tank, then throwing her belongings in with her, closed the lid and left her to drown.</p>

<p>What do you think? Am I way off base? Thanks for letting me post this.</p>

But here is copy/past from &quot;Elisa Lam&quot; wiki regarding her name: </p>

<p>Elisa Lam (simplified Chinese: 蓝可儿; traditional Chinese: 藍可兒;</p>

<p>And here is  小 &quot;Little&quot; Abby&#39;s post from the blog from February 18, 2013* at 4:59 am: 蓝可儿？</p>

<p>*If this was posted from a location in China, they are a day ahead of us and help me out on my logic...Doesn&#39;t that infer that Abby had posted not one day before Elisa&#39;s body was found, but rather two days before?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another thing I forgot to mention was that Elisa Lam stayed on the 4th floor. ANd I don&#39;t know about you, but if I am a hotel guest when I leave my room (in a hotel that is obviously not that &quot;nice&quot; once you get past the facade of fancy retro in the lobby)....if I am a hotel guest leaving my room, where do I go? Do I take the elevator up? Or do I tend to leave my room with the intention to leave the hotel and go sightseeing or whatever? Did Elisa accidentally hit the wrong button on the elevator, going up? And walking out of it kinda not thinking about it (as one often does while riding an elevator lost in a thought) only to realize &quot;Oops! Wrong Floor!&quot; and turn on your heel and return to the the elevator.</p>

<p>She does this exact motion it seems from the footage supplied. She then presses buttons CAREFULLY to avoid the same mistake of being on the wrong floor. But maybe then she hears something? Because she immediately reacts to something that scares her. What made her look around the corner to the right, carefully? Did Elisa accidentally see something &quot;to the right&quot; of the elevator ...which made her visibly and immediately afraid? And then she attempts the work the elevator again hurriedly.</p>

<p>She only settles when she looks to the left.... perhaps she sees something to the left of her that she assumes is a harbor of immediate safety--like a security guard coming out of the doorway to the left of the elevator? She proceeds to talk with someone to the left as if describing something. However.... there is one amount of body language that I stands out to me..... It is when she throws her hands up, as if in a release of interest. I don&#39;t know about you, but I make that gesture when I am visibly offended by someone&#39;s gesture or insatiable rudeness, and am making the choice to blow the person off. As in &quot;Like, Whatever!!&quot;</p>

<p>Elisa makes that hand gesture of hands thrown up over her head when she returns to the elevator and again attempts to work it. (her weird motions appearing &quot;warped&quot; I believe are accounted for by the missing footage that is clearly visible when the seconds and minutes are matched correctly....and the stretching --the &quot;warping&quot;-- of the footage by security is what makes her look &quot;warped&quot;.... But who would be the only one&#39;s to access security footage? No janitor, as it&#39;s there for them as much as it is for the guests. Not a clerk, because they deal in money and also are watched by cameras. ONLY the security could disarm the alarm to the roof and access footage to warp it. I believe that AT THAT MOMENT of her hands being thrown up in a &quot;whatever!&quot; gesture to return to the elevator, that a lewd gesture was made at her by the person who until that moment she assumed was safety. I got a mental image of him grabbing his crotch or something similar that could necessitate an immediate &quot;Okay, I&#39;m out of here!&quot; response such as she displays.</p>

<p>What else could prompt an otherwise (up to that moment) seemingly friendly interaction to turn south to where she wants out again? But notice that still, she can&#39;t get out, because the security has likely locked the elevator as only they could. There is a second elevator, but it was to the right of the elevator she was in..the very direction she looks initially in fear at the beginning of the footage. All points to consider in this mystery.</p>

<p>Did Elisa happen into the middle of some interaction already in play that caught her totally unaware when she stepped off the elevator on the wrong floor while assuming she was in an elevator &quot;going down&quot;? And thus made her witness to a crime on the top floor? And in the eyes of the guilty thus seeing her as needing to be dispatched of in the eyes of? Or did she go to L.A. (for &quot;some reason&quot; no one is really sure of) to rendezvous in what she thought was perhaps an attempt to save &quot;little&quot; Abby (her little sister? or perhaps cousin?) but was the rendezvous a ruse again, just to dispatch what would have been a witness to something larger than we might even imagine and involving people at higher levels of the law or government in Los Angeles all involved in a prostitution scandal or child endangerment?</p>

<p>After all, Elisa&#39;s phone went missing first--this guarantees NO lifeline to call for help, suspicious. I wonder if the security could have eyeballed her from the moment she entered as something they wanted to &quot;covet&quot;. She was young, Asian, and alone in the city. But considering her laptop disappeared after the fact -- this could also back up more of the connection to a human trafficking ring she was in connection with to save a loved on. And maybe the laptop contained all evidence of whatever communication or connection she had to the whole thing as well as names or connections to others involved. If she was &quot;setting up an escape plan&quot; for a loved one in the capital city of human trafficking in China, it&#39;s likely she used her laptop to set up whatever it was she thought was a rescue attempt.</p>

<p>But again, who is Abby? Was she --is she-- still a victim out there left unaccounted for outside of a weird google implication? Is that why she asked for Elisa&#39;s name in a short question perhaps in a brief window of time to send such a message while left in the hanging amidst Elisa&#39;s disappearance but BEFORE the body was found (naked implying sex crime to me.) Did Abby ask a blog which to her may have been just any old site she happened upon that held the name of the Hotel in it, where she could leave the name of Elisa Lam as if calling out &quot;where are you?&quot; or &quot;are you still coming to help?&quot; etc. etc. Who can really say? But the human trafficking connection? That was MADE BY GOOGLE to Abby Lam and is extremely both realistic considering the area of Los Angeles, and the state of the world...and is unsettling to think that maybe Elisa isn&#39;t the only victim in this story. And that there is presently still &quot;Little&quot; Abby out there kept in human captivity in the human slave capital of China.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also found this interesting and missing from most of the retelling of the case....as if this has been swept under the rug:</p>

<p>&quot;The door, WHICH ONLY EMPLOYEES CAN REACH, is also equipped with an alarm that notifies hotel staff if someone is up there. The water tank is also hard to access requiring authorities to work well into the afternoon to remove her body after a maintenance worker discovered it on Tuesday morning.
&#39;The location of the water tanks is very small and configured in a very tight way so it&#39;s a little more difficult to get the body out,&#39; said police spokeswoman Officer Sara Faden. 
&quot;Bernard Diaz, 89, who has lived at the Cecil for 32 years, told the LA Times that he heard a &#39;tremendous&#39; racket on his floor above him the night Lam disappeared.
He said the floor also experience flooding that night.&quot;
&quot;Police have said that the reason for Lam&#39;s visit to Los Angeles was unclear, but that her final destination was expected to be Santa Cruz in central California.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another extremely coincidental connection made with a google search further into who &quot;Little&quot; Abby (Lam) who posted to that blog the night before Elisa&#39;s body was found.
On Page One of a Google Search for Abby and Elisa Lam, there is a twitter profile for Abby Lam started in March 2013. This was the month after Elisa was found dead. It&#39;s nothing spectacular, as there may be more than one Abby Lam about as a few results down you&#39;ll see a linkedIn result that has a couple of Abby Lams listed. These in all likelihood are totally random people. However on the google search page 2, there is the next profile you see for Abby Lam that doesn&#39;t direct you to the profile from Shenzhen are the search results that appear as &quot;Abby Lam - Eastwood, 02, Australia (25 books) - Goodreads&quot;. </p>

<p>I happened to click that link and there is a list of books that are &quot;favorites&quot; each one describing deaths in ritual to gain magical powers, female assassins in competitions to kill one another, one about a girl who is gifted and works for the CIA breaking codes with her computer...and that type of theme, normal espionage type stuff. But one summary of a book creeped me out as a strange coincidence - 
A book called &quot;The Girl of Fire and Thorns (Fire and Thorns #1)&quot; by Rae Carson. 
The description reads:</p>

<p>&quot;Once a century, one person is chosen for greatness.
Elisa is the chosen one. </p>

<p>But she is also the younger of two princesses, the one who has never done anything remarkable. She can&#39;t see how she ever will. </p>

<p>Now, on her sixteenth birthday, she has become the secret wife of a handsome and worldly king—a king whose country is in turmoil. A king who needs the chosen one, not a failure of a princess.</p>

<p>And he&#39;s not the only one who seeks her. Savage enemies seething with dark magic are hunting her. A daring, determined revolutionary thinks she could be his people&#39;s savior. And he looks at her in a way that no man has ever looked at her before. Soon it is not just her life, but her very heart that is at stake.</p>

<p>Elisa could be everything to those who need her most. If the prophecy is fulfilled. If she finds the power deep within herself. If she doesn’t die young.</p>

<p>Most of the chosen do. &quot;</p>

<p>The link to the books can be found here. I find it just another weird coincidence in this whole story.

    <div class="md"><p>This is reaching really far. You basically searched for three names, then turned around and said, &quot;Look! This website has all three names!&quot; It would be equally coincidental if an Abby Lam worked at an insurance company with an Elisa Lam, but there would be nothing to read into that. </p>

<p>This coincidence also follows from the false premise that Abby is even a significant name in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The timestamp on the blog comment is meaningless. The elevator video was released on February 14th, and probably had a million views on Youku (kind of like a Chinese YouTube, I guess) by the time the Abby person commented. </p>

<p>Also, Lam is one of the 25 most common Chinese surnames. It would be like finding an Elisa Jackson and an Abby Jackson, or an Elisa Diaz and an Abby Diaz. Mildly interesting, but not an earth-shattering coincidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of strangeness here, but the foot thing seems to me to obviously be Elisa&#39;s foot. If you watch carefully, she starts turning her body as she walks out of the frame, taking a step with her right foot. What it looks like to me is that she takes a first smaller step, repositioning her left foot. At this point, the left foot is obscured by the right. As she steps with her right foot out of the frame, this reveals the back of the left foot that is pivoting as she turns. It looks like her foot no matter how many times I watch it. Try repeating her movements in this section yourself and you&#39;ll likely see that it makes the most sense that it is her foot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks for the observation! You are right, I think the missing footage that has been stretched out of synch confuses the initial moment...ON the regular play that was matched the seconds to actual seconds? It is clearly her foot in the frame there..... but this still does not change that next to her  - out of view of the camera is a door next to the stairwell - and whoever held that elevator door open (by turn of an employee&#39;s key most likely) could have done so without leaving the threshold of the door adjacent to the elevator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, there is definitely some strangeness. The fact that she was found naked is the biggest indicator to me that she did not do this to herself. Hearing more info about the hotel arouses a lot of suspicion as to what role the hotel staff played. It&#39;s also extremely suspicious that the video was edited, and seems to have been edited at strategic places where a jump in the footage would be less noticeable. I think it&#39;s strange that there is footage where not much is happening, yet there are moments missing which takes away from the idea that unimportant moments when Elisa was outside of the frame were edited since they were irrelevant.</p>
