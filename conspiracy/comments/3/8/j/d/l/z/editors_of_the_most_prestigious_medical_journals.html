<blockquote>
<p>Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine are the two most prestigious medical journals in the world.</p>

<p>It is therefore striking that their chief editors have both publicly written that corruption is undermining science.</p>

<p>The editor in chief of Lancet, Richard Horton, wrote last month:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness. As one participant put it, “poor methods get results”. </p>

<p>&quot;The Academy of Medical Sciences, Medical Research Council, and Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council have now put their reputational weight behind an investigation into these questionable research practices. </p>

<p>&quot;The apparent endemicity [i.e. pervasiveness within the scientific culture] of bad research behaviour is alarming. In their quest for telling a compelling story, scientists too often sculpt data to fit their preferred theory of the world. Or they retrofit hypotheses to fit their data. Journal editors deserve their fair share of criticism too. </p>

<p>&quot;We aid and abet the worst behaviours. Our acquiescence to the impact factor fuels an unhealthy competition to win a place in a select few journals. Our love of “significance” pollutes the literature with many a statistical fairy-tale. </p>

<p>&quot;We reject important confirmations. Journals are not the only miscreants. Universities are in a perpetual struggle for money and talent, endpoints that foster reductive metrics, such as high-impact publication. </p>

<p>&quot;National assessment procedures, such as the Research Excellence Framework, incentivise bad practices. And individual scientists, including their most senior leaders, do little to alter a research culture that occasionally veers close to misconduct...Part of the problem is that no-one is incentivised to be right.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, the editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Marcia Angell, <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/jan/15/drug-companies-doctorsa-story-of-corruption/">wrote in 2009:</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In her must-read essay, Dr. Angell skewers drug companies, university medical departments, and medical groups which set the criteria for diagnosis and treatment as being rotten with corruption and conflicts of interest.</p>

<p>And we’ve previously documented that the government sometimes uses raw power to <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/07/fda-gathers-personal-information-then-smears-whistleblowers-on-faulty-medical-devices.html">cover up corruption in the medical and scientific fields.</a></p>

<p>Postscript: Corruption is not limited to the medical or scientific fields. Instead, corruption has become systemic throughout every profession...and is so pervasive that it is destroying the very fabric of America.</p>

<p>This is probably best illustrated when taking a look at the state of the exercise science industry. It&#39;s ridiculous. You&#39;ll find studies with 15 people where 4 didn&#39;t complete the trial. Then you&#39;ll find the most ridiculous methodology like having novices bench pressing 65lbs on a bosu ball to see how unstable surfaces affect force production.</p>

<p>Then after these 11 novices try they conclude that since they all bench pressed the 65lbs that unstable surfaces must not affect force production!</p>

<p>Meanwhile if you&#39;ve spent more than a day in the weight room you could call bullshit on it before the study even started. Yet somehow these people are academics in high places and have their names on all of these published papers. It&#39;s like a game, how many papers can you get your name on.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested in a review of some of the literature this Doctor gets it. He&#39;s awesome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to write a blog that analyzed &amp; poked holes in research about anti-aging interventions. I quickly discovered that almost every study published had glaring deficiencies in the experimental method. It always left one wondering – how could they be THAT stupid? How could they miss something so obvious?</p>

<p>Well, I still don&#39;t quite know the answer, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s something to do with bias toward being able to point to some kind of groundbreaking result. I guess every scientist on completing their work and having it published wants it to create a buzz. Back when I was studying I had biochemistry described to me as a lifetime of hard work for perhaps a fleeting moment of glory.</p>

<p>I guess that&#39;s the problem with the way things are these days. If it doesn&#39;t go &#39;viral&#39;, it might as well never ought to have happened.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">10</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/SIMONBELMONT20.html">SIMONBELMONT20</a> 2015-06-04</p>
    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re interested in this, let me give you an anecdotal example. I have had eczema my entire life and around the age 10, it was decided I needed treatment from a dermatologist. Okay, sounds good. Eczema can be crippling and seemingly inescapable. When dealing with the disorder, the itch cannot be sated and you will destroy your body in an attempt to sate this itch. This disability will fuck your life, yet you will have zero assistance other than visiting your local dermatologist IF you can afford it.</p>

<p>At the office of dermatology, I was prescribed topical steroids to take as needed. The steroid is a cream applied to the skin to make it &quot;stronger&quot; and less vulnerable. These steroids are given to most eczema patients, note that. The steroids cleared the bulk of my eczema for a time, until it worsened within the year and I was herded into going back. Note my parents are none the wiser.</p>

<p>Over the course of my teenage life this process repeats, all the while my condition is peaking and troughing. The strength of the medication increased proportion to the amount of visits made to the office(literally addicting the body). Huge amounts of pressure and anxiety well inside for years. Every night practically I don&#39;t use copious amounts of steroids, I am tearing myself apart, scratching, scratching, scratching. Nothing sates this itch! My face, through highschool is always in shambles year round, peeling, bleeding, oozing. Others around me try to be courteous of this VERY noticeable condition I deal with, and even still my anxiety is through the roof and the pressures I feel of working a part-time job and having a girlfriend and the pressures of my family and friends to keep up on everything in my painful life. There were times, many times, I just wanted to die.</p>

<p>I graduate, inevitably, eventually. Things are calming down in my life, some peace from this hell. Though things were getting better, my skin was not as I continued to use the &quot;medicine&quot; I was prescribed. After a time, a few months, as my skin had become nearly unbearable to live in I miraculously discovered the site itsan.org.</p>

<p>At this point in my life, two days after my 18th, I discovered the great injustice done to me for so many years. I discovered that naturally eczema would dissipate as it&#39;s due to environmental factors, after long enough the body will adapt as it is a perfect machine. I discovered that my disability had persevered because I used the medicine prescribed to me to CURE my disability. Doesn&#39;t that sound fucked?</p>

<p>So, a little over a year ago, I embarked on the journey that has been topical steroid withdrawal. The pain I have felt has been vast, both emotionally and physically. One could not imagine the atrocities I&#39;ve seen on my own body. I&#39;m 19 now, I feel my skin has been the pinnacle of my life. Only now do I finally hear the screams of progress. To some degree, I have healed from my affliction, though I do suffer from it to this day. I can be almost certain that my body has been claimed victim by the medicine, the steroids, I was given to combat my feeble skin.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time in reading this. I hope this isn&#39;t too offshoot of the original topic. Know how truly blessed you may be for your health, as some do not have health. For those of you struggling with sickness, be strong for strength is within us all.</p>

<p>Also, if you&#39;re interested in some further reading, go to <a href="http://www.itsan.org">www.itsan.org</a> .</p>

<p>I would like to take this opportunity to spread awareness of this atrocity. Again, thank you for your valuable time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ironically, you&#39;ve just made the very mistake that this editorial is criticizing.</p>

<p>Anecdotal information is not as useful as well-gathered and well-analyzed data. Your conclusion, which is that nobody should take topical steroids for eczema-like conditions, is useless. Maybe <em>you</em> shouldn&#39;t take topical steroids, but that advice doesn&#39;t necessarily apply to the whole mass of people with eczema. </p>

<p>This article correctly points out that the process of advancing scientific knowledge is currently crippled by a variety of factors. The answer is not to take advice when the n=1.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, fine. I know for fact, I&#39;ve been poisoned by these chemicals after long term exposure. This isn&#39;t just a hypothesis. Think of my body as a fucking science experiment, if you will. I&#39;ve dealt for so long, I know what it all feels like. Check the website out. I know my condition is DIRECTLY related to the use of steroids. You don&#39;t live this, so you could falsify very easily my anecdotal evidence.
