       It's called a red herring.  They are using it divert attention from the allies genocidal tenancies in India (famine, 7million), Germany (rape of germany, many millions), Japan (nukes), Russia - 110million peasants in the 20/30's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just the fact that the west allied with Stalin and let him do the dirty work (1024+/- days of combat), versus allies 3(70 days +/- of combat).
       <br/>
       Stalin, Lenin and Trotsky were crypto Jew's sent with New York $ to overthrow Russia when it was severely weakened by the 1st world war in 1917.  They proceeded to change their names to Russian sounding ones and kill 150 million people.

       If you ally with a psycho who pulls this shit, guess what. You are the bad guy.  The trick is in owning all the media so you can maintain the big lie to distract everyone from the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But alas, the children who inherited power from the Khazarian cabal are inbred morons who have no finesse, and the truth is leaking at the seams. It's only a matter of time so don't let up and keep them on the ropes. They will fuck it up themselves. 
The best we can do is to create a new system based on love and respect instead of fear and loathing.  Do the opposite of your master and kill him with love.

       That's not really the issue here. All European countries have strong anti-race hate laws which would cover this. The issue is that even though historical debate is acceptable over most  aspects of WW2 (causes, facts, figures, names etc) some countries have determined that no debate is acceptable on any issue which involves the German treatment of the European Jewish population. This is patently absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, until 1989, the universal accepted "fact" regarding Jewish deaths at Auschwitz was that 4 million were killed there  - no debate possible. Yet, after new records were released following the collapse of the Soviet bloc in 1990, it was proven that this figure was an exaggeration and the "real" figure was actually 1.5 million - so they changed the textbooks! This is genuine, you can research it yourself, but here are
       <a href="http://12bytes.org/wp-content/uploads/auschwitz-plaque-killed-comparison.gif">
        the official (before and after 1990) plaques at the Auschwitz museum in Oswiecim, Poland.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In Germany and your country of Austria, famous historians have been sent to prison for their analysis of the real figures involved - if they do not concur with the "official" figures. But guess what, since 1990, the "official" figure of Auschwitz deaths has now dropped by a further 25% to
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp">
        1.1 million
       </a>
       . Everybody should be allowed to discuss these anomalies without fear of imprisonment in a free society.

       No, I only linked to the image of the two plaques. That is an image which speaks for itself. If you have ever visited Auschwitz you would have seen the second plaque (unless you were there pre-1989).

       Of course not, but criminalising discussion of history is not the solution. Nobody questions that the Nazis murdered millions of people, and we owe it to future generations to establish the truth - how many?

      <p>
       I can say this as a Brit (my paternal grandfather was a magistrate in the British sector of Allied occupied Germany after WW2) that the Nuremberg trials were show trials, designed to punish Nazis and shame Germany rather than to be a shining example of jurisprudence. Many Nazi officers were coerced, even tortured into admitting greater crimes than they actually committed.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As we have been discussing, "trustworthy sources" are a subjective concept when views are so entrenched, and where an independent historical analysis of the holocaust is a criminal act.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would recommend you look into the history of one the more famous Nazis who mysteriously "sang like a canary",
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_H%C3%B6ss">
        Rudolf Höss
       </a>
       , the camp commandant at Auschwitz.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm giving you a source I trust - a well known revisionist historian of the holocaust who speaks specifically as to how the British got Höss to confess,
       <a href="http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v07/v07p389_Faurisson.html">
        Robert Faurrison
       </a>
       . You could compare his work to other sources of your choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Briefly, Höss confessed to being responsible for over 3,000,000 deaths between 1943-1944 in the camp, and was subsequently executed. His testimony has since been shown (by the release of official Nazi archives) to have been vastly exaggerated. Why would he confess to killing far more people than he actually did, if it wasn't to fit a particular agenda?

       You asked me to prove a senior Nazi official confessed to exaggerated crimes. I demonstrated that Hoess claimed responsibility for 3 million deaths at Auschwitz (fact). This is universally acknowledged to be impossible, because the
       <strong>
        official figure
       </strong>
       for all Auschwitz deaths is now accepted by historians to be 1.1 million (fact).

      <p>
       From early 1942 until late 1944, transport trains delivered Jews to the camp's gas chambers from all over German-occupied Europe, where they were killed with the pesticide Zyklon B. At least 1.1 million prisoners died at Auschwitz, around 90 percent of them Jewish; approximately 1 in 6 Jews killed in the Holocaust died at the camp.[1][2] Others deported to Auschwitz included 150,000 Poles, 23,000 Romani and Sinti, 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war, 400 Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, and tens of thousands of people of diverse nationalities. Many of those not killed in the gas chambers died of starvation, forced labor, infectious diseases, individual executions, and medical experiments.

       So not enough for you? How many millions of dead people do you need? There were several other camps

       Dont forget mass executions of the civilian population behind the front, death marchs, etc.

       Do you realize the Nazis drafted the first real animal rights legislation the world has ever seen? They created the world's first paid holidays, building and renting cruise-liners for the working class -- unheard of at the time. They were environmentalists, funded the first anti-cancer research, raised the corporate tax rate, forgave 25% of a family's home loan for each child they had, kicked out the Rothschild banking dynasty, created a healthcare program that was ahead of all others at the time, confiscated profits from war profiteers, etc etc etc...

       It's clear there's been an extremely selective and distorted presentation of National Socialist Germany in western media and pop-culture in the post-war period. It's utterly bizarre that today the NS revolution and reforms are derided as "fascist" oppression of the working class.

       Its shit like this is the only reason I really give the Holocaust a second thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the details were secure there would be no issue with discussion, if anything they'd encourage it to spread the details of the event. But no, instead the powers that be lock up anyone that could be a threat to their disturbed narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its honestly mind blowing how toxic the western world has been towards history facts. They intentionally keep these topics on a "ITS SO SACRED DON'T TALK ABOUT IT" level to keep people unaware of what actually happened. I think the worst part about it is that even people who question that narrative aren't suggesting that no one was murdered or the war didn't happen, just not as we are told.
      </p>
      <p>
       History goes to the victor and outside my own personal research I would have never even considered questioning the narrative. Why would I? Why would the govt lie about something like this? Is there a real motivation?
      </p>
      <p>
       It all comes down to control and power. It always does
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact we do not teach our own individual war crimes at a nation to our children (instead they have to find on their own and then resent their govt for attempting retardation) is one of the biggest red flags. If you just do the basic education system you don't learn squat about our past. Anything unsavory to the nation is avoided completely or is presented in a completely 1 dimensional way
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans are clever, the world we live in is the way it is for a reason. Keep them easy to control

       Oh, it's perfectly permissable in schools to teach that the white man is evil, that everything he ever did throughout history was harmful and wrong, and that the white race is a plague on the Earth. That, you can teach. But if you try to teach that the Jews are running the White House and Congress by bribing and threatening the politicians, or that they completely control the American media and use it to brainwash the entire population of the country, you suddenly won't be so popular.

       Hypothetically:
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2010, the Brazilian government was overtaken by a nationalist party, declared its Mormon population to be enemies of the state, systematically deports the majority of them to labor camps infested with malaria (and let's say execute a majority to remain analogous), deny the whole thing for years and then eventually the lower politicians &amp; officers take full blame in semi-international court, reparations are paid to the surviving Mormons in the form of a land grant in Utah...
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't an accurate death toll be among the highest of priorities? Would it be better to declare an adamant estimate and cry "anti-mormonism" to fend off revisions?

       who was a free speech lawyer up here in Canada. He passed away last year. My granddad had one of his books about this that I inherited. It makes some good arguments as to why censorship and hate speech laws suck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Me personally, I don't mind some of the hate speech laws. We kept those Westboro Baptists out of our country because they were listed as a hate group. Although, I think we could have just ignored them and they would have left on their own.

       It's less the past loss of life that bothers me. I'm sure I'd feel differently if I had been there, but that's the reality for me. It's much more about the implications of a situation where a genocide's numbers were blown up to serve a political purpose. It's about making sure such a thing never happens again, or at least less often.

       Yeah, I'm the same way man. It's just how shit is. As time goes on, and new generations are born, people don't feel the same pain/sorrow that their grandparents/parents did during wartime or a tragedy. I think it's natural to feel indifferent at my age.

       I agree about the numbers; I feel that they were blown up as well.

       The past is a great indicator for the future at times. I like reading about history because you're able to see political/economic trends started nearly a century ago that are still developing today. Interesting shit really.

       If you try to pin down a mythology to an exact set of events, and you later find that some of those events are false, what happens to your mythology? It falls apart. In order to keep the myth of the Holocaust alive, it is necessary that the details of the Holocaust remain fluid -- that is to say, it is necessary that the details remain vague and mutable, so that they can never be pinned down. That's why it's so hard to define exactly what the Holocaust is. It's a great big beach ball of emotion floating on a shifting quicksand of changing "facts".

       How does that invalidate the quote? It is a generic quote that mentioned no race creed colour gender or anything like that.  The very fact that I am still getting messages trying to invalidate percived criticism tells volumes.

       Holocaust denial should not be against the law, but there are reasons for it. Hitler and his Nazi party came to power using similarly specious story telling. They blamed WWI and Germany's subsequent fall from power on Jews, rather than look to their own nationalism and militarism. Considering the disastrous results of Naziism for Germany and Europe, it's pretty understandable they're prepared to jail a few and suppress speech rather than risk another Nazi party.

       I think you'll find that [the] international Jewish power elite, behind the scenes, was "lobbying" for war with Germany, and was printing some pretty shocking anti-German propaganda in Jewish-owned media. The boycott, with the stated goal of destroying Germany's export trade, was just the tip of the iceberg.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a shame that discriminatory laws had to be passed for the Germans to re-nationalize their civil service, but it's understandable, and clearly motivated by nationalist sentiment rather than "racism" as it is generally mischaracterized today.

       Allow me to clarify. It was discrimination based on race ("blood"), motivated primarily by nationalism. That might take you some more time to get your head around, but if it was all about insane racism, why weren't black people discriminated against in NS Germany?

      <p>
       Right. Let me talk you through it:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Jewish people identified [themselves] as a group based on "blood".
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Although some [German Jews] had assimilated to varying extents, and some probably would've assimilated in the future, for the most part they apparently remained separate in terms of culture and identity, and (more importantly) political solidarity -- they were a "nation within a nation".
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The NSDAP's goal, in passing the law, was to re-nationalize the civil service, (which was [disproportionately] Jewish, as were the political parties during the rather corrupt Wiemar period.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Note that this is a nationalistic goal.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In order to achieve this, because Jews were, in addition to being a group with separate political solidarity, a group which self-identified based on "race", the NSDAP passed a law discriminating along racial lines.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I hope that makes sense. Bye now.

       Easy, friend. All I've done is explained how removing Jews from the civil service was a primarily nationalist goal to the NSDAP and its supporters. They saw Jews as politically separate, and many German Jews saw themselves this way too -- thus, to the NSDAP it was an issue of sovereignty and indigenous control over the mechanisms of state.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is plenty that is contradictory and surprising about the "Nazi" revolution, their reforms, the war, even the evolution of NS racial ideology -- but something tells me you would have some problems moving beyond the Haunted House version of the history.

       So you don't deny that the Jews declared an Economic Boycott war in 1933 against Germany, then?............Quote from  Jewish newspaper Natscha Retsc:  The war against Germany will be waged by all Jewish communities, conferences, congresses... by every individual Jew. Thereby the war against Germany will ideologically enliven and promote our interests, which require that Germany be wholly destroyed.:End quote.

       Perhaps not. But I realized long ago that even flawed people, or people I don't like, have prescient and accurate things to say... I don't limit myself to learning from people I agree with. I hope you can see how foolish such a practice would be, and where it would lead a person.
