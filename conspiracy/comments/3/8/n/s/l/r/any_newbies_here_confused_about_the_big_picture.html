       I've been researching these "conspiracies" for nearly 10 years now. I actually started researching the UFO phenomenon in the early 90s but didn't start understanding the big picture until early 2006 when I started researching 9/11. Since then I have been scouring the Internet, going to conferences and meeting people on these topics. I have found that a quite consistent general picture has emerged how all of this fits together.

       Atlantis was an advanced civilization (actually a series of civilizations) on Earth from roughly 100,000 BC to 10,000 BC. It ended through a big calamity. It's not clear to me what calamity exactly ended the final version. It could have been a pole shift, deluge or nuclear war. It's also possible that there were multiple calamities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Technologically Atlantis was at least as advanced as our civilization today, probably even more so. They most certainly had more spiritual knowledge. They used pyramids and crystals for example. They also had contact with ETs and probably space travel. The Atlantean civilization was world-wide power much like Western civilization today. So it had colonies all over the world. I'm not certain where its center of power was, but Antarctica seems to be a likely candidate. During Atlantean times the sea levels were a lot lower, too, so many of the cities from that time got submerged when sea levels rose.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Atlantean civilization had rival civilizations like Lemuria, Hyperborea and Vedic India which it fought wars against.
      </p>
      <p>
       Intially Atlantis was vey light/positive oriented but then got gradually more corrupted over thousands of years. In the later stages it was very corrupt, which basically caused its downfall.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea of using pyramids for power is very old and goes back to the Atlantean/Lemurian ages at least. The ancient Egyptians did not figure this out for themselves. It was handed down to them. Egypt inherited namely much of the Atlantean civilization/knowledge. This knowledge was preserved mostly in the Egyptian mystery schools, which unfortunately were hijacked by the Cabal (negative ETs). Other ETs tried to give positive teachings to the ancient Egyptians but these teachings unfortunately became perverted, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sound technology is also one of those ancient arts that are lost now but were known during Atlantean times. Sound technology can be used to levitate very larges stones, for example. Tibetan monks have used this technique for example:

       Are humans capable of telepathy?  Do aliens use telepathy for language or do they speak.

       Yes, humans are basically capable of telepathy, but we have mostly lost this ability due to incarnating in this "lower vibratory" level of existence (where separation is primary) and also to some degree to due the poisoning of our environment and the belief that it's not possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Supposedly when we "graduate" into the next higher level of existence (which is supposed to happen soon), we will all regain the ability to use telepathy. It will become the standard form of communication once again.
      </p>
      <p>
       ETs mostly use telepathy, though some learn languages to be able to communicate with us.

       For me it's my personal experiences seeing UFOs, especially at a ET/UFO contact meeting with Dr. Greer at Mt. Shasta in 2008. I saw various lights in the sky and near the ground (orbs in the trees), that could not be explained conventionally. One of the participants also managed to photograph a craft (so I knew first hand the source of the photo).
      </p>
      <p>
       From a general viewpoint I cannot really point to a single piece of evidence. It's mostly the overwhelming mass of credible reports and witnesses. It is not credible to me that 100% of these thousands of reports are fake or mistaken.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had to pick something though, I would say the reports of material evidence (out-of-place artifacts, Atacama humanoid), the official release of UFO files by various governments and the appearance of UFOs in ancient art, old photographs (before computer-generated graphics were possible) and NASA live feeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I was already quite convinced by the first cases I ever studied in depth, namely the Billie Meier and Bob Lazar cases.

       I don't really know specifically what the Rockefellers are doing about disclosure now. They used to be part of the system that wanted to prevent disclosure. This may be changing now though. Apparently many of the younger members of these families do not agree with the old agenda anymore and want to liberate humanity.

       They certainly have had the plan to subvert and use the disclosure process in their favor if they need to. For this end they have certainly infiltrated the UFO movement. To say that they have complete control over the disclosure movement is false though.

       It's mostly to give the "devil" (negative ETs) and themselves power. Children have a very pure form of consciousness. When they are abused they emit large amounts of fear/lower level energy. This energy can be used by the negative ETs and dark occultists to influence reality to their advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Child abuse also has the "useful" side effect of making people who participate in it blackmailable. This means they can be put into positions of power where they can be controlled via threat of exposing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, it also serves to strengthen group cohesion among the occultists who do this.

       Well and succinctly said. It is absolutely the worst of all the secrets held by the Satanic elite, and the fact they have been able to stifle its exposure again and again is hugely frustrating.

       It's definitely not a fake panic. That's what they would like the public to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many well documented cases on this and they are even becoming more and more exposed recently. Check out the keywords: Marc Dutroux, Jimmy Savile, Hampstead Child Abuse, Operation Hydrant, Franklin Cover-up. (to name a few)
      </p>
      <p>
       Occult child abuse sects are widespread in the higher echelons of power. There are the so-called Luciferianists and Satan worshippers (and not the "LaVey" kind of satanism though). It is estimated that there are about 3 million of these in the US alone. It is a kind of "religion" that is passed mostly down through families. They are very old, started thousands of years ago in the Babylonian times (actually even before that in Atlantean times). They often used of other sects and religions (such as Judaism) as cover.

       After death we continue to exist as pure consciousness, so basically we have a "soul" as has correctly been asserted by many religions. The are several "planes of existence". This material world we are currently in is the lowest (densest) plane. There are "higher levels" which are also material levels where spiritually more highly evolved people exist. There are even higher levels of existance beyond that which are non-material. For each material plane there also appears to be an "astral" equivalent where the souls of beings from those planes go. "Higher" often refers to the "vibratory" or "density" level of an existance. These are planes of existance where just pure spirits exist. In the higher levels of existance you can manifest things easily just by thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       This are somes scheme of the various planes of existance:

       Spirit or consciousness is the key and primary element in all of existence. Consciousness creates the "illusion" of space, time and matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately though, there is only one consciousness, one being in all of existance which we are part of, also called Source, Infinite Intelligence or "God". Basically the Universe is a "playground" we have created for ourself.

       The "Law of One" material is widely considered a good source on this topic although it is a hard read.

       I read through all the David Wilcock links and came out with a rough storyline:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Cabal / Illuminati believe they are "fallen angels" -- the descendants of human extraterrestrial visitors to Earth… they have preserved their genealogy with meticulous care.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their endgame is to bring about chaos (economic rigging, terrorism etc) that creates social disorder and the fall of governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will create a one-world government and there will be a “revealing”, where they portray themselves as descendents of god and be accepted as world leaders forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Questions:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Who are these bloodline families? Are they known?
       </li>
       <li>
        Is a “revealing” and implementation of a one-world government an accurate description of their objective?

       Yea, sure. Say a lie long enough that it becomes the truth. That isn't a picture of the ISS. That is the same grainy rendering that they generate to deceive you. There are quite a few like that floating around on the internet. Nothing professionally done, but just amateur work and you expect us to all believe that claim?

       Governments (especially the US) have been secretly creating a secret space program (SSP) since about the 1930s, starting with Nazi Germany and then followed by the USA. This is where most of the money for "black projects" and "government waste" has been going.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have been developing and using technology that is far, far advanced from what NASA, ESA and the like are using. It's sort of like in the TV series "Stargate" if you have every watched that (but even more than that).
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the latest reports from David Wilcock and "Corey" there are actually now several SSPs: "Solar Warden" (started in the 1980s), ICC (a corporate space program), a "league of nations" type of program with participants from many nations, and the "Dark Fleet" (remnants of the Nazi SSP that is now allied with "negative" ETs). The ICC and Dark Fleet SSPs are under control of the Cabal/Illuminati. There are also some Ancient Earth SSPs (Ancient Mayans and Agartha underground network).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are bases on the moon, Mars and numerous other places in the solar system. It is estimated that there are millions of people now living off-world. Many of these people were tricked or captured into these programs and are now "enslaved".
      </p>
      <p>
       These SSPs are also often called "breakaway civilizations" because their technology is so far advanced now that it can be considered a different civilization. Estimates are that the technology they have is hundreds or thousands of years ahead of our current technology. They can basically do nearly everything you have seen in Sci-Fi movies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't come a definite conclusion if the moon landings were faked or not. They did have the secret technology to go to the Moon at the time, but they might have faked them anyway just to confuse people (they like doing that).
      </p>

       Given my reservations about space technology, I'm more skeptical than your average skeptic. Still I'll give it a read.
