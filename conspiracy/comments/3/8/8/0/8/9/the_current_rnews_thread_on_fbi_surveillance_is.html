    <div class="md"><p>I can believe it. The interesting thing is that it is the right wing -- conservatives -- who are the most paranoid about the federal government coming after them. But there is virtually zero evidence that this ever happens or has ever happened. Conservatives are the ones who have been running things for most of US history. </p>

<p>On the other hand, there is a very long and very detailed history of the government repressing LEFT wing movements that goes back over a hundred years -- everything from state assassination of liberal leaders to infiltration of liberal groups, etc.</p>

<p>Occupy was the most recent example. Because it was perceived as left wing, it was heavily surveilled, infiltrated, and disrupted by police and federal law enforcement. And I&#39;m not surprised that they have made examples of as many Occupy protesters as they could. You don&#39;t see anything like this on the right. There are no stories of police disrupting, infiltrating, or surveilling the tea party protests or all the right wing movements. Their leaders don&#39;t get arrested. Because ultimately the tea party types are the same types that hold a lot of the positions in law enforcement, military, and government.</p>

<p>The world&#39;s not burning down. Yes, there&#39;s a lot of truly terrible stuff going on. There are some very serious challenges. But there are a lot of great things happening, too. Humanity as a whole is better off now than it has been at any time in human history, at least by many of the common measures (health, longevity, material wealth, free time, freedom, etc.)</p>

<p>We have huge problems with concentration of wealth, erosion of the middle class, a lot of the stuff that we talk about here all the time. But the world is a complex place, and while we are losing ground to bad guys on some fronts, we are gaining on many others. Plus, the internet. That&#39;s the game changer that is going to have an impact none of us have even begun to comprehend. The internet is the printing press times a million in terms of the impact it will have on human evolution.</p>

<p>We&#39;re going to win in the end. It&#39;s absolutely inevitable. But salvation probably won&#39;t come from America; this is a country where half the population thought Sarah Palin was a good idea, that listens to Fox News and Rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones. They are standing on the throat of the US and will kill us before they let us join the rest of the civilized world.</p>

<p>But America is outnumbered, drastically, and most of the rest of the world doesn&#39;t have a Sarah Palin problem, a whole political movement of Sarah Palin worshippers blocking progress on every front. In Canada, Europe, Asia, Latin America, people are forming functional societies that are dedicating to advancing the human condition. </p>

<p>There will always be plutocrats trying to derail the whole thing for their personal gain, but they cannot win in the end.</p>

<p>Sorry. Not true at all. When ten years have gone by, you will realize you have been sold a bill of goods by whomever it is that gave you these ideas. It doesn&#39;t help the elites who run the show to allow the economy to collapse. The elites are perfectly happy how things are working right now; they&#39;re richer than ever and are pretty much in complete control of government. From their point of view it would be hard for things to be better. It&#39;s not going to help their position to allow global financial collapse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you can&#39;t see it now, you will soon enough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve been listening to predictions exactly like yours since I was old enough to have conversations like this. (About 40 years.) Ron Paul was predicting economic collapse by Wednesday of next week since at least the 1970s, and probably before that. This is just a feature of the thinking of a certain kind of far-right, populist, anti-government, libertarian mentality. </p>

<p>When you make predictions that fail decade after decade, pretty soon you realize your arguments are full of holes. </p>

<p>Listen, I&#39;m not trying to act superior. I&#39;m just telling you what I have personally observed after living a long time. I have made my own share of wild predictions that didn&#39;t come true. And I learned from them. </p>

<p>For example, I was convinced GW Bush was going to plant WMDs in Iraq after we failed to find any. Turns out he didn&#39;t do that. So I was wrong. He wasn&#39;t quite as evil in that one particular way as I thought he was.</p>

<p>In the 80s, when someone went to media they would slit their wrists, tie them behind back, wrap them in barb wire and drown them in a pool. Then declare it a suicide and make sure everyone else knew how the person died.</p>

<p>You only had to do that to a few people, to keep the other people silent. People would still spread rumors, but no one would put anything out that could be attributed back to them or take a stand in public/media.</p>

<p>I think we have a lot of foreign or illicit influence in government, that should not be there. That is outside of the public channels. Those groups are just killing people left and right to cover their tracks. There are plans in an &quot;emergency&quot; to just decapitate the existing government and have their goons take over. With the legitimate government locked in one bunker and the shadow government in other bunkers with communication equipment, calling the shots and directing the media. </p>

<p>Just like the NSA, the whole congress and elected government was kept out of the &quot;continuity of government&quot; plans. I think we are entering dangerous times, where the disclosure and internal leaks might force their hand into doing something severe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, &#39;awakening&#39;: Come to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> where one of the top posts starts like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;WorldNews mods show their typical pro-Jewish moderation&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reddit is never going to take <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> seriously as long as this sub keeps rampantly supporting anti-semitism. Seriously, it&#39;s nearly half the shit posted to this subreddit. Some of it is legitimate concern with our own US Government, but a huge chunk  is &quot;Israel is terrible and the Joos are bad!!!&quot;.</p>

<p>And before I hear how this <em>isn&#39;t</em> racism I&#39;m seeing: do you all really think there&#39;s some widespread conspiracy by a particular <em>race</em>? Because <em>that&#39;s racism</em>. Provably, I can show that not all or even a majority of jewish people are even somewhat connected <em>at all</em> to any sort of conspiracy. Yet &quot;Its the joos!&quot; is literally the mantra of this subreddit.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s just a group of people who <em>happen to be Jewish</em>, then why talk about their Judaism <em>at all</em>? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there was a overarching <em>white</em> conspiracy in the world because of the KKK or IRA. </p>

<p>Or a <em>black</em> conspiracy because the Crips and Bloods exist. </p>

<p>Or a <em>Mexican</em> conspiracy because the Zetas and MS13 exist. </p>

<p>Or a <em>Japanese</em> conspiracy because the Triads exist. </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t deny that those groups all exist. I simply don&#39;t attribute their characteristics <em>to their particular race</em>. </p>

<hr/>

<p>This is a simple, simple concept. It saddens me that <em>all of the world of conspiracy</em> – and many here are highly intelligent and good people, mind you – is tarnished by a small group of racist radicals who&#39;ve attempted to mold the opinions and outlooks of a group of definitively gullible people into believing that a <em>particular race</em> is the cause of the world&#39;s problems. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m gonna get serious flack here for saying so. </p>

<p>So go on guys, get to it: Prove my point. </p>

<p>Edit: Come on guys, another -50 points to go and I&#39;ll hit the -100 cap. Work <em>harder</em>.</p>

<p>Edit again: <em>There</em> ya go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a rational statement, thank you. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt for a moment that there are provocateurs. </p>

<p>What I argue though, is that the masses of non-racists in this sub <em>let the racists run around freely</em> without scolding, without being told to stop it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a bit of a mantra to the conspiracy theorist: Good men who do nothing in the face of bad deeds are just as bad as the people committing the bad deeds. </p>

<p>Well, good conspiracy theorists who let the idle racism slide are just as much a problem as the racists themselves.</p>

<p>And you know what? If you guys stepped up and got loud like I&#39;m doing right now, <em>you might change things</em>. You might actually make a <em>positive difference</em>. Because the provocateurs and the racists are both unwanted, both undesired, and both causing problems: And yet, they can both be defeated by the same thing: Just don&#39;t fucking tolerate racism. Plain and simple. Call it out when it&#39;s said: It won&#39;t matter if it&#39;s a real racist or not. That&#39;s the fucking <em>point</em> of a provocateur: to appear as a real one. When you see cops hiding in plainclothes at a protest, throwing rocks and shit? What&#39;s the correct response as a real protester? </p>

<p><strong><em>&quot;KNOCK IT THE FUCK OFF DUDE, You&#39;re making it worse on all of us.&quot;</em></strong> </p>

<p>Not, &quot;Oh let him, nothing wrong with throwing a rock or two&quot;. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s not what I see here. I see people adamantly downvoting the guy (me) calling out racism for what it is. </p>

<p>I see people adamantly defending the racists (and by default and thusly, the provocateurs).  </p>

<p>Why is that so fucking hard for people to comprehend?</p>

<p>But at least you can admit that there <em>are actual, real racists</em> at play. Most of the subscribers here just say &#39;They&#39;re <em>all</em> provocateurs&#39;. So thanks for being a bit more rational than the next.</p>

<p>This account is a throwaway, but I&#39;ve been checking out <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for about a year now, and I&#39;ve had my oldest reddit account for 8 years. That is to say, I&#39;m no spring chicken.</p>

<p>So the first rule in this subreddit: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;1. Derisive slurs against people&#39;s race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, social order or creed are not tolerated.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From what I&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s pretty actively enforced. Racist and obviously trollish comments on the front page get taken down pretty quickly, and those that are not, are downvoted to oblivion. Once in a while, &quot;stormfags&quot; show up and brigade a submission or two, and the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> denizens respond by downvoting them into collapsed-post negativity. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say that obviously racist and hateful submissions <em>all</em> disappear. Some make it to the front page, especially late at night (during low activity), but are usually downvoted or removed during the day.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t think your point really stands. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is actually quite against racism and baseless hatred, and this shows based on the voting and moderation patterns. </p>

<p>So when you say this subreddit should adopt the stance of </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;KNOCK IT THE FUCK OFF DUDE, You&#39;re making it worse on all of us.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Frankly, I don&#39;t think blatant racism is worth &quot;rebutting&quot; with a comment. It&#39;s not worth my time. I see some bullshit, I downvote it, maybe report it, and move on. I&#39;m here for information and discussion unavailable elsewhere, and I don&#39;t have the time to feed the trolls. Telling trolls to &quot;knock it off&quot; is about as effective as doing the same to a schoolyard bully -- it won&#39;t do jack shit.  Downvote, report, and move on. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I see people adamantly defending the racists</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see this often, could you give me some examples? It&#39;s possible that someone was defending a racists&#39; right to free speech, something I also support -- even though I strongly disagree with their views.</p>

<p>Bear in mind, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is kind of the catch-all subreddit for content that the main reddits reject or moderate out. So there&#39;s some flat-earthers here, there are Hidden Planet X-ers, maybe a few reptilianers too. That&#39;s the nature of this beast. There&#39;s some bullshit here, no doubt, but there&#39;s also some great, well-researched information here -- try <a href="/u/JamesColesPardon">/u/JamesColesPardon</a> &#39;s submissions, for example. I really don&#39;t see people defending racists here, we tend to shun and downvote them rather than engage with them when they do show up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s a bit of a mantra to the conspiracy theorist: Good men who do nothing in the face of bad deeds are just as bad as the people committing the bad deeds. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that&#39;s actually a classical liberalism mantra (from Edmund Burke), but whatever floats your boat. Do some more research man, maybe hang around here for a week or two. We don&#39;t like that &quot;it&#39;s the joos&quot; shit here anymore than you do. But there&#39;s documentation that the rest of reddit (other subreddit&#39;s power mods) have been regularly submitting and brigading &quot;It&#39;s The Joos&quot; posts.</p>

<p>Is it possible that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is actually not any more racist than the internet at large, but the rest of reddit wants to make it look like they are?</p>

<p>EDIT: one more thing</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I see people adamantly downvoting the guy (me) calling out racism for what it is. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t speak for everyone else here, but I think you&#39;re getting downvoted for promoting the idea that this subreddit is racist, and tolerates outright racism, not because you&#39;re being anti-racist. It&#39;s not something I&#39;d downvote for, but not everyone wants to write out an essay-length post to respond to your argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, stopping by for the customary reach around and upvote brigade. Onward!</p>

<p>Your submission here, <a href="/u/flyby_advisor">/u/flyby_advisor</a>, is far better than anything I have produced lately, that&#39;s for sure.</p>

<p>It is extremely encouraging to see you and others here downvoting this post, and this <em>idea</em>.</p>

<p>You know as well as I do that the <em>idea</em> of reddit being co-opted and changed to be a <em>safe space</em> is coming, right? Take that into context here with these replies. These accounts here are trying to introduce an <em>idea</em> to the sub, surprisingly at the best time, with all the summerfags and such.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s almost as if the account you are replying to is an <em>agent provocateur</em> of sorts, trying to plant the seed of being proud of our censorship against racism (and of course <em>the j00s</em> get a mention), instead of priding the community for it&#39;s mostly levelheadedness besides some obvious stromfront/conspiratard activities).</p>

<p>And here you are, giving this account the time of day and respectfully rebutting him. Good on you. Somebody&#39;s got to do it and I&#39;ve migrated away from this activity and you&#39;re doing a better job than me at it anyway. You give me so, so much hope. </p>

<p>You give us all hope. </p>

<p>Please do not dissappoint.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m guessing <a href="/u/Throwaway4Censorship">/u/Throwaway4Censorship</a> won&#39;t be responding to my post, but that&#39;s okay. I just wanted to have this rebuttal on record.  I offered to provide links to the leaked irc logs where a mod admits he&#39;s been submitting antisemitic stuff to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, <a href="/u/Throwaway4Censorship">/u/Throwaway4Censorship</a> did not take me up on the offer. Either he knows about it but is unwilling to integrate this information, or he&#39;d rather ignore it and others be unaware of it. Either way, not so good.</p>

<p>Now that you&#39;ve brought it up, the OP&#39;s username does seem quite fitting -- coupled with the Chairman&#39;s latest &quot;Safe Spaces&quot; policy, Mr. <em>Throwaway</em> is indeed making a case <em>4</em> <em>censorship</em>. </p>

<p>This is nothing new, i saw it really pick up after the Ron Paul Reddit Floods of &#39;08, and escalate from there. The Conde Nast buyout certainly didn&#39;t help things any... </p>

<p>When it comes to accusations of antisemitism, I see a couple of main groups: those that cannot distinguish between Zionism and Judaism, outright trolls or shills, and &quot;anticonspiracy activists&quot; -- the people that buy into the Cass Sunstein thesis that we are a dangerous bunch and must be subverted through manipulation.</p>

<p>As I understand, there have been more documented antisemitic submissions here from power mods of other subreddits than from stormfront. If that doesn&#39;t clue you in on what&#39;s happening here, well... there&#39;s always lolcats...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See? Rational question. Thank you.</p>

<p>I am fully willing to accept that may be the truth, however: (and this is a big however).. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>I&#39;m not a politician on the global stage (neither are 99% of people in this sub). </p></li>
<li><p>I don&#39;t work at the UN (neither do 99% of people in this sub.)</p></li>
<li><p>I don&#39;t work for UNICEF, The Red Cross, or any other global organization which would put me in a position to <em>make that judgement call</em> (neither do 99% of people in this sub). </p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;ve never been anywhere near that area of the world (Probably a bit more than 1% have been, but still, not a majority or even close). </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I can only choose to trust or not trust what I read, and from what I read, Israel <em>isn&#39;t</em> exactly the nicest of militant states. </p>

<p>But I get conflicting stories: I see some say one thing while others state the exact opposite. It&#39;s how the world has always worked: People lay bias out in journalism in every country, in every language. The difference between my take on that and the general-consensus Conspiracy take on it is that <strong>I require a lot more evidence than <em>&#39;probably&#39;</em> to turn around and condemn an entire race of people as evil</strong>. </p>

<p>The conspiratorial mind has an idea already in mind for who&#39;s guilty: They then move the evidence to make that picture fit. That&#39;s not how evidence is used in the rational world, I&#39;m sorry to say.</p>

<p>So am I willing to admit that it&#39;s possible? Absolutely. It is totally possible. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not Israeli. I&#39;m not Jewish. I&#39;m a white, late 20s dude who builds websites. What I&#39;m not willing to do is condemn an entire <em>race of people</em> for what basically amounts to geopolitical hearsay.</p>

<p>No shit, unless you think genocide is acceptable.</p>

<p>Israel, as it stands,  is NOT a race thus i have just invalidated your argument in this respect.</p>

<p>As for the rest of your post, the genocide being committed in Israel, right this very second, is accepted on the international scale.</p>

<p>According to the definition of genocide as stated by the UN, Israel is committing genocide, this is NOT a conflicting story and to suggest otherwise is a blatant falsehood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow it&#39;s like you don&#39;t even read. First off, no the fact that <em>you</em> didn&#39;t use the term &#39;Jew&#39; or &quot;Jewish&quot; doesn&#39;t at all change the context of the discussion. Israel may or may not be guilty of genocide: <em>The fuck does that have to do with all the Jews of the world?</em> </p>

<p>You&#39;re not &#39;destroying my argument&#39; by ignoring it, kid.</p>

<p>As with any case of geopolitics that you&#39;re only experiencing by proxy of the media, there are many many stories that are conflicting. No matter how hard you try to force it into such a view, the world does not operate in terms of binary &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;.</p>

<p>Go: Find me sources that state &quot;The UN General Assembly has determined, unequivocally, that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza&quot;. </p>

<p>All I can find are certain people making accusations. I can find people in the UN who say absolutely yes, and absolutely no. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s some stuff I found: It&#39;s the Palestinian President. Meanwhile Hamas says something different, and Abbas says &#39;No, Gaza&#39;s problems are caused by Hamas, not Palestine&#39;. It&#39;s all He-Said/She-Said, and deciding to trust one over the other arbitrarily is not the correct approach to determining one&#39;s own beliefs.</p>

<p>Nothing, because the genocide being carried out is not being done by Jews, it is being done by Zionists, actual Jews condemn Zionism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The UN General Assembly has determined, unequivocally, that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The crime of genocide is defined in article II, the provision that sits at the heart of the Convention. Genocide is a crime of intentional destruction of a national, ethnic, racial and religious group, in whole or in part. <a href="http://www.preventgenocide.org/law/convention/text.htm">Article II lists five punishable acts of genocide</a> (<a href="https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/3/ares3.htm">Resolution 260 III</a>).</p>

<ul>
<li>Killing members of the group;</li>
<li>Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;</li>
<li>Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;</li>
<li>Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;</li>
<li>Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the legal definition of genocide, rooted in the 1948 Convention and confirmed in subsequent case law, Israel are committing crimes against humanity, this is an absolute fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But you know what doesn&#39;t bring about that end at all? Blaming the Jewish population</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not blame any Jewish population, only Zionists, stop trying to use the racist card to win an argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ill bet you believe &quot;muslims&quot; somehow brought down WTC6 and WTC7  in a controlled demolition, in spite of there being no evidence to support that particular allegation, huh? </p>

<p>People in this sub are not racist or anti-semitic. They are usually very open minded to all sorts of sometimes-conflicting evidence. This is often taken to mean that users on this sub &quot;will believe anything&quot;... but i prefer to view the users on this sub as highly intelligent people working on a very complex puzzle that is made even more complex by having pieces of other puzzles deliberately mixed in with the &quot;legitimate&quot; pieces, which makes the puzzle that much harder. Sometimes we pick up a puzzle piece that is disinfo-misinfo and look at for a while, not entirely sure of how to fit that piece into the puzzle. Just because we handle a puzzle piece a few times doesnt mean we believe it or that we can make it fit into the puzzle. Those pieces are usually passed around for a while and then dropped, whereas the more promising pieces continue to get reposted (things like WTC7  or the Pentagon)</p>

<p>So when we start to dig into a huge conspiracy like 9/11 and quickly become convinced that the official story is a pack of lies, its only natural to want to learn the truth. None of us have ever claimed to possess absolute truth, only that we are in the persuit of truth, wherever that search takes us.</p>

<p>As of right now, the evidence seems to stronly suggest that Osama bin Laden was a CIA asset, and that his death was faked by the Obama administration.</p>

<p>There is very little evidence to support the &quot;muslims did it&quot; theory of 9/11 beyond a video of some people walking in an airport terminal, a passport that survived a fireball that consumed the black boxes, and some suspiciously convenient muslim propaganda left in the trunk of a rental car. </p>

<p>Furthermore, evidence gathered from the post 9/11 Anthrax letters seems to strongly  suggest that it was an inside job, and the anthrax was produced in the USA for reasons that are still flimsy at best (research!  imagine if Iran wanted to build WMDs for &quot;research&quot; purposes). Also, the Anthrax letters appear to have been crafted in such a way as to make them look like the work of muslims... &quot;Alluha Akbar, Death To Israel, Death To USA&quot;... </p>

<p>Since 9/11 is obviously a false flag, and &quot;muslims&quot; were obviously patsies, it makes us wonder what the motivation for such an attack on us, the ever-innocent american people... </p>

<p>And since the false flag psyop of 9/11 is obviously framed in terms of religion and religious fanatics, it is useful to look at the evidence through the lens of religion and religious fanatics. Who are the players? Who benefits? </p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most damning pieces of evidence is the statement by General Wesley Clark where he admits that immediately after 9/11, the Pentagon had plans to go to war in 7 nations in the next 10 years. Sure enough, American &quot;foreign policy&quot; has followed his prediction very closely, up to an including false allegations of the use of chemical weapons by Assad in Syria.</p>

<p>When we look at &quot;who benefits&quot;, we just have to look at the Yinon Plan for the expansion of the state of Israel, and the statement by the founder of the modern state of Israel David Ben Gurion who said he would rather conquer new lands than to purchase. </p>

<p>So lo and behold the American soldier is taking over land in Kuwait, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Saudi Arabia... and the American public, largly Christians, is supposed to believe that these planned occupations were somehow for their own benefit? Americans (Christians) do not benefit from these occupations, but Israel sure does benefit. Considering the long history of the land of Israel/ Palestine, it would be difficult to say for sure who has rights to what lands. (The same conflict would arise if Native Americans decided they had rights to the land in North and South America). So most Americans would be content to let the chips fall where they may in the middle east, except that now Americans (Christians) have been attacked, which makes it personal, and we are being asked by Bibi Netanyaho for $$$billions for his militaristic, imperialistic ambitions, which few Americans (Christians) actually supoort. We have our own problems to worry about without  having to subsidize a Zionist theocracy in the mideast. Americans (Christians) wouldn&#39;t support a theocracy in the midwest, so why are they being asked to subsidize a theocracy in the mideast?</p>

<p>Sorry if that sounds &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; to anybody.</p>

Its as if the /isrconspiracyracist fools acting surprised that people have finally noticed that over 90% of their racist claims are based not on humanity, but on ONE SINGLE minority group.

Call you a shill? I didn&#39;t say anything of the sort. Though when one walks like a duck, quacks like a duck...what are people gonna think?

All subscribers to reddit, not just <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> have different views on things. Any stupid idea can be vote-brigaded in any subreddit, but this particular one is a target. There are people who want all of reddit to believe what you believe, that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a cesspool of racism. All of reddit is a cesspool of various social ills. </p>

<p>Also, that &quot;mantra&quot; you quoted... I have never heard that before in my life. I think you made it up. Or are you referring to the quote by Edmund Burke?</p>

<p>&quot;All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>tarnished by a small group of racist radicals</p>

<p>You are correct. As a fairly long time participant in this sub I can tell you this unequivocally. A small group of stormfront shitposters (I call them SS because well... it fits.) have infiltrated this community and have successfully bamboozled a sizeable portion of the participators. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>do you all really think there&#39;s some widespread conspiracy by a particular race? Because that&#39;s racism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nail on the head. However where we may disagree is that I feel the intent of <em>some</em> of these posters is to associate this community <em>with</em> those SS and therefore marginalize <em>everyone</em> here. </p>

<p>Furthermore I feel that you are one of the reasons that this kind of thing is effective, because you are here white-knighting on <strong>a ridiculous generalization that fails to consider all sides of the argument</strong>. This kind of effort only serves to reinforce your own conformation bias. </p>

<p>All of us? All of who again exactly? Thanks for promoting that stereotype mr. white knight!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re not telling racist assholes to stop being racist here, you <em>are</em> apart of the problem. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how much more clear I can be on that. </p>

<p>Obviously there are non-racists who <em>are</em> vocal about that here. I&#39;m not against them, nor do I paint them <em>as</em> racists (or &#39;stormscum&#39; as you cutesy call it). </p>

<p>I&#39;ve said it, out right, in no uncertain terms: Racism is wrong. Letting racism happen on your doorstep is just as wrong as <em>being</em> a racist on your doorstep. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re a subscriber of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, you see racism every day. Anti-semitism is everywhere in this subreddit. </p>

<p>And if you see racism every day and you never speak up, never say &#39;wait a sec&#39;, never say &#39;Hey look you nazi fuck get the fuck out of my subreddit&#39;, then ya know what? Stormfront deserves <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Let them have it. Because you&#39;re not putting up a fucking fight. You&#39;re just accepting that &#39;okay some are racists <em>but not everyone!</em>&#39;</p>

<p>Well? Prove it. Again: Letting racism go unchecked is exactly as bad as being a racist yourself. And I simply <em>don&#39;t</em> see anyone ever get anything but downvotes for using the &quot;R&quot; word here. It doesn&#39;t happen. They just get called a JIDF shill (as I have been called now, three times or more). </p>

<p>So why is it exactly that you aren&#39;t engaged in this kind of behavior in the hundreds of other subs that are racist by their <strong>very existence</strong>? Some kind of special thing happening here that isn&#39;t directly on the tin in <strong>many</strong> other subreddits as opposed to being just the results of a small group of SS? </p>

<p>Further, others like me who are more gullible may be fooled by a racist here and led astray against their better judgement. That&#39;s why the subversive nature of stormfront is particularly detrimental here, and not so much in a sub built to be specifically racist.</p>

<p>Jews as a people are as innocent of world manipulation as any other group but it is a fact that a group of Zionist Jews is a major player or the major player in most global geopolitical conspiracies.  Your &quot;racism&quot; scare-training has made you incapable of thinking clearly about anything involving Jews doing bad things so let me give you an analogy.  Imagine that the Italian Mafia was much more successful and powerful than they currently are and used their power to manipulate world affairs through the media, finance, and major industries.  The average Italian person would be as uninvolved in this as any typical person from any other ethnic group, but the idea that &quot;Italians are manipulating the world&quot; would be true.  Switch out &quot;Italians&quot; with &quot;Jews&quot;, and you now understand why the people here pointing the truth out to you are not simple minded racists.</p>

<p>Read the thread on r/conspiracy last week about the plane, same one spotted circling during the Boston bombing. That sub is really getting some vindication recently.</p>

<p>But truth be told there are a lot of things you see first in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if reporters were subscribed to that subreddit, it would be dumb for them not to.</p>

<p>A department spokeswoman said the policy applied only to unmanned aircraft systems rather than piloted airplanes. &quot;Trust us. We&#39;re the FBI. What&#39;s there to worry about? We&#39;d never do you wrong.&quot; <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/fbi-audit-exposes-widespread-abuse-patriot-act-powers">A report released today</a> by the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) on the FBI’s use of National Security Letters (NSLs) reveals a systemic, widespread abuse of power.</p>

<p>J Edgar Hoover was director of the FBI for decades during the Cold War. He was a very power hungry man and would use FBI resources to spy on politicians and prominent citizens and then blackmail them into doing what he wanted. Hoover supposedly had dirt on everyone, including presidents. People with a more cynical view see that period as the US living under a dictatorship. The people would elect new politicians but it didn&#39;t matter because they all had to bend to Hoover&#39;s will. He had the information to destroy anyone&#39;s career so no one could challenge him.</p>

<p>Also, you didn&#39;t miss this in your History class because you weren&#39;t paying attention. They probably didn&#39;t teach much about it. I find that a lot of people try to pretend it didn&#39;t happen. It really kills most people&#39;s Murica Boner.</p>

<p>Its no longer a conspiracy. THEY ARE WATCHING. If you fuck up you will find yourself thrown into the back of a unmarked van by fully armed masked gunmen then drove to a black site. Chained to the floor and then subjected to mental torture and &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a profoundly important story, more than anybody here truly realizes here. This program is a massive nationwide drone spying dragnet, way bigger than the AP reports. This is amazing to me that we have confirmation of this program, i have suspected it for so many years. </p>

<p>I have been across the country and have seen these planes everywhere I go. Sometimes they have flown directly over me. I started noticing this in 2011 and it has only increased. Federal law enforcement has futuristic tools that, while aren&#39;t completely sci-fi, are startling to contemplate. I feel this is the tip of the iceberg.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is right, it&#39;s <em>really</em> right. But the opposite is also true. And that&#39;s the problem. Everyone here knows that you can post just about any crazy conspiracy and some people here will totally buy it, <em>no questions asked.</em> If you don&#39;t believe me, just try it. Start a thread with literally any lunatic theory. As long as it contains two components, it will be upvoted and accepted uncritically. </p>

<p>(1) The reader is the victim. (The GOP and conservative movements, especially, thrive on fostering an intense feeling of victimhood in their subjects.) </p>

<p>(2) The enemy is the US government, or, sometimes, big business, or, sometimes, Jews. (The latter two tend to divide the community; the former is nearly universally agreed upon by everyone here. On the other hand, you see very little overt hatred of Muslims or blacks -- another way <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is better than most of the rest of reddit.)</p>

<p>But, yeah. When someone posts something factual about the NSA, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is head and shoulders above the rest of reddit. But then 2 posts down will be some crackpot shit about the Rothschilds owning literally every central bank in the world (except 2). Or, fucking Jade Helm. That is a story with literally ZERO substance. You have to literally be willing to believe <em>anything</em> as long as it&#39;s about DUH EBIL GOBERMENT to believe Jade Helm. The absolute pinnacle of Jade Help evidence is Dahboo77 breathing into his microphone, &quot;THIS IS IT FOLKS, INSIDE A WALMART CLOSED FOR MONTHS, WE SEE EMPTY SHELVES. WHY ARE THEY SETTING UP EMPTY SHELVES IN WALMARTS ALL THROUGH THE JADE HELM AREA? THESE ARE OPERATIONALLY APPROPRIATE SHELVING FOR UN TROOPS. ARE FEMA PRISONERS -- YOU, YOUR KIDS -- GOING TO BE FORCED TO SLEEP ON THESE SHELVES AT NIGHT?&quot; </p>

<p>Seriously. If that strikes you as a compelling argument, just go down to the basement now and shoot yourself. Because fucking seriously. </p>

<p>People who agitate for change need to be able to convince and persuade people who don&#39;t yet get it. But you can&#39;t do that by acting like a crackpot. You can&#39;t do that by letting Rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones shit into your skull. Like it or not, as frustrating as it is, <em>people respond to evidence and to solid arguments.</em> And that&#39;s about it. If you can&#39;t bring that, you might as well stay home and work on your game. </p>

<p>Are you guys seriously still using the, &quot;Of course they spy on us, duh.&quot; tactic to try to quell public outrage about how the government violates the constitution millions upon millions of times a day. A lack of surprise about how unconstitutional the entire U.S. Government has become is not something people should be proud of, if anything, it should be an even greater red flag that something is seriously wrong. The entire population couldn&#39;t care less how many of their rights are violated, it&#39;s terrible.  We should just be OK with it because, &quot;Anyone who doesn&#39;t think a government as large as the US does stuff like this is at least just ignorant.&quot;? We&#39;re called retards when our theories are unproven because of &quot;hur dur, put a tin foil hat on ya loon!&quot; and we&#39;re called retards when our theories are proven correct because,&quot;hur dur, no duh ya retard!&quot;. Fuck you people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It just seems funny that you seem so outraged on internet websites, yet I would bet money that you dont do shit in real life to do anything about it. You are what they call a keyboard warrior. If you really care that much about constitutional rights, you wouldnt be bitching on the internet, you would be doing more important shit in the fight against the government. So shut your gay little whiny mouth and go do something better with your time than saying &quot;fuck you&quot; to random people on Reddit you loser lol. </p>

I know that there is a 90% chance that you are just trying to be snarky with that copypasta comment, but I really hope that you genuinely thought that this may be a copypasta, just to prove with my first visit to r/conspiracy that the people here really are conspiritards, which is why I cam here to test. </p>

I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USAand your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</p>

<p>They can enjoy their distractions while the world burns down all around them</p>

<p>The world&#39;s not burning down. Yes, there&#39;s a lot of truly terrible stuff going on. There are some very serious challenges. But there are a lot of great things happening, too. Humanity as a whole is better off now than it has been at any time in human history, at least by many of the common measures (health, longevity, material wealth, free time, freedom, etc.)</p>

<p>We have huge problems with concentration of wealth, erosion of the middle class, a lot of the stuff that we talk about here all the time. But the world is a complex place, and while we are losing ground to bad guys on some fronts, we are gaining on many others. Plus, the internet. That&#39;s the game changer that is going to have an impact none of us have even begun to comprehend. The internet is the printing press times a million in terms of the impact it will have on human evolution.</p>

<p>We&#39;re going to win in the end. It&#39;s absolutely inevitable. But salvation probably won&#39;t come from America; this is a country where half the population thought Sarah Palin was a good idea, that listens to Fox News and Rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones. They are standing on the throat of the US and will kill us before they let us join the rest of the civilized world.</p>

<p>But America is outnumbered, drastically, and most of the rest of the world doesn&#39;t have a Sarah Palin problem, a whole political movement of Sarah Palin worshippers blocking progress on every front. In Canada, Europe, Asia, Latin America, people are forming functional societies that are dedicating to advancing the human condition. </p>

<p>There will always be plutocrats trying to derail the whole thing for their personal gain, but they cannot win in the end.</p>

<p>So why is it exactly that you aren&#39;t engaged in this kind of behavior in the hundreds of other subs that are racist by their <strong>very existence</strong>? Some kind of special thing happening here that isn&#39;t directly on the tin in <strong>many</strong> other subreddits as opposed to being just the results of a small group of SS? </p>

But I&#39;ve been around long enough to know that despite what the typical libertarian believes, &quot;libertarian&quot; is very much a catch-all category for a very wide range of different opinions. The label just appeals to a lot of people. For one thing, a lot of people think &quot;Oh, liberty, I&#39;m for that, so I&#39;m a libertarian.&quot;</p>
