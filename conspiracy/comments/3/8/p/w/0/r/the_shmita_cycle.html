       The Hebrew shemita year began the middle of last September, and it ends the middle of September, 2015. The Synagogue of Satan tends to make its moves near the beginning or the end the shemita; this is a special shemita, as it precedes a 50 year jubilee, so something huge is to be expected. Google Jonathan Cahn for the full treatment.

       Thank you for your reply. I was aware of much of this, as well as the 7-year cycle, and planned on making money moves to protect myself late summer but before Labor Day. I will Google your man JCahn to learn more, but do you think I'm skirting too close to danger by waiting that long?
      </p>

       I've got zero doubts it's coming though. Even without the Occult angle, this shit can't hold much longer.

       That's very late, given the fuzzy nature of the thing; they could easily pull it in August, depending on the astrology. Ideally one would spend the entire shemita in preparation, but one does what one can. IMO you are thinking small; also make plans to profit.

       Yea especially with the launch of this site the crash might happen well before the Shemita. Things are really rolling at this point with bank runs in Greece and the bond bubble bursting. I would recommend a diversification of the following hard assets:
      </p>
      <p>
       Silver bullion, batteries, gasoline, guns, ammo, non perishables, a generator / solar panels. Maybe some common spare parts like alternators.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the following soft assets:
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoins, stock in companies that mine silver, stock in companies with hard assets: railways, mining rights, farms, that sort of thing. Crude oil futures. SPXU is also fun in a down turn, but make sure you get out at some point because it is bound to get overvalued, it might even be completely worthless in a complete breakdown of the financial sector. Pawn shops and dollar stores are bound to go up up up. Take a look at what Berkshire Hathaway is doing for more ideas (they just bought an
       <em>
        entire
       </em>
       railroad!).

       Why silver over gold? I have ten oz. of gold in a safe deposit box in a bank, which I've been told is not the best place to keep it. You don't have to comment on that, but why silver &gt; gold?

       You are quite welcome! I like silver because it is more negotiable / divisible. Gold is worth so much that the practicality of spending it in a currency collapse makes it kind of a liability. It is probably best to have both, though. Depending on exactly what actions the government takes, one might be safer than the other (gold is easier to smuggle, but also the gov't might try and seize everyone's gold again)
      </p>
      <p>
       Definitely do not keep it in a safe deposit box. When the banks go insolvent who knows what will happen to it.

       That's a real nice list, though I'd suggest a few things for the precious metals:
      </p>
      <p>
       Gold is a great investment, but a long-term one, as its rise is certain to be very spikey and difficult to speculate with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Silver is an excellent asset, as it is even more undervalued than gold at the moment; but it will be wise to diversify with a couple of grand in government silver in your safe. Your bullion will come reported and tracked, and nobody will trust it in trade, no matter how fancy the certificate that came with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you buy stock in mining companies, make sure to avoid those carrying any significant amount of debt, because that means banksters already own those companies, and your stock purchase would just be decorative.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's kind of a big deal, because one major purpose of suppressing the precious metal price is to drive the mining companies into debt, allowing the banksters to own the metal while it is still in the ground (and off the books), at pennies on the dollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also vices: Liquor and cigarettes are a sure thing if you expect things to get really bad. You would have to find a way to keep your customers from knowing from whom, and where, they came from though.

       These are all such great points, thank you so much!! Especially about the mining co debt -- that is so crucial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could you elaborate what you mean by government silver? Is there a way to get that without without it being tracked?

       Silver coins of limited or no numismatic value. You can buy them by the bag for little more than their 90% silver content, which will be known and trusted in trade in the event of a currency failure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I should have said above that when you buy precious metals, you are essentially shorting fiat currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Addendum: The US government does not track minted coins, and values them at face value for tax purposes.

       Why silver over gold? I have ten oz. of gold in a safe deposit box in a bank, which I've been told is not the best place to keep it. You don't have to comment on that, but why silver &gt; gold?

       You are quite welcome! I like silver because it is more negotiable / divisible. Gold is worth so much that the practicality of spending it in a currency collapse makes it kind of a liability. It is probably best to have both, though. Depending on exactly what actions the government takes, one might be safer than the other (gold is easier to smuggle, but also the gov't might try and seize everyone's gold again)
      </p>
      <p>
       Definitely do not keep it in a safe deposit box. When the banks go insolvent who knows what will happen to it.

       That's a real nice list, though I'd suggest a few things for the precious metals:
      </p>
      <p>
       Gold is a great investment, but a long-term one, as its rise is certain to be very spikey and difficult to speculate with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Silver is an excellent asset, as it is even more undervalued than gold at the moment; but it will be wise to diversify with a couple of grand in government silver in your safe. Your bullion will come reported and tracked, and nobody will trust it in trade, no matter how fancy the certificate that came with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you buy stock in mining companies, make sure to avoid those carrying any significant amount of debt, because that means banksters already own those companies, and your stock purchase would just be decorative.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's kind of a big deal, because one major purpose of suppressing the precious metal price is to drive the mining companies into debt, allowing the banksters to own the metal while it is still in the ground (and off the books), at pennies on the dollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also vices: Liquor and cigarettes are a sure thing if you expect things to get really bad. You would have to find a way to keep your customers from knowing from whom, and where, they came from though.
