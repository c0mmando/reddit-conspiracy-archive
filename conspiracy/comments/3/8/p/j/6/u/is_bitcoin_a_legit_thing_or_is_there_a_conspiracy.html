    <div class="md"><p>you can&#39;t gain control of it like that! it&#39;s a decentralize system. Meaning, that they can trick the majority of the people into implementing something new to the code that is not good for bitcoin, but everyone has to upgrade and agree to run the new code. Other than that, they can&#39;t! Perfect example is the current debate on raising the 1mb block limit to 20 mb. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t trade. It&#39;s not something you wanna trade! it&#39;s too volatile! I would suggest buying one or two and holding on to it for like 5 years. You will either lose 250 bucks, or it will be the best financial decision you ever made in your life. Remember, there are 7 billion people in the world, but there can only be 21 million bitcoins that can ever be created. If this thing takes off after a financial collapse, which very well might, what will happen if you try to divide 21,000,000 into 7,000,000,000? well, if you divide it evenly, each person should  receive about .003 bitcoins. Do the math :D (remember, each bitcoin is dividable to 100 million pieces. So, technically you can buy .000000001 bitcoin if you chose to. </p>

<p>Each BTC is about 250 dollars right now but who knows what the price will be tomorrow. At first, 2009/2010 you could buy 10000 bitcoins for a dollar, and in late 2013 each bitcoin was 1200 dollars. also, remember, don&#39;t think about trading bitcoin to make fiat money. Think more like, &quot;you might be able to one day buy a house for .2 bitcoin !&quot; I dont&#39; mean you can sell .2 bitcoin to have 400K dollars, i mean the person who sells you the house will accept .2 bitcoin for the house! </p>

<p>Here is the thing. It&#39;s either the best thing that happened to humanity or the worse thing depending on what happens to it. Exciting times we live in. </p>

<p>Can I ask you how much you know about bitcoin? When did you start looking into it? That way i can send you appropriate links. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/63502573">watch this first. a quick 3 minute intro </a> </p>

<p>So, personally, this is what got me into bitcoin. I had no idea what bitcoin was really, until one day on my way home  from work, I heard Andreas talk on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=1cexawnOlR8#t=634">Joe Rogan podcast.</a>  I was mining that night with my laptop lol (granted, I&#39;m a techy) </p>

<p>If you are a bit of a techy, and wanna know that the FUCK is mining exactly, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx9zgZCMqXE">watch this</a> </p>

<p>To see what it can do about wars and such, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joITmEr4SjY">watch this.</a></p>

<p>welcome to the financial renaissance</p>

<p>After you watched those, let me know if you have any other questions. I&#39;ll do my best to answer them for you. </p>

<p><a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">oh.. and lastly, this is the bitcoin white paper. What started it all!</a></p>

<p>I love the idea, but there are any number of ways it could be corrupted, from the OS level, to the client level, to the internet level. Then again, our current banking system is extremely corrupt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha. For sure. And as far as mining, you basically just solve someone else&#39;s math homework for bitcoin? Cool</p>
