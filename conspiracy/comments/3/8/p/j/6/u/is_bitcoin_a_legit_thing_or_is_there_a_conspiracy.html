       I was curious about Bitcoin and perhaps getting into purchasing it. Is there a sinister side to it?
      </p>
      <p>
       UPDATE: Just found that there is also Orbitcoin, Billioncoin, Bitbar, Iocoin, etc etc...seems like this idea has exploded. Not sure if that's a good thing. Makes the future seem like we won't have one currency, but quite the opposite.

       you can't gain control of it like that! it's a decentralize system. Meaning, that they can trick the majority of the people into implementing something new to the code that is not good for bitcoin, but everyone has to upgrade and agree to run the new code. Other than that, they can't! Perfect example is the current debate on raising the 1mb block limit to 20 mb.

       I don't trade. It's not something you wanna trade! it's too volatile! I would suggest buying one or two and holding on to it for like 5 years. You will either lose 250 bucks, or it will be the best financial decision you ever made in your life. Remember, there are 7 billion people in the world, but there can only be 21 million bitcoins that can ever be created. If this thing takes off after a financial collapse, which very well might, what will happen if you try to divide 21,000,000 into 7,000,000,000? well, if you divide it evenly, each person should  receive about .003 bitcoins. Do the math :D (remember, each bitcoin is dividable to 100 million pieces. So, technically you can buy .000000001 bitcoin if you chose to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each BTC is about 250 dollars right now but who knows what the price will be tomorrow. At first, 2009/2010 you could buy 10000 bitcoins for a dollar, and in late 2013 each bitcoin was 1200 dollars. also, remember, don't think about trading bitcoin to make fiat money. Think more like, "you might be able to one day buy a house for .2 bitcoin !" I dont' mean you can sell .2 bitcoin to have 400K dollars, i mean the person who sells you the house will accept .2 bitcoin for the house!
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the thing. It's either the best thing that happened to humanity or the worse thing depending on what happens to it. Exciting times we live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can I ask you how much you know about bitcoin? When did you start looking into it? That way i can send you appropriate links.

       Well the government doesn't like it because they are not able to tax you're spending and they're not able to text who would be the business. so the government doesn't really support Bitcoin but I think they have a hard time stopping it's because of our legal rights.

       The problem with bitcoin however, is that it has a high (technological) barrier to entry. I don't want to dissuade you away from it, but I don't see it being used more as a utility and less as an investment, any time soon.

       I'm a bitcoin newb, but basically your computer runs a really complicated math problem. The solution to that problem is one bitcoin. Essentially, you're trading processing power for bitcoin.

       I love the idea, but there are any number of ways it could be corrupted, from the OS level, to the client level, to the internet level. Then again, our current banking system is extremely corrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just don't put all your money into bitcoin is all I'm saying. Diversify yo bonds nigga.

       Ha. For sure. And as far as mining, you basically just solve someone else's math homework for bitcoin? Cool
      </p>
      <p>
       About the corruption: For sure. If its all digital, why can't a hacker simply add a few 000000's to their account balance (just like a bank hacker would?)

       They can't. They have to do the math and get the right solutions. Those solutions are used for the transactions.

       Yeah not so much it all depends on the market let's say I list a Xbox game, would I reasonablly list at at 20 bitcoin...  no because no one would buy it I would list it at .08 bit coin so about 20US dollar's.

       I got a feeling its a honey pot that the CIA created to convince people to accept a new digital currency that they can monitor and control at some point in the future. cant be sure of course, but It just seems like these days stuff like this is being created by people in power before the public interested in security privacy gets to it. They have think tanks working on trends like this and spend a lot of money predicting future trends.

       Interesting. So one day, like Obama keeping impoverished people in poverty and dependent on welfare, food stamps, etc the CIA will one day step out and say "either do what we say or the well will dry up."

       Of course the above is a pet theory of mine, but not something new I'd imagine.

       I see it as an NSA created loose cannon. Deliberately hands-off, it's a legit crypto-currency intended to set a trend that will finish off cash for them.
