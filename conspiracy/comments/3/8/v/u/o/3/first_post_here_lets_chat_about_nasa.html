       Probably should have created an alt for this but the NSA knows what i'm doing anyway so fuck it....
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you see it
      </p>

       OK so I was watching a flat earth video awhile back since it was posted in this sub.  It was lunacy, and yet, it kinda sucked me in.  I was really enjoying the thought of everything we have been taught, being a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Normally Conspiracy stuff just bums me out, but the Flat Earth stuff had me really intrigued.  Anyway, in the
       <a href="https://youtu.be/kFjG4jpUhQI?t=33m34s">
        video
       </a>
       they show astronauts with permed hair.  I found it compelling, because it looks like a fucking perm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today in r/food they posted a
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/zEKhv1d.gifv">
        gif
       </a>
       of Astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti, on the ISS.  Looks like a perm to me.  I mean her hair looks like it has a ton of hair spray on it to stay that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I didn't post this to discuss flat earth.  Mostly because I haven't been able to get behind the idea.  But, I did post this because I do think there is a bunch of valid things about NASA, that just don't make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone out there want to post some stuff about NASA that looks fabricated?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I leave you with this before you call me crazy:

       I honestly couldn't figure out how the gloppy stuff was

        placed

       and then stayed on the tortilla and why she kept chasing one solitary piece of runaway meat source, with her mouth!

       Back to the tortilla: How did she get the first ingredients onto that tortilla? Why do you see her chasing a solitary piece of meat around with her mouth, when the rest of this free floating food source is happily stuck to the tortilla?

       Adhesion and cohesion?  Y'know, the things you learn about in like 4th grade when you put drops of water on a penny?  Are you seriously telling me you've never seen foods that stick to other foods?  Any sort of mashed beans are sticky, plain pieces of meat are not.  You squeeze the beans onto the tortilla and they stick because they're sticky.  The meat flies around until it gets stuck to something because it's not sticky.

        Here is a video of Chris Hadfield making a burrito in space

       .  Notice how everything he does follows the laws of physics?  Amazing.  You're welcome for blowing your mind.

       It does not take any magic hair product to make hair stay in one place in space, especially when it's short.  Literally any normal hair product will do the job.  Some people's hair stays better than others.  Some people use hair product, some don't.  This is nothing new.  There are literally hundreds of videos of astronauts with hair flying everywhere.  Is it really amazing to you that buzz cuts and crew cuts look neat with little maintenance? Because that is literally the entire point of those haircuts.

       The video you posted has nothing to do with anything that was said before.  You are trying to change the argument.  If you can't support your initial arguments and you can't refute my refutations then say so.  Once that has happened then you can try to put up new arguments.

       I'm perfectly calm.  Meanwhile you seem afraid to admit when you're wrong and so instead choose to attempt to hide that fact through non sequiturs.  So one more time, are you actually going to refute anything I said or are you going to keep covering your ears and claiming everyone who doesn't agree with is you wrong?

       That was you saying "you're wrong", not providing any evidence to refute my claims.  So are you going to admit I'm correct or are you going to provide any evidence that I'm not?  You obviously cannot defend your arguments in any way, which is why you keep attempting to move the goalposts here.

       The ISS is nowhere near any Van Allen belts, so your video is still completely irrelevant.  Do you need some quotes?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt">
         The discovery of the belts is credited to James Van Allen and as a result the Earth's belts bear his name. The main belts extend from an altitude of about 1,000 to 60,000 kilometers above the surface in which region radiation levels vary.
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station">
         The ISS maintains an orbit with an altitude of between 330 and 435 km (205 and 270 mi) by means of reboost manoeuvres using the engines of the Zvezda module or visiting spacecraft. It completes 15.54 orbits per day.

       So you're not going to refute anything I said then?  Because so far all you've done is move goalposts and spout non sequiturs.  You have yet to refute a single thing I've said.  Hell, you haven't even

       Me too, I can't believe NASA is not that noble body of scientiists I grew up believing. Its kind of like knowing Santa Claus doesn't exist but on a much bigger scale.

       Also the Apollo was the biggest scam on American people. Why can't they realize that their tax dollars are going into the pockets of people that run these elaborate scams? Demand more accountability and truth about these scams!

       People always want to debate NASA with either "they're totally legit or not at all" but it's more likely that NASA is just a public relations front while the real tech goes on behind the scenes (free energy/warp drive/UFOs, etc.)

       Earnest skepticism for sure. The earth is extremely likely not to be flat; I believe this because Newton figured a thing or two out; straight empirical fact. That being said, empiricism shows some things, such as a strong motivation to best a rival power. The first moon landing was almost certainly staged. After that, I'd like to give it better than 50/50. The Van Allen Belt is not bunk, but who knows what they (TPTB) have to work with. I suppose there would be incentive to stage off-the-planet hijinks, per moon #1, but would Russia fall along now?

       That's a great question.  Why haven't any other countries called out NASA?  I don't know the answer to that.

       Holy shit this flat earth disinfo is to cover up real discussion of the space program. What are they really hiding?

       We should ignore flat earth stuff in this thread and talk about what realistic conspiracy could be surrounding NASA and the ISS etc...

       I'm perfectly calm.  Meanwhile you seem afraid to admit when you're wrong and so instead choose to attempt to hide that fact through non sequiturs.  So one more time, are you actually going to refute anything I said or are you going to keep covering your ears and claiming everyone who doesn't agree with is you wrong?

       Ah yes, somebody saying they're from the other side of the country from the people interviewing them is evidence of a conspiracy.

       Jesus people, why the hell do you base your conspiracy theories on your inability to understand conversations?  Like you are literally saying the ISS does not exist because you are unable to comprehend how people speak.
