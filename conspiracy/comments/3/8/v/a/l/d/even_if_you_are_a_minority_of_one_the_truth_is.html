       People are terrified about being a minority. Our entire culture is about the word, essentially. It's our entire focal point. Everyone wants to belong to the point they will change themselves to be what's required of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why the truth is so mysterious and frightening, and why people avoid it, because searching for it is to be by yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       With so much emphasis on belonging, there's no time for searching.

       It's all about having that internal compass and not being afraid to speak. I have been told on many occasions that I am too loud and too opinionated.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I speak the truth when I see it. You don't have to yell, you don't have to scream. You can be as gentle as a breeze. You can speak in a whisper, as long as you remain true to you.

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       An elderly German woman will face five years for laying out her

       </em>
       on German TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       She wasn't afraid, nor terrified about being a
       <em>
        minority
       </em>
       because she had facts, ledgers, documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       She will still be prosecuted. By her own Government. By her own Country.
      </p>
      <p>
       WHY? She had nothing to hide and documents she
       <em>
        cited
       </em>
       for all to study, read, explore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her home was raided, as were the homes of those that support her right to be heard.

       Not all Christians do that, in fact in my 39 years of life, I've never personally had one person tell me I should become Christian.  This isn't directed at you per se, just in general because I always hear that Christians do this.  I'm sure some do, as do other religions, it's just never happened to me.

       I've had Christians tell me to come to church with them. One time my boss even let me arrange my work dates so I could vacation as long as I agreed to go to church with him 1 time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Legalities of it aside, I do realize he was just trying to look out for me and do a "good thing" by his own beliefs. I fully believe he would have let me arrange the days without the agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I've never had a person cross any lines or get forceful/militant about it. If you believe as a Christian does, and think you're "saving" people by converting them, then of course you're going to feel some sense of duty in it. Can't fault them for it. They believe they have a truth of some kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't think of an instance in which I was discriminated against or anything 'bad' by another Christian. And, aside from the Westboro Baptist Church, who I think anyone can see for what they are, I've never heard of any truthful/candid second hand or news stories that relate to all the talking points atheists have for demonizing Christianity.

       They are. I'm not. We cross paths and glide past each other. It's just a fact of life.

       Did I say "ALL Christians impose their truth on people"? No, but some most definitely do.  And this creates a reputation for that ideology which you are a part of. Think missionaries who assimilate native African people into Christianity.  Thats called indoctrination, in other words, Christian ideology is IMPOSED on those people.
      </p>
      <p>
       People get shamed and judged if their ideals or lifestyle dont alight with what the church deems acceptable.  I grew up in a Christian family, I've known Christians who are genuinely decent and accepting people, and I've met Christians who are some of the worst people. Plus there are examples such as the Phelps family. So, yeah, there are Christians with a reputation of imposing their belief systems onto other people. There are Christians who have sex with children and their church forgives them, not to mention the Vatican probably controls more minds than any other institution in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not saying if youre Christian youre a bad person, or that Ill judge you for it.  But the religion you are a part of participates in some fucked up activity in the name of god and has most certainly developed a reputation for imposing its beliefs onto other people.  Sorry if thats a tough pill to swallow, but isn't it true?

       Not all Christians do that, in fact in my 39 years of life, I've never personally had one person tell me I should become Christian.  This isn't directed at you per se, just in general because I always hear that Christians do this.  I'm sure some do, as do other religions, it's just never happened to me.

       I've had Christians tell me to come to church with them. One time my boss even let me arrange my work dates so I could vacation as long as I agreed to go to church with him 1 time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Legalities of it aside, I do realize he was just trying to look out for me and do a "good thing" by his own beliefs. I fully believe he would have let me arrange the days without the agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I've never had a person cross any lines or get forceful/militant about it. If you believe as a Christian does, and think you're "saving" people by converting them, then of course you're going to feel some sense of duty in it. Can't fault them for it. They believe they have a truth of some kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't think of an instance in which I was discriminated against or anything 'bad' by another Christian. And, aside from the Westboro Baptist Church, who I think anyone can see for what they are, I've never heard of any truthful/candid second hand or news stories that relate to all the talking points atheists have for demonizing Christianity.

       They are. I'm not. We cross paths and glide past each other. It's just a fact of life.
