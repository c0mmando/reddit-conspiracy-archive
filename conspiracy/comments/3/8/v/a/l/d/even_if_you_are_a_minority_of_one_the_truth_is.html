<p>It&#39;s all about having that internal compass and not being afraid to speak. I have been told on many occasions that I am too loud and too opinionated.</p>

<p>But I speak the truth when I see it. You don&#39;t have to yell, you don&#39;t have to scream. You can be as gentle as a breeze. You can speak in a whisper, as long as you remain true to you.</p>

<p>An elderly German woman will face five years for laying out her <em>truth</em> on German TV.</p>

<p>She wasn&#39;t afraid, nor terrified about being a <em>minority</em> because she had facts, ledgers, documents. </p>

<p>She will still be prosecuted. By her own Government. By her own Country. </p>

<p>WHY? She had nothing to hide and documents she <em>cited</em> for all to study, read, explore.</p>

<p>Her home was raided, as were the homes of those that support her right to be heard.</p>

<p>First new case is being heard in Montana.</p>

<p>The U.S., on the other hand, is supposed to have embedded protections from this type of activity.</p>

<p>The last time this percolated was from Seattle, Wa. Then it spilled over to Idaho/Montana, Waco and Oklahoma. </p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t give a damn where one prays or if one prays. I&#39;m not shooting at anyone for spiritual space!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did I say &quot;ALL Christians impose their truth on people&quot;? No, but some most definitely do.  And this creates a reputation for that ideology which you are a part of. Think missionaries who assimilate native African people into Christianity.  Thats called indoctrination, in other words, Christian ideology is IMPOSED on those people. </p>

<p>People get shamed and judged if their ideals or lifestyle dont alight with what the church deems acceptable.  I grew up in a Christian family, I&#39;ve known Christians who are genuinely decent and accepting people, and I&#39;ve met Christians who are some of the worst people. Plus there are examples such as the Phelps family. So, yeah, there are Christians with a reputation of imposing their belief systems onto other people. There are Christians who have sex with children and their church forgives them, not to mention the Vatican probably controls more minds than any other institution in the world.  </p>

<p>Im not saying if youre Christian youre a bad person, or that Ill judge you for it.  But the religion you are a part of participates in some fucked up activity in the name of god and has most certainly developed a reputation for imposing its beliefs onto other people.  Sorry if thats a tough pill to swallow, but isn&#39;t it true?</p>
