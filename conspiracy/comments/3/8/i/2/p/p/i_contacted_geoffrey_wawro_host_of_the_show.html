       So despite looking Mr. Wawro up, and confirming via IMDB, wikipedia, Google etc etc etc that Geoffrey Wawro of the University of North Texas was indeed the same Wawro who hosted History's Business, this is the response I received from him.

       I could be completely off on this. I just want to share what I've found and hope other people join in and potentially dig a little further here.

       Just youtube search for "silverstein pull it" and you will find it. The comment about "pull it" isnt nearly as damning as what he says just after that.... that he
       <em>
        watched  wtc 7 collapse
       </em>
       ... which means he must have been looking at wtc 7 at the exact moment of collapse, which only lasted a few seconds... which makes us wonder how he had the foreknowledge to look and watch what should have been an unpredictable, unexpected collapse.

       Silverstein says that a decision was made to "pull it", and so they "pulled it" and watched the building collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       This phrase "pull it" is debated ad nausea, with the official story apologists insisting "pull it" to mean "evacuate the firemen", whereas official story skeptics insisting "pull it" is a term used in a controlled demolition.
      </p>
      <p>
       The casual observer may be confused by this debate, which is exactly why the apologists muddy the waters with less relevant debate, while deliberately ignoring the phrase "watched the building collapse" which is much less ambiguous.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, we are expected to believe that Larry Silverstein, the owner of the WTC complex, had nothing better to do that focus his eyes and his attention on WTC7 (in anticipation of what exactly?) with so much else going on that day
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the BBC reported that WTC7 collapsed 20 minutes before it actually collapsed, and then accidentally lost their 9/11 tapes because reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, the apologists insist that "breaking news causes journalists to tell lies" and that reporting WTC 7 collapsing 20 minutes before it actually collapsed isnt evidence  of foreknowledge, but rather an educated guess based on similar collapses happening in the past (nevermind that the WTC 7 situation was unique, unless WTC 7 was a controlled demolition, and therefore not unique)
      </p>
      <p>
       Tldr; Why was Lucky Larry looking at the right place at the right time unless he was anticipating something?

       Not for nothing, but to me he comes across as a doddering, dorky rich man who is clueless to the 99 % and diabolical with money and ambition. He is well connected politically on the world...stage (if you can see what I'm putting down). His wife making a 'Dermatology appt" the exact time "his WTC" got hit is more suspicious. Mind you, it is on record that he ate breakfast at Windows of the World every single morning -even Saturday &amp; Sunday- since July 2001.

       I'm sorry but I still don't understand. Why are you arguing that Larry Silverstein watching the building collapse means that he had nothing better to do? Can I assume that his comment meant that he watched it in person and not on television later? Even so, we know he was in the area. Why is it unreasonable that he would have witnessed an event at which he was present? I feel like I am missing something.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the early reporting of WTC-7 collapsing. I think it's more reasonable that it was a mistake rather than to believe the BBC was actually aware of the plot. It seems insane to think that if this was an actual conspiracy that it would be revealed to a foreign news organization for no useful purpose. It's not like the building collapsed out of the blue or unexpectedly. The news organizations already had information that the building was heavily damaged, on fire and in danger of collapse. You see news organizations and media outlets jumping the gun and getting facts wrong all the time. This time the information they reported just happened to be correct in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I see after 9 hours or so I have a handful of down votes but only one person responding to my arguments. I'd like to invite the other down voters to join in. What is so wrong with asking questions? I think my questions are very reasonable. Why would Larry Silverstein do anything other than stay in the area and continue to help with the efforts at his building. He is the one who gave the order to pull the fire fighters out and probably saved many lives doing it. Why would he do anything other than stay on site and help make sure everyone was out and far enough away from the building in case it collapsed? Why would you question him for witnessing a building collapse in front of him? It makes no sense to think someone would have had to plan the collapse of a building ahead of time to witness it's collapse. They were already watching it because of how heavily damaged it was and the fact that it was still on fire. It defies all logic to think Silverstein witnessing the collapse proves anything. In fact I think Larry Silverstein should be commended for his actions on 9/11 and not dragged through the mud.

      <p>
       To get this straight, the BBC staff didn't have time to look at the video of their own reports that day, but they did have time to scoure the airwaves for fuzzy statements from other network reports, finding one or two describing the possibility of the first ever fire-induced collapse of a tall building. They then decided to simply report those statements, repeatedly and confidently mind you, not as heresay, but as if they described an actual event that had transpired.
And 25 minutes later, voila - they became true.

       I don't think the link you posted proves what you think it does. For one the man speaking isn't indicating any suspicion of the timeline of events. Second, because this is translated from another language we cannot closely analyze the wording of his statements. The most logical interpretation of the video is that they received word of the attack and details on the condition of the buildings and the possibility that the buildings could collapse. That is why when they revived word of the collapse a few minutes later they were already aware that it could happen. If there really was some inside knowledge they possessed I doubt they would be so careless as to establish a timeline that would reveal the deception.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's perfectly plausible the BBC would have reported on something they saw on another news outlet and assumed it was the most up to date information available. It unfortunately happens all the time whenever the media reports on a crisis situation.

       I think the firefighters, who were the ones reporting those conditions, would strongly disagree.  If you have the source who predicted the first collapse and who made the call to the former Minister of Denmark please tell us.

       I don't know how the Minister of Denmark revived his information. You are the one claiming that he revived advanced knowledge. Explain who contacted him and what they told him and provide a source.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video you posted only shows that they were told the building was damaged and could collapse. That is a perfectly reasonable thing to say when you can not be sure how extensive the damage is. We don't really know what was said or how the information was communicated and that is my point. There is nothing in the video to indicate that there was any suspicious form of advanced warning. The guy talking didn't seem concerned in any way or suspicious of the timeline. I think you are grasping at straws.

       Why did you quote part of my post and then state "Except it hadn't collapsed"? It's akward and doesn't seem to fit with the part you quoted.

       So you admit you have no information or source to back up your claim. I already explained why the video you posted doesn't prove what you think it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure I understand your point about the firefighters. Just because the Prime Minister of Denmark revived word the buildings might collapse doesn't mean someone knew for 100% sure they would. I'm not sure why you are locked into thinking there must be consistency between what the Prime Minister was told and what was done with the firefighters. Remember that this was a terrorist attack and no one knew what was going to happen. It is perfectly reasonable to be worried that a building might collapse but not know for sure. I remember watching it on television as it happened discussing the possibility that the buildings would fall before they did. I'm not sure why you are so sure that nobody had any clue there would be a collapse. You seem to think they would never send firefighters into a building that was in danger of collapsing but that's just not true. As long as there are people that could possibly be rescued you will have firefighters willing to go inside to find them. Again, no one knew for sure the buildings would collapse that day but many were worried about the possibility.

       Your claim of a simple misunderstanding during the confusion is the one needing proof.  Repeating points from a BBC documentary doesn't convince anybody the BBC didn't have advance knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Advanced knowledge is in the public record What's not is who told them the buildings would fall and why the message didn't reach the people who really needed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's more? Even a cursory look at the BBC shows they're desperate to keep the coverup in place.

       I'm just saying a mistake is perfectly reasonable given the circumstances. It's the most reasonable explanation for why they reported the building had collapsed when it was still standing. Again, news agencies get stuff wrong all the time when in the middle of an on going crisis. You haven't explained why you don't see that as the most likely scenario. You also haven't explained why you think someone would have told a foreign news organization about a supposed plot to bring the building down. Why would the BBC participate in a cover up instead of revealing the whole plot to the world?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't just make bold, illogical and unlikely claims and then expect the other person to provide the evidence.

       It is unfortunately not even from memory. I came across some discussion on reddit and some other forums about someone or some group who insists Larry Silverstein did truly make damning comments about WTC7 on some thus far untraceable episode of History's Business, which was a real show that aired on History Channel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a link about the whole ordeal:

       </a>

      <p>
       I decided to pursue this to some end and that's where I am now, contacting the only connection I can find to this show, which is the host.

       I have a friend who works for the History Channel. I'll ask her if there is an archived version of the show somewhere internally. When I was in TV, we never voluntarily dumped a master copy...but at the same time, that Larry is a lucky son of a bitch.

       You did link to an IMDB page in your email. Was that just for the show or was it for the specific episode you're talking about?

       It is unfortunately not even from memory. I came across some discussion on reddit and some other forums about someone or some group who insists Larry Silverstein did truly make damning comments about WTC7 on some thus far untraceable episode of History's Business, which was a real show that aired on History Channel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a link about the whole ordeal:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2u7i4m/200_reward_elusive_historys_business_episode_with/">
        http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2u7i4m/200_reward_elusive_historys_business_episode_with/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I decided to pursue this to some end and that's where I am now, contacting the only connection I can find to this show, which is the host.
