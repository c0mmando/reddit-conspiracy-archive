       I remember a similar thing happening when Miley Cirus and the foam finger happened.  The news outlets went crazy on it for several weeks.  As a result, the Edward Snowden leaks were pretty much forgotten.

       Sorry but if you're feeling this way then maybe there's something you need to address within yourself.
being "male" isn't a power to be wielded or taken away.

       there are estrogenic chemicals in everything, while testosterone (steroids) are illegal, or obtained through doctors (but most will deny you)
      </p>
      <p>
       the truth is men have significantly less testosterone than ever before because of a variety of reasons including excessive pornography use, high sugar diets, plastic bottles, cigarettes, marijuana (yes its highly estrogenic), and more

       He kind of has a valid point though. Both sexes are being destroyed and not in some kind of benevolent "we're all humans and we're equal" way but in a way that removes the divine from us. Plastics disrupting endocrine systems, soy everywhere, porn encouraging virile dudes to waste their chi and thus their righteous fires(nofap is real ppl, I don't care how angry this makes you), breast and prostate cancer all over the place... Unusual manifestations are just a symbol and a symptom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try growing a big beard these days and you get all kinds of funny comments from it. Interviewing for a job? Shave and get a haircut. Join the army? Go to prison? Same thing. Why? Because virility has political and spiritual significance.

       Whether Jenner is or isn't distracting from bigger issues (I suspect she is, though perhaps unintentionally?), I'm incredibly tired of seeing her face plastered all across the news feed. She came out and called herself a woman while still using he/him pronouns. Now she's switched pronouns and she wears dresses now. Great job, but i could give a shit. We've known for weeks now that shes trans. Shes just dressing like it now. It's time we moved on with our lives.

       It's really big because gender roles and identity are really hot topics socially right now.
I don't think it's an intentional diversion but it could be a convenient one.
Socially, I do think it is important for the general public to accept her as she is /accept that trans people exist. AND maybe swallow the pill that gender roles are just a construct.
It's a good thing, from the cultural and social perspective; it shows we're evolving a bit.
I think the Freedom Act could use a bit more publicity though, its true.

       That proves nothing. There are plenty of trans women who still love women after then transition.
And keeping one's genitals the way they want doesn't have any standing on that.
Caitlyn is just a lesbian. That is all.

       I'm pretty progressive but I'd have a tough time calling someone who starts wearing dresses and makeup a lesbian. If you have a penis and you're putting it in women but you want to be called a lesbian... seems a little crazy. Special snowflake syndrome much?

       Just to state that a lesbian is somebody who comes from the island of lesbos. Heis a homosexual or some kind of new label with a women with male genitals attracted to a female with female genitals.

       The entire Jenner thing revolves around one thing: keeping Ryan Seacrest's bank balance as high as possible. Something like this occurs EVERY TIME that crap drops in the ratings.

       I think a lot of celebrities are used by the Media for distractions but are unaware of it because they are addicted to fame anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that this Jenner piece was carefully planned and marketed months beforehand. The question is, why so much effort? There was a huge marketing plan for this that couldn't even compare to other Kardashian campaigns. I really am tired of this shit news and it covers every media organization's front page. It is a fantastic distraction and everyone lately cares more about the distractions than things that actually impact their lives. The progression of this victim/hero narrative in the media is a joke. The notion that because you are different means you have special rights is terrible and not true. I am tired of people advocating rights that just cater to themselves.

       Well technically in a transsexual operation "
       <em>
        the penis
       </em>
       " isn't as much cut off as surgically reconstructed. A lot of effort goes in to the endeavor. Of course many people would regard this as "crazy". The point is percent wise less and less people do. No doubt the determination of the minorities to reject this process will increase over time, but that's just how things are.

       In some way it probably is. But really I think it's just a symptom of the adolescent tendencies in culture at large. I don't think some high level exec in the studio is thinking, "we've got to find something to put on the TV instead of this real piece of news." I think it's more like, "if you show someone something shocking and novel and related to sex they will be entertained by it and stay around to watch the advertising." People are goddamn animals most of the time, sometimes the real conspiracy is the one at work in our hearts, minds and genitals and is not so external and organized.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many people would really watch TV if it was an in-depth analyses of how lost and juvenile our laws and economics are, how destructive and our way of life is and how pointless its socially prescribed pursuits are? Could TV even exist as an institution if it was so critical of hyperpostmodern greedy globalism?

       I full-heartedly believe important news is manipulated and fed to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, the public has mind-numbingly stupid interests, and eat that shot up. I have to blame the people for giving a shit in the first place. The big money in media is in consumerism culture, and consumerism culture is full of gabbing woman and the guys that want to fuck them.

       Is he a distraction? No. He is part of a decades-old program to destroy American culture and American values. There were those who came before him, and there are those who will come after him. We have not quite reached the depths of perversion and decadance that those in charge of our society want us to occupy, so we will see polygamy, bestiality and pedophilia trotted out as "the new normal" in a year or two.

       Very interesting.  See, I should have thought about that, but for some reason didn't.  I was just thinking it was a distraction tactic (which it may still be in addition to eroding American values).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in your opinion, who do you think benefits from American culture/values being destroyed?  Does it make us easier to control?

       I assume it makes us more consumer driven.  If you lose your beliefs and values, you have to replace that with something.  This usually ends up with people spending money to try to fill a void in their life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I haven't really put a lot of thought into who benefits from our constant downward moral progress.  It seems like a very interesting thought.
