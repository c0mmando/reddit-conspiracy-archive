    <div class="md"><p>I work in the entertainment industry and worked on seasons 6 and 7 of KUWTK for bunim/murray the production company that makes the show and I&#39;ve witnessed some really strange things while being around the Kardashian clan. First off their whole love of God and being Christians is a total front i think cause i got really dark negative vibes from them in between filming especially from Scott Disick, Kourtney, Kris and Rob. Scott is like a cult leader in that family and his influence on the others is unreal. He is extremely obsessed with freemasonry and the whole illuminati thing. Hell he even named his son Mason. I got an incest vibe big time from certain members of the family and this creepy instagram post Scott posted and the creepy caption pretty much confirms my suspicion in my eyes</p>

<p><a href="https://instagram.com/p/3Vb-_KO3_U/">https://instagram.com/p/3Vb-_KO3_U/</a></p>

<p>All this sounds pretty crazy but i think Satanism is something they are all deep into except Bruce. He was always kept in the dark about a lot of stuff and probably still is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great reply, and looking through your Reddit history you certainly keep up with the H&#39;wood biz, so there&#39;s a good chance this is true.</p>

<p>I have felt for years the Kardashians are Satanists. The thought of them as Christians is laughable, another sick Luciferian joke. They are used as distractions whenever some dangerous information surfaces, so it makes me wonder which of the terrible events unfolding right now they&#39;re trying to distract the masses from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s different. I also believe that at different spiritual levels we can identify with both genders, all of humanity, or simply everything. There&#39;s also male and female energies that have nothing to do with genders.</p>

<p>But to physically change your appearance; having more and more broad sexual desires and materialistic desires in general? That&#39;s all fucked up and basically amounts to hedonism. It keeps the general populace occupied with shallow pursuits so they stay ignorant to the factors significantly affecting humanity (negatively or otherwise).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know man, some of these feelings we have are animalistic. I think it&#39;s crucial for one to understand the difference between animals and humans and then ask themselves which feelings make them animal and which makes them human.</p>

<p>Also should reevaluate desires to find the healthiest outlet. It may just be a perspective problem. Haven&#39;t thoroughly thought this out though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we lose our animal feels we would be less animal; if those feels aren&#39;t relevant to what makes us human then it would not make us less human. Humans are one kind of animals, so what is shared with all animals are animal traits. Traits that only humans have is what makes humans human. Maybe we should unify them maybe we shouldn&#39;t, but you didn&#39;t really provide anything that can help answer that question.<br/>
As I said, it&#39;s crucially important to first understand the difference between animals and humans and then to consider which feelings and traits are animal and human. I kind of explained the first part, what makes us different, while trying to clarify what you said.</p>

<p>Anyways, I never said that we should lose our animal feels. Like I said one thing we can do is reevaluate these animalistic desires to find the healthiest outlet, especially when the desires may be misattributed to animal traits and through a different perspective these desires can be reassigned to human traits, so to speak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh this is far from elementary, since research on this, on consciousness in general is very lacking. A lot of things I want to say are pretty subjective; like self-awareness or intellectuality or religion. Something completely unverifiable would be that we have more complex spirits or something.</p>

<p>But one significant thing that does come to mind, is the theory of mind. The Sally-Anne test to see if people understand that others have their own minds, is even seem to be lacking in autistic people. A good video that explains the topic is<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes thank you! This card basically predicted what is happening now. Also the agenda, yes. Don&#39;t forget their agenda is the new world order and the way to achieve that is blurring the lines between what&#39;s real and what&#39;s not. That is what is happening with him. They are trying to push their lgbt agenda by blurring the lines of sexuality. If you look at that old baphomet depiction its a mans body with tits. I feel bad for him honestly. I read another article that said if it was actually his own decision to do this it wouldn&#39;t be so glorified how it is. However, they are trying to push the idea onto us and that&#39;s why you see it all over now </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you should actually read up on the philosophy of hedonism, especially it&#39;s criticisms. Desensitizing yourself to pleasure makes you feel less and need more. It is bad since it propagates needless consumption at exorbitant levels.</p>

<p>As I said in the reply where I mentioned hedonism, this senseless consumption keeps the general populace occupied with shallow pursuits so they stay ignorant to the factors significantly affecting humanity. That&#39;s basically the whole point of proles so I&#39;m agreeing with your comment on how the world is as it is now. It&#39;s just that what you think is warped is actually supporting what we both agree on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe so. If you look at that card there is symbolism all over it. He was never really a main staple on that show but in the cars he is everywhere. Theres a box of wheaties with him on it under the all seeing eye which I think indicates he is their next project. Also he is trapped inside a glass tube sadly looking out at a mannequin wearing his gold medals. Which symbolizes him being trapped not able to return to the american hero he once was. Also the mannequins in pieces is commonly used as a symbol for mind control. Also the words &quot;the end&quot; and &quot;coming soon&quot; above photos of him when he one the olympics</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we lose our animal feels we would be less animal; if those feels aren&#39;t relevant to what makes us human then it would not make us less human. Humans are one kind of animals, so what is shared with all animals are animal traits. Traits that only humans have is what makes humans human. Maybe we should unify them maybe we shouldn&#39;t, but you didn&#39;t really provide anything that can help answer that question.<br/>
As I said, it&#39;s crucially important to first understand the difference between animals and humans and then to consider which feelings and traits are animal and human. I kind of explained the first part, what makes us different, while trying to clarify what you said.</p>

<p>Anyways, I never said that we should lose our animal feels. Like I said one thing we can do is reevaluate these animalistic desires to find the healthiest outlet, especially when the desires may be misattributed to animal traits and through a different perspective these desires can be reassigned to human traits, so to speak.</p>
