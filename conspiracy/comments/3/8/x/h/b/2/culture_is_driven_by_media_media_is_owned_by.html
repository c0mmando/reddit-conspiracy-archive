        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://cdn.ientry.com/sites/webpronews/article_pics/Media_consolidation.jpg">Infographic about headline</a></p>

<p>Our culture is owned by a very powerful few, it is not generated by us. Many of you know this, but it needs to be repeated again for those who are unsure or do not know. </p>

<p>This is how we are controlled, because we do not even control our own culture. </p>

<p>CNN does not deliver news, it delivers propaganda. MSNBC delivers Democrat propaganda, Fox News delivers Republican propaganda. Both have endless material of the other being idiots, because they <em>are</em> both idiots. Statist, pro-coporate, anti-american fear-mongering idiots who are all told what to say by AP and Reuters. 5 of the 6 media companies in the infographic as well as AP and Reuters are controlled by Zionists, which is a religious ideology that believes that Jews have a special right the land around Israel, which gives them justification to keep attacking Palestinians. Basically Zionism is a religious shield behind which the Israeli government hides behind while it commits atrocities. It really has nothing to do with religion or race, just with power.</p>

<p>Even TV channels that seem innocuous have an agenda simply because they&#39;re run by corporations which are profit and power-seeking entities, run by power-seeking people. BET strongly guides African-American culture by creating a culture that African-Americans see as organically African-American, but it is corporate and consumerist. Perfectly materialist. It also controls how <em>white</em> people perceive blacks in America. It does not empower them or us. It is divide and conquer, it drives a wedge between the races. Because blacks in America do not own the media, they do not own the culture. So it is corporate culture, it is consumer culture. Almost all our media is, I&#39;d guess 95%. This isn&#39;t to say it&#39;s without entertainment value, or that it isn&#39;t good drama or good comedy or what have you. This isn&#39;t about that. This is about the bias within those shows, certain ideas being unrelentingly omitted, creating a blackout of information in certain areas of knowledge in American culture. Like Noam Chomsky says, “The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum.” </p>

<p>Humans control other humans not with physical fences, but instead fences of the mind, wherein certain areas of thought are cordoned off. If we buy in to the ideologies given to us by the powerful, we end up believing these cordoned-off areas are that way for our own good and so we never explore them out of fear or &quot;respect&quot;. Christianity and many other religions are also very guilty of this. We may be afraid of talking about these ideas in public. We may be afraid of thinking them to ourselves, even in the privacy of our own minds! Who needs a physical fence when you can control what a person is afraid to think about, and therefore do? Reinforcing a culture of anti-intellectualism also strengthens this attitude, it makes people fear the cordoned-off areas more.  </p>

<p>Disney Channel, Fox News, MSNBC, HGTV, Golf Channel, ESPN. It is corporate media and therefore promotes corporate culture. There are occasional bright spots like The Simpsons or The Daily Show, but even these things are controlled to some degree by the censors and by what is needed to maintain their high paychecks. </p>

<p>Buy this, buy that. Feel bad for x (your hair, your lawn, your friends), fix it by buying y (shampoo, lawnmower, alcohol). The strategy of Problem-Reaction-Solution. Create a problem (or the appearance of one), people react in a negative way, then you sell them the solution to fix it. It&#39;s a predictable and profitable pattern of human behavior, and boy do they know it. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duCSoK4F6Dc">Create your own culture. Create your own music. Create your own YouTube channel. Share it with everyone. This is how humanity advances, by simply outgrowing corporate culture. Aren&#39;t you tired of it? I am.</a></p>

<p>Let&#39;s step outside the boundaries created for us by all this fear, and be who we want to be. Say the things we really wish to say, even if it&#39;s &quot;socially improper.&quot; The truth is powerful, and the powerful don&#39;t want us to say the truth. Too bad. I&#39;ve had enough beating around the bush. This is real life, and we only get one shot. This isn&#39;t a dress rehearsal. I&#39;m not going to spend it being afraid of reasonably stepping outside the perceived boundaries of our American corporate-owned culture. Are you? </p>

<p>but all of the huge channels that deal with history/politics are touting the party line in painfully obvious ways. For every kid interested in this stuff that has his eyes opened by the truth, there are 1000 that learn it from people like John Green and his ilk</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I think the media is based around what culture already likes, but then where it proceeds from there is driven by media. The change of culture is driven by media, perhaps that is a better way to phrase it than how I originally did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even so, I think you need to add &quot;some&quot; -- some of the change in culture is driven by media.  Media does indeed have some manipulating power but it has to avoid overextending its grip or it loses all control.  </p>

<p>E.g. the &quot;Blue Bloods&quot; tv show is pretty good drama -- well written -- but there&#39;s no way in the world a tv cop show is going to get me to declare that torture is a good thing or that we should look the other way when cops gun down unarmed citizenry. </p>

I think maybe for smarter people it has less pull, but for the masses it is literally creating for them the culture by which they live, even if that is in opposition to the ideas presented, it is still defining them. </p>

Our natural culture, which arose from our history and our racial origins, has been under an intense, sustained attack for more than half a century.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been on reddit 6 years and it didn&#39;t used to be nearly as bad like this until it became heavily corporate about 2 years ago. Divide and conquer is extremely profitable. </p>

<p>The 1.Problem-2.Reaction-3.Solution strategy requires fear to work, and fear is generated by divide and conquer, which creates both problems and reactions to those problems (white people fear black people, etc). You can get 100 &quot;us vs them&quot;s going at the same time, all intertwined (men v women, blacks v whites, atheists v religious, etc) then that&#39;s an easily controllable society because no one is unified with anyone else. </p>

<p>No unity means no people power, no power of the masses. This means the only ones with power remaining in this hyper-divided-society scenario are the people who run organizations like government or corporations, as well as those who control large amounts of physical resources like land, gold, personnel, money, or even the money-creation-ability itself. These are all resources. When banding together by mainstream society can&#39;t be accomplished, the people with these resources control the culture entirely. The only thing keeping us from banding together is fear, fear largely generated by our corporate-owned culture. They own us, but only if we are afraid. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really confounding when you stand back and look at it all. Sort of amazing in a terrible way. All these greedy interests converged, and by and large no one stopped them along the way, and here we are. </p>

<p>This shows us how important it is that we develop a world culture of distrusting the power-seeking people by default, instead of trusting them by default. This would lead to a more equal world for everyone, instead of the terrible GINI indexes we see today displaying our inequality, especially in America. CEO to lowest in-company worker pay is on average 475:1, and in many western European countries there are legal limits that make it at most 50:1 or 70:1. We need limits like these, but in order to get there we have to wake up to how much we&#39;re letting these powerful people take us (and our culture) for a ride! Someday we will, hopefully sooner rather than later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well maybe the forces your on about want to rile up racial tension to force the public to come to an opinion that apartheid is a good idea again dividing the masses further.</p>

<p>I think of myself as a race realist and from the information I&#39;ve gathered it seems to that your black population have been encouraged to be degenerates though the media. With them chimping out the rest of the world scream who will save them.</p>

<p>In comes captain government demanding just that extra bit of cash to sweep those nasty problems under the rug. Rince wash and repeat hello to the new imperial world order.</p>

<p>For gods sake you should see the shit you can be arrested for in my country.(UK)</p>

<p>But seriously if you look at the mess that world aid programmes has done to Africa it all starts to make sense.</p>

<p>By causing the natural population to swell to unsustainable levels with all this save the children crap it&#39;s infantaliased the population to levels where they don&#39;t even know how to farm properly.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all true, I agree with your ideas. I don&#39;t think we are anywhere near apartheid though. Not yet, anyway.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also an incentive in the US to make people distrust police by causing police violence by militarizing them. Then once they&#39;re not trusted, they can be federalized, which will in effect privatize them via federal contracts. The Private Military Companies and other parts of the Military-Industrial Complex are chomping at the bit to take advantage of this profit opportunity.</p>

<p>Of course it&#39;s also a &quot;jobs program&quot; to produce MRAPs and body armor and guns for police and give them for free with stipulations they must be used within 6 months or returned. So they sells arms &amp; will profit from federalization, and encourage over-use of equipment. </p>

<p>Mexico federalized their police about 4 months ago. It seems like this is the way things are headed in the US over the long-term, from what I can tell. It&#39;s too much of a profit opportunity and the Military-Industrial Complex is gonna do what it does to give themselves more power and money. It&#39;s been happening slowly, but this seems to be the trend. More militarization along with media narratives that breed distrust of police, combined with actual police incompetence, butted up against a riled-up population. It&#39;s not a good situation for anyone. The police should be demilitarized immediately if this thing is to turn around. </p>
