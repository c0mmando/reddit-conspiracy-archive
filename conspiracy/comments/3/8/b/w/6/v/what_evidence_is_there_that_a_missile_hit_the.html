       I understand the arguments for the towers being pre-weakened or rigged, and Building 7's is understandably suspect, but what evidence is there for the impact at the Pentagon being anything other than an aircraft? I see the claim a lot, but no one ever challenges it or asks for evidence. I'd like to play devils advocate and ask for some.

       The argument from conspiracy theorists was that it looked completely fabricated, there was footage of the pentagon almost immediately afterwards, claims were:
      </p>
      <p>
       1.The hole that was made in the pentagon was far too small and not indicative of what a passenger airliner would have left/done had that been what hit the pentagon.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         There was no wreckage/bodies: Asides from an almost completely intact jet engine. So the entire rest of the passenger jet vaporised on impact, not to mention the bodies of all the 'passengers' on board? Nothing but an engine is seen in the footage.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The part of the pentagon that was struck was the only section that had been reinforced against impact. Conspiracy theorists claim that this 'coincidence' surmounts to the fact that it was deliberately chosen as the location for the strike in order to mitigate damage to the structure and casualties.

       Further playing devils advocate, weren't there people in the building that got killed in the impact? I remember stories of people going in and rescuing people from the rubble when the building was on fire.

Of the 125 victims, 70 were civilians, including 47 Army employees, six Army contractors, six Navy employees, three Navy contractors, seven Defense Intelligence Agency employees, and one Office of the Secretary of Defense contractor; and 55 were members of the U.S. military, including 33 Navy sailors and 22 Army soldiers"

       not to mention it would have been factually/simply impossible for ANYONE to fly/maneuver a 757 into the Pentagon as described. (i.e., Flying a 757 so low at such speeds -- the plane would have stalled and crashed into the ground before it even hit the Pentagon).

        At least 85 videos in government possession that were confiscated have not be released despite multiple FOIA requests. Only an edited video showing a few frames of an indistinguishable object hitting the pentagon is shown to the public. If the government were telling the truth, why not release as many videos as you can to put all the naysayers to rest and make your position/case stronger? And don't say political or burecratic reasons, everyone remotely tied to the official story wants to make the "terrists did it" story as solid as possible.

        The cab driver in the famous photo showing knocked down light poles (which by the way, don't coincide with flight path models the jet would have had to have taken, and are most likely staged) has a significantly different story when he doesn't realize he's being recorded. He practically admits it's a conspiracy.

       Analysis of the physical damage to the Pentagon and lack of debris. You can’t fit a 125 foot wide Boeing 757 into a hole 16 feet wide.  The theory that the plane vaporized is idiotic.  And, what happened to the wings that allegedly sheared off?
       <br/>
       DOT
The official story of how the plane arrived at the Pentagon by making a 270 degree turn at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour is absurd.  A Boeing 757 could not possibly perform that maneuver according to experts.
       <br/>
       DOT
AA Flight 77 was lost from radar as early as 8:56 a.m. and then allegedly reappeared 36 minutes later at 9:32 am. According to Danielle O’Brien, an air traffic controller at Dulles International Airport, the plane that showed up on the radar was not Flight 77: “The speed, the maneuverability, the way that it turned, we all thought in the radar room, all of us experienced air traffic controllers, that it was a military plane.”
       <br/>
       DOT
No unknown aircraft are allowed within 50 miles of the Pentagon.  The Pentagon has its own anti-aircraft missiles that should have fired to protect the building. Only a military aircraft with a special IFF transponder (identifying it as a friend) would have been allowed to approach the Pentagon.
       <br/>
       DOT
CNN reporter on the scene shortly after the impact saying that there was no evidence of a plane hitting the Pentagon.
       <br/>
       DOT
Aerial footage showing no debris (confirming the report by the CNN reporter), plus more analysis showing the size of a Boeing 757 compared to the size of the hole in the Pentagon.  Recall also that the initial hole was only 16 feet wide and the CNN reporter said that the Pentagon structure did not collapse until about 45 minutes after impact.   DOT
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and 9/11 Commission Member Timothy Roemer both saying that a MISSILE was used on the Pentagon.
       <br/>
       DOT
Analysis of the Pentagon video footage of the alleged Boeing 757 (it certainly doesn’t look like a Boeing 757) hitting the Pentagon that concludes it was faked.
       <br/>
       DOT
A leaked video showing a missile hitting the Pentagon.
       <br/>
       DOT
Expert testimony that a high radiation reading near Pentagon indicated that a “depleted uranium warhead may have been used”
       <br/>
       DOT
Two witnesses who were at the Pentagon who said there was no debris or jet fuel, and another witness who “was convinced it was a missile. It came in so fast it sounded nothing like an airplane.” 
DOT
KEY POINT. Many people reported seeing a low-flying plane heading towards the Pentagon.  Thanks to a series of videotaped interviews with multiple witnesses by the Citizens Investigation Team, we find out that: (a) a plane did approach the Pentagon, but it was smaller than a Boeing 757, and it approached from a different angle than reported by the 9/11 commission; (b) the plane did not actually hit the Pentagon, but instead flew past the Pentagon at under 200 feet – immediately after the missile hit; (c) the downed flag poles at the Pentagon were staged, which was admitted by the taxi driver whose taxi was supposedly hit by one of the falling poles.

       Those are the most damning pieces. You might be able to explain away a few of these, but some such as the cab driver and the vaporization of the plane can't be written off.

       I've heard numerous numbers on how many surveillance videos were confiscated, they're all above 70, so I just say 70+. Three were released, none show a plane.

      <p>
       That the most highly guarded airspace in the world was attacked without any signs of defense over an hour into a terrorist attack and there are no videos of it, should be enough for most people.

       You would think, but most people are so dumb/gullible, and simultaneously don't want to hear that the government is lying to them because of the implications, that they would rather stick their heads into the sand.

       Me again? I wasn't aware I've made many comments regarding this before. As I've said before in the thread; I'm a skeptic of the missile theory, but given enough evidence I'm open to it, and there has been some pretty good evidence posted here, I will admit. Alot of the points you've posted do make sense.

       I was copy pasting from a larger list of an even greater resource of what that link is. If the best you can do is claim that some eyewitnesses saw a plane while others saw something else, and claim that 50 miles is exaggerated, this is going to be an easy win...

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Even if the 50 miles claim is exaggerated, the point is the same. No response from the pentagon AA batteries. Intentional stand down order from cheney etc.

         Eyewitness testimony is anecdotal, especially in an event like this.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Does your average eyewitness in an event like this know how to differentiate between a plane and a cruise missile when it's going 800kph?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention, multiple witnesses claimed it wasn't a plane, so in the face of conflicting reports either way, we can set this claim to neutral regardless, and look at other ones.

       I'l repeat a few key ones.

       I'm not sure if MOST is the word you are looking for considering the majority of testimony on the site you linked to was people hearing the explosion, not seeing anything. Independent documentaries that have interviewed people show conflicting reports on the subject.

       Many of your eyewitnesses that see a plane fly over them are actually seeing a second plane, not the (object) that hit the pentagon.

       Intent and location and target do NOT matter when it comes to debris that should be left behind. All that matters is mass and velocity. Plenty of planes have crashed over the decades as large or larger than the one that was supposedly flown into the pentagon on 9/11. Not a single one left behind so little debris, and not one body.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every plane crash in history (other than those that hit the ocean) leaves behind bodies, except for the pentagon, it must have some special shield or something that vaporizes organic matter on contact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, intent, and target literally mean nothing when it comes to what should be left behind. The only thing that matter is size of the aircraft, and speed, both of which are completely comparable to any other aircraft in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       The damage on the pentagon is totally inconsistent with what a plane should do as well, not to mention the missing parts.

       How can you even take yourself seriously with these strawman arguments? You know exactly what I mean, organic matter doesn't just disappear because a plane hits a building instead of a field or an ocean.

       Having DNA remains at the site, and having bodies are two completely different things. Not a single body near the lawn (not talking about bodies in the pentagon) indicates that it was likely not a plane that hit the pentagon. Most people's DNA is not on record, so identifying victims through DNA when you have no prior match is ridiculous. It's not as if family members sent in hair or skin samples to be matched. Basically the government is saying "take our word for it".

       Two-thirds of the victims were military personnel, who will certainly have previously had blood samples drawn and analyzed. Asking family members of those on the passenger manifest to provide samples would be perfectly normal.

       So on this basis, you also write off the small minority of engineers who think WTC 7 was a demolitions job as well. Glad we got that put to rest. But yet another claim, that the maneuvers "were quite impossible", is destroyed. Some pilots say that. Others disagree.

       My biggest issue with it in general is the explosion itself. It's not the kind of explosion generated by a missile. It's fireball was far too big in relation to the dust cloud for it to be a military warhead.

       Look at a photo of the external damage to the Pentagon, taken soon after impact and before the floors above collapsed. Now imagine a full-sized airliner hitting that wall at 300 mph and ask yourself "Where did the engines go?".

       Actually the angle it supposedly took was impossible, too low, there's interesting information on that from Pilots for 911 truth. The pole was staged interview with cab driver also available. The only engine found was on the front lawn not inside the building. Your still ignoring the fifteen foot hole, no airliner makes that, only a missile.

       Oh my god! Someone actually interested in the truth, thank you for you open mind. Do more research on your own you will find huge amounts of information, I recommend Architects and engineers for 911 truth and Pilots for 911 truth, they have some great information.

       close .. popular mechanics said that the plane 'turned into a sort of plasma ball ... and melted what amounts to a tunnel through the columns and finally penetrating through to E .. making that nice, small, circular hole in the outer wall'
      </p>
      <p>
       Plasma :/
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you believe that a plane hit the pentagon then you also have to believe that a plane turned into a plasma ball.  Of course you also have to believe that a huge jetliner got swallowed up by the earth in shanksville.

       Actually most airliner bodies are between 10 - 20 feet in diameter. Assuming the wings either fell off/folded in/exploded/whatever, the hole makes sense.

       The foam is the part that broke off, which resulted in the dent as it fell onto the wing. The broken off parts hitting the wing did not break off more parts until the shuttle itself exploded.

       Wow, let's just vere of into an entirely different conversation. OK there's a video of the test for that scenario and it shows the foam going through a plane hull. Even the scientists couldn't believe it, but it was all based on basic science calculations the engineers did when the observed the foam impact. Still besides the point, 120 wing span doesn't fold into a fifteen foot hole, its never happened.Just like three buildings collapsing on there own imprint without explosives, it's never happened.

       That's great. That's also not the same thing as the actual incident. It hit the wing, dented/damaged/scraped/what have you it, this in turn screwed up the thermal protection which is why it went up in flames upon re-enry.

       Its both against basic physics and has never happened. That's like saying a human can jump to the top of the empire state building , just because it hasn't happened doesn't mean it can't. If your actually interested Architects and engineers has all the physics and engineering about this. Also Pilots for 911 truth takes about this too. I'm gonna go with the experts on thus one.

       You do understand that the AE for 9/11 group is made up of less than half a percentage of all certified architects and engineers in the nation right? Arguably that means that the majority of experts reject alternate 9/11 theories.

       My grammar was correct and in since you didn't  seem to get it I was pointing out the absurdity of your argument. On AE911 where would you get that percentage? Just because they are not part of AE911 doesn't mean they disagree. Where's the group if architects who believe the NIST report , they don't have a group. AE911 held an open debate on the physics of 911, not one person from the other side showed up, where are your supporters?

       Moved on most likely. (I'd also argue that people don't take AE911 too seriously anyways and just kind of disregarded it.) 9/11 was almost 14 years ago. The lines in the sand are drawn, you either believe the official story or you don't. Most people on the official story line just don't bother anymore. It's why you don't see heated debates on JFK or the Illuminati or anything. It's been around for ages and the only people you see arguing about it are those that adhere to alternate theories and bored people on forums.

       How is that 75 feet? Where did you get that measurement from? The lack of lighting makes it nearly impossible to tell how deep it goes. Hence why I said "three feet" since that's about as far as the light goes.

       Radical assumption.  And there were no bodies on the lawn, assuming the passengers jumped out of the windows before the plane got to the Pentagon.  And they threw all the seats and luggage out too.  And removed the landing gear and one of the engines.  And all of the aluminum body, as well as the wiring.

       shills are paid by someone to say anything to someones advantage. Moron.  not exclusive to government.
       <br/>
       You know how many shills here work for the corporations? or pro-cannabis lobby? or Naturalnews.com? 911blogger.com? Ae911truth? Etc etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       come on open your eyes.  The worst on here are the pro government/pro obama ones sure.
       <br/>
       You think Monsantos competitors aren't on here, paying shills to undermine the competition? Shills work on all sides. government and 'other'.  shills are used by everyone. You work for someone, thats why you cant admit the video is fake.
       <br/>
       I'd bet that 90% of posters on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       are doing it to get paid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your video is fake if you cannot admit to that, you're being paid not to. I'm not going to waste time on a shill like you explaining why mickey mouse isnt a documentary. Jesus it doesnt even hit the same place as whatever actually did hit the pentagon.

       There were three exit holes, spaced some distance apart. The CIA has stated on record that none of the 70+ videos that they confiscated from cameras in the area show a plane hitting the building, and they still refuse to release nearly all of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ones they have released don't show a plane.

       Compare to video at 52 seconds.

       But don't get me wrong. I question whether a plane hit the pentagon. But i've seen a ton of documentaries and photos to know the difference between the impact hole and the exit hole.

       But as you can see, the exit hole makes no sense.

       You are defending the stance that it was a plane, you prove it. I've provided you with proof you ignore saying its grainy. You don't address the fact that the hole made was fifteen feet wide, not close to big enough for an airliner impact of a sixty foot wide plane.

       How is that 75 feet? Where did you get that measurement from? The lack of lighting makes it nearly impossible to tell how deep it goes. Hence why I said "three feet" since that's about as far as the light goes.

        Actually, the vast majority of independent witnesses clearly state it was a plane. Very few specify a missile [note: not saying it flew "like a missile", saying it WAS a missile]. If you're going to claim a missile, you need to explain this.

      <p>
       I'm not sure if MOST is the word you are looking for considering the majority of testimony on the site you linked to was people hearing the explosion, not seeing anything. Independent documentaries that have interviewed people show conflicting reports on the subject.
      </p>

       Many of your eyewitnesses that see a plane fly over them are actually seeing a second plane, not the (object) that hit the pentagon.

       I never claimed a missile hit the pentagon. How about you prove a plane hit the pentagon? All we have is conflicting eyewitness reports, no footage, and damage that is inconsistent with a plane crash.

        Find me other plane crashes where a plane was deliberately flown, as fast as possible, into one of the biggest buildings by floor space in the world. Then we'll see whether this is consistent or not.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Intent and location and target do NOT matter when it comes to debris that should be left behind. All that matters is mass and velocity. Plenty of planes have crashed over the decades as large or larger than the one that was supposedly flown into the pentagon on 9/11. Not a single one left behind so little debris, and not one body.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every plane crash in history (other than those that hit the ocean) leaves behind bodies, except for the pentagon, it must have some special shield or something that vaporizes organic matter on contact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, intent, and target literally mean nothing when it comes to what should be left behind. The only thing that matter is size of the aircraft, and speed, both of which are completely comparable to any other aircraft in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       The damage on the pentagon is totally inconsistent with what a plane should do as well, not to mention the missing parts.

       Your other two arguments are respectively 1) unproven, since I've already shown you a pilot saying they were perfectly possible, and 2) pure speculation, which
