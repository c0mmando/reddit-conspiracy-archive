    <div class="md"><p>Dude, arguing your beliefs with someone never works. You aren&#39;t going to convince people or Save them. Just give it a rest and let them believe what they want.</p>

<p>I suggest you educate yourself about other religions and myths before you blindly defend your own beliefs. You will find that Christianity is just as valid as any other monotheistic religion. All of them want you do bow down to some intangible being.</p>

<p>In this subreddit I don&#39;t expect to get into an argument about theology but I also don&#39;t expect bible thumpers in here complaining that their thumping wasn&#39;t effective.</p>

<p>So bravo to that subreddit for banning you.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Being an asshole in here can also result in a ban. Check out the rules on the sidebar.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t think for a second that you&#39;re triggering anyone with your shocking views: it&#39;s just a tired shtick and there&#39;s no room for discussion with your approach.  Atheists run into folks like you plenty online, and you&#39;re the worst type of person to deal with since you don&#39;t listen and are incredibly rude when expressing your naivety.  I get it, you spent some time rationalizing your beliefs: well guess what, so has everyone else, so don&#39;t think you&#39;re the only one that&#39;s ever thought about the issue and that they have ZERO idea what they&#39;re talking about.  Their sources and rationale are <em>different</em> from yours, but they have them.</p>

<p>Atheists should be allowed one space where they don&#39;t <em>have</em> to deal with folks like you: kind of like how you have church.  It&#39;s nice to have a place where you can express your views without having to defend them against ragers.</p>

<p>You have a fucking weird view of how that conversation went, dude. He said that according to the Gospel, the simple act of disbelief would send you to an eternity of Hell, and that&#39;s exactly what it says. There is also no actual physical evidence for his existence, and that&#39;s also true. He said it bluntly, but not rudely, and didn&#39;t attack anyone or mock anyone.</p>

<p>And I CERTAINLY wouldn&#39;t call what you said &quot;Nice circlejerking man but that&#39;s not true.&quot; as if you said it politely, or were even remotely correct anyway. </p>

<p>&quot;atheiest circlejerk&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;statistical bullshit, liberal circlejerking, and blatant lies&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;no idea what you&#39;re talking about&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;stop acting like you&#39;re superior&quot;</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t really come off like you seem to think it did, does it?</p>

<p>The best part to me is that you&#39;re factually incorrect. There is literally no known physical evidence of Jesus&#39; existence, even for your high horse antics and superiority complex. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t come here crying and playing the victim card. You acted like an ass, broke the subreddit&#39;s rules, were wrong anyway, and got what you deserved. It&#39;s not some conspiracy. </p>

<p>Well, Wikipedia is being a little misleading there. The &quot;vast majority of scholars who write on the subject are Christian theologians who barely qualify to be called &quot;scholars&quot;.</p>

<p>From the same wikipedia page:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>There is no physical or archaeological evidence for Jesus.</strong> All the sources we have are documentary, mainly Christian writings, such as the gospels and the purported letters of the apostles. <strong>The authenticity and reliability of these sources has been questioned by many scholars, and few events mentioned in the gospels are universally accepted.</strong></p>

<p>End of story. There is no evidence that Jesus ever existed except the writings of Christians claiming he existed, and the writings of a few others telling us what the Christians told them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course there&#39;s no physical evidence you retarded cunt. Do you expect Jesus&#39;s body to be in a perfect state thousands of years later? The numerous things written about him are enough. By your own logic Alexander the Great didn&#39;t exist because we don&#39;t have his body.</p>

<p>Let me link the image I&#39;ve already linked before (but apparently you decided to ignore it, like the weasel you are).</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/fbLqHVS.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/fbLqHVS.jpg</a>
(not to mention the Quran, which although has a differing account DOES SAY JESUS EXISTED. Contrary to what fucktards like you will say).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no evidence that Jesus ever existed except the writings of Christians claiming he existed, and the writings of a few others telling us what the Christians told them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Considering Jesus converted most of the people he interacted with (besides people like the Pharisees, which went on to write the Talmud) that&#39;s not unexpected. But let&#39;s see... the Quran and Talmud weren&#39;t inspired by Christians. Neither was Mara bar Serapion a Christian, and in fact he was much likely a Pagan, he wrote about the execution of the &quot;king of the Jews&quot;.</p>

<p>Not to mention Tacitus wasn&#39;t a Christian, and he still wrote about Pontius Pilate&#39;s execution of Jesus. But please, continue acting like you have any idea what you&#39;re talking about. I&#39;m sure your parents would be proud that you are a smarmy weasel. I&#39;m not going to waste time listing more none-Christians, there&#39;s plenty more though, if you&#39;d bother to read what I say.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You thought you&#39;d be clever by trolling atheists</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fuck off. Calling out their little circlejerk is trolling? Disagreeing is trolling? Keep throwing that buzzword around, it lets people know you&#39;re a weasel. Trolling is fishing for a reaction, not correcting retarded statements that are off-base from history.</p>

<p>Edit: I upvoted everyone who replied to this thread, even the people who called me a &quot;troll&quot; or a &quot;moron&quot; etc etc. Not because I agree with them, but because they&#39;re on topic. But hey down vote me if you want, just goes to show people on this sub don&#39;t want to be confronted with any new views.</p>

<p>The irony is, this is the last thing a &quot;True Christian&quot; would ever say.  Assuming Jesus did exist, (I have seen zero proof of his actual existence), the one thing he did say in his teachings is to &quot;Love One Another&quot;.  </p>

<p>I have read your posts.  Your words are completely un-Christian, and fairly typical of people who claim to have taken Jesus as their personal Lord and Savior.  It is a shame, really, because you are proving the people in r/atheism&#39;s point.</p>

<p>I dislike their arguments. And their repeated uses of buzzwords (&quot;waa ur a trole cuz u disagree with me&quot;</p>

<p>Just a thought experiment, if someone went up to you and said &quot;the sky has no color&quot;, do you think calling them stupid would be awful? Well, I don&#39;t think so. In the context of the quote, you&#39;re saying what they said is stupid.</p>

<p>Sure, it&#39;s mean. But if people make stupid statements, then they can expect to get stupid answers (insults). Does that mean I hate them? No. Context.</p>

<p>2 Corinthians 11:19-31King James Version (KJV)</p>

<p>19 For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.</p>

<p>20 For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.</p>

<p>21 I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.</p>

<p>22 Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.</p>

<p>23 Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.</p>

<p>24 Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.</p>

<p>25 Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;</p>

<p>26 In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;</p>

<p>27 In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</p>

<p>28 Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.</p>

<p>29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?</p>

<p>30 If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.</p>

<p>31 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.</p>

<p>Nope. But I never said it would be. We can prove <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> was a real man, without having his body. And he died before &quot;Jesus&quot; was supposedly born.</p>

<p>There is no evidence of any kind that the man called &quot;Jesus&quot; even existed, apart from writings made well after he supposedly died.</p>

<p>A book written a century after someone dies is not evidence that person existed. A statue dated to the period and identified as that person is. </p>

<p>Nothing like that exists in the case of &quot;Jesus&quot;.</p>

<p>You mean the guy that wasn&#39;t even born until decades after this so-called &quot;Jesus&quot; lived? Yeah, he told us what the Christians claimed to believe. Your point is? No one doubts that Christians claimed a guy called Christ was executed by the Romans.</p>

<p>The question is whether or not there ever was such a guy. There is nothing to prove there was. He clearly was only repeating things he had been told, because he got Pilate&#39;s title wrong, calling him a &quot;procurator&quot; when he was in fact a &quot;prefect&quot;. Official Roman records would not get that wrong, so its pretty obvious who told him that lie.</p>

<p>There <em>are</em>  things written about Jesus not a century, not 50 years, but completed in 6 A.D (and probably in the middle of being written much earlier). And that is the Babylonian Talmud, which described Jesus as a sorcerer and confirmed his miracles (it did deny he was God and said he got boiled in feces...)</p>

<p>Completely different situations. Unlike the Christian conception of God, the Graeco-Roman Gods are all regarded even by their followers as being in some sense created, springing into being, etc, and thus not &quot;ultimate.&quot; Beyond that, they don&#39;t particularly care about humanity.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3270999/Has-Biblical-city-Sodom-Monstrous-site-Jordan-matches-descriptions-area-destroyed-God.html">The Bible is also a lot more accurate in regards to history.</a></p>

<p>Yeah, you&#39;re being a weasel again. It&#39;s like if N. Korea and Canada wrote a bunch of books about Kim Jung Un, and one said he was a great leader while the other said he was a dictator. That&#39;s two sources verifying that Kim Jung Un did exist. Even if the sources have differing accounts on him.</p>

<p>There has never been any scientific proof for the theory of macro-evolution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll let Wikipedia answer you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The term &quot;macroevolution&quot; frequently arises within the context of the evolution/creation debate, usually used by creationists alleging a significant difference between the evolutionary changes observed in field and laboratory studies and the larger scale macroevolutionary changes that scientists believe to have taken thousands or millions of years to occur. They accept that evolutionary change is possible within what they call &quot;kinds&quot; (&quot;microevolution&quot;), but deny that one &quot;kind&quot; can evolve into another (&quot;macroevolution&quot;).[16] While this claim is maintained on the vagueness of the undefined, unscientific term &quot;kind&quot;, evolution of life forms beyond the species level (i.e. &quot;macroevolution&quot; by the scientific definition) has been observed multiple times under both controlled laboratory conditions and in nature.</p>

<p>Even Wikipedia is calling you an idiot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Scientists have absolutely no idea how life originated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No idea? Once again Wikipedia will set you straight...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abiogenesis (Brit.: /ˌeɪbaɪ.ɵˈdʒɛnɨsɪs/ ay-by-oh-jen-ə-siss[1] U.S. English pronunciation: /ˌeɪˌbaɪoʊˈdʒɛnᵻsɪs/),[2] or biopoiesis,[3] is the natural process of life arising from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds.[4][5][6][7] It is thought to have occurred on Earth between 3.8 and 4.1[8] billion years ago, and is studied through a combination of laboratory experiments and extrapolation from the genetic information of modern organisms in order to make reasonable conjectures about what pre-life chemical reactions may have given rise to a living system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis</a></p>

<p>They have a very good <em>idea</em> how life originated. You just don&#39;t like it. Luckily no one gives a shit what you like.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Charles Darwin&#39;s book Origin of Species does not state how species originated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it does. It clearly states that species originate from evolutionary changes in earlier species. It doesn&#39;t state where the first species came from. Big difference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Darwin&#39;s book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species</a></p>

<p>But it only makes sense if you accept that new species arise over time, rather than all being &quot;created&quot; at once by a magical sky daddy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the gaps between species have never been filled in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit. Pure fucking bullshit. Considering this is reddit, I&#39;ll use cats as an example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Feliformia (also Feloidea) is the name of a suborder within the order Carnivora consisting of &quot;cat-like&quot; carnivorans, including cats (large and small), hyenas, mongooses, civets, and related taxa. Feliformia stands in contrast to the other suborder of Carnivora, Caniformia (&quot;dog-like&quot; carnivorans).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feliformia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feliformia</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Asiatic linsang (Prionodon) is a genus comprising two species native to Southeast Asia: the banded linsang (Prionodon linsang) and the spotted linsang (Prionodon pardicolor).[4] Prionodon is considered basal to the Feliformia and a sister taxon of the Felidae.[5]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 41 known cat species (40 if the Iriomote cat is considered to be only a subspecies of the Bengal cat) in the world today are all descended from a common ancestor.[1] Cats originated in Asia and spread across continents by crossing land bridges. Testing of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA revealed that the ancient cats evolved into eight main lineages that diverged in the course of at least 10 migrations (in both directions) from continent to continent via the Bering land bridge and the Isthmus of Panama, with the Panthera genus being the oldest and the Felis genus being the youngest. About 60% of the modern cat species are estimated to have developed within the last million years.</p>

<p>We have genetic evidence of the link between two different families of animals that have &quot;cat like&quot; features. Only one of those families contains species that you would call a cat.</p>

<p>Just because you refuse to see the truth, does not mean its not true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All artist&#39;s renderings of &quot;missing links&quot; have been based on pure imagination, not any sort of fossil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And? No scientist uses &quot;artist renderings&quot; as evidence of anything. Just because some artist tried to give you a look at what a &quot;missing link&quot; might look like, that does not mean there even <em>is</em> a &quot;missing link&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evolutionists will fervently assert that evolution is a fact, but they do not even agree among themselves how it happened</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit. Why do you think Darwin is one of the most well known names in science?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The existing fossil record provides more support for species arriving suddenly and in stages </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Charles Darwin himself admitted that his theory was full of holes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>could not begin to answer the question of how life originated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He wasn&#39;t even trying. His theory was about how species evolve. Evolution is an undeniable natural process. Everything &quot;evolves&quot;. The question was, how do species &quot;evolve&quot;. His theory answered that question by saying &quot;species evolved via natural selection&quot;.</p>

<p>No scientist ever doubted that species evolved. After all what we call a dog did not exist until around 30,000 years ago, but through &quot;unnatural selection&quot; we have guided their &quot;evolution&quot; in ways that benefit us. But there is no doubt they evolved.</p>

<p>Seriously, no one that takes the word of a book written 1600 years ago should ever try to argue science. You&#39;re too stupid. Unfortunately for the rest of us you&#39;re too stupid to realise it.</p>
