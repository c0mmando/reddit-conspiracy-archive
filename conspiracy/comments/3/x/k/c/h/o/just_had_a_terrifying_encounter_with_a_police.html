        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m on mobile be forgive the typos:</p>

<p>11:30pm central time staturday night I was driving with my bother home for work. </p>

<p>A car leaving a gas station pulls out In front of me while I am going about 40mph. I have to lightly apply the brakes so as not to rear end him but that wasn&#39;t a big deal. The problem was he proceeded to go 25mph into 40. So thinking wtf I pass him.  It was a passing zone. </p>

<p>Now this is were it all starts. This guy is driving a Ford Focus hatchback. We pull to a stop light and he pulls next to me into the left hand turn lane. The light turns green so I go. He then pulls right back behind me (illegal) and begins to follow me. Riding my ass super close and making me nervous. </p>

<p>We get to my block and he still riding my ass. I turn, he turns at this point I turn to my brother and tell him to call the cops we&#39;re being followed aggressively. He was blowing stop signs and everything just to continue to ride my ass. This whole time I&#39;m driving the speed limit and using my turn signals. </p>

<p>So I double back and luckily my local police station is only about 5 minute drive from me. My brother is on the phone with dispatch explaining the situation.  While decide if this asshole wants to follow me he can follow me to the PD. </p>

<p>We get my local station with him in tow still following me. There are cops waiting for us when we get there. </p>

<p>Well, well, well it turns out he&#39;s a cop too. Tells the cops on scence I was driving aggressively and that he the was on his radio trying to get marked cars to come pull me over. </p>

<p>I explain this situation as I saw it and said I had no way of knowing he was a cop and he was following me driving crazy and made me nervous so I called the cops. </p>

<p>Now the demeanor this guy had was that of pure power. He stuck he face and badge in my window saying &quot;you&#39;re not going to win this&quot;. He was acting very high and mighty and just being a crazy ass. </p>

<p>It was at this point told me brother to start video recording.  I knew this situation had some pretty violent potential. </p>

<p>Well after running my plates and making sure I owned the car, oh yea did I  forget to mention he called my car in stolen?! The local cops come back and say it&#39;s all just a misunderstanding. Asking me if is everything cool. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a CCW holder and after asking if I had my weapon on me the left me to and wished me a merry Xmas. </p>

<p>Now this situation could of turned out so much worse it&#39;s scares the shit out of me to even think about it. Here I am being followed by a unknown person who is very clearly pissed off. </p>

<p>I shutter to think what would of happened if I had stopped anywhere but that police station.  He would of got out of his car and probably attacked me. And if I would of had my weapon I probably  my would of had it drawn at someone who is acting very much like a threat, but in this case I would be unknowingly drawing my weapon on a off duty police officer.  Let that sink in for a minute. This guy almost escalated this seemingly meaningless situation into one that could of been profoudnly life altering or even deadly. </p>

<p>We might of had a shoot out and considering I&#39;m a novice shooter he most likely would of killed me, brother, or both. And the terrifying  part is he would of got away it. </p>

<p>All Becuase he didn&#39;t like being passed on street. I followed the rules of the road. Did nothing wrong and this crazy fuck tried to escalate it into a potentially violent situation.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m still fucking wired thinking about all ways that could of ended badly for me and my family. All for nothing. Becuase he was having a bad day and ruled my passing him as a sign of aggression. </p>

<p>I suggest this to all of you right now. Get a dash cam now. Not next week. Order one and install as soon as you have the means to. </p>

<p>Being in a car is the most common place you will encounter cops. Shit I haven&#39;t even had a speeding ticket for over a year and I commute everyday and commonly go 5 of the limit. I&#39;m a hard working straight edge guy. never been convicted of crime but tonite I know for a fact I was going to either be a felon or even executed by a rogue cop if he had his way. </p>

<p>Get a dashcam NOW. It may be the only thing that proves your innocence of your ever meet a cop like I did tonite.  He wanted blood for a precieved slight and was going to use the badge as a way to enact his form of street justice. </p>

<p>So afer harassing me and calling my car In stolen and saying he was trying to get me pulled over for nothing we both walk away. </p>

<p>The local police did escort him outnifnit neighborhood and I&#39;m literally praying i never see that man again. The shit he could of got away with is fucking bone chilling to think about. All for nothing at all. Becuase he was old fuck driving 20 under the speed limit. </p>

<p>Get dashcam now. Please. </p>

<p>OP did not have his gun with him. If he had, they probably would have taken it, and found some reason to either arrest him despite his permit, or at least revoke the permit.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think any regular poster in this subreddit would seriously expect to have a better outcome than what happened here. It&#39;s not like there was anything they could/should have arrested the off-duty cop for, even though his accusations were BS according to OP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s as truthful as I could be. I never went over 45mph the entire time. I accelerated quickly twice once from a stop light and another  from a stop sign. I only did this to out some space between us he was making me nervous with how close he was tailgating me. Both times he accelerated to keep as close to my rearend as possible. So close I couldn&#39;t see his head lights. Like riding my ass super close.  </p>

<p>I used my turn signals and never went more than 2-3 mph over the posted limit. Made no sharp turns. I took him for a little bit of ride through me neighborhood just to confirm he was in fact following me. </p>

<p>Once I knew for certain he wasn&#39;t going away I called the cops and headed to my local PD. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. The right to resist unlawful arrest has been abrogated across most of America by cop happy legislators and judges.</p>

<p>There&#39;s limits to what they can legally but seriously if the department has a vendetta against you they could arrest you unlawfully, make up bullshit stories to corroborate some false allegations that you resisted, assaults them, etc., and have your ass thrown in jail rather easily. </p>

<p>Then they can proceed to turn off cameras or go behind an open door and give you a vicious beatdown. Even kill you and get away with it. &quot;He was banging his head against the wall. We had nothing to do with it.&quot;</p>

<p>Coroners and attorneys, cops, and judges are all buddies. It&#39;s sickening.</p>

<p>In the last year I&#39;ve had two friend illegally jailed. One a grandmother in a sling from should surgery. The other a father trying to enforce visitation to see his kids.</p>

<p>Granny got off with having to pay exact change for a bullshit overnight parking ticket she got when picking up grandkids few months back. Debtors prison wasn&#39;t legal last I checked.</p>

<p>Father got jailed for contempt of court for refusing to pay bullshit court fees his ex rang up fighting his lawful visitation order. Then gets his jaw broken in jail for passivley resisting (going limp) because he knew it was illegal incarceration (debtors prison.) They charged him with assaulting an officer despite the video clearly showing his face being broken in an unprompted &quot;wall stun technique&quot;. First trial ended up hung jury because they stacked the jury with a local attorney. Second trial had three extra redundant charges added on and they found him guilty of misdemeanor obstructing and resisting an officer.</p>

<p>He just got his probation revoked for refusing to answer personal questions about friends and family.</p>

<p>Fuckckkmk.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeh, well, what if I wasn&#39;t causing any trouble, nor breaking any laws, and they start trouble and then change the law on me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yup. That is how it works. Abide by the new law, hope they don&#39;t change it any more.&quot;</p>

<p>It is scary shit and you are absolutely right to worry about escalation from a person who knows that he can basically shoot you and get away with it. </p>

<p>One of my youngest memories is of a cop pulling my mother over. This was in the mid 80s. One cop drove to the station (we were in the middle of nowhere and it probably took more than an hour). The remaining cop shackled my mother&#39;s hands and feet and had her belly-down on the road. He casually kept a shotgun to her back while my sister and I, 4 and 6, watched from the back seat.</p>

<p>She checked out and it&#39;s have a nice day. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just hard to imagine that we approve as a nation of a police force which can do this. We have the highest incarceration rate in the world with the most prisoners and we have police that can hold an unarmed young lady posing no threat face-down shackled on the highway with a shotgun to her back.</p>

You can even ask for the street footage where you both were driving if there were restaurants, stores or gas stations nearby, they usually have their own CCTV footage.

    <div class="md"><p>I have had similar experiences with cops in my hometown. Two of which stand out the most. </p>

<p>1) My cousin had got into trouble with the law, his irresponsibility turned into warrants. In a regular speeding traffic violation he was yanked out his vehicle through the window and was claimed he had attempted to flee. The tow truck driver found his keys on the floorboard, and a witness of the scene said no such thing appeared to happen. Flash forward 9 months. </p>

<p>I get pulled over a few blocks from my house for 3 miles over the speed limit of 35 mph. No big deal, I was in the wrong no matter what. The officer was rude as shit about it and when he got my license and looked at the name his immediate response was &quot;huh, deja vu. You don&#39;t have any warrants do you?&quot;. I simply replied &quot;no sir&quot; amd was a bit puzzled by the whole deja vu comment because I had only known my cousin was in trouble, never knew the story behind it. When the officer came back the first thing he said was &quot;good thing you didn&#39;t try to run from me&quot; then proceeded to finish the traffic stop issuing me a speeding ticket. When I made it to my dad&#39;s house I let him know about my experience. His job is governmental (public works) but nothing in law enforcement. His response was to pick up the phone call the chief and let him know he needed to have a few words with him. In short, I was profiled because of my blood relation to someone. </p>

<p>2) Leaving my house to go to work I notice cop lights at a house nearby. I stop at the stop for an extended time to just snoop and actually see nothing concerning, just a bunch of kids in the front yard and a momma talking to the officer. Kinda take a bit longer to look still and finally decide there&#39;s nothing to see. Let off the brake and begin to drive through, about halfway through I see one of the kids lift their hand and point at my car. Nothing suspicious at the time so I just kept going. A block down I notice the cop truck turn the corner super fast with lights still lit up, at this point I knew he was coming for me because there was no other cars around, and if he was in a hurry to get somewhere else there was a much faster exit he could&#39;ve taken to get to the highway considering he would&#39;ve had to turn around to to get to me. So I pulled over at the nearest safe place I could give the officer right of way, lo and behold he pulls up behind me. I get out my information, wait on the cop to take an interestingly long time to come to the window. When he comes to my window he immediately approaches me with raised voice (radio blaring about a description of a car nothing like mine) and demands I tell him why I feel I can just speed up and down his roads and blow through stop signs. I let him know I have no idea what he&#39;s talking about. He then wants to know owns a vehicle by the description of (insert description of neighbors vehicle) and I let him know I don&#39;t and have never known a vehicle by that description. He then begins to tell me he can take me to jail right then and there if he feels like it and goes on about a big rant, then asking me where I was going. At this point I&#39;m nearing past time for me to be to work on time and let him know that if he&#39;s no going to ticket me or apprehend me he needs to call his chief or I will. He let&#39;s me go with a &quot;stern verbal warning&quot;. I talked to the chief anyways. Flash forward a month or two, I notice a cop cosistently at the end of my street during the time I leave for work on days (i work shiftwork). One of those days my window would thaw out very well so I pulled over at the church parking lot about a block down to finish scraping the ice my Hester wouldn&#39;t melt. Guess who it was? Yep, Mr jail me officer. I talked to the chief again about harrasment. Last I heard that officer is a sergeant now. </p>

<p>I&#39;d seen the comparisons to the mafia and organized crime a while ago, and damn does the shoe fit. If you describe an organization that demands payment for protection, always defends their own against outside claims of wrong-doing except when their own are calling out the organization&#39;s wrong-doing, respond to any type of disrespect with violence, exert an undue influence over municipal government, take bribes, extort civilians and businesses, etc., many people would say you&#39;re talking about the mafia, while you could just as easily be describing any city police force.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look at the history of police in this country, there are two main types of organizations that ended up becoming what are now police: slave patrols in the south and agencies such as the Pinkerton&#39;s in the north and west. The Pinkerton&#39;s and other such agencies were hired by industrialists and mine owners to put down worker strikes, and the slave patrols are kind of obvious. Police departments have always been used to protect property and owners of property, never the people. Municipalities with sheriff&#39;s are some of the few exceptions to this, but many of them are rife with corruption as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had similar stories of people following me (not off duty cops) for road rage bullshit and eventually giving up. I too am a CCW holder and always carry my weapon on me.</p>

<p>Never thought about what would happen if it was an off-duty police officer. In my state we have solid Castle / Stand Your Ground laws (explicitly for home, vehicle, and workplace). Not sure about your state but I think a jury would have a hard time finding fault if you did end up shooting this guy.</p>

<p>But yeah, dash cams are essential. Especially ones you can rotate (if pulled over).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Road rage is a real thing. I&#39;ve experienced it a couple of times myself in my life and it&#39;s pretty much irrational. I look back on those incidents and think &quot;who the fuck was that guy&quot; when it was, of course, me.</p>

<p>There is no other place in my life where I get irrationally angry to the point of almost being violent except in the car.</p>

<p>It hasn&#39;t happened in a long time and I think the reason is that I&#39;ve simply modified how I approach driving. I simply see it as a thing I am doing and not a competition. I also try to avoid things like aggressively passing someone even if they&#39;ve done something stupid. You never know when you might trigger someone. You triggered this dude and he also happened to be off duty police.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious did he ever flag you to pull over or was he just tailing?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Get dashcam now. Please. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Had some local, well recognized &quot;Super Troopers&quot; pull me over for a made up &quot;defective brake light&quot; 2 years ago, solely as an excuse to write me a ticket for an expired license at the time (can&#39;t pull someone over for an expired license when you don&#39;t know it&#39;s them or not driving the car to begin with ;) ).</p>

<p>They denied my public records request for their dashcam/body mic tape because </p>

<p>1) There was a license plate in the shot and they had privacy concerns.  It was my own license plate....no one drove by.</p>

<p>2) An &quot;undercover narcotics&quot; officers name was mentioned over their radio, and they just couldn&#39;t muster the ability to edit this out ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<p>The tickets for &quot;defective equipment&quot; and the expired license were dropped in the end without ever going to trial or anything.  But it was all in all a huge waste of my time, and an unnerving experience given their aversion to releasing the dash/body mic recording. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been recording the audio in the car and video outside ever since.  Been about 2 years now.</p>
