      <p>
       I'm on mobile be forgive the typos:
      </p>
      <p>
       11:30pm central time staturday night I was driving with my bother home for work.
      </p>
      <p>
       A car leaving a gas station pulls out In front of me while I am going about 40mph. I have to lightly apply the brakes so as not to rear end him but that wasn't a big deal. The problem was he proceeded to go 25mph into 40. So thinking wtf I pass him.  It was a passing zone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this is were it all starts. This guy is driving a Ford Focus hatchback. We pull to a stop light and he pulls next to me into the left hand turn lane. The light turns green so I go. He then pulls right back behind me (illegal) and begins to follow me. Riding my ass super close and making me nervous.
      </p>
      <p>
       We get to my block and he still riding my ass. I turn, he turns at this point I turn to my brother and tell him to call the cops we're being followed aggressively. He was blowing stop signs and everything just to continue to ride my ass. This whole time I'm driving the speed limit and using my turn signals.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I double back and luckily my local police station is only about 5 minute drive from me. My brother is on the phone with dispatch explaining the situation.  While decide if this asshole wants to follow me he can follow me to the PD.
      </p>
      <p>
       We get my local station with him in tow still following me. There are cops waiting for us when we get there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, well, well it turns out he's a cop too. Tells the cops on scence I was driving aggressively and that he the was on his radio trying to get marked cars to come pull me over.
      </p>
      <p>
       I explain this situation as I saw it and said I had no way of knowing he was a cop and he was following me driving crazy and made me nervous so I called the cops.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the demeanor this guy had was that of pure power. He stuck he face and badge in my window saying "you're not going to win this". He was acting very high and mighty and just being a crazy ass.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was at this point told me brother to start video recording.  I knew this situation had some pretty violent potential.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well after running my plates and making sure I owned the car, oh yea did I  forget to mention he called my car in stolen?! The local cops come back and say it's all just a misunderstanding. Asking me if is everything cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a CCW holder and after asking if I had my weapon on me the left me to and wished me a merry Xmas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this situation could of turned out so much worse it's scares the shit out of me to even think about it. Here I am being followed by a unknown person who is very clearly pissed off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I shutter to think what would of happened if I had stopped anywhere but that police station.  He would of got out of his car and probably attacked me. And if I would of had my weapon I probably  my would of had it drawn at someone who is acting very much like a threat, but in this case I would be unknowingly drawing my weapon on a off duty police officer.  Let that sink in for a minute. This guy almost escalated this seemingly meaningless situation into one that could of been profoudnly life altering or even deadly.
      </p>
      <p>
       We might of had a shoot out and considering I'm a novice shooter he most likely would of killed me, brother, or both. And the terrifying  part is he would of got away it.
      </p>
      <p>
       All Becuase he didn't like being passed on street. I followed the rules of the road. Did nothing wrong and this crazy fuck tried to escalate it into a potentially violent situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still fucking wired thinking about all ways that could of ended badly for me and my family. All for nothing. Becuase he was having a bad day and ruled my passing him as a sign of aggression.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest this to all of you right now. Get a dash cam now. Not next week. Order one and install as soon as you have the means to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being in a car is the most common place you will encounter cops. Shit I haven't even had a speeding ticket for over a year and I commute everyday and commonly go 5 of the limit. I'm a hard working straight edge guy. never been convicted of crime but tonite I know for a fact I was going to either be a felon or even executed by a rogue cop if he had his way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get a dashcam NOW. It may be the only thing that proves your innocence of your ever meet a cop like I did tonite.  He wanted blood for a precieved slight and was going to use the badge as a way to enact his form of street justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       So afer harassing me and calling my car In stolen and saying he was trying to get me pulled over for nothing we both walk away.
      </p>
      <p>
       The local police did escort him outnifnit neighborhood and I'm literally praying i never see that man again. The shit he could of got away with is fucking bone chilling to think about. All for nothing at all. Becuase he was old fuck driving 20 under the speed limit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get dashcam now. Please.

       Actually that ended well for OP, and was clearly his best choice. His whole post is about the probable negative outcome of most other options.

       OP did not have his gun with him. If he had, they probably would have taken it, and found some reason to either arrest him despite his permit, or at least revoke the permit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think any regular poster in this subreddit would seriously expect to have a better outcome than what happened here. It's not like there was anything they could/should have arrested the off-duty cop for, even though his accusations were BS according to OP.

       That's as truthful as I could be. I never went over 45mph the entire time. I accelerated quickly twice once from a stop light and another  from a stop sign. I only did this to out some space between us he was making me nervous with how close he was tailgating me. Both times he accelerated to keep as close to my rearend as possible. So close I couldn't see his head lights. Like riding my ass super close.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used my turn signals and never went more than 2-3 mph over the posted limit. Made no sharp turns. I took him for a little bit of ride through me neighborhood just to confirm he was in fact following me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once I knew for certain he wasn't going away I called the cops and headed to my local PD.

       Hey I'm not trying to call you out or anything but this seems like a problem with the American police force, here in the UK people aren't afraid of the police, but I guess that's because we don't have the chance to get shot.

       The UK cops being gun free defiantly reduces the chances of being killed by a cop. I bet they still dish out some beat downs though.

       Police are not gangbangers. Police are a trained paramilitary organization that is given absolute power over citizens. They can lie, steal and kill with impunity and they know it. Gangbangers are none of that.

       Depending on the neighborhood, gangbangers are at least some of that, at least some or most of the time. Police just have a trump card.

       Is the gang working for someone else, how connected is the businessman or politician.  Conversely a single cop or small group is going to find how much being a cop matters when dealing with someone working for someone powerful, probably laugh in their face as 'fellow' cops who are in pay of the powerful businessman shoots them.

       Yup. The right to resist unlawful arrest has been abrogated across most of America by cop happy legislators and judges.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's limits to what they can legally but seriously if the department has a vendetta against you they could arrest you unlawfully, make up bullshit stories to corroborate some false allegations that you resisted, assaults them, etc., and have your ass thrown in jail rather easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they can proceed to turn off cameras or go behind an open door and give you a vicious beatdown. Even kill you and get away with it. "He was banging his head against the wall. We had nothing to do with it."
      </p>
      <p>
       Coroners and attorneys, cops, and judges are all buddies. It's sickening.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the last year I've had two friend illegally jailed. One a grandmother in a sling from should surgery. The other a father trying to enforce visitation to see his kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granny got off with having to pay exact change for a bullshit overnight parking ticket she got when picking up grandkids few months back. Debtors prison wasn't legal last I checked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Father got jailed for contempt of court for refusing to pay bullshit court fees his ex rang up fighting his lawful visitation order. Then gets his jaw broken in jail for passivley resisting (going limp) because he knew it was illegal incarceration (debtors prison.) They charged him with assaulting an officer despite the video clearly showing his face being broken in an unprompted "wall stun technique". First trial ended up hung jury because they stacked the jury with a local attorney. Second trial had three extra redundant charges added on and they found him guilty of misdemeanor obstructing and resisting an officer.
      </p>
      <p>
       He just got his probation revoked for refusing to answer personal questions about friends and family.

       The Cops are most definitely the bad guys here. I grew up being beaten, harassed, and having my fast food money stolen from cops on the regular as a teen. Ever since then, I avoid cops at all cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its at a point that even if I see one driving anywhere near or behind me, if its too close to call, i'll actually pull in somewhere and wait for them to pass because there is built in fear of them from what I went through as a teen

       We're on an American website where most people are living in the United States, you just need to understand that is why you may disproportionately hear about US problems. It's the worst in central and South America anyways, you'd probably get fired for not taking enough bribes as a cop.

        what the law is

       I ordered a dash cam a few days ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is scary shit and you are absolutely right to worry about escalation from a person who knows that he can basically shoot you and get away with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of my youngest memories is of a cop pulling my mother over. This was in the mid 80s. One cop drove to the station (we were in the middle of nowhere and it probably took more than an hour). The remaining cop shackled my mother's hands and feet and had her belly-down on the road. He casually kept a shotgun to her back while my sister and I, 4 and 6, watched from the back seat.
      </p>
      <p>
       She checked out and it's have a nice day.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just hard to imagine that we approve as a nation of a police force which can do this. We have the highest incarceration rate in the world with the most prisoners and we have police that can hold an unarmed young lady posing no threat face-down shackled on the highway with a shotgun to her back.

       Stay safe OP, and report this. You can even ask for the street footage where you both were driving if there were restaurants, stores or gas stations nearby, they usually have their own CCTV footage. Find out the name of the off-duty cop as well and use time correlations in the report. There are too many encounters like this and they always end badly.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this happens again pull off into a well crowded area with lots of light and cars/people.

       I hope you have some names and badge numbers. I would write this up, postpubliclytoestablish a record of what happened and send a copy to local city council   tell them the whole sordid tail in detail. But still count on the fact that those particular cops will find a way to harass you. Document. Everything, putting it all out might seem bassackwards but  if troublemaking continues you can show what is what. Depending on where you are at, I too have seen them act like he-man on a power trip, while chasing people around. Over nothing.be safe and and document....

       Don't just send a copy. GO to your local city council meeting. Use your opportunity for public comment (they limit these to three to five minutes usually) to tell your story and after the meeting, try to talk with one of the council members or one of the police that is surely in attendance (my meetings always have 1-5 in attendance). With enough conviction, a cop might just approach you themselves after the meeting because speaking like that in public about their shameful acts embarrasses the hell out of them.

       I have had similar experiences with cops in my hometown. Two of which stand out the most.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) My cousin had got into trouble with the law, his irresponsibility turned into warrants. In a regular speeding traffic violation he was yanked out his vehicle through the window and was claimed he had attempted to flee. The tow truck driver found his keys on the floorboard, and a witness of the scene said no such thing appeared to happen. Flash forward 9 months.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get pulled over a few blocks from my house for 3 miles over the speed limit of 35 mph. No big deal, I was in the wrong no matter what. The officer was rude as shit about it and when he got my license and looked at the name his immediate response was "huh, deja vu. You don't have any warrants do you?". I simply replied "no sir" amd was a bit puzzled by the whole deja vu comment because I had only known my cousin was in trouble, never knew the story behind it. When the officer came back the first thing he said was "good thing you didn't try to run from me" then proceeded to finish the traffic stop issuing me a speeding ticket. When I made it to my dad's house I let him know about my experience. His job is governmental (public works) but nothing in law enforcement. His response was to pick up the phone call the chief and let him know he needed to have a few words with him. In short, I was profiled because of my blood relation to someone.
      </p>

       2) Leaving my house to go to work I notice cop lights at a house nearby. I stop at the stop for an extended time to just snoop and actually see nothing concerning, just a bunch of kids in the front yard and a momma talking to the officer. Kinda take a bit longer to look still and finally decide there's nothing to see. Let off the brake and begin to drive through, about halfway through I see one of the kids lift their hand and point at my car. Nothing suspicious at the time so I just kept going. A block down I notice the cop truck turn the corner super fast with lights still lit up, at this point I knew he was coming for me because there was no other cars around, and if he was in a hurry to get somewhere else there was a much faster exit he could've taken to get to the highway considering he would've had to turn around to to get to me. So I pulled over at the nearest safe place I could give the officer right of way, lo and behold he pulls up behind me. I get out my information, wait on the cop to take an interestingly long time to come to the window. When he comes to my window he immediately approaches me with raised voice (radio blaring about a description of a car nothing like mine) and demands I tell him why I feel I can just speed up and down his roads and blow through stop signs. I let him know I have no idea what he's talking about. He then wants to know owns a vehicle by the description of (insert description of neighbors vehicle) and I let him know I don't and have never known a vehicle by that description. He then begins to tell me he can take me to jail right then and there if he feels like it and goes on about a big rant, then asking me where I was going. At this point I'm nearing past time for me to be to work on time and let him know that if he's no going to ticket me or apprehend me he needs to call his chief or I will. He let's me go with a "stern verbal warning". I talked to the chief anyways. Flash forward a month or two, I notice a cop cosistently at the end of my street during the time I leave for work on days (i work shiftwork). One of those days my window would thaw out very well so I pulled over at the church parking lot about a block down to finish scraping the ice my Hester wouldn't melt. Guess who it was? Yep, Mr jail me officer. I talked to the chief again about harrasment. Last I heard that officer is a sergeant now.

       Cops employ this tactic in my area as well. For example, my uncle had a problem with DUIs, so my cousin will get pulled over a lot, even when he's not breaking any traffic laws.

       I'm reading this whiny shit about cops looking at you, and speaking loudly to you, and approaching you with a loud radio and I'm like shut the fuck up you little bitch. When we see brown and black people being executed in the streets by cops virtually on a daily basis, you have the audacity to get on here and bitch about how you didn't appreciate how you were spoken to by some fuckface of a cop. Just be glad that you're not brown or black and that you haven't been tazed or shot. And I should say that I'm assuming you're not brown or black, because the shut you're whining about is pretty much they're everyday reality. Someone who is black or brown accepts this shit as the price to pay for living.

       "As of 1 June, black Americans were more than twice as likely to be unarmed as white Americans when killed by police. At that point 32% of the 135 black people killed by police had been unarmed, compared with 15% of the 234 white people. This disparity has since shrunk, with 26% of the 248 black people and 18% of 490 white people being recorded as unarmed."  source:

       The way to handle this is to write a letter to your local police chief thanking the officers who were waiting to assist you. Don't mention the other asshole. This way someone in administration will be aware of what transpired, the cops who helped you will get some recognition, and management will be aware of the asshole.

       I remember what it was like to live in a free country.  We started losing that when Reagan was president and the War on Drugs.  When the law against false news/propaganda was repealed that signaled the beginning of the end.  Don't believe anything unless you see it for yourself and don't communicate anything you don't want repeated.

       We had a drunk driving check point on our road and after seeing vids of citizens discussing this with the police, I decided to ask one simple question.... when my turn to stop, show license, registration and proof of insurance came, while another officer shined a flashlight in the back seat looking for who knows what, I rolled down the window and said "I thought these stops were unconstitutional?"
      </p>

       They are a nationwide criminal organization. An I have heard somewhere in my life someone  referring to their badge as nickel tin. It just came to me one day. Based on that and the fact that they,kill,steal,gamble,protect drug dealers,rob drug dealers,etc. An legal extortion. I say that as someone who has worked in the restaurant industry and has had to give cops discounts of free food so the "patrol our area more". That is what the owners would say. I always hated that, they already get paid and that is their fucking job. It reminded me of the mob.

       Me either. It may be the term. I have used it on here a lot and depending on the comment it is down voted quickly. Feel free to use it. I have been trying to make it a thing for years but I do not tweet. I recently started with the TM cause someone showed me. I have always hoped to get people to think differently about the people they are supposed to trust.

       I'd seen the comparisons to the mafia and organized crime a while ago, and damn does the shoe fit. If you describe an organization that demands payment for protection, always defends their own against outside claims of wrong-doing except when their own are calling out the organization's wrong-doing, respond to any type of disrespect with violence, exert an undue influence over municipal government, take bribes, extort civilians and businesses, etc., many people would say you're talking about the mafia, while you could just as easily be describing any city police force.

       I thought the name looked familiar. But I went with it anyway. An thank you for that. That is it. The get called the biggest gang in America. Every gang has a name. An it also helps when I try to explain their influence over good cops, who mean well, but are scared to talk due to witness intimidation. I make the joke that they used to have to pay the cops to look the other way. Then they got smart, best way to beat them is become them.

       If you look at the history of police in this country, there are two main types of organizations that ended up becoming what are now police: slave patrols in the south and agencies such as the Pinkerton's in the north and west. The Pinkerton's and other such agencies were hired by industrialists and mine owners to put down worker strikes, and the slave patrols are kind of obvious. Police departments have always been used to protect property and owners of property, never the people. Municipalities with sheriff's are some of the few exceptions to this, but many of them are rife with corruption as well.

       I was thinking about something similar this morning while watching an AHC program about outlaws and the tactics they used to use to catch criminals. Often deputizing someone cause they shoot better than the person they are chasing. Again it all fits into the racket that is policing in this country.

       Wow.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had similar stories of people following me (not off duty cops) for road rage bullshit and eventually giving up. I too am a CCW holder and always carry my weapon on me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never thought about what would happen if it was an off-duty police officer. In my state we have solid Castle / Stand Your Ground laws (explicitly for home, vehicle, and workplace). Not sure about your state but I think a jury would have a hard time finding fault if you did end up shooting this guy.

       But yeah, dash cams are essential. Especially ones you can rotate (if pulled over).

       I have been pulled over four times in the last six months...three of those I really wasn't doing anything wrong...one of the times it was for a seatbelt violation which is the most fucking bullshit thing to get pulled over for. People can be going 90 in a 55 but I'll get pulled over. Btw I am a white female in a Chevy aveo. But my car does look like a lump of crap right now...(lots of dents and dings from other people) and this is the "nice part of Indianapolis."

       Road rage is a real thing. I've experienced it a couple of times myself in my life and it's pretty much irrational. I look back on those incidents and think "who the fuck was that guy" when it was, of course, me.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no other place in my life where I get irrationally angry to the point of almost being violent except in the car.
      </p>
      <p>
       It hasn't happened in a long time and I think the reason is that I've simply modified how I approach driving. I simply see it as a thing I am doing and not a competition. I also try to avoid things like aggressively passing someone even if they've done something stupid. You never know when you might trigger someone. You triggered this dude and he also happened to be off duty police.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm curious did he ever flag you to pull over or was he just tailing?

       Never flagged me just rode my ass crazy close. So close I was afraid to even touch my brakes. I figured he would just go away. When I got closer to my house I knew he wasn't going away and was waiting for me to stop. He wanted to teach me a lesson for passing him.

       I worked my ass off to accomplish the goal of getting a decent car. Maybe not everyone's taste, but I got a brand new dodge charger. Within a week of getting it one cop in particular has driven by me aggressivelyeevertime he sees me. He even tailgated me  until my turn off of the highway and blocked me off from making my turn by getting over and within a cople inches of the corner of my car so I would PIT myself if i tried to make my turn. Some people shouldn't be in law enforcement.

       This actually may have played a part. I bought a nice car as gift to myself when I first started my career. He could of seen it as me being a rich asshole who can do whatever he wants. Although I did nothing wrong he maybe saw my car and thought that I thought I was superior to him.

       Welcome to America where at least we still have the second amendment in order to shoot statist enforcement officers in the face if the need arises. You will be hunted by them afterwards, but at least you still have the tools left to fight with. Just imagine living in some other country where the basic universal human right to self defense with a gun is outlawed and only the statism enforcement officers have the guns. Imagine how much doubly fucked you would be.

       I mean what was I supposed to do?  This guy was pissed and I didn't know what else. Figured he'd calm down once he saw the PD, but no this crazy fuck was PD.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really I'm glad I did what I did. I grew up in my town and 100% positive they weren't to happy about the guy doing weird shit in they're town.
      </p>
      <p>
       They excorted him out making sure he didnt do anything crazy. That's was a big surprise to me and says a lot about what they thought of him.

       I think you made the right call. Only you know your neighborhood and your relationship with the police there. I would have done the same thing in my neighborhood, because I have no criminal record, I'm a clean cut white guy, and I am on favorable terms with all of the local police. That being said, I think everyone should use their own judgement when dealing with these types of situations. Who knows if this could have been some crazy person who actually wanted to hurt you and not just a pissed off cop who just finished a workout. Smart choice, and I'm glad you made it out safely.

       That's not true, but I agree it should be a last resort.  Certainly never call the cops on someone you care about.  This was a situation where it was the right thing to do.

       Sorry this happened to you.  I have a slightly off topic comment,  and it comes from a desire to help,  not only you but the entirety of people with carry permits.:

      <p>
       If you aren't confident enough to believe that you would likely "win" in a shootout situation. .. heck,  if you think (hope?) that every time you confront someone,  that it will result in a shootout. .. then you aren't ready to carry.

       I'm not a bad shot. But it was late, dark, and I just got off work.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can hit a target from 50 feet no problem. But I've never been in a shoutout. Andreanline is a hell of drug. Confidence kinda goes out the window at that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a responsible person. I don't want to pull my gun ever. I would of done the same if I had my weapon on me last night.  I never have thought or hoped to pull my weapon ever. I have a CCW because I don't live is the nicest area. And I commute through the south side of Chicago regularly. Ever been to the south side of Chicago?  Shit, I would rather have bullet proof car than 1000 guns when driving on the south side.
      </p>

       All I'm saying is you feel as confident as you like but until the shit hits fan it's best to avoid it.

       I had a recourse. I wasn't going to stop for some random guy following under any circumstances. There's way to many variables for that.  I wasn't going to confront this guy even if I had my weapon.

       Perfect way to solve this problem is to practice your weapons training. That way you can defend yourself and your brother if it is necessary. We are all responsible for our own lives. Don't go looking for trouble but if it finds you be prepared for it.

       Had some local, well recognized "Super Troopers" pull me over for a made up "defective brake light" 2 years ago, solely as an excuse to write me a ticket for an expired license at the time (can't pull someone over for an expired license when you don't know it's them or not driving the car to begin with ;) ).
      </p>
      <p>
       They denied my public records request for their dashcam/body mic tape because
      </p>
      <p>
       1) There was a license plate in the shot and they had privacy concerns.  It was my own license plate....no one drove by.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) An "undercover narcotics" officers name was mentioned over their radio, and they just couldn't muster the ability to edit this out ¯_(ツ)_/¯
      </p>
      <p>
       The tickets for "defective equipment" and the expired license were dropped in the end without ever going to trial or anything.  But it was all in all a huge waste of my time, and an unnerving experience given their aversion to releasing the dash/body mic recording.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been recording the audio in the car and video outside ever since.  Been about 2 years now.

       Also, in russia there was (is?) an epidemic of crazy drunk bastards throwing themselves on your hood and then claiming that they will need X amount of Putin-bucks to heal without making this a big legal nightmare... I think the cams cut down on this, but you still occasionally see it in the thousands of hours of excellent footage on youtube; some big drunk fuck just lazily hucking himself up on the hood of a car that had already stopped!

       in would have driven home pulled in my drive way and if he followed i would then have warned him about being armed in my state if there is time thats what you are supposed to do.  if he parked out front or followed you in your drive you have the legal right to display your weapon at that point...there is no way to have known he was a cop   you would be within your rights to do so.

       Also: It's illegal to use a LEGAL NAME. You are committing fraud if you claim to be or to own the name on a birth certificate - because you are not that and don't own it. It is CROWN CORPORATION property. Original fraud siGn is on them and the buck passed on to you, if you consent to it. Cops asking for the name are aiding and abetting fraud.

       Depends on how serious one is to stand in the truth of who you really are. Dead thing or living being. It's your choice. "It's illegal to use a legal name. Have a nice day" - a lot of knowledge and good intent boils down to that simple statement of truth.

       It's extremely difficult to read with a bunch of grammar/spelling mistakes. It slows me down considerably, so I had to spend extra time absorbing the information. It may not have bothered a slow reader like you, but other people can read considerably faster and this is what slows them down. Have some courtesy and write correctly.

       Don't just send a copy. GO to your local city council meeting. Use your opportunity for public comment (they limit these to three to five minutes usually) to tell your story and after the meeting, try to talk with one of the council members or one of the police that is surely in attendance (my meetings always have 1-5 in attendance). With enough conviction, a cop might just approach you themselves after the meeting because speaking like that in public about their shameful acts embarrasses the hell out of them.

       I'm a responsible person. I don't want to pull my gun ever. I would of done the same if I had my weapon on me last night.  I never have thought or hoped to pull my weapon ever. I have a CCW because I don't live is the nicest area. And I commute through the south side of Chicago regularly. Ever been to the south side of Chicago?  Shit, I would rather have bullet proof car than 1000 guns when driving on the south side.

       All I'm saying is you feel as confident as you like but until the shit hits fan it's best to avoid it.

       The UK cops being gun free defiantly reduces the chances of being killed by a cop. I bet they still dish out some beat downs though.

       Meanwhile there is no one to defend you while a muzzie cultist stabs you and slowly saws your head off with a dull rusty butcher knife in broad daylight in a busy city in the middle of the road while the LibCucks stand around filming on their iPhones.
