       I still don't get the big deal about oil being priced in dollars. If you need to pay in dollars for something, you just buy dollars with your own currency, and then you use it to buy the oil. So how does that benefit the US or have anything to do with the dollar being stable? I feel like I'm so close to understanding this, but it's not clicking.﻿
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does OPEC give the dollars it makes from oil to the federal reserve? That just seems like the US puts a gun to their head and says "We could take your oil by force, or you can just give us the profit." So then it's not really that oil is priced in dollars, it's that the US steals oil profits from OPEC. Right? Or what am I missing?﻿

       The more people who have to buy and keep dollars, the greater the value of the dollar, and hence the greater power of the US.  If people don't want dollars anymore, the value goes down, think along the lines of share prices, the more people who want a particular share, the more it's value goes up.  If we all had to buy oil with McDonalds shares, McDonalds shares would go up to an incredible price.

       So it makes the US dollar valuable because oil is valuable? Isn't the dollar already valuable because it's the currency that 350m people do business with?

       There was a middle eastern chap by the name of Gaddafi, you may have heard of him.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was in the process of creating a gold backed currency, the dinar, to be used to sell and buy oil with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly it didn't quite go to plan. You see the US dollar has no real value. Gaddafi knew this and intended to prove it.

       That's another thing.  The Euro along with the US dollar, the British pound and the Japanese Yen are all part of some Special Drawing Rights agreement controlled by the IMF.  So essentially all those currencies are managed by the same cartel.  China is joining that bundle of currencies

       so really there already is just one world currency.  my opinion is that the SDR mechanism is just there to ease the transition to the Chinese Yuan as the world's reserve currency.

       Here is a very easy way to understand it. Without gold our money has no value (not that gold has any value) so we had to find something to replace gold which was oil. Now if all the countries are selling oil in their currency then all currents have equal standing in the world. If a country controls what the oil is sold in their money immediately has more value.

       I see, so while before the dollar was redeemable for gold, now it's redeemable for oil. In a way...
      </p>
      <p>
       But something else I don't get is, what makes a country's currency valuable or not. Like, if say oil was no longer traded using dollars, how does that alter the value of the dollar that's in my pocket right now? Seems like the economy would just continue on as usual. I could go buy bread, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't get why it's so catastrophic for the US.

       Well the value of the dollar would lose all credibility at that point. I understand your confusion about how it is connects and it goes a little like this. Currencies have always needed a way to be legitimized whether that be through killing or precious metals or oil. One of the fist examples of a paper currency was from Genghis Khan and he literally just killed people if they didn't use his currency. Without Genghis Kahn going around and murdering people his currency losses ALL of its legitimacy. When the oil bubble pops all of that money I'm your pocket losses it's legitimacy on an international level, you will still be able to use your dollars locally but inflation will make everything cost more.

       Supply and demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       To keep up with the current demand, they have created trillions of dollars out of thin air.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people stop using those dollars, what do you think happens to them? Suddenly you have a huge amount of supply and very little demand. So where you used to be able to give someone one dollar for a product, now they are asking for two, or ten, because they don't want it either.
      </p>
      <p>
       The end result is the value of every dollar plummets.

       Okay thank you. I paused the video to ask you a question that I hope you can answer. When they say international commodity, does that include all goods traded between the participating countries? I thought this was just about oil, but oil isn't the only commodity. Cars are commodities, right? But that would mean that Japan would have to sell its cars to Germany, let's say, in US dollars. And that seems weird. But is that what's going on?

       The US dollar was chosen to be the currency used to buy oil. Every nation needs to buy oil, so they acquire US dollars to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they also want to buy wheat, but they already have US dollars. Why change to another currency?
      </p>
      <p>
       So international transactions are carried out in the currency everyone is holding to buy oil, simply because it is more convenient than trading in multiple different currencies with different values.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing being missed is that one of things important for such a trading currency is stability. A company needs to know that the currency they are paid will have pretty much the same value a week later, otherwise the risk of trading in that currency goes up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say I buy a car off you. You want $1,000. I give you that $1,000 dollars, but by the time you come to spend it, it only has the value that $500 dollars had when I gave it to you. You would lose half the value of the transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we're talking about trillions of dollars being traded, stability is one of the most important features.

       Pricing oil in dollars spreads the risk associated with the dollar to every nation in the world, since they are required to hold dollars to trade oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Canada were to make a trillion dollars materialize, all that it would do is drive down the value of each dollar in existence. Canada's purchasing power from each dollar would decrease.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when the US prints $19 trillion, the burden is spread to all nations. Sometimes directly, for example when China owns $2 trillion in US bonds, they don't want to see the value of those bonds drop in relation to the excess cash printed.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have two choices: 1. reflect the new value of the US dollar and lose out on the bonds they hold and make their products more expensive by using the real new value of the US dollar or 2. get less for their products but maintain the rate of sales by acting as if the US is good for the money.
      </p>
      <p>
       China has done the latter, while making direct currency swaps with their key trading partners. By having direct currency swaps, they by-pass the dollar. This means they are able to devalue the dollar without worldwide losses (since all currencies are tied to the dollar, devaluing the dollar would raise their prices for all countries, not just the US).
      </p>
      <p>
       Take it a step further and remove the petrodollar. Now when the US prints more currency, it is only added to the US purchasing power. It doesn't devalue the purchasing power of all nations pegged to the dollar since they are holding large reserves. Now only the US feels the diminished return of newly printed money. It becomes like Canada or any other country that is printing money they don't have. The burden is no longer shared.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now China only faces the loss of US customers when the US prints new money. It doesn't worry about the global market loss. Instead of lowering their product's value, they only raise the prices to US customers and accept the loss of sales on a small number of products sold to the US and maintain the sales to other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US also loses other economic weapons, such as printing money they don't have and lending it to ________ in exchange for the privatization of their industries, lucrative US contracts and securing the nations resources as collateral.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently if ________ receives $50 b in loans from the US, then that value is spread among all the dollars held by all the countries in the world. It's not reflective of the value of the US economy, but of the world's economy. The country could trade directly with any country and the value is close to what the loan was, $50b.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the US isn't the reserve currency, then printing $50b and increasing the money supply decreases the value of each dollar only in regards to the total supply held by the US. That is: the US goes from circulating, for example $1 trillion to $1050 billion. The value of the dollar for Americans and for ______ drops by nearly 5%.
      </p>
      <p>
       If every country in the world has $50b in reserves, then the total US dollar supply goes from $1 trillion in the US, plus $50b in every country x 180 countries plus the $50b of newly printed money.
      </p>
      <p>
       that goes from $10 trillion to $10050 billion, or decreases the value of all by 0.5%.

       So say I'm Japan, and I want to buy oil from an OPEC country, so that means I need US dollars. Can't I just buy dollars using yen, and then go buy the oil?
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if the value of the dollar went down in relation to the yen, that just means that I'll get more dollars for my yen when I go to exchange it, and I can still buy the oil.

      <p>
       No. Edit: Sorry, misunderstood your question. Yes, you can buy USD using yen. But that adds demand to the USD and middlemen costs of purchasing USD plus drives up the demand for USD.

       Not if you are already holding hundreds of billions in US dollars. Not if all your exports are already pegged to the dollar.

      <p>
       Oil "greases the wheels" of all industry. Not only are many raw materials made of oil, but processes to make raw materials need oil, transport, shipping, packaging, and your countries economy are tied to oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the Mafia infiltrated the clothing market in New York, they took over the labelling of clothes. All clothes sold need labels. By adding a dollar to the cost of labelling, they were able to spread that cost over the entire clothing market.
      </p>
      <p>
       By pricing in oil in US dollars, you are able to spread the amount of US dollars around the world and increase the price of every sector along the way as well as increase the overall number and requirement for US dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Japanese companies manufacture in China, they used to have to go yen to Us dollar to RMB. And then all the processes of manufacturing had to do the same. Then when they sell the products, it goes from RMB to USD and then back to yen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The USD becomes the middleman, getting commission and spreading the demand of USD.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then Japan went to direct currency swaps with China. They go yen to RMB, but since the USD is the world reserve currency, they still sell as RMB to USD to yen and their processes of manufacture still require demand for USD.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are limiting the middleman, but not by much and the demand for USD is still there, with the commissions.

       By being the currency used to trade in oil, you force everyone to use USD. Since everyone is already using USD, it becomes the de facto world reserve currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine oil continues to be traded in USD but a different currency becomes the world's reserve. In this situation, you have to hold USD for your oil, but can't use it on the world market for other things. That means constantly trading USD for the world's reserve currency, losing at each exchange but needing both.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would add further costs and complications. What countries have done, with key trading partners, they have agreed to direct swaps. They say, each year there will be $50b that we recognize you have to trade in our currency. This $50b can be traded as if it exists without materializing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That enables both countries to have the USD needed for oil and doesn't require them to trade in USD when doing trading for goods directly.
      </p>
      <p>
       That limits middlemen and direct demand for USD.

       The game is inherently unsustainable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine yourself as the head of this giant pyramid scheme that allows you to take a cut off of every transaction in the world, allows you to print massive amounts of money and distribute amongst a select few (The Fed handed out over $16t in loans while the markets were at rock bottom prices in and around the 2008 collapse). You can only do this if you can bottleneck an essential industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oil has been made into an essential commodity by blocking any competitors for a very long time. The more you develop the use of oil and block the development of competitors, the more effective oil becomes while the competitors lag behind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now everyone needs oil for everything. You have bottlenecked it if you can get some cash off all of it. By making it tradeable in US dollars only, you are able to not just get cash out of every single drop, you are also able to print $16t and buy up the world's economic output on the cheap.
      </p>

       What wouldn't you do for this power?
      </p>

       What would be some threats?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some threats would be some countries not following the practice and succeeding because of it. You send them into oblivion and enrich your military while doing it and drive up the demand for oil. win win win.

       Hemp is a threat. It provides a resource that can be grown worldwide and provides an abundant amount of material that can replace oil directly and indirectly. Hemp was outlawed and put into international treaties bringing its production nearly to a halt worldwide, prohibiting development of it and it's uses.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will also need friendly representatives in the major oil producing countries. The CIA helped put in the leaders of Iran, Iraq, and many other countries. Saudi was already friendly and willing to play ball.

       Energy is by far the most important consideration in human existence. By determining the method of attaining energy and control over that energy, you are able to dictate the levels of human existence.

       You are able to head a giant pyramid scheme.

       But the House of Saud is a minor threat. Place them high enough up on the pyramid and they will be content.

       A major threat is thorium. It's widely available. If developed, it could be a way for any country to access energy far beyond what they currently can without a middleman. Anyone could develop it and bring its cost down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Energy would cease to provide a platform where every single transaction enables a few to profit off the worlds labour and print the equivalent in currency to buy up the world's production with no risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, you will not hear about thorium and when you do, you will hear instantly people saying how it's not feasible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is quite different:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Very little money has gone into researching it and it has still proven usable.
      </p>
      <p>
       But thorium is just one example. There are hundreds. Look into the history of competitors that have been bought up to be closed down.

       I'm still a little confused, then, what about energy from uranium reactors? Why wouldn't a country like Australia with lots of uranium reserves use purely nuclear power if it allows them to circumvent the US's pyramid scheme?

       Uranium is riddled with problems. Meltdowns, nukes, few reserves, long-lived waste issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last I checked, the world has 30-40 years worth of uranium based nuclear power at current use. Thorium's reserve give the world a thousand years of power, no meltdowns, no nukes, and less harmful waste.
      </p>
      <p>
       A power source that is relatively problem free and is good for the next thousand years is much more of a threat than uranium.

       Do you think if that "nuclear" was thorium, it would be treated differently than a nuke?

       India had a thorium reactor designed and ready to go, but decided it would be better to maximize profit from existing resources, or in common speech, allow the energy giants to make their profit.

       Besides the massive military, oil is the only thing keeping the dollar valuable. I thnk the more interesting question is how and why did the Dollar make it to the place as the World's reserve currency? What currency did it replace and why? How many world reserve currencies has there been? Finding these things out will help with your question.

       I've often said the only thing that's backing the dollar is us (the military), because at the end of the day that's how they're keeping everyone else in line by sending us in to make public examples out of these leaders. Leaders we more than likely put there to begin with.

       It has the same effect as Import/exports on the exchange rate. If all oil is sold in USd, for the exchange rate, it is as if US was exporting all the oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can therefore afford to import a lot of real stuff in exchange for FIAT. Because others are giving oil in exchange for FIAT. Except OPEC keeps the fiat profit. But US can just type it or print it.

      <p>
       with 33,327,700 bbl/day form OPEC x 100$ x 365= 1.22 trillion USD/year.
If Oil exporters then spend the USD, it should cancel out.

       Except, the usd is not spent, there are massive reserves of inannimate USD. If the US reserve status is lost, those USDs will no longer have reaosn to be kept as reserves and will blow up the GP=MV. The common man's bank account sets the common man's cash. Its marketing. This means that if rich people can trade new currency between themselves in the financial sector they can diminish their price increasing impact on the real economy. What affects prices in the real economy is the circulation in the real economy. When the economy slows, the number of transaction diminish and therefore velocity drops. This drop in velocity brings a diminishiment of goods but brings also price reduction. 66% price reduction, this price reduction kicks the economy back up. This is how the 1920 crash corrected.
The Statists created a bubble (caused the crash), inflated the currency supply with 'stimulus' (prevented prices from falling to allow recovery) and diminished credit supply. Tldr, caused a long ass statist created depression and then used it to blame freeodm and offer statism as the solution. You can even find the central bankers laugh about it in their transcript -fed

       A monopoly of force can break anything. Considering worker productivity and advances, costs should be lower and you would work less. That is the natural course, not the statist in the bag edition.
