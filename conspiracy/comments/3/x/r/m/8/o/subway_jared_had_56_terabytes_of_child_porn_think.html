       Surely, the huge volume of porn in his possession suggests that he is just one person in a vast network. Shouldn't there have been a huge investigation into where he obtained the material from and who he shared it with?? We live in the surveillance era. They should be able to quickly pull up several of Jared's accomplices by going through his cell and electronic data. But you won't hear about any of that from the media. Think about that.... Consider the horrifying implications. This is the world we live in.

       Agreed. That amount just seems unreasonable and untenable for even somewhat advanced users. Where did he store all this? Did he have an array of hard drives hooked up to a network access storage just downloading and saving gigabyte after gigabyte?

       Storing 5.6 TB is very easy to do. Have a look at

       Those guys will laugh at this puny 5.6 TB.

       A cheapish 4 bay NAS with 4 * 4 TB drives which holds 8 TB of data in a mirrored RAID configuration can be built for less than 1500$.

       Yeah, it's pretty easy. I just use external USB drives and have almost 13Tb. The content though is problematic. I find it pretty fucking stupendous you could have 5.6Tb of just child porn. I wouldn't even have that in TV shows, which is probably my biggest collection. We're talking thousands of individual episodes there. Unless these videos are all in massively high quality (which I highly doubt), I wouldn't have that there was that much content available. Might just be naivety though I guess.

       We're not talking about home videos. I'm pretty sure there are child pornagraphy rings in developing nations that pump out hundreds of movies a year. In particular South East Asia and Eastern Europe have a big problem with this. He probably just found large databases containing a huge volume of the stuff, and downloaded them in their entirety from a safe location to sort through on his own at home off the internet.

       Exactly, this is what I'm getting at. Hardly requires NASA-level technology but just seems entirely excessive and absurd.

      <p>
       Maybe the guy was an idiot and did but I find it suspicious. Also, we've already established the guy is into CP, so why do we need this extra info a bit after the bombshell? Seems like a way to defame him even further or push some kind of agenda.

       You know how they say liars often add extraneous details because they're full of shit and want to make it seem credible? I'm getting that feeling here with the ~6TB claims.

       Next thing they'll say is it was encrypted and we can't have encryption cause it hurts the investigation.

       No one downloads porn. I know 1 person off the top of my head that actually downloads porn onto a computer and it was like 3 movies. 
I don't know the number of people that look at child porn but I bet it's a pretty fucking low number.  Now 8 TB and the fact that it's a "celeb" makes me kinda suspicious. Yea, its only Jared but still.... 8 TB? What's this guys background?

       Most normal people do not download porn because they don't have to. Normal porn is readily available on 100s of streaming websites. But people who are into child porn can not just go to a random website and stream some stuff. Instead they have to go to same hkdden website in the darknet and hunt for new stuff. Because of this it is not surprising that those peope tend to download much more than normal people.

       I'm not saying it is impossible, very aware that storage is cheap and easy. However the level of effort to store that isn't just a casual user.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, it doesn't take a computer scientist but I'm saying it's a suspiciously high amount. It could be legit and the guy is pretty fucked up. I'm just trying to fathom why the guy would even care to store that much.
      </p>
      <p>
       He knew it was illegal and everyone knows CP is a no-go. To go and store that much of it (likely amongst several drives) is just stupid. It just seems excessive.

        Taylor pleaded guilty Thursday to 12 counts of
        <strong>
         producing
        </strong>
        child pornography and one count of distributing it, and then begged for leniency, holding back tears. He apologized to his victims and asked the judge to "not allow me to rot in the landfill of lost souls" with a lengthy prison term.
       </p>
       <p>
        ...
       </p>
       <p>
        Fogle was sentenced to more than 15 years in prison last month on child pornography and sex crime charges, including paying to have sex with minors. Investigators say Taylor secretly recorded images of 12 children, ages 9 to 15, in his home, and then shared the images with Fogle.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prosecutors last week recommended 35 years, saying Taylor's actions "greatly impacted the lives of 12 children and their families." The minimum sentence under federal law is 15 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        In court documents, Taylor admitted to using hidden cameras to produce child porn.
       </p>
       <p>
        He said it started by accident when a security camera captured a sexual encounter in his home office, The Associated Press reported. After telling Fogle about the accidental tape, he said the Subway spokesman encouraged him to hide cameras in other areas where "minors would be when either changing clothes or undressing to shower or bathe," according to the court documents.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On Nov. 3, 2012, Fogle allegedly paid a 17-year-old girl who he had found online to engage in sex acts while he was staying at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, according to the papers. Several months later, he again paid her for sex acts while staying at the Ritz Carlton Hotel, according to the documents, which says the girl told Fogle her age when they first met and that he knew she was a minor.
       </p>
       <p>
        After the first meeting, the documents said, Fogle texted the girl and offered to pay her a fee if she could find him another underage girl to pay for sex acts.
       </p>
       <p>
        During these discussions, Fogle "stated that he would accept a 16-year-old girl, while stating that the younger the girl, the better," the documents said.
       </p>
       <p>
        Between 2011 and 2013, Fogle also repeatedly sent text messages to other escorts, "soliciting them to provide him with access to minors as young as 14 to 15 years," the documents said, adding that he would only make such requests after engaging in sex acts with the escorts to "insure that they were not undercover police officers."
       </p>
       <p>
        The documents also alleged that Fogle on multiple occasions received sexually explicit images and videos produced by Russell Taylor, 43, who ran the charitable Jared Foundation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two months before Fogle's home was raided, authorities arrested Taylor on seven counts of production of child pornography and one count of possession of child pornography. Investigators said they discovered a cache of sexually explicit photos and videos Taylor allegedly produced by secretly filming minor children at his home.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prosecutors also allege that Fogle received from Taylor multiple images and videos, some of which were taken by a video camera hidden in a clock radio that filmed children changing clothes or bathing. Some were taken in buildings were Taylor lived.
       </p>
       <p>
        The documents said Fogle knew those depicted were minors, some as young as 13 or 14 years old, and in some cases knew the minors involved by name and had met them "during social events in Indiana."
       </p>
       <p>
        In other cases, the documents said, Taylor allegedly obtained sexually explicit images taken by others outside the U.S., including videos of children around age 6, and shared them with Fogle.

       I don't understand child pornography. From a purely sexual point a view a little girl or boy looks pretty much like a small hairless man. So I don't quite get the psychology of it to begin with. But more than that, how in the hell does one deal in this stuff? What do you do, just walk up to the water cooler at work and say, "Hey man, want to look at some naked children being sexually exploited?" I mean don't you
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       you are going to get caught? The vast majority of people despise that shit. And who makes that shit to begin with? I don't know about you but every kid I've ever met doesn't stop running their mouth. I don't see how anyone can get away with it... well, unless the poor kid has some really fucked up parents, but how many of those can there possibly be? But even so, where do people get the pics? You can't just search "child porn" on Google and up it pops. I always hear people say its on the "dark web". Well I did some bit-torrent searches just to see what would turn up, and again nothing. And yet every other week there is another big bust of someone with a shit ton of child porn on their computer. None of it makes much sense to me.

       The global elite pedo ring theory is one conspiracy I can believe actually exists.  I can't wrap my head around it.  Once someone becomes extremely wealthy/powerful, do they just go "Welp, time to start fucking kids i guess!"

       This
       <sup>
        ...
       </sup>
       My theory is this, when you have endless(basically) money and power, what do you do? In your free time? Your ego and soul get so big and twisted from no one ever saying no to you, what do you do? You could have 100 of the most beautiful women brought in so they can suck on your nuts all day.. Boring... I could have people killed for fun, but unless you're a psychopath (which I'm sure a lot of the big powerful people are) killing is usually just done as part of the job( no fun) so you start deriving  pleasure from illegal things because the rush.. But you keep on doing increasingly more twisted shit because you get used  those things... Powerful pedos most likely have giant orgies where everyone gets their free 7-10 year old of choice.. Really scary stuff man :/

       Nothing. Pedophiles are born that way, they don't have a choice. Just like homosexuals. Rich and powerful pedophiles can get away with it so they do.

       There isn't a doubt. Every time they grab one of them, these bastards start singing. The sophistication and the lengths these guys go to just because they know these things will happen is just insane.

       There were questions about the length of Jerrod's prison term because of the severity of his offences. Hopefully he folded faster than superman on laundry day. You'd hope he turned over as much current and valid information as he could to help them. By the public time line it was probably his buisness partner who turned him over within seconds of being cuffed.

       Although I suppose it could be argued that old media figures were a necessary sacrifice to shield high government. I don't necessarily disagree and do find the Franklin coverup theories compelling. Despite the fact that Johnny Gosch's mom may just be mentally ill, something was up with Jeff Gannon.

       Jared was probably set up. Maybe the 5.6 terabytes of that material was just for effect in the mainstream media. I do wonder what could have been that Jared was doing. Maybe it was a way to target even the Subway business. I do not know given the community here and others, and events over the years I do not rely on the MSM.

       There were questions about the length of Jerrod's prison term because of the severity of his offences. Hopefully he folded faster than superman on laundry day. You'd hope he turned over as much current and valid information as he could to help them. By the public time line it was probably his buisness partner who turned him over within seconds of being cuffed.
