    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s pretty easy. I just use external USB drives and have almost 13Tb. The content though is problematic. I find it pretty fucking stupendous you could have 5.6Tb of just child porn. I wouldn&#39;t even have that in TV shows, which is probably my biggest collection. We&#39;re talking thousands of individual episodes there. Unless these videos are all in massively high quality (which I highly doubt), I wouldn&#39;t have that there was that much content available.

<p>Yeah, that is the fucked up thing. How large is a normal DVD rip? Around 1 gb? This means he could have had 560 full length movies which contains nothing but child porn. wtf? </p>

<p>We&#39;re not talking about home videos. I&#39;m pretty sure there are child pornagraphy rings in developing nations that pump out hundreds of movies a year. In particular South East Asia and Eastern Europe have a big problem with this.

<p>You know how they say liars often add extraneous details because they&#39;re full of shit and want to make it seem credible? I&#39;m getting that feeling here with the ~6TB claims.</p>

<p>Most normal people do not download porn because they don&#39;t have to. Normal porn is readily available on 100s of streaming websites. But people who are into child porn can not just go to a random website and stream some stuff. Instead they have to go to same hkdden website in the darknet and hunt for new stuff. Because of this it is not surprising that those peope tend to download much more than normal people.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/russell-taylor-cohort-ex-subway-pitchman-jared-fogle-gets-27-n477741">http://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/russell-taylor-cohort-ex-subway-pitchman-jared-fogle-gets-27-n477741</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>...</p>

<p>Taylor pleaded guilty Thursday to 12 counts of <strong>producing</strong> child pornography and one count of distributing it, and then begged for leniency, holding back tears. He apologized to his victims and asked the judge to &quot;not allow me to rot in the landfill of lost souls&quot; with a lengthy prison term.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Fogle was sentenced to more than 15 years in prison last month on child pornography and sex crime charges, including paying to have sex with minors. Investigators say Taylor secretly recorded images of 12 children, ages 9 to 15, in his home, and then shared the images with Fogle.</p>

<p>Prosecutors last week recommended 35 years, saying Taylor&#39;s actions &quot;greatly impacted the lives of 12 children and their families.&quot; The minimum sentence under federal law is 15 years.</p>

<p>In court documents, Taylor admitted to using hidden cameras to produce child porn.</p>

<p>He said it started by accident when a security camera captured a sexual encounter in his home office, The Associated Press reported. After telling Fogle about the accidental tape, he said the Subway spokesman encouraged him to hide cameras in other areas where &quot;minors would be when either changing clothes or undressing to shower or bathe,&quot; according to the court documents.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.wabe.org/post/fogle-plead-guilty-sex-acts-minors-child-porn">http://news.wabe.org/post/fogle-plead-guilty-sex-acts-minors-child-porn</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>On Nov. 3, 2012, Fogle allegedly paid a 17-year-old girl who he had found online to engage in sex acts while he was staying at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, according to the papers. Several months later, he again paid her for sex acts while staying at the Ritz Carlton Hotel, according to the documents, which says the girl told Fogle her age when they first met and that he knew she was a minor.</p>

<p>After the first meeting, the documents said, Fogle texted the girl and offered to pay her a fee if she could find him another underage girl to pay for sex acts.</p>

<p>During these discussions, Fogle &quot;stated that he would accept a 16-year-old girl, while stating that the younger the girl, the better,&quot; the documents said.</p>

<p>Between 2011 and 2013, Fogle also repeatedly sent text messages to other escorts, &quot;soliciting them to provide him with access to minors as young as 14 to 15 years,&quot; the documents said, adding that he would only make such requests after engaging in sex acts with the escorts to &quot;insure that they were not undercover police officers.&quot;</p>

<p>The documents also alleged that Fogle on multiple occasions received sexually explicit images and videos produced by Russell Taylor, 43, who ran the charitable Jared Foundation.</p>

<p>Two months before Fogle&#39;s home was raided, authorities arrested Taylor on seven counts of production of child pornography and one count of possession of child pornography. Investigators said they discovered a cache of sexually explicit photos and videos Taylor allegedly produced by secretly filming minor children at his home.</p>

<p>Prosecutors also allege that Fogle received from Taylor multiple images and videos, some of which were taken by a video camera hidden in a clock radio that filmed children changing clothes or bathing. Some were taken in buildings were Taylor lived.</p>

<p>The documents said Fogle knew those depicted were minors, some as young as 13 or 14 years old, and in some cases knew the minors involved by name and had met them &quot;during social events in Indiana.&quot;</p>

<p>In other cases, the documents said, Taylor allegedly obtained sexually explicit images taken by others outside the U.S., including videos of children around age 6, and shared them with Fogle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand child pornography. From a purely sexual point a view a little girl or boy looks pretty much like a small hairless man. So I don&#39;t quite get the psychology of it to begin with. But more than that, how in the hell does one deal in this stuff? What do you do, just walk up to the water cooler at work and say, &quot;Hey man, want to look at some naked children being sexually exploited?&quot; I mean don&#39;t you <em>know</em> you are going to get caught? The vast majority of people despise that shit. And who makes that shit to begin with? I don&#39;t know about you but every kid I&#39;ve ever met doesn&#39;t stop running their mouth. I don&#39;t see how anyone can get away with it... well, unless the poor kid has some really fucked up parents, but how many of those can there possibly be? But even so, where do people get the pics? You can&#39;t just search &quot;child porn&quot; on Google and up it pops. I always hear people say its on the &quot;dark web&quot;. Well I did some bit-torrent searches just to see what would turn up, and again nothing. And yet every other week there is another big bust of someone with a shit ton of child porn on their computer. None of it makes much sense to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This <sup>...</sup> My theory is this, when you have endless(basically) money and power, what do you do? In your free time? Your ego and soul get so big and twisted from no one ever saying no to you, what do you do? You could have 100 of the most beautiful women brought in so they can suck on your nuts all day.. Boring... I could have people killed for fun, but unless you&#39;re a psychopath (which I&#39;m sure a lot of the big powerful people are) killing is usually just done as part of the job( no fun) so you start deriving  pleasure from illegal things because the rush.. But you keep on doing increasingly more twisted shit because you get used  those things... Powerful pedos most likely have giant orgies where everyone gets their free 7-10 year old of choice.. Really scary stuff man :/</p>

<p>Nothing. Pedophiles are born that way, they don&#39;t have a choice. Just like homosexuals. Rich and powerful pedophiles can get away with it so they do.</p>
