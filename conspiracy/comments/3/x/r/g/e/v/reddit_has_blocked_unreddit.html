<p>Then just read youtube comments. They&#39;re exactly that, uncensored, no PC moral agenda and only a wonky comment system to deal with. The only other problem is that they can make your eyes melt out of their sockets because they&#39;re so fucking stupid and horrible. It seems poor moderation only leads to excessive racism and pedophilia, just look at the *chans. At some point you stop wanting to see what they have to say, because what they say is not enlightening in the least, think unfettered cawadoody voice chat with squeakers calling your mom a nigger.

<p>The situation has gotten especially worse since the appointment of Ellen Pao as CEO, culminating in the seemingly unjustified firings of several valuable employees and bans on hundreds of vibrant communities on completely trumped-up charges.  </p>

<p>The resignation of Ellen Pao and the appointment of Steve Huffman as CEO, despite initial hopes, has continued the same trend.  </p>

<p>we sure they didn&#39;t just change there rest api? what it does isn&#39;t too different from the waybackmachine except it&#39;s reddit customized. It would be very difficult to block. I guess you could blacklist the ip&#39;s they use to scrape from but that can be worked around pretty easily. It&#39;s behavior would be harder to accurately profile against a normal guest than I think reddit is capable of.</p>

<p>People complain about that? I&#39;ve never heard of that</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost as though reddit isn&#39;t a single person, and has separate thoughts on subjects</p>

<p>I&#39;m on record multiple times as favoring the direct opposite: NO comment deletion by anybody, <em>ever</em>, plus any edits feature strikeout/insert marks so the original is always visible. </p>

<p>The internet is different to real life. So why should it be treated the same? </p>

<p>You are a human (I assume), but the actions you take, for some reason, related to a specific medium (the internet) should be treated in a different fashion than other actions? Why?</p>

<p>There is no difference between <em>Internet</em> and <em>the real life</em>. The internets, the communications, the statements are just as real as the real life.</p>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Because this medium is different to speaking in person. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no difference between Internet and the real life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a huge difference. On the internet there&#39;s no immediacy, you can plan your response, you can insert citations and all other kinds of stuff. </p>

<p>In person if you&#39;re talking or arguing a point, it&#39;s all very immediate. </p>

<p>On the internet, everything is recorded. Things in person tend not to be. </p>

<p>Not to mention the rather obvious fact that online anonymity provides a great deal of security and shit talking that people wouldn&#39;t dare do in person. </p>

The lack of censorship there in conjunction with the standard voting system means the people manipulating votes on the internet (i.e. the hard right wing) can get away with it even easier than they can here.
