       If you are someone considering voting for Hillary Clinton, I think you should understand that you are voting for someone who will lie on live tv, and who is so entrenched in the establishment that it will be covered up right in our faces and they just expect people not to notice.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the debate on Saturday, Hillary said to Bernie "With all due respect, senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya. you joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Qaddafi,". This was during a discussion about US military intervention in Libya after Bernie spoke against any foreign interventions. This is a lie. Bernie did not vote for military intervention in
       <del>
        Syria
       </del>
       Libya. The bill being referred to is a non-binding resolution condemning the human rights atrocities taking place. See for yourself.

        https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/senate-resolution/85
       </a>
       . There is no military authorization.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is Hilary has voted for every foreign US intervention including Iraq, and will plainly lie about Bernie's record to even the playing field during the debate. Additionally both times she brought it up the moderators blocked Bernie from responding with a correction. It was obvious manipulation of the public. We should be ashamed to have a system that is directly working towards nominating the establishment's favored candidate, there is nothing fair or democratic about this process.
