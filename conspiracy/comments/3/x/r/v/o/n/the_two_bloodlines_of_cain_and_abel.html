So, I figured I would post a few links to inspire you to research exactly what I am talking about and what &quot;reptillians&quot; means metaphorically. These are the esoteric/occult teachings of the Free Mason&#39;s and various other societies, and mystery schools. The teachings go deeper, but this is a primer, if you will.</p>

<p>If you are religious (Christian/Catholic/etc), this may be a bumpy ride (I&#39;m a former Catholic myself, now more spiritual). Take everything you read and view in these links with a grain of salt, because much of it has been sanitized and could very well be misinformation, by these very organizations. Censored, if you will from general consumption. </p>

<p>That being said, there are plenty of breadcrumbs to follow here, if you are interested in these thing and would like to research more. Knowing these things will help in researching the Flavian&#39;s of Rome, Christianity, the reorganizing of Rome into the Vatican and the Tri Sovereign States (The Vatican, The City of London, The District of Columbia). Enjoy the rabbit hole..</p>

Tubal Cain Tubal-Cain is a person mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, in Genesis 4:22. He was a descendant of Cain, the first murderer killing his brother Abel. Tubal-cain was the &quot;forger of all instruments of bronze and iron. He is normally depicted with a flexed bent arm holding a hammer. Arm and Hammer baking soda logo.</p>

It&#39;s purported to be the <a href="http://freemasonrywatch.org/tubalcain.html">secret password</a> of the freemasons.  As a mythological figure he&#39;s likened to <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithraic_mysteries#Lion-headed_figure">Mithraic Kronos</a></em> or <em>Saturn / Demiurge</em> via <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan_of_the_alchemists">Vulcan</a></em></p>

[5:2] Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them &quot;Humankind&quot; when they were created.
<strong>[5:3] When Adam had lived one hundred thirty years, he became the father of</strong> a son in his likeness, according to his image, and named him <strong>Seth</strong>.

I&#39;m now curious though if anyone has any idea what Cain was marked with by God after killing Abel? 
If I recall correctly after it being found out that he has murdered his brother and God was very displeased He cursed Cain and marked him with the mark of a murderer so that all people would know what he had done. Does that serve any significance to freemasonry? 
Anyways, delving deeper.. Thanks again!</p>
