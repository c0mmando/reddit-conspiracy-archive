        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I want to start off with the fact that I have gay/transgender friends and I really don&#39;t care what goes on in people&#39;s sexual lives.</p>

<p>However, something is not sitting well with me. Growing up, I really bought into the LGBT stuff. When I was 13, I even thought that I was a lesbian. It&#39;s funny, though, now that I am an adult I definitely know I was confused about my sexuality, and I&#39;m so glad I let myself grow up and mature before I labeled myself in anyway. I&#39;m definitely straight. What I&#39;m trying to get at is that I think that I was brainwashed a little...</p>

<p>I unquestionably supported all the &quot;gay&quot; stuff as a teen without ever researching it. Now that I&#39;m an adult, I really feel confused. The transgender stuff is now mainstream, and they even are teaching kids as young as kindergarten about gender/sexuality. It really freaks me out.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to come off as bigoted. I know that for many people, their sexuality and gender can impact their life profoundly. But I can&#39;t help but think something is up. Excuse my ignorance, but here are some of my questions...</p>

<p>1) Is transgenderism truly just a mental illness? Wasn&#39;t it labeled that way in the past? What has changed? 
2) Is there some sort of conspiracy to ensure that people are completely confused about their gender? Why?
3) Is there something in the food? In the water?
4) Are &#39;they&#39; ultimately moving the population toward transhumanism?
5) Has gay marriage had any negative consequences? 
6) Is there something I&#39;m missing here?</p>

<p>I really would love to hear your thoughts!</p>

<p>Edit: for every upvote I get a downvote. Must have struck a nerve. Scary how people are so scared to question things.</p>

<p>For a conspiracy forum, you&#39;d think this be upvoted higher.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re welcome. I find it very disturbing that they are trying to make a mental disorder as &quot;normal&quot; in society. It&#39;s not normal. That doesn&#39;t mean transgender people should be outcast. Much like schizophrenics shouldn&#39;t be shunned and outcast. They should be helped and advised not to become/pursue their delusions. There is a clear agenda going on. Just my thoughts on the matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as the mental disorder bit, there is a have-your-cake-and-eat-it situation there because in one breath it&#39;s everyone right to decide who they are and in the next it&#39;s the way people are born. I think Rachel Dolezal was a side effect, or maybe just a good example of how delusional people can be about this kind of stuff.  Her situation was with her race, sure, but she still was (apparently) adamant in her belief that she is African American despite being born to white parents, and born a white person, and even went so far as to essentially attempt a &quot;race change&quot; operation to appear as the ethnicity she identified with. Although, the reaction to her story was laughter or outrage not awards and magazine covers (well, maybe she was in magazines too). The strangest one, I  think, are the transgender people who still prefer the opposite sex, as in born a woman but see themselves as a gay male, and vice versa. There is obviously an agenda being pushed on this issue, but I can&#39;t say really who I think it is or whether it&#39;s just the next step after gay marriage. Maybe it&#39;s something along the lines of this seasons South Park with PC principal not realizing what he is and all that, who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on what you mean by &quot;exposed&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s up to you as a parent to sit your kids down and explain your thoughts on the birds, the bees, the kings, and the queens. They&#39;re going to be exposed to things in society, you can only help guide them with how they interpret it all.</p>

<p>They&#39;re going to do all kinds of dumb things growing up, and they&#39;re going to probably have sex. Access to condoms in public schools is considered &quot;perverse&quot; by many, but each one is a potential unwanted teenage pregnancy averted.</p>

<p>I just think there are more pressing concerns with our kids than the &quot;dangers&quot; of being exposed to the reality that gender isn&#39;t necessarily binary.</p>

<p>I mean, is it so hard to instill this: &quot;There are all kinds of people in the world, and you&#39;re going to grow up and figure out who you are. I just want you to be happy.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>10 years ago my friend tried to turn me onto Alex Jones. I listened for about 20 minutes and he was ranting about how in the future, they&#39;ll try and convince people that boys and girls should share a bathroom. And that boys would be encouraged to be really girly and gay. He said that children would be intentionally confused about their gender and it was the beginning of the &quot;Transhumanist&quot; movement. </p>

<p>I turned that shit off immediately because I thought it was the dumbest bullshit I&#39;d ever heard. 10 years later.... My reaction when I see this video being forced down everyone&#39;s throat on reddit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW92UlhDVO4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW92UlhDVO4</a></p>

<p>TPTB are literally trying to make the millennials into genderless queer monsters and they are taking the bait hook line and sinker. Imagine what this country is going to be like in the next 10 years: A bunch of genderless blue hairs that can&#39;t keep up with their debt payments protesting alongside BLM in the streets.

<p>I dunno about that video.  I see a tolerant parent helping their kid be who they think they are.  If it&#39;s a mental disorder: fine.  But we have no cure for gender dysphoria, so until then, help them be the gender they think they are.</p>

<p>My personal problem with what&#39;s going on in the world places the transgender stuff and social issues at the very very lowest of priorities.  I take issue with 1) mass mind control to create military worship, nationalism, consent for war, to keep people from the truth, 2) battling 9/11 truth with more anti-propaganda and warping people&#39;s relationship with science and understanding, 3) this ISIS horseshit that&#39;s a total psyop and it&#39;s so obvious that if you don&#39;t know it by now, you&#39;re in the popular outgroup of political dumbcucks who don&#39;t understand one single atom of reality, 4) the impoverishment of america and the stark lack of opportunities---and vast income disparity that inhibits any semblance of competition.</p>

<p>Because, ultimately, it&#39;s social engineering in order to create a 2nd class tier of confused, moronic, debt slaves. And these people are so brainwashed that they can be easily manipulated to attack society sideways and downwards, never upwards to the people who are really the ones actually fucking them over.</p>

<p>Take BLM for example: I agree that there is &quot;structural racism&quot; in this country and it&#39;s called the War on Drugs. But are they protesting in front of court houses and trying to make people aware of jury nullification? Are they speaking up against the criminalization of drugs especially weed? No. They&#39;re being used to shout down anyone who disagrees with them, they&#39;re being used to marginalize other people on the same plane they exist on. </p>

<p>This is called Divide and Rule and the George Soros&#39; of this world are funding this leaderless, no-clear-goals movements to shape and create new social taboos in this country. And what is the point of creating new social taboos? In order to make certain very important political topics not allowable to talk about. For instance, can you have an open and serious discussion about immigration right now without being called a racist? Not usually...</p>

<p>OP isn&#39;t talking about sexual orientation, he&#39;s talking about the MSM shoving specific issues down everyone&#39;s throat to create an agenda. It&#39;s not about sexual orientation. Anyone can be anything they want and do anything they want and who cares. It&#39;s about making certain issues taboo and divisive. This includes transgender issues as well as racial issues, feminism, social justice issues etc. </p>

<p>The media creates an atmosphere where you either believe Caitlyn Jenner is a hero or you&#39;re a &quot;denier&quot;, a heretic, and you will be mocked and made to feel like a stupid backwards outsider. The MSM doesn&#39;t give a fuck what the issue is, as long as that issue can be used to create fault lines amongst the population.</p>

This third gender isnt&#39; just transgender, it&#39;s also androgyny, genderqueer and entirely widened spectrum of other genders created within that ambiguous space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, as usual, their push is not for any kind of equality, and their positions are full of logical inconsistencies.</p>

<p>It is hammered into us that everybody&#39;s personal definitions of sex and gender are their own, and they can&#39;t be wrong. They must be respected and tolerated and even celebrated. It&#39;s all a big grey area anyway, so there&#39;s really no possible way to say somebody is wrong. Anybody who disagrees with them is a bigot.</p>

<p>Unless... unless your own personal definition is that a biological male is a male, a biological female is a female, and the tiny minority of people who have sex hormone and chromosomal abnormalities are the only grey area. In that case, your personal definition is wrong, it is not to be tolerated or respected, and anybody who agrees with you is a bigot.</p>

<p>Now I don&#39;t care if people use &quot;their own definitions&quot; of words, I really don&#39;t.

It&#39;s a basic right to freedom of speech and thought.</p>

<p>But that equally goes for women who don&#39;t consider themselves to be the same as biological men who have had cosmetic surgery. It equally goes for biological white people who call themselves black. etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I don&#39;t get is pushing the idea that gender is a &quot;social construct.&quot; </p>

<p>Example: You have a male who really thinks he is supposed to be a female. He proceeds to wear makeup, dresses, etc.- you know, basically imitating the &quot;socially constructed&quot; female that they insist they actually are naturally on the inside. If gender is a &quot;social construct&quot;, then how does the born-this-way thing make sense? How is it that everyone is now being pushed to accept and validate the &quot;socially constructed&quot; female gender of a male-to-female trans person?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people are homosexual and born that way. Some are heterosexual and born that way. The vast majority, however, are merely sexual, not necessarily homo or hetero. Without access to society&#39;s views on these topics, many people would be sucking dicks, sucking clits, and doing butt stuff. Guys would be tugging their friends off, and girls would be kissing a lot more than they do today. </p>

<p>I feel that the big deception is that there is not a choice. Sure, for some people, like I said, they are very clearly born homosexual. I grew up with somebody who was obviously predisposed to being gay even before he hit puberty. He spoke like a girl, was involved primarily with female-oriented activities and hobbies, and sure enough, came out of the closet about ten years later. </p>

<p>For the rest of us, however, even those who are certain that we are straight, we are heterosexual mostly by choice. If raised in a society which embraced homosexuality, the straight guys of today&#39;s society would certainly be doing more gay stuff. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this is necessarily a bad thing, but I do agree that young children probably shouldn&#39;t be taught about homo or heterosexuality at too young an age. I think they should be taught that some kids have two daddies, and that&#39;s ok, and that some kids have a mommy and a daddy, and that&#39;s ok, and that some kids only have a mommy, and some live with their aunts and uncles, and that all of these things are ok. I do not, however, feel it is appropriate to tell young children thst Bobby&#39;s dad likes to eat his wife&#39;s pussyhouse while Jimmy&#39;s dad prefers to dress like a French maid and test the tensile strength of his foreskin against his plumber&#39;s nose. </p>

<p>To each their own. Gay guys are awesome and straight guys could totally learn a thing or two from them. And vice versa. We&#39;re all great. Everybody is great. Food from every country is great. People from every country are great. What a world. What a fucking world. </p>

<p>I feel like the toxic environment we live in, is causing a higher percentage of people to be gender-confused.  I understand that homosexuality has been found in nature and am in no way discrediting how people feel.  I earnestly believe they are attracted to whoever they are attracted to, the question is why?  It is my gathering belief that our environment is causing a sudden surge of gender-questionable people.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely right. For example, many children who under go sexual abuse have malformed opinions about sexuality. Sexuality can be programmed in the brain like anything else. I also am not against other people&#39;s sex lives and their choices. I accord them the free will to do as they please and be happy about it.

<p>I wonder too if cultural elements are important here. What is America&#39;s culture? Consumerism? Materialism? Greed?</p>

<p>I actually live on the Navajo reservation and people are very accepting of LGBT people. It&#39;s just not an issue. People are accepting, but nothing is pushed....</p>

<p>But..</p>

<p>There is tons of systematic abuse here. Sexual, physical, etc. Associated with poverty. Does this affect the people sexually?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think as a transwoman I can sound off on this.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s an &quot;agenda&quot; per-say, but there&#39;s defiantly something fucky going on. I&#39;m a pretty normal person, but the people I&#39;ve seen throughout the years in support groups and such... They&#39;re a different breed, and they all seem to have far larger issues at hand that they&#39;re simply trying to disguise.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t like it when I say this, but the vast majority of trans people out there most likely are not trans at all, but are just escaping from their issues. Our society doesn&#39;t have to accept these people when they&#39;re creepy men doing things no one should do or weird goths with gouges in their cheeks, but now that they&#39;re transgender we HAVE to accept them because that&#39;s the direction this world is heading in. A man that&#39;s getting way too close to someone 30 years younger is &quot;scary&quot;, but a transwoman that does that is being &quot;empathetic&quot;. </p>

<p>I mean, the fact that there are a lot of people that get the sex reassignment surgery either before or right at the start of HRT should be evidence that there&#39;s really little gender issues at play for them in the first place. </p>

<p>What it really boils down to is basically the WebMD syndrome, where everything thinks they can self-diagnose themselves mixed with the left-leaning acceptance crap. In the US, the proper way to start HRT is to see a certified therapist I believe 12 times, who will then either sign off on you getting hrt or reject you for having other issues. Then only proper health clinics that have been approved for that stuff can supply the proper treatment.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s either too much work or too expensive for most people. They gotta fix their problems <em>now</em>, so they just buy the medicine online. And we&#39;re supposed to accept that. Lemme answer those 6 questions now that I&#39;m done with my rant.</p>

<p>1) Yes. And no. Its basically as simple as saying Female brain in Male body. What do we give priority to? Am I my brain, or am I my body?</p>

<p>2) Again, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a conspiracy, but I&#39;m sure someone somewhere out there is profiting off of this. Why else is Jenner popular when even the Trans community hates her?</p>

<p>3) lol, I don&#39;t think so. I ate the same food and drank the same water as my siblings and they turned out fine.</p>

<p>4) As I said, most trans people are just freaks trying to disguise larger issues. There&#39;s no metaphysical nonsense at work. Just autistic idiots that think hormones are more beneficial than serotonin inhibitors.</p>

<p>5) naw.</p>

<p>6) naw.</p>

<p>And yes, I am upvoting you. I mean, I agree with you after all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck you get it...</p>

<p>So to review... No one is allowed to question...</p>

<ol>
<li>Global Warming</li>
<li> Vaccines</li>
<li> Trans---whatever the fuck they are calling it today...</li>
</ol>

<p>--In a speech given to the US Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works on July 28, 2003, entitled &quot;The Science of Climate Change&quot;, Senator James Inhofe (Republican, for Oklahoma) concluded by asking the following question: </p>

<p><strong>&quot;With all of the hysteria, all of the fear, all of the phony science, could it be that man-made global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people?&quot;</strong> </p>

<p>He further stated, &quot;some parts of the IPCC process resembled a Soviet-style trial, in which the facts are predetermined, and ideological purity trumps technical and scientific rigor.&quot; Inhofe has suggested that supporters of the Kyoto Protocol such as Jacques Chirac are aiming at global governance.</p>

<p>--&quot;Whereas the reports produced by these more recent organizations frequently refer to global ..... the resultant ideal sustainable population is hence more than 500 million but less than one billion.” - Club of Rome, Goals for Mankind</p>

<p>--I present Jazz Jennings..  <a href="http://www.dailystormer.com/jazz-jennings-and-the-zio-conspiracy-of-transgender-kids/">http://www.dailystormer.com/jazz-jennings-and-the-zio-conspiracy-of-transgender-kids/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Society is being engineered in the worst possible way; to view transgender people, especially transgender children, as being completely normal. This is where Jazz Jennings and her reality show come in. I Am Jazz tries to present the family as a normal, happy one that just happens to have a family member who is a biological boy but identifies as a girl. The show is poorly scripted, badly acted, and often comes off as a preachy public service announcement for transgendered people because that’s precisely what it is. In the first episode Jazz’s grandparents stop by and Jeanette (Jazz’s mother) fills them in on Jazz’s hormone therapy as well as the proper and improper terms to use when referring to transgender people. This comes off as laughable because if Jazz has been transgendered since she was about five which her parents claim then wouldn’t her grandparents already be aware of these things?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The fourteen year old from Coral Springs, Florida is the new darling of the media. She has a reality show on TLC called I Am Jazz, has made numerous appearances on TV throughout the years including The Rosie O’Donnell Show, 20/20, Dr. Drew, and was recently chosen as the spokesmodel for Clean &amp; Clear skincare. She’s also a boy. At least she is according to her and her parents, Greg and Jeanette Jennings.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Jazz is notable for being one of the youngest documented people to identify as transgender and was first seen on a 2007 20/20 special with Barbara Walters when she was just six years old.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Jazz is always a victim in some way. Jazz’s struggles are bigger than everyone else because she’s transgendered. In fact, no one else in the show seems to have any problems at all. Everyone, from Jazz’s girlfriends to her siblings and parents makes her the center of the universe in every interaction while praising her to the heavens for being so brave in the face of adversity. The goal appears to be to make Jazz, and all other transgendered people, simultaneously the victim and the brave, noble warrior at the same time. Naturally, liberals and progressives applaud this paradoxical freak show because of their own fondness for diametrically opposing ideas along with an aversion to facts or reality.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;To understand that, one has to understand the agenda at work here. Ever since Bruce Jenner decided he is a woman and appeared on the now infamous cover of Vanity Fair, not a day goes by that the public isn’t besieged with media coverage of transgender issues, specifically transgender children. <strong>It is pushed for the same reason that radical feminism, the homosexual agenda, and miscegenation is; to normalize the abnormal and to brainwash people via the media to believe that this is something very common when in fact it is one of the most disturbing agendas the Zionist elite have ever created. They want to convince parents that not only is it normal to change their child’s gender, but that they should put their child on hormone blockers before puberty, a process that some psychiatrists have pointed out could be physically and mentally harmful for the child.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Dr. Kenneth Zucker, a psychologist and head of the gender-identity service at the Toronto Center for Addiction and Mental Health, has voiced his concern over hormone blockers saying, “Medical practitioners have to be careful with children with gender identity issues. Giving children hormone blockers before the age of thirteen is too early.”</p>

<p>&quot;Dr. Zucker has written over 130 papers about gender identity since he started researching it in 1975. He also conducted a study of 109 boys who struggled with GID (Gender Identity Disorder) from the ages of 3 to 12 and found that when researchers followed up with the boys at the age of 20, <strong>only 12% still identified as GID</strong>. There’s also currently no statistics on the effects of transgender children taking medical treatments since it is such a new phenomenon. Zucker’s approach is to try to get the child to identify with the gender they were born with as well as pin point what may be causing the confusion in the first place.&quot;</p>

Hopefully the normalizing and integration of LGBT into the dominant heteronormative society leads to less ignorance and bigotry. It seems to be working so far.</p>

<p>I&#39;d rather children and teenagers live in a world where they&#39;re allowed to figure out their own identities without fear.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not afraid that Caitlyn Jenner is harming straight people.</p>

<p>Dude, there are people on Tumblr who think they are &#39;owl kin&#39;. Something disturbs me about that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ask any gay person when they started to question their sexuality. You will get a lot of &quot;I knew I was different at age XX&quot; and it isn&#39;t always going to be during or after puberty.</p>

<p>Please realize I am talking about sexual development and not sexualizing children.</p>

<p>Tumblr kids are doing the same boundary-pushing you and I did when we were their ages. The only thing left that feels like a rejection of the status quo is the very idea of &quot;identity&quot;.  Every niche and subculture left that we created and enjoyed has a hundred websites and their own cultures and dogma. So then, their battleground becomes themselves.</p>

<p>It can look dumb and messy to adults, but it&#39;s mostly just experimentation in journal form. Kids are inundated with information and seek to establish their identities at an earlier age than maybe we&#39;re accustomed to.</p>

<p>Esoteric tales of past lives?  Hollywood making people gays? A queer drug they put in the water, vaccines or milk?  You are saying that society is making gays. Here is a thought: there has always been gays but society is now more accepting of them as non sub-human peoples as minorities once were thus more are &quot;coming out&quot;. </p>

<p>Google the Kinsey scale. People are on a sliding scale of sexuality not simply gay or straight.</p>

<p>It sounds like nonsense if you use a semblance of critical thinking.</p>

<p>Here is a thought. It was you. You went through a phase and didn&#39;t have any guidance. You encountered an idea and didn&#39;t know what to do with it. It is that simple.</p>

<p>Example: You have a male who really thinks he is supposed to be a female. He proceeds to wear makeup, dresses, etc.- you know, basically imitating the &quot;socially constructed&quot; female that they insist they actually are naturally on the inside. If gender is a &quot;social construct&quot;, then how does the born-this-way thing make sense? How is it that everyone is now being pushed to accept and validate the &quot;socially constructed&quot; female gender of a male-to-female trans person?</p>
