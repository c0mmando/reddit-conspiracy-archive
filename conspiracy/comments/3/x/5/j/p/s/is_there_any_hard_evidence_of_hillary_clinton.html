I know she had early ties to some kind of students group that was sponsored by masons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is mountains of evidence that link Freemasonry to magic traditions.  It works like this, going backward through time:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Freemasonry</strong> derived from: &lt;&lt; <strong>Rosicrucians</strong> </li>
<li>from: &lt;&lt; <strong>Alchemists</strong> &lt;&lt; </li>
<li>from:  [ Hermeticism + Kabbalism (mystic Judaeism) + Astrotheology + Syncretic Paganism + Numerology + alt-Christianity (Jesus&#39; Mary-ism) ] === <strong>Gnostics</strong> &lt;&lt; </li>
<li>from: <strong>Knights of Malta / Jesuits</strong> &lt;&lt; </li>
<li>from: <strong>Mystery Cults / Mystery Schools</strong> (Essenes; Cults of Eleusis, Mithras, Orphos, Dionysis) &lt;&lt; </li>
<li>from: <strong>Ancient pre-big 3 Religious traditions</strong>: Zoroastrianism, Manicheanism (pre-kabbalism) , Tantra (mystic buddhism), Sufism (mystic islam)</li>
</ul>

<p>If I had my druthers I would lump <em>Freemasonry</em> into a <em>larger cryptoreligious <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/39zys0/america_is_a_mega_cult/">megacult</a></em> of <strong><em>&quot;Gnostic Globalists&quot;</em></strong>.  This is not a theory, because I can actually prove it with so much evidence going back hundreds of years that it&#39;s a moot point in my book.  But if you need convincing that these globalists are into the occult, may I <em>Illuminate you</em> with these links:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that there is semi-hidden knowledge salvaged from pre-known civilization, a past golden age if you will. I think that given the right access to this knowledge and enough resources any individually can become as powerful as he or she desires. This is not magic as it is described in the mainstream media but is instead much more subtle. I am a novice when it comes to understanding this stuff but basically you can use things that apply pressure to the collective consciousness and by doing so you can elicit a response. I also believe that through very very very intense meditation a person can retain memories from past lives. I&#39;m not saying that Hillary cuntin can us all these magical avenues  to their fullest but I do think she&#39;s evil enough to resort to anything to gain power , even seeking the knowledge of the mystery schools.</p>

. it features high relief carvings of animals not local to that area.
. the temple was continuously buried and rebuilt over the course of its existence and more than 50% of the structure is still under the ground. they have not yet carbon dated the deepest layers. the upper layers already date back 12,000 years
.the stone seems to be worked in a way reminiscent of the stone at the pyramids the methods used still elude researchers today.
.furthermore there are depictions of the constellations on the pillars that represent the star systems they they are facing. this knowledge eludes to a complex understanding of the astronomy.

    <div class="md"><p>Mostly because it&#39;s hard to believe an ignorant, savage, warlike people would have the time and energy to map the stars. The Mongols never built anything like this nor did the Norse. The hypothesis that I subscribe to is one that suggests that there was a cataclysmic event that turned the clock back on civilization after some parts of earth had already reached a golden age. This age is far beyond the electrical age that we are currently stuck in. after the cataclysm there were pockets of survivors with this golden knowledge, I hypothesize that one could survive a cataclysm by hiding in a large pyramid like structure. perhaps these survivors understood the most harmonious way to develop and sustain a civilization and these early versions of megaliths are reminiscent of that golden age knowledge influencing early know civilization . And because of time this ancient golden knowledge has become watered down. Remember magic is simply a way to influence and alter the course of history. It&#39;s not Harry Potter stuff it&#39;s more akin to alchemy and meditation and even modern day psychology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the body and blood is symbolic, not literal. Also I personally see religion just as crazy as believing in magic. Actually I think people believing in magic is a little more crazy. But nonetheless you do bring up a good point that believing in this black magic isn&#39;t too different from believing in religion. That doesn&#39;t do me any good since I don&#39;t believe in either though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong.  Catholics believe in transubstantiation, which means the blood and cracker <em>become literally</em> the blood and body of Christ.  Which itself literally translates into into a whole continent (s. america) and a bunch of people around the world with a deep deep suspension of disbelief and denial of reality.  Unless you are catholic and I&quot;m just some areligious a hole.</p>

<p>The test is: One can put a blessed cracker in the microscope and find no amount of jesus christ in it, but probably will find some GMO monsanto products in there.  Just sayin&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so this is a stretch, and I had to wade through some swamps of word vomit to find this connection for you...</p>

<p>This website <a href="http://thegodpress.blogspot.com/2015_11_01_archive.html">http://thegodpress.blogspot.com/2015_11_01_archive.html</a>
 says,&quot;Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is now running for president, is not the first Clinton to support the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC; <a href="http://www.hqudc.org">http://www.hqudc.org</a>) and Children of the Confederacy (CofC) claim of &quot;heritage and pride&quot; in displaying the Confederate flag. The state flag of Arkansas sports 25 white stars and four blue ones. And in 1987, while serving as governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton signed a bill affirming that one of those blue stars is there in honor of the Confederate States of America. Not only did Bill and Hillary Clinton honor the Confederacy on the flag, but they also had a special day to celebrate it.&quot;</p>

<p>Picture of DOC rally <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vbURCrVYDH4/VkMYEiig1aI/AAAAAAAAAQ4/J4pz_ARcQgQ/s1600/HillaryConfederate.jpg">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vbURCrVYDH4/VkMYEiig1aI/AAAAAAAAAQ4/J4pz_ARcQgQ/s1600/HillaryConfederate.jpg</a></p>

<p>Now I go to the Daughters of the Confederacy objectives page, <a href="http://www.hqudc.org/objectives/">http://www.hqudc.org/objectives/</a> </p>

<p>They have a Jefferson Davis Medal <a href="http://www.wddesigns.org/UDC/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jdgold.jpg">http://www.wddesigns.org/UDC/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jdgold.jpg</a></p>

<p>Which seems to be sporting a similar style and design to templar/knights of Malta medals and crosses. I don&#39;t see a direct link to the eastern start organization but there is definitely a link between hillary&#39;s start at yale and her meeting up with bill who got his yale scholarship from the club of rome before they became a power couple. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahaha!  Great catch!  I knew there was a reason to come back to this post.  Too bad I can&#39;t confirm that&#39;s hillary.  Sure looks like her dumpty body outline though.</p>

<p>All these confederacy / white power extreme right wing groups like KKK are associated in some way or another with freemasonry.  Mason divest themselves from any association as they look down on those groups, however its well known that people in kkk for example were also in fraternal order of police and freemasons.  I know this connection through conspiracy books.</p>

<p>But I know this connection firsthand, from having gone into a bait and tackle gas station off the highway in alabama in a trip across the country.  I went into their bathroom and saw something truly unforgettable.  Instead of the usual dick/pussy/gay graffiti stuff, I saw a bunch of alchemical, demonic sigils and masonry symbols, including the sigil for lucifer.  Not knowing anything about occult at the time, I still broke into a cold sweat of terror just from being there, I think because it was so incredibly weird and unexpected, not necessarily because of some kind of latent power behind symbols (who knows though?).  Imagine walking into a bathroom right after 9/11 and it has arabic written all over the walls...that kind of feeling.</p>

. it features high relief carvings of animals not local to that area.
. the temple was continuously buried and rebuilt over the course of its existence and more than 50% of the structure is still under the ground. they have not yet carbon dated the deepest layers. the upper layers already date back 12,000 years
.the stone seems to be worked in a way reminiscent of the stone at the pyramids the methods used still elude researchers today.
.furthermore there are depictions of the constellations on the pillars that represent the star systems they they are facing. this knowledge eludes to a complex understanding of the astronomy.
