     Fourteen Incredible Facts About 9/11

    <div class="card bg-dark mb-3">
     <div class="card-body md">
      <ol>
       <li>
        An outline of what was to become the 9/11 Commission Report was produced before the investigation began. The outline was kept secret from the Commission’s staff and appears to have determined the outcome of the investigation.
       </li>
       <li>
        The 9/11 Commission claimed sixty-three (63) times in its Report that it could find “no evidence” related to important aspects of the crimes.
       </li>
       <li>
        One person, Shayna Steinger, issued 12 visas to the alleged hijackers in Saudi Arabia. Steiger issued some of the visas without interviewing the applicants and fought with another employee at the embassy who tried to prevent her lax approach.
       </li>
       <li>
        Before 9/11, the nation’s leading counter-terrorism expert repeatedly notified his friends in the United Arab Emirates of top-secret U.S. plans to capture Osama bin Laden. These treasonous leaks prevented Bin Laden’s capture on at least two separate occasions.
       </li>
       <li>
        Former National Security Advisor Sandy Berger was caught stealing documents from the National Archives that had been requested by the 9/11 Commission. The Commission had previously been denied access to the documents but the White House reluctantly agreed to turn them over just as Berger was trying to steal them.
       </li>
       <li>
        The official story of the failed air defenses on 9/11 was changed several times and, in the end, paradoxically exonerated the military by saying that the military had lied many times about its response. The man who was behind several of the changing accounts was a specialist in political warfare (i.e. propaganda).
       </li>
       <li>
        Military exercises being conducted on the day of 9/11 mimicked the attacks as they were occurring and obstructed the response. NORAD commander Ralph Eberhart sponsored those exercises, failed to do his job that day, and later lied to Congress about it (if the 9/11 Commission account is true).
       </li>
       <li>
        A third skyscraper collapsed late in the afternoon on 9/11. This was WTC 7, a 47-story building that the government’s final report says fell into its own footprint due to office fires. The building’s tenants included U.S. intelligence agencies and a company led in part by Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney. Meetings were scheduled there to discuss terrorism and explosives on the morning of 9/11.
       </li>
       <li>
        News agencies, including BBC and CNN, announced the destruction of WTC 7 long before it happened. One BBC reporter announced the collapse while viewers could see the still-standing building right behind her in the video. Years later, after claiming that it had lost the tapes and then found them again, BBC’s answer to this astonishing report was that everything was just “confusing and chaotic” that day. Of course, one problem with this is that the news agencies predicted the exact building, of the many damaged in the area, that would collapse. Another big problem is that no one could have possibly predicted the collapse of WTC 7 given the unprecedented and unbelievable official account for how that happened.
       </li>
       <li>
        Construction of the new, 52-story WTC 7 was completed two years before the government knew what happened to the first WTC 7. In fact, when the new building was completed in 2006, the spokesman for the government investigation said, “We’ve had trouble getting a handle on building No. 7.” The construction of the new building, without regard for how the first one was destroyed, indicates that building construction professionals in New York City did not believe it could ever happen again.
       </li>
       <li>
        Ultimately, building construction codes were not changed as a result of the root causes cited by the National Institute for Standards and Technology for destruction of the World Trade Center (WTC) buildings. This fact shows that the international building construction community does not believe that the WTC buildings were destroyed as stated in the official account.
       </li>
       <li>
        AMEC, the company that just finished rebuilding the exact spot where Flight 77 was said to hit, was put in charge of cleanup at the WTC and the Pentagon. The man who ran the company, Peter Janson, was a long-time business associate of Donald Rumsfeld.
       </li>
       <li>
        The response of the U.S. Secret Service to the 9/11 attacks suggests foreknowledge of the events in that the agency failed to protect the president from the obvious danger posed by terrorists.
       </li>
       <li>
        The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission notified the FBI of suspected 9/11 insider trading transactions. That evidence was ignored and the suspects were not even questioned by the FBI or the 9/11 Commission.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       There are, of course, many more incredible facts about 9/11 that continue to be ignored by authorities and much of the media. Let’s hope that the next major terrorist attack results in legitimate reporting and unified calls for truth before fourteen years have passed.

       Biggest one for me is the perfectly round hole in the pentagon with no sign of plane debris. Yeah right. Only one poor video of it too. Oh yeah, another plane crashes in PA and there is only a steaming pile of dirt. What a joke.

       OK, non-perfectly round hole. But still, c'mon. Obviously it wasn't a plane. And the Pentagon has hundreds of cameras and we only get to see the one video clip.

       viewers could see the still-standing building - And the New Yorkers who recognised the building in question would have been able to see the error. But why do you think the people from the BBC would recognise it? It's not famous or well-known to anyone from the UK.

       This is a matter of debate, but I'd go with the fire-fighters on-site, who saw the building structure weakening over a period of hours.

       What, exactly, "mimicked" the attacks? Did any of them involve jetliners being deliberately crashed into buildings? No. And how did these exercises "obstruct the response" exactly? According to General Eberhard, "it took about 30 seconds" to realize what was happening was not a drill.

        the investigation
       </a>
       actually revealed the original source of the belief WTC 7 had collapsed was the BBC mis-reporting their own reporter. "At 4.27pm, a BBC reporter, Greg Barrow, who is in New York, appears on our radio news channel, BBC Radio Five Live, and says: "We are hearing reports from local media that another building may have caught light and is in danger of collapse." He then responds to a follow-up question by saying "I'm not sure if it has yet collapsed but the report we have is talking about Building 7." At 4.53pm, on the same radio station, the programme's presenter, Fi Glover says "25 minutes ago we had reports from Greg Barrow that another large building has collapsed just over an hour ago." At 4.54pm, the BBC's domestic television news channel, BBC News 24, reports the same thing. "

       Not so, according to the official report which states: "The SEC and FBI, aided by other agencies and the securities industry,
       <strong>
        devoted enormous resources to investigating this issue
       </strong>
       , including securing the cooperation of many foreign governments. These investigators have found that the apparently suspicious consistently proved innocuous."

       If youre trying to be funny, you are confusing the issue more and cluttering up a thread for.....unhelpful reasons.  I cant tell youre copying some nut job.  That and, did you downvote the OP because he didnt know who you were trying to pretend to be?
      </p>
      <p>
       Please explain.  It doesnt do much for this thread and keeping comments on target.

       I didn't do any downvoting. I would assume it would be
       <a href="/u/DronePuppet">
        /u/DronePuppet
       </a>
       doing the downvoting since
       <a href="/u/burningempire">
        /u/burningempire

       was disagreeing with him.
