       I just need a little reality check. To me, is seems like the world is getting crazier and crazier with each passing day. Is this a figment of my imagination and shitty memory or actual fact?

       The world has always been shit, mate. Wars, chaos, some times of peace, followed by wars. See the Hundred years war, the invading Muslims, the crusades because of invading Muslims. The plague, the dark ages, etc etc. It's just now, we have access to it at our fingertips. It's crazy, because people once thought, well maybe there is a land somewhere (paradise) without war or chaos, yet we are finding out, there isn't because of the internet. Although, there are places of sanctuary, secluded in nature. I chose that route. Just move away from it all. I'll feel it if my country goes to war, but for the mean time, it's just me and my dog out in the forest drinking cider and chilling. It's a hard life (don't get me wrong), but it beats being a wage slave and the rat race.

       Has PC culture, unemployment, immigration, high prices for shit goods, water concerns, police state and all that crap always been an issue too?

       Reading what I've just typed sounds like I'm trolling. It's not. I'm just trying to tie all the loose ends up with what I'm thinking because I feel like either I'm crazy or the world is going down the toilet.

       Those have always been an issue in one form or another. I suggest people research history. PC is the equivalent of burning "witches" at the stake for saying that maybe, the Earth revolves around the Sun.

       The niche that PC culture occupies used to be occupied by the heavily religious-- think witch burnings, etc.  Same principle, just different manifestation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unemployment complaints are ancient.  The traditional solution has been a war to knock off the surplus population and make some broken windows that need to be repaired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Immigration problems are also ancient.  That's basically what the crusades were about.
      </p>
      <p>
       High prices for shit goods has resulted in mini-genocides ever since the dark ages ended, and surely goes all the way back to Babylon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Water concerns: Droughts are ancient.  Pollution is probably new-ish, though there's a few allusions to the spoiling of a river, etc, in ancient histories.  (Edit to add
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_empire">
        this
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Police State: That's the default state of mankind.  The non-police state was a tiny bubble that existed for a brief stint before the American Ideal was subjugated.  During most of history, the king owned you, and everything you did.

       That's what most of us Canadians thought of Trudeau too. Look where he is now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Better than Harper by a long shot, but he's already fucking up majorly. But then again, what did we expect? He's just another lying figurehead with his hands in corporate pockets like the rest of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally (don't take this the wrong way), I hope Trump gets elected. He's a douchebag and wants to shut down the internet and do XYZ crazy thing, but he's just a figurehead like everyone else so It'll all happen/not happen anyway. At least with him in office we'll get some comic relief before the next North American civil war.

       Trump is on his own side. The guy took legal action to get rid of a few wind turbines on an adjacent property because he thought it made his golf resort view look ugly. That tells you everything you need to know.

       And? It still tells you what kind of person he is. A self-centred self-entitled capitalist who demands everyone bend over backwards for him because he has a lot of money, and who cares more about a golfing view than the environment. If that's the type of man you want running your country then it's no surprise you're in the mess you're in right now.

       The world has always been "crazy"; however, at the moment it happens to be trending vaguely in a crazier direction while at the same time we are becoming increasingly capable of comprehensively understanding exactly HOW crazy it is, which is why you feel this way.  Just remember that worrying about shit constantly isn't very helpful.

       I agree with a lot of opinion here.  Always been crazy.  Information flows so quickly now that we are getting bombarded with the info faster, so it just seems like more.  All is not lost though.  Just gotta find a way to survive for a while if people start losing it and killing each other.

       Only if you're an idiot.  Personally, I love violence and death, and am highly disappointed we aren't directly engaged in more conflicts.  I'm seriously hoping we take a more active approach in Syria, like a full invasion.
