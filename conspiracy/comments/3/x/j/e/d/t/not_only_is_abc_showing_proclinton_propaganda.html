<p>It will be Hillary vs. Trump and Hillary will win because they will make Trump look like a racist. We will have our 1st Queen of the Republic. God help us with this evil cunt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you didn&#39;t know that they are neck and neck. Bernie has a 12 point lead over her in the state where last night&#39;s debate was held, New Hampshire, and in Iowa, a key state, he&#39;s behind her 5 points with an over 5 point margin of error. So it&#39;s absolutely neck and neck. Way too early to call the race, especially when you clearly aren&#39;t following it closely.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like Obama, but he doesn&#39;t wildly fling insults at countries he doesn&#39;t like, and I at least respect him as an adult for doing that. Trump does not act like an adult in my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not even remotely close to a Burnie supporter but this game has been rigged for years. Remember when Ron Paul won a few primaries and was polling in the top 2 or 3 of the Republicans? Or when he was the only candidate polling to be able to beat Obama last election?  No?  Of course you don&#39;t. This two party system is an Oligarch. It&#39;s not about us, it&#39;s about controlling us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The system is changing due to social media and people distrusting MSM more and more. If Ron Paul was running this cycle I bet he would do much better. And if Bernie was running last cycle we might never hear about him. </p>

<p>So I get that it&#39;s easy to be defeatist, but the internet is still so new, and we still have a ways to go until most people in the country grew up using it, which I think is a good thing (it&#39;s a good thing to have grown up with it.)</p>
