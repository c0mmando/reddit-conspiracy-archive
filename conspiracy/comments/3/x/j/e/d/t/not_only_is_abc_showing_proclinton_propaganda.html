       All this BS show and tell display is just a facade. She has the approval of the finalist on presidential run as Democrat with the endorsement tag of the Bilderberg Group. If you don't have that, and Bernie doesn't apparently. It is all done and said.

       Maybe you didn't know that they are neck and neck. Bernie has a 12 point lead over her in the state where last night's debate was held, New Hampshire, and in Iowa, a key state, he's behind her 5 points with an over 5 point margin of error. So it's absolutely neck and neck. Way too early to call the race, especially when you clearly aren't following it closely.

       I mean, I think it's not appropriate for someone who hopes to lead a country to continuously trash talk one of your two neighboring countries. He doesn't have to like Mexico, but he can at least be polite about the situation.

       I don't like Obama, but he doesn't wildly fling insults at countries he doesn't like, and I at least respect him as an adult for doing that. Trump does not act like an adult in my opinion.

       That's why I always wait till it comes out on youtube.  No need for live stream anymore, so what if it's couple hours late.  At least you don't have to deal with the tedious commercials all the time.

       I am not even remotely close to a Burnie supporter but this game has been rigged for years. Remember when Ron Paul won a few primaries and was polling in the top 2 or 3 of the Republicans? Or when he was the only candidate polling to be able to beat Obama last election?  No?  Of course you don't. This two party system is an Oligarch. It's not about us, it's about controlling us.

       The system is changing due to social media and people distrusting MSM more and more. If Ron Paul was running this cycle I bet he would do much better. And if Bernie was running last cycle we might never hear about him.

       So I get that it's easy to be defeatist, but the internet is still so new, and we still have a ways to go until most people in the country grew up using it, which I think is a good thing (it's a good thing to have grown up with it.)
