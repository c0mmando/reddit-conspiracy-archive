<p>Please someone ELI5 how the Republicans can have 17 people competing for the presidency, while the Democrats only have 3, if they haven&#39;t already chosen their nominee behind closed doors.</p>

<p>This is not democracy, this is a group of rich donors meeting behind closed doors to select the nominee in spite of what the American people want.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that Trump can&#39;t be controlled. It&#39;s all the skeletons in the White House that he could easily blab about and not give a single fuck. That&#39;s what they can&#39;t risk.</p>

<p>I seriously suspect someone will make an attempt on his life to prevent him from getting that far, if he&#39;s still the leader in the primaries.</p>

<p>It will be very intersting to see how they deal with Trump. I can&#39;t quite tell if it is all a trick to make us think Trump is not an insider, or if the establishment really doesn&#39;t want him. I suspect the later. But if so I wonder how they will unseat him? Perhaps they can&#39;t. In which case I fully expect the RNC to secretly support Hilary.</p>

<p>Yep. She was given the 2016 nomination in exchange for stepping down in 2008. Since she is so openly hostile to anything desirable, they have to hide her until June of next year so that it appears believable that she receives the nomination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The MSM has been pro Clinton from the beginning. They immediately got her email scandals out of the way so it wouldn&#39;t become an issue just before the actual &quot;election&quot;. </p>

<p>Trump has destroyed the repub credibility and drew all the MSM attention away from their only respectable candidate, Rand Paul. This, of course was by design. Trump is the hired clown, the bullshit fake candidate.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the MSM has been in full Clinton kiss ass mode while ignoring the only respectable candidate on the Dems side, Bernie Sanders.</p>

<p>The MSM narrative that Clinton is &quot;Americas Darling&quot; will be the false history of why she won. Guaranteed, the electronic ballot boxes will be fixed and flipping votes like flap jacks at a country fair breakfast. Clinton will win in districts where she absolutely shouldn&#39;t have. If Clinton wins, I have a feeling it will be even worse than the W Bush years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what, I&#39;ll put my tin-foil hat on today. I can&#39;t find anyone else saying that that whole debate was a farce, and that ABC means All Behind Clinton. ABC wasn&#39;t even trying to make it deniable. They showed the Hillary supporters camp first, tried to interview that little old lady, and waited until the end to show the Bernie camp, when everyone would have tuned out already, especially as the debate was over, and even I wanted to stop watching. The panels were amazingly biased, tried to insert Trumps name into the discussion way more than he really needed to be. In fact, mentions of Trump basically show that ABC was trying to imply that Bernie shouldn&#39;t be taken seriously by anyone, this is in the bag for Hillary, you should just vote for the inevitable. It was disgusting that ABC couldn&#39;t find a moderator who could remember who to pronounce Sanders. Mr. Saunders anyone? You had one job, to interact with the 3 prospective nominees for the most important office in the land. You&#39;re a news person, and you can&#39;t be bothered with pronouncing a major candidate&#39;s name correctly. That smacked of &#39;planned&#39;. Ask that guy why he pronounced it that way, and any answer he gives should be justification for that guy losing his job. He is either incompetent or he is doing the bidding of his corporate overlords. </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;
There was at one point where one guy on Stephanopoulos&#39;s panel said &quot;Bernie is a Hawk&quot;. Senator Sanders was a fricking conscientious objector, and this guy gets away with calling him a hawk? Don&#39;t get me started on how the rules apply to everyone except for Hillary, and how Bernie was the only one who would listen to the moderators at all, how the quality of questions, and the expectations of the answers differed from candidate to candidate, how O&#39;Malley looked like his job was to just act incensed whenever Bernie ever said anything, regardless of what he said. Or the scheduling of this debate during the same weekend as the new Star Wars premier, on a Saturday in December when there&#39;s football on. ABC at the very least shouldn&#39;t be allowed to host debates anymore, the quality is just horrible, and there&#39;s all this added commentary that just blatantly pushes their biases. </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;
Maybe I watched a different debate than the rest of you guys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate these types of post, it&#39;s completely retarded to think you yourself classify as &quot;The American People&quot; lol. Do you know how many minorities are literally scared shitless that a person like Donald Trump or any Republican wins office?</p>

<p>This is why I love conspiracy realm, it goes off on all these bat shit crazy angles but majority of you just want power back in the same people who oppress the minorities and inadvertently their own, instead of someone as liberal as Obama coming back into office.</p>

<p>You use 9/11 as means to somehow connect this big conspiracy started by the exact same party that&#39;s been linked to every fucking conspiracy in the past caught with their hands in the cookie jar and then go on to call yourself and the people like you, &quot;The American People&quot;. The only thing your resisting is reality, that shit doesn&#39;t have to be all about rich, white, men. Get over it. Donald Trump is put there to expel the garbage rhteroic and overall ideals of the Republican party to the forefront. To wake voters up to the fact that- that is what the Republican party is, a big fat racist party.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Never before in the history of our State have Oregonians had so much to be congratulated upon. No State in the Union is receiving more attention. Her agricultural products, her mild climate,her great natural resources, invite the immigrant, the capitalist and the pleasure seeker, while the sound basis upon which rest her finances, and the fact that within two years her taxable property has increased more than ten millions of dollars, clearly indicate that the State, in the face of a general business depression throughout the land, is in no danger of deterioration of decay.&quot;
