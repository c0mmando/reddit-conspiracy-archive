       It starts off with ABC "checking in" on a pro-Hilary watch party that was clearly done on purpose and then during the second break switches to a Sanders reporter who got cut off after 5 seconds of talking, then the next break is with that same pro-Hilary party we saw during the beginning! I seriously had to turn it off after that. They don't even try to fucking hide their obvious agenda that involves putting Clinton into power.

       there is definitely a recognition that this is a national (if not global) stage.  and that a certain level of mutual decorum is entirely appropriate among contenders.  that does not mean that everyone is playing on the same team, or even agrees.

       I'm pretty sure Sanders has supported wars in the past - supports Israel, and supported the Assault Weapons Ban in the 90s. He is just an authoritarian team-player like the rest of them.

       Rifles are used in a tiny fraction of gun violence cases; the vast majority of gun violence cases are done with handguns. Creating a new definition of firearms and placing "assault" in front of it is simply fear mongering.

       Good job I haven't mentioned gun violence then (y) And what are you talking about? Assault Rifle is a well defined term referring to a rifle capable of selective fire, typically including automatic action, with a detachable magazine. I think I have made my point fairly clearly that the US is quite the anomaly (especially in 'The West') when it comes to allowing access to such weapons as part of the general civilian arsenal.

       Select fire weapons haven't been manufactured for civilians since 1986 and every select fire or automatic weapon in the US has required registration of it's owner since 1934 and only 2 times in that whole period has one of these weapons been used in a crime and one of the two was a police officer.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please tell me how banning legal assault rifles which have almost never been used in criminal violence is going to have any impact on gun violence?

       Well the problem is that there are two separate issues. General gun violence and mass shootings. I agree that banning assault weapons is unlikely to greatly reduce gun violence in the US as the country is flooded with weapons already and as you rightly point out the majority of violence is an attritional process with a multitude of small events using smaller-sized weapons such as handguns etc. This is why I do try to take a wider holistic view of gun control in the US but also why I try to stay away from discussing it (unless drawn into it as I have here haha) as I understand it is very much a cultural issue that I will never understand as an outsider.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the issue of mass-shooting is what draws attention so this is where most of the media and political pressure ends up being applied. Again you're right that the majority of massacres are actually conducted using semi-auto weapons that would not be affected by banning assault weapons. This doesn't matter though. Do you honestly expect the media and government to put forwards a rational response to such an emotional topic? Ultimately assault weapons are
       <em>
        perceived
       </em>
       (i.e. your own opinion/factual reality is less important here) to be the more dangerous. They are
       <em>
        seen
       </em>
       as having a high rate of fire, are easy to rapidly reload, and can general cause an awful lot of destruction in fairly short order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway I'm done with guns for now I can see this is evidently pricking a lot of people. I will leave

       Yes and when buying personal ammunition citizens must provide identification, proof of address, and criminal background check. They are then permitted to buy ammunition for guns they are
       <em>
        legally allowed to own
       </em>
       . Ammunition for the militia rifles that are privately owned is limited to government-approved shooting ranges and must be used on site. Why do people argue this so much? Is it not just common sense that it's a good idea to have some regulations and restrictions on the purchasing and use of deadly weapons?

       There is a reason that we are one of the progenitors of the idea of liberty.  For a brief time in the late 20th century, we almost lived up to all ideals simultaneously.

       There is no populist logic behind the idea that a militaristic state should wield much more powerful weapons than its citizens.  It serves only to prevent revolution should an authoritarian oligarchy run off the rails.

       Hilary and her policies are just as bad if not actually worse than a lot of the current rep. candidates, if you really think Hilary is the answer to how to fix how fucked up your country has become then things are even worse than i thought.

       Voting in America is more like a sporting game than rational decision making. If Trump makes the Republican ticket then Republicans will tick the Republican box, no matter that Trump's an unqualified racist bigoted idiot. If Bernie runs independent he will steal Democrats from Hilary and the democrat vote will be split in half. Trump would win. It's stupid but it's how American politics works.

       You misunderstand me.  I'm not saying she would be an excellent president.  Hell, I'm camp Sanders all the way, as he's the only candidate who actually seems genuine.  Ok, Trump does too, but he's a complete asshat.  At this point, Sanders is my first and only choice.  But if it comes down to it, yes I do think Hillary is the better choice against any of the Republicans.  It would be a giant douche vs. a turd sandwich, but isn't that usually the case anyway.

       I guess I underestimated just how unpopular Hillary is on this sub.  I never said I think she would be great.  I thought I made it pretty clear I'm not overly fond of her, and you're making me out to be a Hillary supporter.  Maybe not you specifically but that one guy sure is.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the same token, I think you underestimate just how much I can't stand most of the candidates on the right.  Carson's an idiot savant, Fiorina's more of a liar than Hillary, and Bush is well, Bush.  As a New Jersey native I can tell you Christie is petty and vindictive and overly arrogant, and Rand Paul is a pompous ass who I'll never forgive for his response to Hurricane Sandy.  I mean I've met rabid Star Wars fans that like Jar Jar more than I like Trump or Cruz.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rubio's the only Republican that has any chance that I would consider voting for, and even he is, at best, just as phony as Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, I would be willing to cast a vote for Clinton if it means keeping someone I see as even worse out of the White House.  Please don't make me out to be a Clinton supporter.  I'm not.  I just happen to think the other side is a hell of a lot worse.  Hopefully Sanders gets the nomination and I don't have to bite the bullet.  As it stands, he's the only candidate I think positively of.  Period.

       Can someone please explain it to me how the Republicans can have 17 candidates, and 2 debates each time, but the Democrats only have 3 candidates?  What about people like Tulsi Gabbard, why isn't she running for president?  The DNC has clearly already decided to make Hillary the nominee, before the American people have even cast their first vote.

       The DNC has already determined the nominee by limiting the options.  Democrats are allowing it to happen, and that's the part that doesn't make sense to me.  The DNC believes it knows what's best, and apparently the Democrats agree.

       Do what?  This is the first time I've ever heard this claim.  She is the vice DNC chairwoman, I find it hard to believe she could take such a conservative approach on LGBT issues and be selected for the vice DNC chairwoman.  If you have a source for this, please share it.

       Regardless, even is this is true, her positions on the things that actually matter in this world, and LGBT rights are not one of the things that actually fucking matter, I support her.

       Eh. Some of that was Bernie being genuinely respectful for his wife, and acknowledging how the role of First Lady has changed since Hillary held that position.

       What was ridiculous was Muir allowing Clinton to have the last word for literally everything. Allowing Clinton to talk over the moderators without interruption, yet Sanders got shut down when he would try to reply at times. Clinton positioned at center. Clinton allowed to walk in late, during a question, and somehow it's treated as funny and not disrespectful. This debate showed obvious favoritism towards Hilary. It sucks, but she's got the support already.

       On the surface, gerrymandering drastically skews the results in favor of incumbents. Superdelegates protect the established party structure without any accountability to the people. Winner-takes-all format for the Electoral College makes voting in the duopoly run-off pointless for the majority of citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Underneath the surface, Diebold voting machines are unauditable and unaccountable. I would truly find it more surprising if these machines are
       <em>
        not

       being exploited by power brokers to position their favored candidates. This is simple human nature.

       this is why I find trump hilarious. They obviously meant to do the same thing with jeb, and it backfired horrifically. The icing on the cake would be jeb somehow winning the primary at this point, to face hillary in the scripted election, despite having only 3% of the vote.

       That's a pretty big leap of logic you just made.  I do think that corruption exists within the government and I do think they're largely incompetent.  I just don't need to believe in conspiracies to see that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think an example would better illustrate what I mean.  There are some who believe 9/11 was an inside job.  I personally don't think the evidence holds up all that well, but I do think our government took advantage of the fear that came with it to convince the populace we should go to war in Iraq.  The biggest difference between you and I is that you think the government causes a lot of these events whereas I think they simply take advantage of these events.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, they'd have to be pretty damn competent to keep so many conspiracies under wrap for so long.

       Its funny, people claim the government is incompetent and inefficient (which it is) yet seem to have a hard time grasping that this same incompetence makes it unlikely that some of the more outlandish conspiracy theories out there could ever actually be managed in reality.

       The government is a very intricate machine. It's like saying a car can't have an amazing transmission but a shitty motor. All parts are not equal. This is true with government agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know for a fact the bureaucratic parts are shitty. Your local DMV is probably a hellhole of barely competent people working at a snails pace. Similar with other federal agencies, like TSA and DHS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we also know several black projects go on with utmost secrecy. The U-2 spy plane was one such project. Did it get leaked before by all the people working on it?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's countless shit in Groom Lake that we will never know the details of. Has anything leaked there? So clearly the government can keep secrets if they want.

       You are completely right, but it does depend on the department. I wonder if there is any evidence around to contrast and compare different departments like the FBI and the DoD? I have a feeling the black projects conducted by the DoD are
       <em>
        by far
       </em>
       the most restricted and controlled, especially projects like U-2 which represent a major tool to be used against other great powers.

       Hilary is bad. Trump is worse. Sanders seems the best option from where I'm standing. However, even though he's hardly a Zionist, Sanders is nevertheless Jewish, and in my opinion I think this will stop him coming down as hard as he should against Israel.

       Sure: Sanders will suffer a media blackout like Ron Paul did, the media will misrepresent poll numbers to make him look less popular than he is, Sanders supporters will become discouraged and give up, Hillary will cruise to victory in the primaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whoever her opponent is in the general election (it doesn't matter) will receive 45-48% of the popular vote and ~200 electoral college votes while Hillary receives ~300.

       Besides the points about media blackout and misrepresenting poll numbers I think your predictions are more or less in line with mainstream projections at this point as well. If it's all a big puppet show, I think you should be able to point to who the Republican candidate will be as well.

       It's interesting. The attraction to Hilary seems to be
       <em>
        entirely
       </em>
       a media construct. Here in the UK a Labour politician went on a brief bit about how excellent it would be if/when Hilary wins, a female president of the USA! Her passionate speech was met with
       <em>
        absolute silence
       </em>
       . Fucking hilarious. I do hope the people manage to overcome the attempts to control this election, though I do also
       <em>
        kind of
       </em>
       hope Trump wins.

       I suppose I'm referring to this whole campaign in general, but because the manipulation is so blatant, I think it's done a fine job in waking up a number of people to just how fixed it all is. So in that respect, I don't mind it.

       Or how most of her questions brought her to the false flag issue and Radicalization? She has a military agenda and an anti gun anti constitution agenda and the moderator catered to it. Where are the issues? NSA? Citizens United? CISPA? Free Speech? Dirty Money in Politics? Refugees? Student loan Debt? Wealth inequality? Bank bailouts? Police Brutality? Civil Forfeiture? WTF!

       Sanders is a strawman candidate, brought in to give the impression that it isn't a coronation. Except that Clintons numbers have tanked and Sanders could actually take it. Now the Democratic Party and the MSM has to maneuver the situation to where it could be plausible for Clinton to take it.

       hate to say it as a trump supporter but the baby boomers are going to vote for Billary in droves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary = Bill to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       and them remember those Bill Clinton years fondly.

       All the vegas gambling websites favor Hillary to win the Presidency by a large margin... and those are the people who are willing to take bets so they are actually putting their money where their mouth is.

       We should not be bothered because we know that it is all just bs to legitmize the stealing of funds from the public and our resultant enslavement.

       It seems like they have switched to making it super-obvious to turn non-brain-dead people away from politics. You can either join the 2-headed "PARTY" or you can remain a slave.

       Eh. Some of that was Bernie being genuinely respectful for his wife, and acknowledging how the role of First Lady has changed since Hillary held that position.
      </p>
      <p>
       What was ridiculous was Muir allowing Clinton to have the last word for literally everything. Allowing Clinton to talk over the moderators without interruption, yet Sanders got shut down when he would try to reply at times. Clinton positioned at center. Clinton allowed to walk in late, during a question, and somehow it's treated as funny and not disrespectful. This debate showed obvious favoritism towards Hilary. It sucks, but she's got the support already.
