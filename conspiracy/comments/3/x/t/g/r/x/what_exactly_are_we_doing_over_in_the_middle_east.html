       This is what I believe is happening. What I believe the West (mostly America with it's close Allies) does is target poor but environmentally rich countries. First they try to get them to take a loan (mostly IMF loans) by bribing the leaders and other officials. This loan of course fucks the country over completely, like three times over.
      </p>
      <p>
       The money is never actually in control of by the country; instead the IMF decides where the money should go (oil production and some things to make them look good). The money made from the countries resources all go into the pockets of mega corporations like 7-Eleven, Shell and others, except some money is kept for the corrupt leaders (it's funny how we always claim dictators to be corrupt, but never realize to be corrupt you need to be corrupted by someone).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there is the huge debt that the country now has to pay so to cover the loan. The sum of money invested is always so large that it would take countries decades to repay. It's complete financial stranglehold and there are many examples of countries where you see this and the devastating effects the IMF loans seem to have. Of course recently there has been Greece and Tunisia, but people are not really aware of the investing and exploitation of natural resources in West Africa.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, when countries do not want the IMF loan, when the leaders refuse and stand behind their people what happens? First they go the full mile to convince him to take the loan. These are not stupid people and they do not want to make much of scene. This includes smear campaigns; paid rioters; we've seen this with every major leader that for some reason people loved. Take Hugo Chavez; he was loved by many in Venezuela. Even in his third term he got around 67% of the votes. However we in the West are lead to believe he is some insane guy that mistreats his people. This is because he would not budge; he knew the resource of Venezuela belongs to the Venezuelan people and that money earned from said resources should be taxed and profited by the people. When the smear campaign doesn't work like it did with Chavez you'll get staged coups. Like the 2002 coup d'etat attempt. It was supposedly the Venezualian government and the poor (vast majority of Venezuela) against the people that felt they were getting too Cubanized. Well, that failed as well but the battle still goes on there for the resources. But here's the kicker; they have no ability to send troops there because the South Americans are not our enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Middle Eastern people are though luckily enough for the rich of the rich. So for the many countries that did not get pulled into an IMF loan there are so many opportunities to have military interventions; proxy or otherwise. Syria of course being the biggest deal right now but Yemen is getting pretty much the same treatment. Yemen agreed to the IMF loan in 2014 but to this date has not received it; they backed out. So now they get nuclear missiles dropped on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Syria Assad is obviously refusing any help from the West and would rather go the Eurasian route. The USSR was the bulwark against the Western imperialism but when they fell there was no one to stop the West from taking more and more. Now Russia is back and it's kicking up a lot of dust. I honestly have no idea what will happen since this is an unprecedented situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm no lover of Russian international policy but I am happy to see them stand up against the imperialism that my own country participates in.

       Pretty much this.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2003 there were four Middle Eastern countries that were A) enemies of Israel and B) considered credible threats by Israel:
      </p>
      <p>
       Iraq, Libya, Syria and Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2003, Israeli Prime Minister said:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/sharon-says-u-s-should-also-disarm-iran-libya-and-syria-1.18707">
         Sharon Says U.S. Should Also Disarm Iran, Libya and Syria
        </a>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       What has happened to those countries in the interim?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course there are other players involved with their own interests, but essentially, the reshaping of the Middle East to serve Zionist interests has been the primary driving factor.

       Cycling through weapon stockpiles to keep the arms manufacturers in business :v I think there's more than a small amount of testing going on as well. People are becoming increasingly aware of the potential for another world conflict (not least over Arctic resources) so much like the Spanish civil war, the great powers are looking for any and all opportunities to figure out the best ways of using all their fancy new weapons. Russia for instance is most certainly formulating and finalizing its own

       I alsways like to think maybe that there is a small chance its something ancient human history related or ET related somehow. Seems like all the powers that be just can't stay out of there. Has to be more than a bunch of oil and people shooting each other to keep us there for so long.

       Maybe we should just let them have their silly Caliphate on the condition of some basic human rights and limited militarization. We may not much care for their way of life, especially at first, but so what? One in the hand is better than two in bush, so to speak. In time I fully expect they're laws will mellow just as they are slowly doing in Iran due to the inexorable sway of modernity.

       I'm not sure if you'll be able to grasp the full breadth of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East (nations included, but not limited to: Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, UAE, Yemen), from a question on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Foreign policy is an exceptionally broad term. Foreign policy toward
another country can include immigration, economic assistance, intelligence sharing, health initiatives, and much more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you more curious about the American wars in Iraq and Afghanistan?  Or current drone campaigns in Pakistan and Somalia?  Or the proxy war that is occurring right now in Syria?  There are these and so many more things that "we're doing" in the Middle East.

       People tell you it's about oil or money, but that's a lie. It's a battle to establish global Sharia law and bring about the Caliphate. Western Leaders are on the side of the Sunni Islamic tribes (especially ISIS).

       Yep. Exactly my point. They aren't the ones driving it. It's the Western (Russia is Western) Leaders who are trying to create the caliphate.
