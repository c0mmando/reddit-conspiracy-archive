    <div class="md"><p>Since your post is shit, I am actually going to post what, for me, is proof that the moon landing was staged. </p>

<p>My grandfather was a shipbuilder during WWII. He was responsible for installing galleys on Merchant Marine ships and later in the war he moved to the Civil Air Patrol where he met Jean-Claude Molineaux, a French ex-patriot who had been developing airplanes for the French government about six years prior to the Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk. At the time my grandfather met him, Molineaux was testing his experimental jet engines on the home front with C.A.P. pilots. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t long before my grandfather began working as Molineaux&#39;s assistant. Within the next ten months, my grandfather learned the ins and outs of Molineaux&#39;s workshop and also possessed a prowess for great ideas. It was my grandfather&#39;s proposal to put fighter jets over the Pacific in early 1944. By 1946, top brass had their eye on him, eventually moving him, through the OSS, to a town outside of Fairbanks, Alaska to work on the first bona fide spacecraft. </p>

<p>My grandfather and Molineaux, who was now his assistant, had completed work on two identical space crafts, each which used a different type of fuel. They had already done countless test flights on a variety of prototypes, several of which made it well out of Earth&#39;s atmosphere only to get stuck in orbit.</p>

<p>It was New Year&#39;s Day,1949, two years after moving to Fairbanks, and my grandfather was six months behind on his goal to reach the moon on summer solstice, 1948. Up to the day he died, he told my father that he could have done it if not for budgetary setbacks. </p>

<p>There they were on an open plain in Fairbanks on New Year&#39;s Day, mere hours from the flight that they all thought would surely make it to the moon. The auroras were particularly visible that night, although my grandfather&#39;s camera didn&#39;t pick them up. The first pilot was a man named Michael McIntire, but they all called him Mickey Mouse. He was a friend of my grandfather and somebody he talked about very often. The second was Thomas Tippermann, a Canadian fighter pilot who was nothing short of ecstatic about his upcoming mission. My father still has a photo taken of McIntire that night, wearing his space suit and helmet which had Mickey Mouse painted on the front. </p>

<p>Tippermann&#39;s craft was launched first, at approximately 2:00AM. My grandfather wrote that he and Molineaux both knew that it would not be a successful flight. This was a craft with an alternative fuel that was ordered by high command, despite my grandfather&#39;s insistence that it could not sustain the weight of the craft. </p>

<p>Tippermann&#39;s craft burned up its fuel within moments of launch and crashed several miles from the launch site. Tippermann miraculously survived. My father has photographs of him at the crash site, smiling. My father also has a piece of the craft&#39;s metal skin that Tippermann took as a souvenir and left to my grandfather after he committed suicide the morning after the flight. My father now has the piece of the craft along with the somewhat eerie telegram from Tippermann that says &quot;Took this to remember Pass to JC when you go&quot;.  </p>

<p>It was closing in on 4:00AM, an hour after McIntire&#39;s scheduled flight, and tensions were growing. McIntire was not as optimistic as he was earlier in the night, though as expected, his craft had a perfect launch. McIntire maintained radio contact with my grandfather for the duration of the flight. As his craft approached the moon, tensions once again grew high, but the landing was, just like the launch, flawless. </p>

<p>McIntire&#39;s craft was supplied with enough fuel for a return flight, but to his shock, it appeared that much of it had leaked our after landing. He was stuck. At this time my grandfather was given orders to cut off all communications with McIntire, and he did. He said repeatedly, every time he told the story, that it was the biggest regret of his life, to which my grandmother would make a sarcastic joke about how him hitting her throughout the sixties and seventies wasn&#39;t something he should regret. </p>

<p>By the late 1960s, my grandfather was out of the game for the most part. Molineaux died when am automobile driven by the drunken son of a brigadier general struck him at an intersection. No funeral was held. My grandfather was sent to New York for a year after that to maintain a military archive. He said it was a desk job with no paperwork, no duties, and no human interaction. That was the year that the space program died. That is also the year that the story gets interesting. </p>

<p>My grandfather took the plans to his crafts. He also took the recipe for the fuel he had invented. Molineaux&#39;s sister who lived outside of Marseilles at the time, was married to a man who robbed banks as a child and came to own a bank in adulthood. This man, Frederic DeTrez, hid these files for nearly four years as my grandfather negotiated with high command. </p>

<p>A deal was struck. My grandfather was still revered amongst his former colleagues, despite the longstanding disagreement. My grandfather said that he did not want to live in a world, or have his children grow up in a world where Major General James O. Radley or his children could have anything to do with United States interests on the moon. Radley was a notorious drunk who caused the death of both Tippermann, through his insistence to use the ineffective fuel, and McIntire, for issuing the order to cut communications and for denying requests to launch a rescue craft.</p>

<p>The agreement specified that all United States activities regarding travel, exploration, resource mining, and settlement on the moon would be halted until 1996, at which point DeTrez would release the files to my grandfather or his next of kin, my father, to send to high command. When that time came, the government had little interest in traveling to the moon and we have not stepped foot on the moon ever since that night on New Year&#39;s Day in 1949. </p>

<p>High command kept my grandfather in the loop throughout the late sixties are were upfront about the whole event being staged. My grandfather&#39;s initial concern was that they were just saying it was staged but were actually planning on traveling to the moon in direct violation of their agreement. My grandfather was invited to the sound stage in New Jersey, right across the Hudson River from Manhattan, where the famous photograph would be taken. My grandfather saw the whole thing, from the setting up of the shoot to the development of the negatives and the first printings. Another neat item my dad has in his office is the first print of the famous moon landing photograph. </p>

<p>Anyway, there you have it. It&#39;s not the most action-packed tale in the world, but it&#39;ll get you there, that&#39;s for damn sure. Some people get their kicks from thinking about the moon. I get mine from good old-fashioned story telling. Of the fictional kind, that is. </p>
