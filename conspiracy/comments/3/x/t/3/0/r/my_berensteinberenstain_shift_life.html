       i never even watched sex and the city and i know there is no "in" in there. also, interview has also always been with
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       vampire.
      </p>
      <p>
       i don't know about these bears, cause apparently it's an American literature and I never heard of it before a few days ago in some video some guy was claiming idon'tevenknowhat ...
      </p>
      <p>
       so what exactly does this prove?

       I'm only going to pick out a few.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember
       <em>
        Smokey the bear
       </em>
       , "Go home Walter" definitely was said by Mike when Walt goes on his little rampage in an attempt to kill Gus, Fruit Loops became Froot Loops in the last 10 years at some point, it's always been "publicly" and "separate", chartreuse is a vomit green color, puce is like off salmon, and Jiffy (at least used to be) the Southern equivalent to Jif.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, maybe I'm in a minority here, but I've always remembered it as "Bearenstain Bears".

       HAHA. I actually always thought is was Bernstein. I first heard of this theory a few months ago, I have to say i find my self confused because I also watch the Simpsons religiously and they have said Bernstain twice. Ironically spell check does not recognize the latter.

       That's cause "Berenstain" is not a name.  Berenstein is.

       I sure as fuck would remember if it was pronounced and spelled "stain"

       mirror mirror on the wall/magic mirror - I don't think I've ever watched the Disney movie, but I've read the fairy tale, and I'm pretty certain it's 'mirror mirror'. It seems to be that way for every retell except for the Disney movie.

       Ok, I took out Home Depot and Hello Clarice because you seem to be right.  One of the things is though, regarding Smokey Bear and Barbra Streisand, is back in berenstein, there was no alternate version.  It was never 'Barbra' or 'Smokey Bear', I know it was 'they will come', disney's snow white said "mirror mirror" like the fairy tale, and it switched to Jif, I remember when it happened, I thought it was a legitimate corporate rebranding, but now I guess not.  Those ones you'll never convince me otherwise but thank you for pointing out two that I was wrong about, I appreciate it

       Hey no problem &lt;3! It's all very interesting and I really just like to help figure things out.
      </p>
      <p>
       We create nicknames all the time. I haven't even heard of Smokey the Bear since I was a child, until it started coming up again in these theories. And I haven't been keeping tabs on them. I'm not so certain that this is one to keep. Probably the Barbara one though. I never ate Jif peanut butter, so I don't really know well enough to convince you. I feel that way about most of these. I wasn't really too aware of any of them to be so sure of myself, except for Smokey, but I can easily see why they would drop the 'the'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm curious about when you remember Jif rebranding? And why would it be 'they will come' when it was only his father? Wasn't it?

       I grew up in CA, where we have a lot of fire, and I have never once heard anybody say "Smokey bear" in my entire life.  That one definitely changed, there was no alternate to "Smokey the Bear" back in berenstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jif thing, I remember noticing it changed, just like Looney Toons, but I assumed it was just a corporate thing where they changed the name because of some focus group or copyright lawsuit, but there is no records of these changes.  That's the crazy part, it's apparently always been this way, for all of these.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as Field of Dreams goes, I haven't even seen the movie, but I have heard that quote a thousand times.  It was famous, almost as famous as "Luke....I am your father" was.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you build it, they will come.  I used it not 6 months ago when i was talking to my boss about opening a new building for her business, because it's always been "they".  Except apparently not

       Yea, I've never heard the alternate for Smokey the Bear either. I wonder what they name him in schools now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard multiple people say 'they', but that could just be people misquoting it, picking it from other people, or changing it to fit the situation. I remember even choosing to use 'they' instead of 'he' when making jokes because it would be 'they' when talking about customers and stuff.

       im a bernstein native too.  how do you know this place sucks as bad as  our home?   imagine how much weve forgotten about our home.  anyway, strap on your tinfoil hat because i have a silly, and i mean SILLY theory about how this all came about:
      </p>
      <p>
       in the far future, maybe around the year 2278, time travel technology has been invented, but is still classified.  america is ruled by a tyrant dictator, who has instituted the near worship of himself and his lineage (much like todays kim jong-un).  the cabal of state funded scientists who discovered time travel conspired with another cabal of operatives much like todays CIA.  together they decided to rid history of the scourge of their ruthless dictator.  i order to do this in the most humane way possible, they decided to go back in time to the early 1800's.  one (or perhaps many) operatives took jobs as customs officials, watching for the ancestors of their modern day leader.  when the ancestors came through new york (probably), they were diverted to haiti.  thus ensuring that the kingdom they were so familiar with and hated so much never came to be.  in the process however, these time traveling, now customs officals, took other actions that had an unforeseeable outcomes.  when the author of the bernstein bears' relatives came through customs, their name was changed to berenstain instead.

       Haha ok well I did actually read it, it was very creative.  In reality, if you want to know who did this and how, look into the fact that CERN and Bilderberg were both founded in 1954, and what exactly the antimatter they produce in those particle accelerator experiments at the LHC does.
