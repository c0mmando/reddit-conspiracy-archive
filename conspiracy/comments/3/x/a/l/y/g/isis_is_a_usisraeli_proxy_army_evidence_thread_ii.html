        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>US intelligence has destabilized more than 15 countries over the last 65 years, usually with the technique of arming and funding the rebels, who then overthrow the government. Then they install a US/Israeli friendly governments, like in Iran in 1953, Chile in 1973, Afghanistan in 1979, Nicaragua in the 80s, Iraq, and many others. Here&#39;s a wiki list that includes most of them in detail. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_United_States_foreign_regime_change_actions">(link)</a></p>

<p>Now, keeping this well-documented historical knowledge in mind, let us consider the following things that have happened recently regarding ISIS and their relationship to the US and Israel. </p>

<hr/>

<p>ISIS was recently filmed owning US tents: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kji6Jnuj1XY">(link)</a></p>

<p>ISIS&#39;s fleet of vehicles is mostly made of Toyota Hilux trucks (Toyota Tacoma in the US) in part thanks to the Department of Defense. <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/10/the-u-s-government-supplied-isis-iconic-pickup-trucks.html">(link)</a></p>

<p>Do you remember when Turkey shot down the Russian plane? Why did Russia make more progress bombing ISIS in 3 days than the US did in 3 years? Because the US isn&#39;t actually trying to get rid of ISIS, in fact they inform them to evacuate buildings before they destroy them. <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=188_1411748599">(link)</a></p>

<p>ISIS sells $1.5 million a day of oil, which requires trains and pipelines that are known about and not destroyed by the US. The oil goes in to black markets in Turkey (conveniently overlooked by their corrupt government) and then is sold to later markets. <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/turkey-buying-oil-isis-after-downed-plane-putin-slams-islamic-states-black-market-2198214">(link)</a></p>

<p>Who are the later markets? Israel winds up with most of the ISIS oil. <a href="http://www.globes.co.il/en/article.aspx?did=1001084873">(link)</a></p>

<p>This fits in with the goals of Genie Energy drilling in the Golan Heights (as advised by Dick Cheney, Rupert Murdoch, Larry Summers, and Jacob Rothschild). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_Energy">(link)</a></p>

<p>Or Genel Energy, a similarly-named company funded by Nat Rothschild, doing a similar thing on the Iraq side of Syria, headquartered in Turkey. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genel_Energy">(link)</a></p>

<p>As if that wasn&#39;t obvious enough, an Israeli IDF colonel leading ISIS was publicly arrested in Iraq. <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/guess-who-is-behind-the-islamic-state-israeli-idf-colonel-leading-isis-terrorists-arrested-in-iraq/5483679">(link)</a> <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2015/10/19/breaking-israeli-general-commanding-isis-captured-in-iraq/">(link 2)</a></p>

<p>Why is the production quality so hollywood-like in the ISIS videos? Why are they so incredibly good at PR and messaging, right from the start?</p>

<p>The Director the Defense Intelligence Agency admits the US created ISIS in an interview. See 8:00 to 13:00. He clearly says the US knew about the rise of ISIS, armed them anyway, and did it deliberately to oust Assad. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SG3j8OYKgn4">(link)</a></p>

<p>General Wesley Clark: &quot;Our friends and allies funded ISIS to destroy Hezbollah&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHLqaSZPe98">(link)</a></p>

<p>Gen Wesley Clark again, saying he was told the US was going to overthrow 7 countries in 5 years, one of which included Syria: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw">(link)</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s John McCain, Lindsay Graham and Abdelhakim Belhadjr who has been promoted from an al-Qaeda operative to his current position as the head of ISIS in Libya. <a href="http://imgur.com/wAhcZjX">(link)</a>
Here&#39;s the story that goes with the photo. <a href="http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2015/03/05/libyan-fubar-john-mccains-libyan-moderate-abdelhakim-belhadj-has-joined-isis-now-heads-isis-through-libyan-dawn-construct/">(link)</a></p>

<p>ISIS posts the PR photos they took with John McCain in Syria. <a href="http://countercurrentnews.com/2014/06/isis-pr-mccain/">(link)</a></p>

<p>Henry Kissinger admits ISIS &quot;captures&quot; its weapons From U.S. Government. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryk3MWX7qJQ&amp;t=2m27s">(link)</a></p>

<p>Isis apparently takes control of US weapons airdrop intended for Kurds. Funny how that keeps happening. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/22/isis-us-airdrop-weapons-pentagon">(link)</a></p>

<p>Some politicians have been talking about this in a well-sourced way, but they are often ignored by the media. <a href="https://randpaul.com/failed-policies-weapons-to-isis-syrian--iraq">(link)</a></p>

<p>Putin talking about this. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQuceU3x2Ww">(link)</a></p>

<p>This is all to overthrow the Syrian government, so they can install their own government. Then they can install their own central bank, they can take over the war reconstruction process which is very profitable, and it would allow them to equip the Syrian army which is a big market for the arms manufacturers. Also they want a pipeline from Qatar to Turkey, and they want all the oil in Syria. Israel also wants a safe zone around it, and taking over Syria is part of that plan. It also weakens Russia and Iran, who are big supporters of Assad. The gains in power and profit to those running the war are of many types. The confluence of interests is what creates the atmosphere for war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post.  I agree with you 100%:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is all to overthrow the Syrian government, so they can install their own government. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>it&#39;s not about necessarily installing a new Syrian government, so much as it&#39;s about destroying syria to give a piece to Israel and a piece to the kurds.  It also takes out a potential iranian ally on the path to persia.  But all the stuff about reconstruction and LNG pipelines/ russian influence are dead on.</p>

Afghanistan and Iraq were so immediately reinstated with a centralized bank/currency (exchanging dollar on the dollar) quicker than you could say &quot;One World Bank.&quot; <a href="http://i.imgur.com/VhDNEPp.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/VhDNEPp.jpg</a> </p>

<p>The last countries in the world without a privately owned central bank when this video was made was:Iran, Libya, Syria, Egypt,  North Korea. Now it&#39;s just Iran, Syria, and North Korea. They&#39;re the only governments that don&#39;t have to put themselves in debt to create money, the means by which all over governments of the world are influenced, especially in the west. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a path towards slavery. </p>

<p>Get a community into debt, make them sell their assets to pay off the debt, then they are left owning absolutely nothing and end up selling their children into slavery. It is a tried and true method. </p>

<p>Trump is promising to get rid of our debt by selling off our national assets. He is a real estate developer. What do you think he has in mind for our national parks? Maybe we should ask the Indians who used to live there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly... North Korea is a topic that deserves its own sub but the battle for Iran is currently being waged behind sophisticated doors of &quot;code&quot; if you will. Specifically, case and point is Stuxnet, a US/Israeli quantum computing worm responsible for thwarting Iran nuclear activities (no link needed just google it). Mark my words it&#39;s just the beginning, Iran will be back in focus soon enough (under what exact focus by MSM, I do not know). Very great post btw with links at every key point, keep it up OP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If only you applied the same skepticism to sources that pander to your (literal) prejudice. It seems some people will lap up any nonsense, when it fits their preconceived belief system. </p>

<p>For instance, your claim &quot;an Israeli IDF colonel leading ISIS was publicly arrested in Iraq.&quot; The sole source for this, with no supporting evidence or follow-up - as would certainly have been the case had this actually happened? <a href="http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13940730000210">The Fars News Agency</a>, the same source which <a href="http://theiranproject.com/blog/2013/04/12/what-time-machine-iranian-news-agency-quietly-deletes-a-report-that-iran-had-built-one/">previously reported</a> a 27-year-old Iranian scientist had invented a machine that allowed people to see into the future. You also cite a Texas plumber&#39;s truck ending up in ISIS hands as somehow meaningful evidence &quot;ISIS is a US/Israeli Proxy Army&quot;? And you&#39;re surprised when people outside <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> won&#39;t take you seriously?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make some decent points. I got rid of the texas truck one, I was just trying to refer to pop culture to keep it interesting for people to read, it didn&#39;t fit in particularly well. Good call. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to have to keep the IDF leader leading ISIS story though, although many sites link back to the fars publication of the story on Oct 22, the original older source on Oct 19th is what I consider a credible source: <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2015/10/19/breaking-israeli-general-commanding-isis-captured-in-iraq/">http://www.veteranstoday.com/2015/10/19/breaking-israeli-general-commanding-isis-captured-in-iraq/</a></p>

<p>So it does seem to be a credible story so I&#39;m going to leave it for now.</p>

<p>The Foreign Affairs High Representative at the USA Parliament and Secretary General of the “DESI” European Department for Security and Information Ambassador Dr. HAISSAM BOU-SAID</p>

<p>&quot;The USA Parliament&quot;? Really? There&#39;s no such position, and if you Google the good Doctor&#39;s name...

    <div class="md"><p>I can see where people draw the lines, it&#39;s pretty easy. </p>

<p>But the official narrative, as bizarre as it is, makes a whole lot more sense than &quot;ISIS is a US/zionist conspiracy&quot;</p>

<p>2003: US invasion of Iraq, thus spawning the Iraqi insurgency which produced &quot;AQI&quot; - a Local branch of Al-queda which was largely a separate entity from Al Queda. Terrorist franchising isn&#39;t like McDonalds - If you want to start your own AQ faction you basically can. </p>

<p>2011: Syrian revolution happens. Seeing as Syria is a client state of Russia and the US can make some grounds with the then popular arab spring movement, the US officially supports the rebels. </p>

<p>2012/2013 the US started arming Syrian rebel groups. At this point it wasn&#39;t so clear who was going full wahhabi, so we started to train some. </p>

<p>At some point along the line ISIS split from Al-Nursa and became their own thing. members from the free syrian army started to defect to ISIS</p>

<p>They were never united to begin with.  The groups are cellular structured and operate in networks, which means there is constant fluidity of people, allegiance and transfers (finance and arms).  There was no real command center on the ground, which meant that oversight of weapons and cash flows was impossible.  This exacerbated divisions.  There is massive corruption throughout Syria and the war has made many very rich.   The population, as per my network contacts inside Syria, remains divided--both for and against the current regime in power. Given the division, the fragmentation and lack of unity among opposition and their not having gained legitimacy among the masses, result in opposition not be a viable alternative to the present regime.  Russia proposed in 2012 an alternative to Assad in transition, which gives him a face-saving way out. I do believe in the end, he will bow down to an alternative candidate.  The U.S. and Saudis dictating his removal before talks or coordination is not realistic and has more to do with their own power blocks among their domestic population.</p>

<p>Russias intervention in Syria isn&#39;t about ISIS. It was about getting rid of the pesky &quot;moderate&quot; (whomever that may be) rebels that were attacking Russia
<a href="http://www.interpretermag.com/putin-in-syria-even-isis-says-russia-is-not-bombing-isis/">Even ISIS says Russia wasn&#39;t attacking them</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/01/world/europe/russia-airstrikes-syria.html?_r=0">Russia is mainly bombing other rebels</a></p>

<p>Sure, did US arms get into ISIS hands? Yes. It&#39;s not that hard given the fluidity of the networks in that region or the fact that Iraq i soldiers abandoned their posts.  Is ISIS a result of US foreign policy? Questionably. Some people say that the Islamist roots were growing when Saddam was in power. Wahhabism is nothing new. </p>

<p>Are Saudis hands implicated? Yes. They are. But what do we say? &quot;Fuck you Saudi?&quot; They are a huge partner, for better or worse.  Same with Turkey. Outing them isn&#39;t that easy. </p>

<p>And what does anyone, especially the US want in Iraq or Syria in 2015? Is it oil? Because the US has hit a shale boom. This war is purely about geopolitics.</p>

<p>Besides, Russia and the US look like they are on the verge of cooperating. <a href="http://tass.ru/en/world/772195">US and Russia agree to no regime change in Syria</a></p>

<p>Russia needs Syria as a warm water port. That&#39;s it. They loose Syria, their ability to back up any other ME country in the geopolitical world is over. </p>

<p>Also, that truck ended up in turkey from an Auction. We sell trucks overseas routinely. Nothing crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh ISIS has been around since 1999 not the 2012/2013 you&#39;re claiming (although under a different name). They certainly did not split up from the Al-Nusra. ISI supported Al-Nusra during the Arab Spring but soon stopped working together due to political differences (Al Qaida wasn&#39;t very happy with ISI killing innocent people instead of fighting the army). Oh and Jabhat al-Nusra has only been active since 2012...</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know where you&#39;re getting all this disinformation from but it&#39;s totally illegitimate. You&#39;re basing your theory on stuff that&#39;s just wrong. </p>

<p>I very much support the idea that a lot of these groups get propped up due to the conflicts there (as in I don&#39;t believe they&#39;re solely formed by Western governments). And I do agree that Syria for Russia seems like it would be a great military asset.</p>

<p>There&#39;s just a lot of stuff you got wrong. Also yeah Russia is bombing all the rebel groups in Syria because that is what Assad asked of them. These awesome rebel groups that want to install sharia law in Syria. Maybe Assad, you know, would not like a civil war there anymore. Or have his country be taken over by militant zealots.</p>

<p>edit: just read the comments in the last link to see how dumb and confused people are in general. It&#39;s sad.</p>

<p>The Crazy part is that there is much good intention behind this, but as we are told,  &quot;the road to hell is paved with good intentions!&quot;</p>

<p>Read this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why all the secrecy?</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Due to the severity of the situation it is mandatory to maintain public calm for as long as possible. The Earth is dying. Humanity is on the road to extinction – without the Shield mankind will die off with in 20 to 50 years. Most people alive today could live to see this extinction take place. This means that an announcement of the situation we face boils down to telling every man, woman and child on earth that they have no future, they are going to be killed. People would panic. There would be economic collapse, the production and movement of goods would collapse. Millions would die in all cities on earth, riots and violence would reduce civilian centers to rubble within days. Half of the population in dense metropolitan areas would try to leave the cities seeking &#39;safety&#39; in the rural areas thinking that they would be safe. Those left behind in the cities would be at war with their neighbors, fighting for the remaining supplies. We would be telling the world that the world is coming to an end, and even with the Shield the chances of survival are small.</p>

<p>UV Summer and Global Warming are the immediate problems we face, there are far greater problems that are raising their ugly heads and will present new problems which in some cases have no viable solutions at this time. Ecologies are collapsing. The extinction rate of species is climbing. The amount of chemical pollutants in the water and soil are fast approaching and in many places has surpassed the earth&#39;s ability to heal itself. Crop failure is on the rise, even in the USA the returns on crops are smaller than they were 10 years ago. Even with the advances in genetically altered food crops, we are falling behind in our ability to produce enough to go around. Throughout the 20th century chemical fertilizers and pesticides were used to insure the best yields. Unfortunately many of these have contaminated ground water, killed beneficial insects along with the undesirable insects. These chemicals have gotten into the food chain and are affected other species besides mankind. It is only a matter of years before famine spreads like a cancer throughout the world.</p>

<p>Clean fresh water is in short supply, in many places well water is non-potable, containing the run off of pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers that have been used on crops and lawns. The water treatment facilities we have are unable to scrub out all of the toxins we have placed in the soil and water supply. Many of the toxins we find build up over time in the body, a long slow poisoning which has been making its presence felt in many areas of the world in the form of cancers, leukemia, sterility, birth defects, learning disorders, immune deficiency problems, etc. These are on the rise, any good researcher can find the records. For decades there was public outcry for the end to pollution. For every small step we made to clean up our production, millions where born who added to the problem. Yes, pollution is down per individual, however there are a couple more billion individuals producing pollution, thus the real numbers have an increase in over all pollution produced. Name a city that does not have problems with smog. You would be hard pressed to find one. Though smog controls on automobiles is higher than ever before, the number of autos on the road has increased thus the amount of smog producing pollutants is higher than ever before. All the clean air acts passed to curb individual factory and auto emissions did not address the production of more factories and more autos. </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Here an uneasy compromise was made between the need to maintain the economy against the need to maintain the ecology. The ecology lost since it was estimated to be a problem decades from now. The economy was a problem that would have dire effects today.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>All of these factors combined have produced a scenario that in shorts boils down to the end of the world in 50 to 75 years. Even if we were to stop all emissions of pollution today, the inertia of past decades is enough to carry us over the brink in 100 years.</strong> </p>

<p>However we cannot stop the production of pollution, to do so would mean shutting down every factory, every auto, every train, truck, ship and every household on the planet. Electricity is used to heat many homes in the Western World. The production of electricity produces fewer pollutants than heating all homes with wood or coal. Cutting our power generation abilities down to hydroelectric and fission reactors would leave a good chunk of the world in the dark. It is an impossible situation, our civilization is geared to the use of energy, take away our energy and civilization will collapse. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s get this out of the way: according to the majority opinion of this sub, the US and Israel knowingly and willingly conspired to create ISIS and the entire situation is fully under joint US-Israel control. Utter and complete nonsense. The only way a person would believe that would be if they <em>already</em> believed it, then sorted through 10 years of articles and videos, cherry picking the ones that fit their confirmation bias.</p>

<p>The <em>instability in the region</em> (partly due in fault by the US, largely due in fault by the tinderbox conditions the region was in pre-Iraq war) led to the creation of ISIS. Even had the US never stepped in, even if Israel was the unified State of Palestine, Assad would still have sparked a civil war by murdering his own people, Saddam would still have instigated a revolt, and Russia, Iran and the Saudis would still have desperately poured money and supplies trying to get their side to win, inevitably resulting in the creation of a dangerous and powerful third party entity who simply wants to hate all sides.</p>

<ol>
<li>US Tents: Stolen from Iraqi humanitarian supplies and/or supplies to Iraqi forces.</li>
<li>Toyotas: Ditto</li>
<li>Russia also doesn&#39;t discriminate between the so-called Islamic State and the other forces in the region. If they&#39;re against Assad, they&#39;re against Russia. </li>
<li>The ISIS-Turkish oil pipeline is a known problem, but the vast majority of the oil is Kurdish, which most countries would rather keep flowing.</li>
<li>Israel buys the majority of <em>Turkish</em> oil, most of it comes from the KRG, with a small percentage being smuggled in via ISIS in Iraq. (Despite OP&#39;s title, this is the only &quot;link&quot; between Israel and the so-called Islamic State)</li>
<li>The Golan Heights is essentially Israel. They need to do absolutely nothing to keep occupying it, as no one would fault them for not making peace with Assad. Attacking Syria would make those reserves a warzone which would be bad for everyone all around.</li>
<li>What does an oil company in the Kurdish Region prove in regards to &quot;ISIS is a US/Israeli proxy&quot;? the Kurds hate ISIS.</li>
<li>Iran <em>claims</em> an Israeli was arrested in Iraq. So far nothing more than a single blurb from the Iranian government has ever been released about it. No pictures, no audio tapes, no interviews with the people that captured him. And a weird non-Israeli name (&quot;Oulan&quot;) and a military ID that doesn&#39;t match the standard IDF format.</li>
<li>ISIS videos: It&#39;s the 21st century. There are thousands of basement YouTubers with better production value than the multi-million dollar so-called Islamic State. If that&#39;s supposed to be proof of US support for ISIS, the US must also support Tom Ska.</li>
<li>DDI admits the US created ISIS: He says no such thing. He is discussing the mistakes the US made in supporting the Free Syrian Army, how it lead to the creation of ISIS, and how the US didn&#39;t realize the extent that it would go. Very far from a &quot;proxy&quot;.</li>
<li>Wesely Clark admits that parts of ISIS <em>may</em> have been funded by &quot;friends and allies&quot;. Nothing about &quot;US Proxy&quot;.</li>
<li>And he&#39;s right, the US was pushing for Middle East wars to try and stop terrorist organizations like the Taliban. Still nothing about &quot;ISIS as a proxy&quot;.</li>
<li>McCain with ISIS heads: Virtually the <em>entire world</em> supported the Libyan rebels against Qaddaffi and cheered for their success. It&#39;s an egg on their face that several turned to the so-called Islamic State, but again not proof of a proxy.</li>
<li>Again McCain with ISIS guys: Same as 13 and 10. The US gave a small amount of support to the FSA, before pulling it when it became difficult to tell who was on which side.</li>
<li>ISIS captured US weapons: Same as 1 and 2. Iraq is full of US weapons, most of them given over to Iraqi military forces. ISIS captured them. So what?</li>
<li>Ditto.</li>
<li>Great 20/20 hindsight, Senator Paul. This is the same as the above: by 2014 the US realized that a lot of their weapons earmarked for Iraq were ending up in ISIS hands. Because it&#39;s a warzone, not because that&#39;s the intent.</li>
<li>Putin talks about how the instability in the Mid East led to the creation of ISIS. His wording makes it clear that they were not intentionally funded or run by any outside agency (such as the US or Israel).</li>
<li></li>

<p>Show me evidence they have pulled it. Just recently they were shipping arms to the FSA. There&#39;s no evidence they&#39;ve stopped supporting these people.</p>

<p>Why did Russia make more progress bombing ISIS in 3 days than the US did in 3 years?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What? Russia has only made small progress around SE Aleppo and around Tadmur. They even lost some of that progress around Tadmur (Mahin). The US allies, meanwhile, have taken back Kobane, Tel Abyad, Sinjar, Tikirt, Baiji. All of which are much more significant than anything the SAA has recaptured since Russia got involved. </p>
