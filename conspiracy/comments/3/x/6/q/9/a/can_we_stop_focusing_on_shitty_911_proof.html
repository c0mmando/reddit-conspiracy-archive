    <div class="md"><p>No problem with &quot;thinking critically&quot;.  And I don&#39;t &quot;take everything the govt says at face value&quot;.  But neither of those things is what is going on.</p>

<p>Instead, CT&#39;s are starting with their desired conclusion, and then inventing or denying facts and sources to try to support that conclusion.  Often the conspiracy theories come out minutes or hours after an event, with no wait for any but the most basic facts, no wait for an investigation.  It&#39;s directed, religious, dishonest behavior, not &quot;critical thinking&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m well aware that govt does bad things sometimes, is wrong sometimes.  But the govt explanation of 9/11 seems to make common sense, and is the only explanation with ANY evidence supporting it. Give me some good, solid evidence otherwise, and I&#39;ll change my mind.</p>

<p>Evidence that supports the govt explanation: footage/pictures of the hijackers in the airports, video and eyewitnesses of planes hitting the buildings, records of hijackers entering the USA, records and eyewitnesses of hijackers taking flight lessons, phone calls from passengers saying &quot;we&#39;re being hijacked&quot;, flight 93 cockpit voice recorder showing struggles, accidental radio transmissions of the hijackers voices from the planes, Bin Laden claiming responsibility (after first denying it).</p>

<p>A wise man once said that common sense is not all that common.

<p>FBI didn&#39;t have enough evidence to make a court case, or indict him or whatever.  Or decided not to bother; he already was on the Top Ten Most Wanted list for previous attacks.  That&#39;s different from &quot;no evidence&quot;.  For example, Bin Laden&#39;s video where he claimed responsibility: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_for_the_September_11_attacks#Osama_bin_Laden_statements_after_9.2F11">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_for_the_September_11_attacks#Osama_bin_Laden_statements_after_9.2F11</a></p>

<p>And that whole article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_for_the_September_11_attacks">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_for_the_September_11_attacks</a> details how they connected the hijacking to the hijackers to Al Qaeda, and Bin Laden was head of Al Qaeda.</p>

<p>Then why didn&#39;t the FBI accept that video as evidence?  Also, decided not to bother?  You gave a lot of maybes but none ring true.  At least according to our government...he was still at large, and the mastermind behind the greatest terrorist attack of all time.  Your answer is well, maybe they decided not to bother to do their job which is, well, laughable at best, likely pathetic, and possibly <a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/">JTRIG style deflection, right from the playbook.</a> </p>

<p>startquote</p>

<p>No conspiracy theory has ever been proven true. I stand by this statement as fact, given the distinction between a real conspiracy and a conspiracy theory. So let&#39;s define that distinction clearly.</p>

<p>Conspiracies, as we refer to them, are crimes or schemes carried out in secret by a group of conspirators. Sometimes they are discovered, like the three I just mentioned; and others have undoubtedly successfully remained undetected. These clearly exist. But they are quite distinct from what we colloquially call a conspiracy theory, which is claimed knowledge of a conspiracy that has not yet been discovered by law enforcement or Congress or the newspapers or the general public. They are, in fact, future predictions. They are the beliefs or conclusions of the theorist that they predict will eventually come true or be discovered. ... Unlike a Julius Caesar conspiracy discovered when or after it took place, a conspiracy theory is of a discovery that has yet to take place.</p>

<p>I maintain my claim that a real conspiracy is very distinct from a hypothesized conspiracy; and I maintain my claim that no hypothesized conspiracy, believed within the conspiracy theory community, has ever subsequently been discovered to be true. </p>

So you are saying that you believe a war hungry president and his staff, who receive a document saying &quot;attack is imminent&quot; and doesn&#39;t do anything to stop the &quot;19 Saudis&quot; who trained in the US, were here legally, and some of which were being tracked by CIA handlers/operatives pulled this off. That&#39;s fine with you. No worries. That two 99 story high rises in New York collapse in their own footprint because of an airplane strike in the top third of both buildings. How, the owner of the buildings and his family who all either have regular meetings or plans in the buildings were all conveniently scheduled elsewhere that day? How gold and other securities were trucked out of the lower levels a few days/weeks before with no reason? I just gave you the most notably documented pieces of information that started me on my journey of truth. We can&#39;t change your mind. Only you can do that. You have to start fitting the puzzle pieces together yourself if you want more evidence. But you will have to provide ME with evidence to start believing the official story...because that my friend is the real fairy tale.</p>

<p>Cleland was originally appointed to serve on the 9/11 Commission but resigned shortly after, having been appointed to the Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Before his resignation, he said that the Bush administration was &quot;stonewalling&quot; and blocking the committee&#39;s access to key documents and witnesses.[21] A key figure in the widespread criticism of governmental opacity regarding 9/11, he was quoted as saying in November 2003: &quot;I... cannot look any American in the eye, especially family members of victims, and say the commission had full access. This investigation is now compromised.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>An Initial Microstructural Analysis of A36 Steel from WTC Building 7</strong></p>

<p><strong>Rapid deterioration of the steel was a result of heating with oxidation in combination with intergranular melting due to the presence of sulfur.</strong></p>

<p><strong>According to a member of New York Air National Guard’s 109th Air Wing, who is at Ground Zero from September 22 to October 6: “One fireman told us that there was still molten steel at the heart of the towers’ remains. Firemen sprayed water to cool the debris down but the heat remained intense enough at the surface to melt their boots.”</strong> [NATIONAL GUARD MAGAZINE, 12/2001] </p>

<p><strong>New York firefighters recall “heat so intense they encountered rivers of molten steel.”</strong> [NEW YORK POST, 3/3/2004] </p>

<p><strong>Paramedic Lee Turner arrives at the World Trade Center site on September 12 as a member of a federal urban search and rescue squad. While at Ground Zero, he goes “down crumpled stairwells to the subway, five levels below ground.” There he reportedly sees, “in the darkness a distant, pinkish glow—molten metal dripping from a beam.”</strong> [US NEWS AND WORLD REPORT, 9/12/2002] </p>

<p><strong>Ron Burger, a public health advisor who arrives at Ground Zero on September 12, says that “feeling the heat” and “seeing the molten steel” there reminds him of a volcano.</strong> [NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ASSOCIATION, 9/2003, P40] </p>

<p><strong>Alison Geyh, who heads a team of scientists studying the potential health effects of 9/11, reports: “Fires are still actively burning and the smoke is very intense. In some pockets now being uncovered, they are finding molten steel.”</strong> [JOHNS HOPKINS PUBLIC HEALTH MAGAZINE, 2001] </p>

<p><strong>William Langewiesche, the only journalist to have unrestricted access to Ground Zero during the cleanup operation, describes, “in the early days, the streams of molten metal that leaked from the hot cores and flowed down broken walls inside the foundation hole.”</strong> [LANGEWIESCHE, 2002, PP. 32] </p>

<p><strong>Ken Holden, who is involved with the organizing of demolition, excavation and debris removal operations at Ground Zero, later will tell the 9/11 Commission, “Underground, it was still so hot that molten metal dripped down the sides of the wall from [WTC] Building 6.”</strong> [9/11 COMMISSION, 4/1/2003] </p>

<p>My understanding is that very few cameras were facing the site of the crash.  Three on the Pentagon itself, one or two at a gas station.  And some of those were taking a picture every 5 seconds or something.  No other buildings were nearby, and building cameras tend to be pointed at their own doors or parking lots anyway, not at another building half a mile away.</p>

<p>startquote</p>

<p>Reality: The cabal’s feats did not require in-depth technical knowledge or a high degree of skill.  The attackers, as private pilots, were completely out of their league in the cockpits of those 757s and 767s; however they were not setting out to perform single-engine missed approaches or Category-3 instrument landings with a failed hydraulic system – or to land at all.  They were setting out to steer an already airborne jetliner, in perfect weather, into the side of a building.  Though, for good measure, Mohammed Atta and at least one other member of his group did buy several hours of simulator training on a Boeing 727 (this was not the same type of jet used in the attacks, but it didn’t need to be).  Additionally they obtained manuals and instructional videos for the 757 and 767, available from aviation supply shops.</p>

<p>Hani Hanjour’s flying was exceptional only in its recklessness.  If anything, his loops and spirals above the nation’s capital revealed him to be exactly the shitty pilot he by all accounts was.  To hit the Pentagon squarely he needed only a bit of luck, and he got it.  Striking a stationary object — even a large one with five beckoning sides — at high speed and from a steep angle is very difficult.  To make the job easier, he came in obliquely, tearing down light poles as he roared across the Pentagon’s lawn.  If he’d flown the same profile ten times, seven of them he’d probably have tumbled short of the target or overflown it entirely.
As for those partisan pilots known to chime in on websites, take them with a grain of salt.  As somebody who flies 757 and 767s for a living, I think my testimony carries some weight.  Ask around and you’ll discover that the majority of professional pilots feel the way I do.</p>

<p>Do you know what that word means?</p>

<p>In other words, I&#39;m highlighting the lack of investigation for something which resulted in trillions of dollars spent, millions dead, and a hungry MIC that projects their budgets into the future. Which resulted in the lose of freedom and more agents of the state.</p>

<p>I&#39;m highlighting that his only source for the &quot;official conspiracy theory&quot; is random guys on the internet because there was no investigation to determine what happened and hat investigation that was done left more questions than answers.</p>

<p>Any apologist who would take such extraordinary measures to justify their own lose of rights, the funding of violence, torture, black site prisons, spying on everyone including allies, etc., should be viewed explicitly for what they are doing. </p>

<p>They should be held in context with what their pipe-dreams of evidence is supporting so that people can make a legitimate determination on the situation rather than some grainy photos with zero pedigree can be printed on any website making any claims they want. </p>

<p>Yes, I do.</p>

<p>I see, there was no investigation and the investigation that was done was subpar. Gotcha.</p>

<p>So, like journalists that work for newspapers (the dreaded MSM) who are trained to do their jobs.</p>

<p>Your utter lack of evidence supports this. My utter lack of evidence supports an utter lack of evidence. It supports the government actually finding some and making a reasonable case to take reasonable actions. </p>

<p>There was an offer to hand Bin Laden over. Nah, better to radicalize Iraqis and provide a feeding ground for future terror. That&#39;s what you support for literally no valid reason. </p>

<p>You come to these threads and try to maintain that the investigation into 9/11 was legit and therefore the governments response to it. You legitimize the outrageous acts with no proof. You are scary. You are the worm that has invaded our crimson bed of joy.</p>

<p>And what do I think should be done about folks like you? You should be pitied and provided a decent wake so that no one falls in the path of your appetite for destruction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And you have accused me of a long line of things.</p>

<p>As you may notice, this thread is about:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can we stop focusing on shitty 9/11 proof?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet, you want to ignore the big picture and focus on: </p>

<p>spelling?</p>

<p>K. Got ya.</p>

<p>And you are even wrong about the spelling! Ah wonderful.</p>

<p>You are a warmonger. Anyone who overtly supports 9/11 is providing impetus to the government to carry out what they did post-9/11. It&#39;s a simple fact. You are saying the government&#39;s version of events is correct. You are allowing them to co-opt the debate and giving them the support to determine the response as they might.</p>

<p>Instead of taking the normal course of action and demanding a trial to get to the bottom of things and make clear determinations to provide coherent, useful and efficient responses, you are saying:</p>

<p>They&#39;ve given me all the evidence I need and may act as they choose.</p>

<p>You are doing this and it makes you a warmonger.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a &quot;debate&quot;, it is what it is; it&#39;s history; it&#39;s debt to the bank and privatized armies using covert means against the US people. Get used to it and the people who are acting similarly should get used to it. You bear the burden of the impetus you provide. You are providing it out of your own free will. </p>

<p>Just be honest and open enough about it so that others may make valid determinations.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t try to hide behind grainy pictures and ignore the things being done because people like you are convincing others that grainy single pictures are enough to give up their rights, spread terror around the world, spend now and into the future, and privatize the process. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree but to be maybe a bit more specific, in trying to learn the &#39;right&#39; lessons, it doesn&#39;t seem all that important to me precisely how the towers were made to fall but rather how such an attack could be carried out in the first place. Clearly something in the intelligence services went drastically wrong (intentionally or not). Oddly this doesn&#39;t seem to be a prominent feature in the discussion, certainly not as loud as the debate over steel-beams! I have made posts about Operation Gladio in this sub and know it is brought up reasonably often, yet people don&#39;t seem to draw the link between the deep state routinely using terrorist cells to further its agenda since the 1970s and current events (let alone 9/11). </p>

<p>No, I think we&#39;ll never be able to detect and prevent every small group of criminals/terrorists from doing something.  Short of some kind of locked-down police state with closed borders, similar to the old Soviet Union or East Germany at the height of the Cold War.  If we&#39;re going to have tourism, travel, freedom of movement inside the country, etc, people are going to be able to do bad things.</p>

<p>To me, the clearest failure was in airport security.  They knew for decades that their procedures were crap, they were failing tests, etc, and didn&#39;t fix the procedures.  Still haven&#39;t fixed them today, in some ways.  And I&#39;m not sure how they could stop a passenger from taking a box-cutter or razor-blade through without full strip-searching and other massively-invasive procedures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough but like I said, I&#39;m not convinced there being a conspiracy behind 9/11 is particularly relevant to anything anymore.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, for example, if it turned out 9/11 WAS a US govt conspiracy, that would mean there was no massive failure in the intelligence services, right ?  And maybe it would mean we&#39;d roll back the Patriot Act and associated changes and NSA spying.  Maybe the whole War on Terror would be dialed down a bit.  Heck, most of the R candidates for president are saying they&#39;d be better at preventing another 9/11 than the D&#39;s.  It could make a huge difference.</p>

<p>There is plenty of evidence from multiple sources, you just choose to dismiss it all as fake.  Records of them getting visas, entering USA, staying in hotels or apartments, taking flight training, at least one going through security to board the flight (<a href="http://www.911myths.com/html/hanjour_video.html">http://www.911myths.com/html/hanjour_video.html</a>).</p>

<p>A statement with no content.

<p>False and false.  Some firefighters say they saw molten steel, no one sampled or photographed it, could have been glass or aluminum or plastic or a mixture.  <a href="http://911myths.com/html/wtc_molten_steel.html">http://911myths.com/html/wtc_molten_steel.html</a></p>

<p>Quantity doesn&#39;t equal quality.  I still am asking all the CT&#39;s for just ONE simple clear solid piece of evidence that proves a conspiracy other than the Al Qaeda conspiracy in the govt explanation.  I have asked and asked, and no one yet has provided such a piece of evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, sorry. I&#39;ve read the NIST report and that is a gross misrepresentation of it.</p>

<p>NIST says:</p>

<p>Fires caused thermal expansion in a beam that then got lose of its support, fell several stories gaining the necessary momentum to knock a column off of its footing which then fell bringing down the internal structure which then allowed the facade to collapse.</p>

<p>That is NiST&#39;s theory.</p>

<p>To make it work, they just removed the shear studs, the phalanges, increase the temperature of fire, modified the expansion of the steel, removed the floor which would have arrested the increase in momentum of the falling beam, removed the footer for the column so that the momentum from the beam would knock it off. And then ignored the actual footage of the building, blueprints, and engineering drawings to allow this to happen.</p>

<p>Your explanation is contrary to NIST&#39;s and NIST&#39;s is contrary to the engineering drawings and footage.</p>

<p>And the reason is simple: unless explosives were used, the building wouldn&#39;t fall after accounting for the damage and length/strength of the fires and the building&#39;s design. And it would have never fallen as shown which is easily verified by watching the deformation that happens in NIST&#39;s computer model.</p>

<p>Well, from the sidebar of the sub:  &quot;This subreddit is a thinking ground. Above all else, we respect everyone&#39;s opinions and ALL religions. We hope to challenge issues which have captured the public’s imagination, from JFK to 9/11. This is a forum for free thinking, not hate speech. Respect other views and opinions, and keep an open mind.&quot;</p>

<p>And from me:</p>

<p>These conspiracy theories do real harm. We should oppose harmful falsehoods.</p>

<p>If the lesson we learn from 9/11 is &quot;govt is evil&quot; or &quot;the Jews did it&quot;, when the real lesson (I think) is &quot;we should stop supporting dictators and invading countries&quot;, we risk more 9/11&#39;s. And people in the Mideast don&#39;t learn the lesson &quot;we should stop the extremists among us&quot;.</p>

<p>If the lesson we learn from big events (9/11, Boston Bombing, HIV/AIDS, Ebola) is &quot;don&#39;t trust anything the govt or scientists say&quot;, that helps lead to &quot;deny climate change, refuse vaccines, deny evolution&quot;.  In places such as Africa, it costs many lives every year.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theories generally are a form of religion: belief without evidence, even belief despite the evidence. This harms our country and our society.</p>

<p>And the logic of conspiracy theorists often is EXACTLY that of the religious: &quot;I have no evidence for my claim, but if I can cast doubt on science/govt&#39;s evidence, that means my claim must be correct, right ?&quot;.  No.</p>

<p>Yes, there have been real conspiracies. Yes, there is plenty of malice and incompetence by govts or govt agencies. But these conspiracy theories are a different thing: start with desired conclusion, and invent/deny facts to justify it.</p>

<p>I was 43 when 9/11 happened.  I watched it on TV.  One of my brothers saw the second plane hit the WTC, watching from a rooftop in Brooklyn.  A distant friend of the family was on the street near WTC as glass started raining down.

<p>Interesting theory you&#39;ve forwarded.  Personally I don&#39;t believe it, but it&#39;s interesting.  Having participated in many military exercises it seems clear to me the reporters of the day were all reading from the same script.  How did the authorities know it was Bin Laden so fast, when the FBI never found any hard evidence linking Bin Laden to the attack?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you, but nothing should be &quot;believed&quot;. Everything should be proven or dis-proven with evidence. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to say WTC7 was &quot;demolished&quot; because we have no concrete evidence of it. Nor do I think we should say it &quot;collapsed due to normal office fires&quot; as NIST suggests, for the same reasons. You can&#39;t have your cake and eat it too.</p>

<p>Granted, there are lots of suspicious coincidences and unusual circumstances - that&#39;s exactly why we should ask questions instead of jump to conclusions. I don&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; official stories, that&#39;s why I ask questions.</p>

<p>Interesting, so you don&#39;t believe the US government has made it a priority to infiltrate online discussions and attempt to correct the message I take it.  I would invite you to consider the following evidence to the contrary:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/">Among the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG</a> are two tactics: (1) to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and (2) to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy Theorists have been claiming that lizards rule the world. So what? It&#39;s noise. There&#39;s a lot of shit out there and every so often an interesting money trail or subsequent arms deal conveniently happen. These are the things that are worth talking about - not a completely disprovable ancient detail. I don&#39;t speak for everyone here but I personally couldn&#39;t give a shit about jet fuel and steel. I&#39;m more concerned that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the morning of September 11, 2001, 19 men armed with boxcutters directed by a man on dialysis in a cave fortress halfway around the world using a satellite phone and a laptop directed the most sophisticated penetration of the most heavily-defended airspace in the world, overpowering the passengers and the military combat-trained pilots on 4 commercial aircraft before flying those planes wildly off course for over an hour without being molested by a single fighter interceptor.</p>

<p>These 19 hijackers, devout religious fundamentalists who liked to drink alcohol, snort cocaine, and live with pink-haired strippers, managed to knock down 3 buildings with 2 planes in New York, while in Washington a pilot who couldn’t handle a single engine Cessna was able to fly a 757 in an 8,000 foot descending 270 degree corskscrew turn to come exactly level with the ground, hitting the Pentagon in the budget analyst office where DoD staffers were working on the mystery of the 2.3 trillion dollars that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had announced “missing” from the Pentagon’s coffers in a press conference the day before, on September 10, 2001.</p>

<p>Luckily, the news anchors knew who did it within minutes, the pundits knew within hours, the Administration knew within the day, and the evidence literally fell into the FBI’s lap. But for some reason a bunch of crazy conspiracy theorists demanded an investigation into the greatest attack on American soil in history.</p>

<p>The investigation was delayed, underfunded, set up to fail, a conflict of interest and a cover up from start to finish. It was based on testimony extracted through torture, the records of which were destroyed. It failed to mention the existence of WTC7, Able Danger, Ptech, Sibel Edmonds, OBL and the CIA, and the drills of hijacked aircraft being flown into buildings that were being simulated at the precise same time that those events were actually happening. It was lied to by the Pentagon, the CIA, the Bush Administration and as for Bush and Cheney…well, no one knows what they told it because they testified in secret, off the record, not under oath and behind closed doors. It didn’t bother to look at who funded the attacks because that question is of “little practical significance“. Still, the 9/11 Commission did brilliantly, answering all of the questions the public had (except most of the victims’ family members’ questions) and pinned blame on all the people responsible (although no one so much as lost their job), determining the attacks were “a failure of imagination” because “I don’t think anyone could envision flying airplanes into buildings ” except the Pentagon and FEMA and NORAD and the NRO.</p>

<p>The DIA destroyed 2.5 TB of data on Able Danger, but that’s OK because it probably wasn’t important.</p>

<p>The SEC destroyed their records on the investigation into the insider trading before the attacks, but that’s OK because destroying the records of the largest investigation in SEC history is just part of routine record keeping.</p>

<p>NIST has classified the data that they used for their model of WTC7’s collapse, but that’s OK because knowing how they made their model of that collapse would “jeopardize public safety“.</p>

<p>The FBI has argued that all material related to their investigation of 9/11 should be kept secret from the public, but that’s OK because the FBI probably has nothing to hide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most people who ask good questions don&#39;t think jet fuel melts steel. It doesn&#39;t have to.</p>

<p>Go on, make a post asking how many people think jet fuel melts steel. See how many people rush to the defence of the well known straw man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that. You claim that those who oppose the conspiracy theory wrongly claim that conspiracy theorists state &quot;Jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams&quot; and since they never make such a statement, that the claim is therefore a strawman.</p>

<p>However, since conspiracy theorist actually did claim that &quot;jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams&quot; it&#39;s not a strawman.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see. You and I are in disagreement about who is claiming that &quot;jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams&quot;. In this case, I understand that the conspirators are promoting this claim as the straw man. It is their fallacious argument, not the conspiracy theor<em>ists&#39;</em>.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s break this down, so you understand my POV and reasoning and we&#39;ll get somewhere and perhaps you will be better equipped to explain why I am wrong.</p>

<p>1) I am the &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;.</p>

<p>2) I think the &quot;conspirators&quot; which include the victims of misinfo propagate two opposing messages:<br/>
    * Officially: &quot;Jet fuel can not and doesn&#39;t need to melt steel.&quot;<br/>
    * Via brigading, misinfo, noise, shilling, meme circlejerks: &quot;Jet fuel melts steel.&quot;</p>

<p>3) My argument is that there are suspicious circumstances surrounding the collapse. We should ask some serious questions.</p>

<p>4) The conspirators argument (via the mechanisms outlined above) is that jet fuel doesn&#39;t melt steel, therefore the entire thing is a conspiracy nut delusion and we do not need to ask more questions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an erroneous reduction and misrepresentation of the theorists (my/most CTs) claim in order to derail the argument and come to a false premature conclusion that the question which was not asked is answered and that no further investigation is required. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a straw man.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t provide evidence for something which hasn&#39;t been <strong><em>proven</em></strong>; no more than you can <strong><em>prove</em></strong> that a God exists. Furthermore, the onus is not on me to prove the assertion I suspect you support in order to refute a claim I didn&#39;t make.

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate you keeping this respectful considering we clearly have very different opinions. I acknowledge a lot of it is conjecture, but it&#39;s not entirely unreasonable from what I understand. I&#39;m really not beyond looking from the situation from your perspective and I think it&#39;s healthy to do so during any kind of useful discussion. Hopefully that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing here instead of a pretend Internet &quot;I win&quot; argument. We can all play knifey-spoony.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why on earth would anyone take this seriously?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I take it seriously because people with a lot more money (who created the concept of money) in positions of power, with the will, motive and ability to retain power, control and wealth have demonstrated throughout history that they can and do conspire. This doesn&#39;t mean they always do, it means they can and do sometimes. </p>

<p>My opinion may be 100% paranoia-driven delusion. I am willing to acknowledge this, however - there are a lot of very unusual coincidences that raise suspicion. This doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s OK to jump to &quot;Israel did it.&quot; - no more than it&#39;s OK to blindly accept &quot;this passport flew away from the wreckage and was found undamaged, and it just so happens to show one of the terrorists&quot;.</p>

<p>Both claims would entail a degree of conjecture in order to be reasonably considered, because no one person would be an expert in either case with the evidence provided. This isn&#39;t ideal. At that point, I like to ask, &quot;Can we ask some more questions then?&quot; - and I don&#39;t think this is unreasonable.</p>

<p>My argument, again, is that questions should be asked. An independent inquiry should be launched. Do you think this would be unreasonable, given the number of inconsistencies with the official explanation, and considering that this event was effectively the catalyst for the 15-year long US/NATO invasion of the Middle-East?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate you keeping this respectful considering we clearly have very different opinions. I acknowledge a lot of it is conjecture, but it&#39;s not entirely unreasonable from what I understand. I&#39;m really not beyond looking from the situation from your perspective and I think it&#39;s healthy to do so during any kind of useful discussion. Hopefully that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing here instead of a pretend Internet &quot;I win&quot; argument. We can all play knifey-spoony.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why on earth would anyone take this seriously?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I take it seriously because people with a lot more money (who created the concept of money) in positions of power, with the will, motive and ability to retain power, control and wealth have demonstrated throughout history that they can and do conspire. This doesn&#39;t mean they always do, it means they can and do sometimes. </p>

<p>My opinion may be 100% paranoia-driven delusion. I am willing to acknowledge this, however - there are a lot of very unusual coincidences that raise suspicion. This doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s OK to jump to &quot;Israel did it.&quot; - no more than it&#39;s OK to blindly accept &quot;this passport flew away from the wreckage and was found undamaged, and it just so happens to show one of the terrorists&quot;.</p>

<p>Both claims would entail a degree of conjecture in order to be reasonably considered, because no one person would be an expert in either case with the evidence provided. This isn&#39;t ideal. At that point, I like to ask, &quot;Can we ask some more questions then?&quot; - and I don&#39;t think this is unreasonable.</p>

<p>My argument, again, is that questions should be asked. An independent inquiry should be launched. Do you think this would be unreasonable, given the number of inconsistencies with the official explanation, and considering that this event was effectively the catalyst for the 15-year long US/NATO invasion of the Middle-East?</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.askthepilot.com/questionanswers/conspiracy-nation/">http://www.askthepilot.com/questionanswers/conspiracy-nation/</a> :</p>

<p>startquote</p>

<p>Reality: The cabal’s feats did not require in-depth technical knowledge or a high degree of skill.  The attackers, as private pilots, were completely out of their league in the cockpits of those 757s and 767s; however they were not setting out to perform single-engine missed approaches or Category-3 instrument landings with a failed hydraulic system – or to land at all.  They were setting out to steer an already airborne jetliner, in perfect weather, into the side of a building.  Though, for good measure, Mohammed Atta and at least one other member of his group did buy several hours of simulator training on a Boeing 727 (this was not the same type of jet used in the attacks, but it didn’t need to be).  Additionally they obtained manuals and instructional videos for the 757 and 767, available from aviation supply shops.</p>

<p>Hani Hanjour’s flying was exceptional only in its recklessness.  If anything, his loops and spirals above the nation’s capital revealed him to be exactly the shitty pilot he by all accounts was.  To hit the Pentagon squarely he needed only a bit of luck, and he got it.  Striking a stationary object — even a large one with five beckoning sides — at high speed and from a steep angle is very difficult.  To make the job easier, he came in obliquely, tearing down light poles as he roared across the Pentagon’s lawn.  If he’d flown the same profile ten times, seven of them he’d probably have tumbled short of the target or overflown it entirely.
As for those partisan pilots known to chime in on websites, take them with a grain of salt.  As somebody who flies 757 and 767s for a living, I think my testimony carries some weight.  Ask around and you’ll discover that the majority of professional pilots feel the way I do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem with &quot;thinking critically&quot;.  And I don&#39;t &quot;take everything the govt says at face value&quot;.  But neither of those things is what is going on.</p>

<p>Instead, CT&#39;s are starting with their desired conclusion, and then inventing or denying facts and sources to try to support that conclusion.  Often the conspiracy theories come out minutes or hours after an event, with no wait for any but the most basic facts, no wait for an investigation.  It&#39;s directed, religious, dishonest behavior, not &quot;critical thinking&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m well aware that govt does bad things sometimes, is wrong sometimes.  But the govt explanation of 9/11 seems to make common sense, and is the only explanation with ANY evidence supporting it. Give me some good, solid evidence otherwise, and I&#39;ll change my mind.</p>

<p>Evidence that supports the govt explanation: footage/pictures of the hijackers in the airports, video and eyewitnesses of planes hitting the buildings, records of hijackers entering the USA, records and eyewitnesses of hijackers taking flight lessons, phone calls from passengers saying &quot;we&#39;re being hijacked&quot;, flight 93 cockpit voice recorder showing struggles, accidental radio transmissions of the hijackers voices from the planes, Bin Laden claiming responsibility (after first denying it).</p>

<p>FBI didn&#39;t have enough evidence to make a court case, or indict him or whatever. Or decided not to bother; he already was on the Top Ten Most Wanted list for previous attacks.

<p>Then why didn&#39;t the FBI accept that video as evidence?  Also, decided not to bother?  You gave a lot of maybes but none ring true.  At least according to our government...he was still at large, and the mastermind behind the greatest terrorist attack of all time.  Your answer is well, maybe they decided not to bother to do their job which is, well, laughable at best, likely pathetic, and possibly <a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/">JTRIG style deflection, right from the playbook.</a> </p>
