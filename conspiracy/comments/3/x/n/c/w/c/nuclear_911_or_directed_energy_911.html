<p>That depends on what type of energy is being directed and it could blend in if it belongs there. </p>

<p>The cyclontron produces the power for the weapon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cyclotrons use more power than they generate, and create energy that is not very easy to capture and use. They are not the best way to produce power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is not the weapon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesn&#39;t remove the fact that said weapon would be incredibly conspicuous. It would need to have a direct line of sight to the WTC, and as such would need to be decently high above the ground, and in order to direct enough energy that far, would have to be incredibly large. It would have to be orders of magnitude more powerful (and as such, massive) than most such weapons in use today, and would be an incredibly pointless waste of money since it would also be far too big to actually use for anything. It just isn&#39;t possible to hide such a device.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would they just come forward? Why step off the top of the pyramid?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a national laboratory. They&#39;re hardly at the &quot;top of the pyramid&quot; here. They&#39;re literally just scientists and engineers, who were hired to work at the laboratory. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How would you know what the full capabilities are if they are classified?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t need to know the full capabilities of such a device to know that said device just isn&#39;t feasible based on how any of the discussed technology works. No offence, but I&#39;m not quite sure you understand how most of this technology (i.e. DEW&#39;s, Cyclotrons, etc...) actually work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The line of sight is there if you look. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where? The Sychrotron? You need a device that has absolutely no obstructions whatsoever, so would have to be higher than everything around it, even trees. The only tall things in that base do not have anything of that magnitude attached to them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also why does it have to be big? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you&#39;re going to be pumping literal <em>terrawatts</em> of energy through it at a given moment. That&#39;s something that can only be made so small before it&#39;s no longer possible. It just isn&#39;t physically possible to miniaturize such a powerful device to a scale that makes sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Money does not matter at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It kinda does in this case, because they&#39;d be spending multiple probably billions of dollars to make such a massive device, only to use it a single time for something that could be done far easier with less convoluted methods. It&#39;s not that it&#39;s too expensive period, it&#39;s that it&#39;s not cost effective in the slightest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Compartmentalization helps with the hiding. The ones who put everything together are the ones who are at the top.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Compartmentalization only works so much. If you understand how the technology works, it won&#39;t be too hard to figure out you&#39;re building an extremely powerful directed energy weapon, since it functions totally differently to something like a cyclotron.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is.</p>

<p>Did you know that the 767 came fitted with an avionics suite called &quot;Future Air Navigation System&quot;? Did you know that the autopilot on the 767 can fly the aircraft from immediately after takeoff, until final approach? The aircraft will actually line itself up with the runway and begin to land, but for safety reasons the pilots do the actual landing.</p>

<p>This system also has GPS navigation and digital data link communications.</p>

<p>And the final little trick it has is that air traffic control, the airline, and anyone else who has the correct codes and frequencies can upload a new flight plan into the navigation system without the pilots having to do anything. </p>

<p>The 767 with FANS can be flown remotely from the ground as long as the autopilot is in full control. All you have to do is prevent the pilots from switching off the autopilot and you can fly that aircraft anywhere you want, including into the side of a building.</p>

<p>Those commercial airliners were hijacked all right... but not by anyone on the aircraft.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what they don&#39;t want us talking about. They&#39;d much rather we make fools of ourselves by saying there were no aircraft at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, How deep were those tests?</p>

<p>The first test showed visible shock waves ripple the surface at detonation. That would have been obvious had it happened in New York. When the void collapsed it left a crater much larger than the footprint of the WTC complex.</p>

<p>The second test also showed visible shock waves on the surface at the moment of detonation.</p>

<p>The third test once again showed visible shock waves on the surface.</p>

<p>The fourth test was clearly much more powerful or a lot shallower as the shock wave is powerful enough to launch tons of dust into the air from the surface.</p>

<p>All you managed to prove is that nothing like this happened in New York on 9/11. This is evidence against the use of underground nukes.</p>

<p>Now about the depth of those tests:</p>

<p>The first test carried out by the US was of a 1.2 kiloton device (the Hiroshima bomb was 21 kilotons) buried 5.2 metres below the surface which, when detonated, breached the surface and launched dust 11,500 feet into the air.</p>

<p>The second test was a 1 kiloton device (1/20th the power of the Hiroshima bomb) buried 20.4 metres below the surface. It too breached the surface and launched tons of dust to an altitude of 12,000 feet.</p>

<p>The third test was a 0.055 kiloton (55 ton) device buried 148 metres below the surface. It still breached the surface, although the radioactive cloud was reduced by a factor of ten from an above-ground explosion.</p>

<p>The first underground nuclear test to be fully contained underground was Plumbbob Rainier, which involved a 1.7 kiloton device (1/12th the power of the Hiroshima bomb) buried 274 metres below the surface.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_nuclear_weapons_testing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_nuclear_weapons_testing</a></p>

<p>The only possible way to completely contain even the smallest nuclear explosion is to bury it hundreds of metres underground.</p>

<p>But that still does not hide the seismic shock waves caused by the explosion.</p>

<p>There were no underground nukes at the WTC. Period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re clearly smarter than the rest of us. Here is a challenge for you.</p>

<p>How much energy would it take to melt 100 tons of steel?</p>

<p>I can tell you it is a hell of a lot more than any directed energy weapon could ever produce. Even if it could, it would burn the atmosphere above the WTC and we&#39;d fucking see it.</p>

<p>You know how we can see lightning? You would have the same thing happen if you pumped enough energy down a beam to melt even 100 tons of steel in seconds, let alone thousands. The air between the DEW and the WTC would turn into a white hot glowing plasma.</p>

<p>That never happened. End of argument. Get an education.</p>

<p>Nuclear shock waves can&#39;t teleport and neither can electromagnetic waves.</p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t if it was underground and depending on the payload size.</p>

<p>Got a picture of that? I don&#39;t remember seeing them walking on water, they were however walking on super heated rubble. Some times only being able to work in the debris for a few minutes at a time.</p>

<p>Sure it could, that is how nuclear explosions work. Vaporizing everything in x radius.</p>

<p>A nuke wouldn&#39;t make a loud noise underground? It wouldn&#39;t shake the whole island violently so everyone would know it? How can you know if it was a nuke if it was a magic nuke that had no characteristics of a nuke?</p>

<p>In the video I posted above Dr. Wood shows how a news report said firefighters steel toed boots were melting.. yet Dr Wood points out if the boots were melting then how could their feet not be cooked in the process?</p>

<p>Do you have videos showing where the firefighters could only work minutes at a time?</p>

<p>So the buildings were turned to dust by an underground noiseless nuke? This doesn&#39;t make sense... if it destroyed the upper building it should have produced an incredible amount of light...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL, you tell me! Wheres the real evidence of your theory?</p>

<p>STEEL structures didn&#39;t turn to dust as they fell through the air. It was dust on a beam that stayed suspended in the air as the steal beam fell. A steel beam is heavier than dust. you can literally see the beam fall into the cloud of dust below. it didn&#39;t vaporize. </p>

<p>Proof they were half a mile away as the buildings fell? </p>

<p>Why does Judy Woods file copyright complaints on peoples youtube video who debunk her &quot;theories&quot;? If her theories and &quot;proof&quot; are so compelling why is she trying to get their videos taken down?  Seems a bit disingenuous, no?</p>

<p>This buildings outer shell was made almost entirely of steel.. that was as thick as tank armor... you can WATCH the outer shell turning to dust in the video... literally turning completely to dust before it hits ground below. The WHOLE building was made almost entirely of steel.. it never should have produced remotely this much dust..</p>

<p>Watch the video I linked to..  she shows pictures of the cars before and after the &quot;attack&quot; the cars are in the same spot half a mile away and a whole row of cars is fried...  Imagine an immense tesla coil and the electrical charge produced around it.. or it may have been like a microwave type beam that produced interference patterns in different locations producing these effect..</p>

<p>Bullshit. I see the thing she says turn to dust all the way until it goes out of view behind a building. She&#39;s telling bald faced lies knowing the &quot;true believers&quot; in her audience will not call her on her bullshit.</p>

<p>In every case you see the solid bit all the way until it passes out of view. They do not turn to dust at all.</p>

<p>If you want to know why they are trailing clouds of dust, stand on the side of a road as a tractor-trailer passes by at 55 mph. You will feel a strong suction pulling you towards the truck.</p>

<p>As those massive and not at all aerodynamic pieces fall through the dust cloud, they drag the dust along with them in exactly the same way. They are basically sucking it down faster than it would fall by itself.</p>

<p>The problem with that video is it clearly shows most of the building did not fall at free fall speeds, because those pieces <em>were</em> free falling and they clearly fall much faster then the collapse itself, which is why they emerged from the dust cloud.</p>

<p>Only because you&#39;re an idiot. You&#39;ve been convinced that what you can clearly see is not what is really happening. She told you a bullshit lie about them turning to dust, and you <em>want</em> to believe it, so you tell yourself you <em>can</em> see it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>&quot;.</p>

<p>Once people like you have decided what you think is true, you will clutch to any bullshit claim to justify your belief. So even though we can all see the steel doesn&#39;t turn to dust, but instead pulls dust down with it in its slipstream, you will refuse to believe the obvious truth because it would mean accepting that you fell for a load of bullshit.</p>

<p>There is always a possibility. There could be technologies far beyond our understanding, <em>but</em> the evidence perfectly fits with a very simple and low tech explanation: Thermite was used to cut the supporting structure of the WTC, which then failed and caused the collapse of the building. Gravity did the rest.</p>

<p>Occam&#39;s Razor. If I have two competing claims, I have to go with the one that requires the least amount of assumptions to back it up.</p>

<p>I assume someone planted thermite in the buildings and set it off soon after the aircraft hit, to ensure they collapsed. There is evidence that the buildings would not have collapsed as they did, unless the core columns were all cut simultaneously. There is evidence of thermite. There is undeniable evidence the building collapsed.</p>

<p>You assume some incredibly advanced technology exists. You assume that technology was used to turn the WTC to dust. There is no evidence the WTC was turned to dust by any technology. There is no evidence such technology even exists. Your entire theory is an assumption backed up by nothing but more assumptions and outright lies.</p>

<p>Occam&#39;s Razor.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;re saying she uses it. Make up your fucking mind.</p>

<p>You think paint and coating could produce that INCREDIBLE volume of dust</p>

<p>In researching your guys claims, one I came across was that the large spire that remained standing for a few moments, turned to dust in mid-air. The video did indeed look like that, but was in fact easily explained by the coatings etc.</p>

<p>The other claim of steel turning to dust was referring to the chunks that fell out of the dust cloud as the buildings collapsed. Those ones obviously didn&#39;t turn to dust, so no explanation was necessary.</p>

<p>Now because you retards are never truly specific about your claims, I am left to guess exactly what you mean. It seems now that you mean the huge dust cloud itself.</p>

<p>The simple answer there is, no, that dust was made up of all sorts of coatings, construction materials, and even office furnishings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and accuse me of lying?</p>

<p>No, I accused you of lying because you said there was &quot;<strong>no seismic evidence</strong>&quot;. Now you&#39;re changing your story and admitting there <strong>was</strong> seismic evidence.</p>

<p>There was plenty. There was none for the bullshit nuke claim. The seismic evidence showed that any explosions were either high in the building or so small as to not register on seismometers  nearby.</p>

<p>Thermite doesn&#39;t explode. Thus the evidence that thermite was found in the dust, and that no large explosions we recorded by seismometers combine to indicate that thermite was used to cut steel beams and gravity did the rest.</p>

<p>Yep, a powdered metal (usually aluminium) and an oxidiser (usually iron oxide AKA powdered rust). When they burn, their combustion products are molten iron and aluminium oxide.</p>

<p>Guess what they found in the WTC dust? Tiny spheres of iron that was once molten but cooled before it had a chance to hit a surface and flatten out, and aluminium oxide.</p>

<p>Bullshit. All they had to do was simultaneously cut the core columns that are not visible from outside the building. The collapse of those columns pulled the rest of the building down with them.</p>

<p>You are ignoring what I am writing now.. you are refusing to consider the possibilities... as I said.. heat may have not been needed.. it HAD to have not been needed because the evidence proves the towers did not fall conventionally.. if there was almost no heat then the mechanism for disintegrating the buildings could not have required massive amounts of energy...</p>

<p>True, but that does not mean anything other than the presence of aluminium oxide can be explained. It doesn&#39;t explain the tiny droplets of molten iron that cooled before hitting a surface and being deformed. Those two things <em>together</em> are evidence of the use of thermite. <em>Evidence</em> but not proof.</p>

<p>Aluminium oxide is <em>not</em> evidence of DEW or nuclear bombs. That&#39;s the difference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>heat may have not been needed.. </p>

<p>There is no choice. &quot;Heat&quot; is simply the vibration of atoms. If you vibrate atoms, regardless of how you do it, they will increase in temperature. It is a physical fact. Atomic vibration <em>is</em> temperature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if there was almost no heat then the mechanism for disintegrating the buildings could not have required massive amounts of energy...</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>If</em>...</p>

<p>There was huge amounts of energy released. Just the collisions of tumbling debris would cause heating of the cloud. Not enough to burn you, but it does increase the temperature. The gravitational energy alone was incredible. Think of how big a rocket you would need to overcome gravity and launch the WTC into the air. It would be impossibly huge.</p>

<p>Also, the molten metal seen pouring out of the building and found under the rubble proves a large amount of heating was going on, in at least some parts of the building.</p>

<p>Why do you ignore those undeniable facts?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It does. The combustion products of thermite were found in the dust. Molten metal was seen pouring from the building and was found under the rubble.</p>

<p>There is no evidence of directed energy weapons at all.</p>

<p>The buildings were turning to dust the whole time after the towers were supposedly hit by jets.. until they came down. </p>

<p>First of all you don&#39;t know that was molten metal.. it may have looked like molten metal but it doesn&#39;t mean it was. It also could have been thermite produced by the towers turning to dust that mixed with the aluminum dust and then was ignited somehow...</p>

<p>Even if what you were saying was true and thermite was used.. it still doesn&#39;t explain the non existent debris.. it doesn&#39;t explain the non existent seismic signal for a large building supposedly collapsing as hard as it did.. doesn&#39;t explain the bathtub not being damaged and certainly doesn&#39;t explain the building not even penetrating through the ground level into stores and parking garages below... Dr. Wood even shows video of people on the scene wondering what happened to the buildings that disappeared..</p>

If nano-thermite is like thermite, but better, faster, hotter, and more easily controlled, then turning the towers into dust is what that would do.  Thermite doesn&#39;t set stuff on fire.  Thermite turns stuff into ash.  The stuff it touches doesn&#39;t exactly &quot;burn.&quot;  It&#39;s just: <em>poof</em> ash in place of stuff.</p>

<p>I think that for a lot of reasons.  While generation IV nuclear weapons and directed energy weapons do exist, and could somewhat explain the observed phenomena, they are also easy to detect.  In particular, they cause exposure of film, and/or electromagnetic effects that would be picked up by devices in the area, and would have been reported.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, nanotech is ubiquitous and advanced.  I would assume based on a lot of reasons that this is the explanation for the tower collapses.</p>

<p>Bullshit. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uxsFglz2ig">They use thermite to weld railroad tracks.</a></p>

<p>Put simply, thermite is a powdered metal mixed with an oxidizer that burns at extremely high temperature. The temperature is so high it can almost instantly melt steel. In the case of welding, they use a mould to contain the liquid steel until it cools and hardens. In the case of cutting, they let the molten steel drain away.</p>

<p>If thermite was used to cut the core columns of the WTC, we would expect to see molten steel running down the columns until it cools enough to harden.</p>

<p>It certainly won&#39;t turn them into ash, but if they become molten and then the building collapses, we would expect to see the molten steel form tiny droplets that is <em>mixed</em> with the &quot;ash&quot; during the high energy disintegration of the remaining structure.</p>

<p>And... what do you know? They found exactly that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the problem with the cancer portion of the nuclear theory is people are just now getting these cancers.</p>

<p>the thyroid cancer rates are closer to what people in towns downwind of nuclear testing in the midwest in the 50s and 60s experienced. those people were in danger of fallout clouds, not the direct radiation of a ground explosion (which is what would have happened if 9/11 was a nuclear device). so at worst it is evidence of a dirty bomb; the force of the explosion wasn&#39;t nuclear driven, but it had radioactive material in it to be used as &quot;shrapnel&quot;</p>

<p>if a nuclear device had gone off anyone who was in/around ground zero between 9/11 and 6-8 months later would have died within 2 years. they wouldn&#39;t just be showing increased cancer rates 15 years later. the cells in their bodies would have been devastated by the radiation exposure and 99% of people who were first responders or at ground zero around that time would have died within months, not just showing increased cancer rates a decade + later</p>

<p>so at absolute worst this is evidence of a dirty bomb. but more likely it&#39;s something they built the buildings with that caused this. either unknown to us before or something that was never publicly broadcast as a dangerous material.</p>

<p>now i am not someone who thinks 9/11 happened as reported. there are way too many inconsistencies and questions surrounding it, and the whole investigation seemed to be half assed and people were being too patriotic to care at the time. we&#39;ve spent more time and money on benghazi investigations than we did on 9/11 if that tells you anything. but i am very certain it was not a nuclear attack</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The difference between acute and chronic radiation exposure can be shown by using exposure to the sun&#39;s rays as an example. An intense exposure to the sun can result in painful burning, peeling, and growing of new skin. However, repeated short exposures provide time for the skin to be repaired between exposures. Whether exposure to the sun&#39;s rays is long term or spread over short periods, some of the injury may not be repaired and may eventually result in skin cancer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no offense taken, but i think you are the one who needs to reconsider</p>

<p>you bring up a great point: the difference between acute and chronic radiation sickness. acute radiation sickness is when you take a very high dosage of radiation in a very short period of time. chronic is when you are exposed to lower levels that increase your risks over time. with a nuclear bomb acute = dead now (between 24 hours and 6 weeks), chronic = dead later (cancer 10-15 years down the road)</p>

<p>my entire point is there are ONLY cases of chronic sickness. there are no cases (i know of) of people who died from acute radiation poisoning. if you have sources of this i would like to see them, because then i might start to change my mind. but until then i will remain unconvinced</p>

<p>the thing with a nuclear device going off in close proximity to thousands of people is that a lot of people are going to absorb a lethal dose of radiation the moment the bomb goes off. they may walk around for a few hours/days, or if they are unlucky weeks, but they are basically dead the moment that bomb went off. </p>

<p>another thing to consider, when a nuclear bomb goes off at or close to ground level, a much higher percentage of radioactive material gets &quot;stuck&quot; to the surrounding matter, causing a &quot;hot zone&quot; of radiation (where as an air explosion most the radioactive material gets launched into the air and distributed over a larger swath of area). this hot zone will also give off lethal doses of radiation, causing acute radiation sickness to those exposed</p>

<p>which my point here is, if a nuclear device exploded on 9/11, there would 100% be cases of acute radiation poisoning. without these cases there is no evidence of an actual nuclear bomb detonating.</p>

<p>now again, as i said in my first post, the cancers people are showing now do fall in line with lower doses of radiation exposure, or chronic radiation sickness. but this could be from a dirty bomb (which is not a nuclear bomb, it is a normal bomb with basically radioactive waste strapped to it, i.e. radioactive shrapnel). the radioactive particles from the dirty bomb could have easily gotten into that cloud of debris and given people cancer now - this is completely plausible. but this also is a far shot from a nuclear bomb going off in NYC on 9/11</p>

<p>so again, unless you can give me verifiable cases of people dying from acute radiation sickness right after the attacks, i will never believe that this was a nuclear attack. because without those cases there is no real evidence</p>

<p><strong>More information about radiation sickness: why not too many cases of acute radiation sickness were noticed among “Ground Zero” responders?</strong></p>

<p>It might sound strange, but indeed not too many cases of acute radiation sickness were reported after the extensive clean-up operation that involved thousands of totally unprotected responders who worked without any “lunar-looking haz-mat suits” and often even without any respirators on Manhattan’s Ground Zero. Intuitively, it might appear that any and every worker who spent some time at Ground Zero should end-up with some acute radiation sickness (ARS) and such a development would be unavoidable. Contrary to the “intuitive presumption”, it was not so in practice. In reality, the Ground Zero responders and local residents suffer from chronic radiation sickness, rather than from an acute one. Why did that happen? ...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sorry was at work and just got to look at this. i&#39;ll try to read more of this if i can because i am sure he has some interesting points, but sorry to say i am still unconvinced by this section</p>

<p>aside from his slightly misleading info on radiation (i&#39;ll get to that a little later) there is no speculation on how much could have actually been given out/what levels would be present afterwords. which i did a little digging and most estimates are that a bomb would have had to have a yield of about .75-1Kt to take the towers down. a bomb of this size would give out lethal doses (as in dead within 48 hours) of radiation for up to 1.5KM from the blast center, and still giving out a blast of 570 R (generally lethal) at 3KM. now since it would have been a subsurface explosion the area wouldn&#39;t have been that wide, but the concentration of radiation would have been higher. then the residual radiation would still be this lethal for 7-10 hours afterwords. it would be to the level of you have at best a 50% chance of surviving with medical help within 3 days, assuming you only took about 10 hours of exposure after the 3 day mark. within 2-3 weeks it would be relatively safe to work on site for short periods of time.</p>

<p>but even all that aside, and there still is <strong>no</strong> evidence of actual acute radiation sickness. yes he states that people with respiratory illnesses were &quot;obviously&quot; actually cases of acute radiation sickness, and only <em>shills</em> would disagree - but where is the proof? out of the &quot;hundreds&quot; of first responders with acute radiation sickness he is saying there were, how many of those people died? because i still can&#39;t find any evidence of this, and he skims over that little detail and starts talking about chronic sickness (so if it is after that i apologize). and the amount of radiation these first responders would have had to take from a nuclear device would absolutely given them a dose of radiation that killed them within days. </p>

<p>acute radiation sickness will. kill. you.</p>

<p>this is from the CDC on radiation exposure, because you don&#39;t get cancer from acute radiation syndrome. your body shuts down way too fast for your cells to mutate and form tumors. your cells basically become so damaged they can no longer function, and you die fairly rapidly</p>

<blockquote>
<p>*Bone marrow syndrome (sometimes referred to as hematopoietic syndrome) the full syndrome will usually occur with a dose between 0.7 and 10 Gy (70 – 1000 rads) though mild symptoms may occur as low as 0.3 Gy or 30 rads.
The survival rate of patients with this syndrome decreases with increasing dose. The primary cause of death is the destruction of the bone marrow, resulting in infection and hemorrhage.</p>

<p>*Gastrointestinal (GI) syndrome: the full syndrome will usually occur with a dose greater than approximately 10 Gy (1000 rads) although some symptoms may occur as low as 6 Gy or 600 rads.
Survival is extremely unlikely with this syndrome. Destructive and irreparable changes in the GI tract and bone marrow usually cause infection, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. Death usually occurs within 2 weeks.</p>

<p>*Cardiovascular (CV)/ Central Nervous System (CNS) syndrome: the full syndrome will usually occur with a dose greater than approximately 50 Gy (5000 rads) although some symptoms may occur as low as 20 Gy or 2000 rads.
Death occurs within 3 days. Death likely is due to collapse of the circulatory system as well as increased pressure in the confining cranial vault as the result of increased fluid content caused by edema, vasculitis, and meningitis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>since this guy used the old form of radiation (roentogens), .7 gray (Gy) is about 80 roentogens. 50 Gy is 5,700 R - so with him talking about a 500 R dose being lethal he isn&#39;t wrong, but you are only in the first level of acute radiation sickness (and far far below what would have been pumped into those on site and the first responders - people at the epicenter of this blast would have been exposed to more like a minimum of 40-50 Gy in the first few hours)</p>

<p>from the same site, when taking a dosage equal or less than 1 Gy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recovery or death: Most patients who do not recover will die within several months of exposure. The recovery process lasts from several weeks up to two years. There should be full recovery for a large percentage of individuals from a few weeks up to two years after exposure.
• death may occur in some individuals at 1.2 Gy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so again i ask, if these first responders were exposed to such high amounts of radiation (which this author states is true), and they did actually have acute radiation sickness (which the author speculates &quot;hundreds&quot; of people did have), <em>why are they still alive</em>. he doesn&#39;t really address this part of it (because it doesn&#39;t fit the narrative). you can speculate and say that they covered up the sickness these people had and all that. but the fact remains that 99% of those first responders would have died in the hospital before cleanup efforts could even begin</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i made an estimate based on this calculator <a href="http://www.stardestroyer.net/Resources/Calculators/NuclearExplosions.html">http://www.stardestroyer.net/Resources/Calculators/NuclearExplosions.html</a> (which i found from some forum related to dune lol - some guy wanted to know how big the explosion of a lasgun hitting a shield would be)</p>

<p>and what i found on this wiki page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_nuclear_explosions">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_nuclear_explosions</a></p>

<p>when i first started looking at this theory a few months back i couldn&#39;t find a lot of info on subsurface explosions and the proliferation of radiation in those scenarios since the vast majority of bombs are air bursts, as this enhances the explosion/destruction portion of the bomb. air bursts also reduce the amount of local radioactivity pretty well - this is why the cities in japan had survivors and there didn&#39;t seem to be any long term consequences to those people who did start rebuilding a few years later. where as a surface burst will have a lot of radioactive particles captured by the surrounding matter. i can admit my estimates could be very far off.. and i agree a subsurface explosion isn&#39;t going to spread the radiation as far. on the flip side though, i can&#39;t see it completely containing it either</p>

<p>but even if it did, the amount of radiation released from the bomb wouldn&#39;t change. so the less distance out it traveled the more concentrated in the affected areas it would be. which only reduces the life spans of the first responders further and increases the time it would be extremely dangerous to be there. and i don&#39;t believe that there is any way it would have been so contained that it would have prevented everyone from dying from acute radiation sickness, which still seems to be the case</p>

<p>so again from what i know and what i&#39;ve seen and read, i still think at worst there was a dirty bomb we weren&#39;t told about. this explains how people have symptoms of chronic radiation sickness now, because they were exposed to low levels of radiation. and it also explains how there are no deaths from acute radiation sickness. it would also fit in with the author of that pdf&#39;s theory that they were monitoring radiation levels on the cleanup crews and shuffling them around, since there still could have been residual radiation in the area that would have been dangerous over long periods of exposure</p>

<p>a dirty bomb is also far more attainable than a full on nuclear device would have been. and if whoever orchestrated the attacks was ever discovered, a lot easier to pass the blame along for</p>

<p>Huge craters under the WTC? Dr Wood shows how the grages and shops under the WTC were not even affected. Firefighters under the towers walked out unscratched..</p>

<p>The cancer is likely caused by the nano particles the dustification of the towers generated.</p>

<p>Your videos support Judy Woods evidence not your claims! In the video you link to it said massive amount sof debris just disappeared... &quot;vaporized into dust&quot;.</p>

<p>You claim the cancer the first responders got was from nukes but there&#39;s no data to support this.. and there&#39;s not even data to show engouh radiation a nuke would produce.. radiation would have been everywhere with a nuke..</p>

<p>The explosion people thoguht was frim below the towers was from the explosion high in the buidling that was transmitted through the elevator shaft all through the building all the way to the gground level.. like a shotgun blast. That&#39;s why there is a mis conception.. EVERYONE would have reported an earthquke.. not just a blast..</p>

<p>In the video you posted it said the bathtub wall shifted in not out.. which makes no sense with a nuke.. and a nuke should have done more than pushed them around.. not even a crack?</p>

<p>Also, I heard that they actually damaged the wall with the equipment.. it wasn&#39;t the event itself that did it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re clearly smarter than the rest of us. Here is a challenge for you.</p>

<p>How much energy would it take to melt 100 tons of steel?</p>

<p>I can tell you it is a hell of a lot more than any directed energy weapon could ever produce. Even if it could, it would burn the atmosphere above the WTC and we&#39;d fucking see it.</p>

<p>You know how we can see lightning? You would have the same thing happen if you pumped enough energy down a beam to melt even 100 tons of steel in seconds, let alone thousands. The air between the DEW and the WTC would turn into a white hot glowing plasma.</p>

<p>That never happened. End of argument. Get an education.</p>

<p>The dust is POURING out man.. those are STEEL panels...</p>

<p>People weren&#39;t working in the WTC balanced on steel beams. They had office furniture and wall cladding and ceilings and all sorts of office furniture. Literally hundreds of tons of stuff not made of steel that could be pulverised as the structure collapsed. That&#39;s what the dust is.</p>

<p>The steel itself is seen falling <em>through</em> the cloud.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That you can&#39;t see them turning completely to dust is mind boggling..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only because you&#39;re an idiot. You&#39;ve been convinced that what you can clearly see is not what is really happening. She told you a bullshit lie about them turning to dust, and you <em>want</em> to believe it, so you tell yourself you <em>can</em> see it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>&quot;.</p>

<p>Once people like you have decided what you think is true, you will clutch to any bullshit claim to justify your belief. So even though we can all see the steel doesn&#39;t turn to dust, but instead pulls dust down with it in its slipstream, you will refuse to believe the obvious truth because it would mean accepting that you fell for a load of bullshit.</p>

<p>Weak minds can&#39;t handle the truth.</p>
