       WISE seems to have ruled out a Jupiter to 20000 AU and a Saturn to 10000, but I don’t know the actual scope of their study.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Kuiper Belt falls off long before the (STILL THEORIZED, EVEN; we act as though it exists when we don’t even know yet) Oort Cloud, that much is certain. Falloffs generally only happen with the presence of a planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would not be surprised if an Earth-sized object is out there, which means that it’s a planet, no matter what the fucking IAU wants to pretend about these things.

       I thought I made a submission about this a week ago but I cannot find it. I even had a similar title for it. I must have been a bit buzzed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, There's actually some real science that was recently published that suggests they found planet X. Here's an article/excerpt:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That is, perhaps, until now. On December 8 researchers from Sweden and Mexico quietly submitted two papers to the prestigious journal Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics, announcing their discovery of not one but two possible Planet X candidates.

       the idea of planet X has been around since about the time we started trying to explain the funky orbits or Uranus and pluto. they know something is out there effecting their orbits they just have nothing to point at yet

       I don't know about "nothing". You should read the paper the scientists published. It's pretty convincing that they found "something" out there.

       Cool beans. I'm wondering if this is going to be just swept under the rug. It's definitely not received as much traction as I figured it would. OP kind of proves that point by not knowing about the recent info.

       I have a buddy that is completely immersed in the planet x theory, I just can't get into it.  So what if it's true, what does that mean?  Are we going to be invaded by aliens from Planet X, who the fuck cares, and why should I?  I'm not even saying I don't believe it's possible, but even if it is, there are so many other terrestrial  things on this earth that actually mean something, that this is just disinformation, a distraction in my opinion.

       I read sitchin and he has some really cool ideas on the subject.  All the water on this planet did not just come from comets.  Maybe another planet side swiped us and left the water behind. As he suggests.

       iirc the accepted theory on the moon is something hit us, possibly about same time the asteroid belt between mars/jupiter formed.

       now that they have confirmed what they think is water on ceres i would say that could be a fairly likely source as well.

       Actually we could sneak up on it.

       Exactly, and even if it did somehow miraculously sneak up on us, so what?  What would happen?  The entire Planet X thing seems like a distraction to me.

       I'm interested in it, and I've actually dreamt about it before when i was younger.  I just think that with all we have out there along with other countries, someone is going to spot it and there will be no way to hide it.

       This is one of my favorite topics. There is a lot of BS out there but there is also some good science to back it up. I think most people can agree that it's at least a possibility. That's pretty cool in itself

       I think there is no need to worry or lose sleep over but only to observe and maybe be a little curious, i know i am but only for the truth. I'm sure there are some that know the truth about this but i doubt they would share it with the rest, for what ever reason...

      <blockquote>

        Sitchin, who died in 2010, denied any connection between his work and Lieder's claims. In 2007, partly in response to Lieder's proclamations, Sitchin published a book, The End of Days, which set the time for the last passing of Nibiru by Earth at 556 BC, which would mean, given the object's supposed 3,600-year orbit, that it would return sometime around AD 2900. He did however say that he believed that the Annunaki might return earlier by spaceship, and that the timing of their return would coincide with the shift from the astrological Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius, sometime between 2090 and 2370.

       There is info on PlanetX/Nibiru all over the net, the question is how much of it is true.

       That was for the shills. It's usually the first thing they do is complain about the source. So I went and found a "valid" source beforehand.

       That makes a ton of sense.  I did not look at it like that.  But surely something that size would be visible from the sun hitting it within a few LD's wouldn't you think?
