<p>The Kuiper Belt falls off long before the (STILL THEORIZED, EVEN; we act as though it exists when we don’t even know yet) Oort Cloud, that much is certain. Falloffs generally only happen with the presence of a planet.</p>

<p>I would not be surprised if an Earth-sized object is out there, which means that it’s a planet, no matter what the fucking IAU wants to pretend about these things.</p>

<p>Anyway, There&#39;s actually some real science that was recently published that suggests they found planet X. Here&#39;s an article/excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is, perhaps, until now. On December 8 researchers from Sweden and Mexico quietly submitted two papers to the prestigious journal Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics, announcing their discovery of not one but two possible Planet X candidates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sitchin, who died in 2010, denied any connection between his work and Lieder&#39;s claims. In 2007, partly in response to Lieder&#39;s proclamations, Sitchin published a book, The End of Days, which set the time for the last passing of Nibiru by Earth at 556 BC, which would mean, given the object&#39;s supposed 3,600-year orbit, that it would return sometime around AD 2900. He did however say that he believed that the Annunaki might return earlier by spaceship, and that the timing of their return would coincide with the shift from the astrological Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius, sometime between 2090 and 2370.</p>
