        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m very confused.</p>

<p>The first time I&#39;ve heard about the Illuminati is when I read the Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown, and it was fascinating. The book said that Illuminati is a group of &quot;enlightened&quot; scientists who want to reveal the truths which some religions were trying to hide.</p>

<p>However, as I started using the internet, I found websites and videos about another kind of Illuminati - one that consists of people who worship Satan and try to control the world with a so called New World Order. I read about all these celebrities and rich people who do things from selling their souls to brainwashing  our society.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really curious and would like to know more about this. Anybody on reddit has anything to tell about the Illuminati?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could call them scientists but you are more accurate in calling them occultists or alchemists.  They use science as a tool, but the knowledge that makes the <em>illumined</em> is not the model of modern science that the public currently accepts.</p>

<p>Think about it this way, what did alchemists want to do back in the medieval times?  They wanted to find a way to turn worthless material into gold.  They were considered to be scientists/wizards/sorcerers and were considered to be involved in dark/black magic.</p>

<p>Today alchemists have succeeded.  They discovered a way to make <em>paper</em> as valuable as gold without even ensuring that the paper is backed by gold.  Today the <em>illumined</em> have successfully developed the infrastructure to give paper the value of gold.  Did they do this using <em>science</em>?  i don&#39;t know if I would call it that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would you consider this <em>science</em> as a technology improvement, though? Technology has come a long way since the medieval time, and now many things cost way more or less than they should be. What do you think about that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I think part of the reason that most people don&#39;t think that the Illuminati exist is due to compartmentalization.  For these elite, whoever they are, it is preferable to put a system in place that executes their will without their direct influence.  That way it is organic and cannot be traced back to them.  In this case I think they use the false dichotomy between socialism and capitalism (but mainly capitalism) to ensure that the gap between the rich and the poor widens and that no matter what consumers decide to do, it leads to money in the pockets of the elites.</p>

<p>So to answer your question, I do not believe that the elite themselves manipulate pricing, because that would leave a trail.  What they do is indoctrinate entire generations to believe that all decisions should be driven by profit, and by that I mean <em>monetary</em> profit. They teach us that resources are scarce and that the only gain to be achieved comes at the expense of someone else.  (It used to be called mercantilism, and it is what wiped out the Native American population.)   The system has been in the process of being developed over many many years, and today it is in full effect to the point that people will literally die to protect this system.</p>

<p>All these people have to do today is sit back and not cause a fuss while our hard earned dollars are funneled into their pockets.  Here and there they stir up fights amongst us so that we don&#39;t direct our attention towards them.</p>

<p>If you understand human behavior and understand that the most psychopathic and manipulative people are rewarded the most on our current system, you realize that there <em>must</em> exist a group that has won this game that we play.  </p>

<p>The latest example of this is this douche Martin Shkreli that just got arrested.  He caught a glimpse of the game and how people are playing it.  He tried to pull the same sort of trick that many other pharmaceutical companies pull because &quot;hey, they are doing, why shouldn&#39;t I?&quot;  The problem was that he was too obvious about it and he drew attention to this twisted game that we play.  I believe this prompted the elite to squelch this naive poser to reinforce the narrative that the game is fair and that evil is punished.  This was not because they were upset with what he did, it is because he was drawing to much attention to the tricks that they pull.</p>

<p>I went on a bit of a rant there but maybe I answered your question?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im no expert but what we call the illuminati could be the Kakocracy that James Corbett talks about in his latest podcast. James details how pedophilia can be used to control a large group of conspirators and make sure none step out of line. Essentially their anti social nature is both their greatest asset and their kill switch.</p>

<p>It only lasted a few years until it was disbanded.</p>

<p>I do realize that there are many societies mistaken as the Illuminati, but the Illuminati itself is merely a myth to the majority of the world. It&#39;s hard to know what&#39;s true and what&#39;s not.</p>
