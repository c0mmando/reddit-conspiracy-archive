      </p>
      <p>
       I don't own a car.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have a mortgage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have a cell phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I pay for nearly everything in cash.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know my neighbors. I have a very good pair of well fitting boots that will take me where I need to go. I have a passport. I have a vacant empty criminal history. I have cash to travel. I have no identifying tatoos, few trackable medical records, and virtually no public record of any kind outside of utility billing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I (sort of) speak a couple of languages and can read several others.

      <p>
       I am everyman. I can fit in anywhere and disappear into the woodwork.

       This is a vital battleground here, this is the war of information.  The Elite can only get away with their crimes if people are falling for their propaganda, one of the most important things to do is to spread the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If today I post about the danger of a specific vaccine, there's a chance I'll influence someone not to take it, that could save their life, it also stops Big Pharma getting the money for the sale of the jab.  That means I've reduced the profit of a corrupt industry and potentially saved someone's life or good health.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same with False Flags, they only work if people believe them, you can't go to war under a false pretext if nobody believes it.  The work we're doing here is incredibly important and if anything we should all be doing a lot more!

       I'll tell you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But one less thing this year.  One less gallon of gas.  Earn one less dollar.  Get one less lottery ticket.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop funding this machine by just $10 this coming year.  It won't have an effect at first, but if you get into the habit, and spread the notion to your friends, in time, Nancy Pelosi won't be able to afford a new jet, and John McCain won't be able to buy a new ranch.  And while this doesn't seem that big a price to pay to you, to that kind of person, with their entitlement, they might literally fall over dead of an aneurysm, and we all win.
      </p>
      <p>
       You kill cancer by cutting off the blood supply.  None of us are prepared to go cold turkey-- but just spend $10 less in 2016 and pay $10 less in taxes.

       Well, "their" tactic has been to slowly remove rights and enslave us more, one little step at a time. I don't see that changing, so why wouldn't the same work for us?

      <p>
       No-one will be able to change the course of the world by themselves and doing anything radical will just put you into trouble. Changing your on path one step at a time and set an example for others could eventually work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that I'm that example, I work, spend, loan, whatever, just like everyone else and support the system in that way.

       It'll happen faster than you think.  Right now the whole system needs
       <em>
        every single penny poured into it.
       </em>
       There is
       <em>
        no margin at all.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Reduce the flow by 3%, and you'll see a shocking ripple flow through.  It doesn't need to be 50% or 25% or 80%... there is
       <em>
        no margin at all whatsoever.
       </em>
       They've established a devouring system that requires every single ounce of energy that everyone can pour into it.  Reduce it by a hair, and it won't operate any more.

       i think americans should all stop paying their medical and student bills at the same time.  we need more lawyers to help define this movement because lawyers are the ones who are profiting from bending laws to benefit the elite.  we're ultimately fighting a PR battle and we can't make very many mistakes.  but we must taunt a crash of the system before our lives crash, we're already blamed for all the elite's problems anyways we might as well push it to its logical extreme.  every dogma in the world is being pushed to its logical extreme anyways and its being cheered on by our politicians on both sides.  why cant the people cheer and organize for an end to medical and student bill oppression until our leaders apologize for their extremism and corruption?  Our leaders have been far more concerned about Iraq and then Libya rather than American lives here at home losing our basic freedoms.

       My thoughts exactly. We now have a voice and strength to challenge the evil things that want to control everything. The government and media gatekeepers are loosing power and we are seeing that more then ever. They are now trying to control using one of the last methods they have.

       People on this sub are doing exactly what needs to be done. We promote and make use of alternative media, providing competition in media and preventing the amalgamation of a single source media system.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are extending the use of the internet to include personally relevant content rather than just the marketing campaigns of pharmaceutical companies, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually this knowledge, and platform will become more practical in how we function.
      </p>
      <p>
       3D printing maximizing the use of locally available resources will stop providing a reason to fund these pricks and their agendas. Instead of paying the electric company, owned by the Rothschilds, Mitsubishi, the Hearsts, that have bottlenecked resources in cooperation with the Nobles, Rockefellers, the monarchs, we will be building energy solutions into the footprints of our houses.
      </p>
      <p>
       This takes away from the need for government and their funding. We will eliminate waste by incorporating waste management into buildings, minimize maintenance costs, maximize food security.
      </p>
      <p>
       3D printing will make SIM and whatever similar games a reality and as we focus our attention towards providing solutions that eliminate outside forces, we will be less subjected to those forces.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this requires understanding of the importance to eliminate these streams directed towards the government that are used against the people. Communication is required and ideas advanced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you eliminate the streams of power being directed towards these assholes, you eliminate the power and the associated atrocities.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, as long as we rely on provisions from a select group of psychopaths, we are at the mercy of this group and whatever boogeyman they dream up.

       If you want to do something different, I suggest becoming rich and joining the illuminati and infiltrating their ranks.  Build up some influence from within and convince other illuminati to rebel against the system.  Travel the world and convince every influential business magnate to join your cause.  Then, if you are lucky, this might happen:

       After the final battle between the young guns and the old guard, you cradle the head of your dying friend in your arms.  "We did it," your friend says with his dying breath.  You gently rest him on the floor.  There, within the secret headquarters of the Illuminati, the throne sits empty amidst the bodies of the fallen.  Who will claim the throne?  After some silent deliberation, you climb the steps to the golden throne that sits beneath the all-seeing eye.  "Things will be different," you think to yourself.

       I personally believe humans are innately selfish in general, of course there are exceptions, but since the beginning of recorded history, people in general conspire, hoard power, act against the greater good, etc. Its hard to change the basic general nature of people. I dont think its something one or even a large group of people can correct quickly. It will take a large scale, nearly world-wide movement. That's just my layman's opinion though

       that's not the basic general nature. that's what happened in the mediterranean, birthplace of slavery and imperial colonialism. indigenous peoples weren't peaceful, but they were very realistic about what it meant to survive--they knew you couldn't kill off your neighbours, because they came from the same place as you did.
      </p>
      <p>
       indigenous peoples had ritual and community, with religion to guide their ways of life. they understood that there was a balance. you don't find that in the birthplace of imperial colonialism and slavery; i.e. the flourishing of hermeneutic perspectives which lead to genocide basically everywhere.

       no, it isn't. i study religion; with the study of religion comes the study of anthropology, history, archaeology, etc. so far i've done a lot of studying on the religious philosophies of varying african tribes, ancient slavic peoples, eastern philosophies (including sects of buddhism, hinduism, and shintoism), mesoamerican, native american (from east to west and in canada), celtic, nordic, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
       you would be surprised by the comparative studies, which all indicate that these peoples were much more progressive and took more responsibility for themselves in relation to the world around them. not all of them were cannibalistic (and even if they were, it is either a "left hand path" cult or in relation to rituals as ancient as the culture itself; for example, eating the parts of a naturally deceased member of your family in order to gain their strength and wisdom), and "war" to tribes was more like raiding. "war" was not a thing. you raided your neighbour, at the most, and then made peace with them, or if you were to "take over", you'd adapt to their perspectives (not co-erce them to yours).

       When you first become a "conspiracy theorist" you think there are just a couple of power hungry selfish bad apples at the top, and as soon as you get other people to look at the evidence they'll see you are right, then we can rid the system of corruption and all will be well.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then as time goes on you notice that most people will refuse to look at the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those that will look at the evidence will refuse to consider it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile they
       <em>
        accept everything
       </em>
       they are told by the news, politicians, priests, professors (or whatever other authority figure is telling them something).
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically they are incapable of going against authority.  That is the bulk of the human species, and they actually are the ones
       <em>
        enabling
       </em>
       the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in the end, ironically, conspiracy theorists come to sympathise with the elites - of course you have to manipulate people
       <em>
        too stupid
       </em>
       to figure out the most obvious, basic shit on their own to do the right thing, you sure as hell can't explain it to them in rational terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bottom line is that unfortunately the human race is a violent, destructive, stupid, narrow-minded, short-sighted species, and the sooner the Earth's immune system kicks in the better.

       -Learned/learning basic survival skills (fire making, water filtering, First aid, etc...)

       -Small investments in
       <em>
        physical

       Gold/Silver  (be very weary of stock in precious metals.  I suggest only buying physical metal in a small qty over time)

       -Stopped contributing in any way to conversations that are obvious distraction issues (other than maybe to point out that there are more important things that need to be discussed like the TPP, CISA, a possible WW3, etc...).
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as trying to make a broader impact, I haven't done much to be honest. I've e-mailed and called all of my federal representation multiple times in the past 3 months or so about an array of issues including the TPP and CISA but I know that doesn't do much if anything at all.

       Just my two cents; you should stop investing in gold and silver and start investing in tools.  Tools can make it possible to do a whole host of things (build, fix, create) whereas precious metals may not even be used as currency for much longer.  In a post-collapse environment, tools will bring you far more stability than precious metals.  Just say'n.

       Honestly that is an important point and something I've thought about. I haven't been dumping a lot of money into precious metals and I don't think it will be as important a currency as skills and tools will be in the event of a total collapse. However, before every big crash the price of Gold and Silver skyrockets. I'm hoping to be able to dump it during that time and use the money to buy anything of importance that I can, such as tools, while money still has some value. If there is no crash then at least I'm diversifying my wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are 100% correct though, tools, skills, and networking will be the most important things in the event of a full on crash. It makes sense that people will value things of practical use over things like precious metals. Very few will have a practical use for such things.

       The silver lining is that after you buy the tool, you start investing time in learning to use it.  Eventually, you become skilled enough that people will seek you out (in your community) to have you do work for them. This in turn sets you on the path to self-sufficiency.  Tools are a much better investment. ;-)

       We are not in control.  If we were to organize or take action we would be considered a terrorist group.  Our strength lays in remaining isolated and neutral.  The NWO wants us to fight, then they get to kill more of the rogues.  That's how the domestication process works.

       Think about this, nothing has changed since the olden days with ruthless kings and queens. There is the ruling class and the serfs. It has been like that for thousands of years. It's not something you can stop by snapping your fingers. If there was lawlesness another emporer would rise and the cycle would continue. Just my 2 cents

       OP makes an important point. You quickly reach a point when the 'doom porn' can become a destructive addiction; there are only so many articles you can read. And they never stop, information grows at an exponential rate .. you can spend every second awake reading and you all youll have is an infinitesimal piece of it all .. and no skills, no social life, no connection to the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, you're well read? What's the use in being hyper-aware of every wrong, every evil deed going on in the remote corners of the earth?  Now you must dodge several additional bullets: paranoia, faux-intellectualism, anhedonia, nihilism, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "I'm awake everyone else is sheeple" attitude must be crossed and left behind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've arrived at the conclusion of forget changing the world, change yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is difficult enough of an endeavor. It only takes a lifetime.

       What have I done?  I've been a positive influence on those around me.  I do my best to be a great human being although I'm extremely flawed and scarred.  I do my best to not be jaded, to be positive, to be happy, to follow my dreams, to keep my morals.  Many people do not do this and they suffer and they hate people that do try to be genuine.  I've seen my influence skitter around through people, it happens, we are all much more powerful than it seems.  I've inspired people to find true happiness in their spirit.  That's what I CAN do and I'll keep trying to help people.  Small tiny almost insignificant actions can have massive effects on people.  The way that the powers that be got to where they are was small consistent actions over and over and over.  It's taken them hundreds of years.  The opposition needs to do the same and I see the results are slowly coming in.   Social change is a slow business, you can't just get on a megaphone and enlighten everyone.  Humans learn by coming to realizations on their own, giving them information bounces off, they need to deeply ingrain understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Large actions may come someday if or whenever people can agree and come together, when we have social harmony.  There are no philosophical leaders, there is no clear direct path for us to take, when someone can simply and clearly show everyone a good action that everyone can do that will make life better, they'll do it.

       Its about reaching a critical mass of people who know the truth.  Once its learned its never forgotten, and you become part of the solution.  Many people work too hard, too long hours, battling to keep the wolf from the door, frightened to lose their job, this is their system.  Also, divide and rule.  Create new enemies such as immigrants, unemployed, working class etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Already people throughout the developed world are voting differently.  Take the US at the moment, you have Trump and Saunders, which wouldn't have happened 20 or 30 years ago.  Its because people are learning the truth about their politicians throughout the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, continue to educate and inform, share information.  Change will come.

       Great post! I completely agree, if you want to change the world the best way is to get out there and do it. I currently work in mental healthcare development, have worked in health clinics and in research labs. My hope is that my work will, alongside the work of
       <em>
        thousands
       </em>
       of others, help bring about a new age of prosperity. I am a Marxist at heart and I honestly believe that the general trend is towards making the kind of hierarchical structures that rule the world today completely fucking obsolete. If they try and hold on after that point... well... that's where revolution comes in though obviously it's my sincere hope that we will make it there through non-violent means.

       I'm not afraid. I think America is about to see the worst era of its history, but I'm not afraid. TPTB want you to fear. The media wants you to fear. The candidates wanted you to fear in the debate last night. Admitting fear is admitting defeat. Just control what you can as an individual, continue to spread love and do your part, no matter how small. Just don't fear, its letting them win.

       Honestly that is an important point and something I've thought about. I haven't been dumping a lot of money into precious metals and I don't think it will be as important a currency as skills and tools will be in the event of a total collapse. However, before every big crash the price of Gold and Silver skyrockets. I'm hoping to be able to dump it during that time and use the money to buy anything of importance that I can, such as tools, while money still has some value. If there is no crash then at least I'm diversifying my wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are 100% correct though, tools, skills, and networking will be the most important things in the event of a full on crash. It makes sense that people will value things of practical use over things like precious metals. Very few will have a practical use for such things.
