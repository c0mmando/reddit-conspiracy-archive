<p>I don&#39;t own a car.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a mortgage.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a cell phone. </p>

<p>I pay for nearly everything in cash.</p>

<p>I know my neighbors. I have a very good pair of well fitting boots that will take me where I need to go. I have a passport. I have a vacant empty criminal history. I have cash to travel. I have no identifying tatoos, few trackable medical records, and virtually no public record of any kind outside of utility billing.</p>

<p>I (sort of) speak a couple of languages and can read several others. </p>

<p>I am everyman. I can fit in anywhere and disappear into the woodwork.</p>

<p>If today I post about the danger of a specific vaccine, there&#39;s a chance I&#39;ll influence someone not to take it, that could save their life, it also stops Big Pharma getting the money for the sale of the jab.  That means I&#39;ve reduced the profit of a corrupt industry and potentially saved someone&#39;s life or good health.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same with False Flags, they only work if people believe them, you can&#39;t go to war under a false pretext if nobody believes it.  The work we&#39;re doing here is incredibly important and if anything we should all be doing a lot more!</p>

<p>But one less thing this year.  One less gallon of gas.  Earn one less dollar.  Get one less lottery ticket.</p>

<p>Stop funding this machine by just $10 this coming year.  It won&#39;t have an effect at first, but if you get into the habit, and spread the notion to your friends, in time, Nancy Pelosi won&#39;t be able to afford a new jet, and John McCain won&#39;t be able to buy a new ranch.  And while this doesn&#39;t seem that big a price to pay to you, to that kind of person, with their entitlement, they might literally fall over dead of an aneurysm, and we all win.</p>

<p>You kill cancer by cutting off the blood supply.  None of us are prepared to go cold turkey-- but just spend $10 less in 2016 and pay $10 less in taxes.</p>

Our leaders have been far more concerned about Iraq and then Libya rather than American lives here at home losing our basic freedoms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People on this sub are doing exactly what needs to be done. We promote and make use of alternative media, providing competition in media and preventing the amalgamation of a single source media system.</p>

<p>We are extending the use of the internet to include personally relevant content rather than just the marketing campaigns of pharmaceutical companies, etc.</p>

<p>Eventually this knowledge, and platform will become more practical in how we function.</p>

<p>3D printing maximizing the use of locally available resources will stop providing a reason to fund these pricks and their agendas. Instead of paying the electric company, owned by the Rothschilds, Mitsubishi, the Hearsts, that have bottlenecked resources in cooperation with the Nobles, Rockefellers, the monarchs, we will be building energy solutions into the footprints of our houses. </p>

<p>This takes away from the need for government and their funding. We will eliminate waste by incorporating waste management into buildings, minimize maintenance costs, maximize food security. </p>

<p>3D printing will make SIM and whatever similar games a reality and as we focus our attention towards providing solutions that eliminate outside forces, we will be less subjected to those forces.</p>

<p>But this requires understanding of the importance to eliminate these streams directed towards the government that are used against the people. Communication is required and ideas advanced.</p>

<p>Once you eliminate the streams of power being directed towards these assholes, you eliminate the power and the associated atrocities.</p>

<p>But, as long as we rely on provisions from a select group of psychopaths, we are at the mercy of this group and whatever boogeyman they dream up.</p>

<p>If you want to do something different, I suggest becoming rich and joining the illuminati and infiltrating their ranks.  Build up some influence from within and convince other illuminati to rebel against the system.  Travel the world and convince every influential business magnate to join your cause.  Then, if you are lucky, this might happen:  </p>

<p>After the final battle between the young guns and the old guard, you cradle the head of your dying friend in your arms.  &quot;We did it,&quot; your friend says with his dying breath.  You gently rest him on the floor.  There, within the secret headquarters of the Illuminati, the throne sits empty amidst the bodies of the fallen.  Who will claim the throne?  After some silent deliberation, you climb the steps to the golden throne that sits beneath the all-seeing eye.  &quot;Things will be different,&quot; you think to yourself.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no, it isn&#39;t. i study religion; with the study of religion comes the study of anthropology, history, archaeology, etc. so far i&#39;ve done a lot of studying on the religious philosophies of varying african tribes, ancient slavic peoples, eastern philosophies (including sects of buddhism, hinduism, and shintoism), mesoamerican, native american (from east to west and in canada), celtic, nordic, and more. </p>

<p>you would be surprised by the comparative studies, which all indicate that these peoples were much more progressive and took more responsibility for themselves in relation to the world around them. not all of them were cannibalistic (and even if they were, it is either a &quot;left hand path&quot; cult or in relation to rituals as ancient as the culture itself; for example, eating the parts of a naturally deceased member of your family in order to gain their strength and wisdom), and &quot;war&quot; to tribes was more like raiding. &quot;war&quot; was not a thing. you raided your neighbour, at the most, and then made peace with them, or if you were to &quot;take over&quot;, you&#39;d adapt to their perspectives (not co-erce them to yours).</p>

<p>i can talk more about the subject, if you like. or give you some reading material. would you like citations?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m afraid of nothing personally. Four years in the Marine Corps taught me combat and basic life saving techniques. I would like to learn more survival skills regardless.</p>

<p>What do I actually do to fight the corruption and sorry state of our world? I&#39;m somewhat ashamed to say, nothing. I work too much and have too little personal time. Perfect example of keeping us down, eh?</p>

<p>I share the occasional post on social media the few times I go on it. I teach my children differing world views and religious views. I have them enrolled in self defence classes. I think things will get bad enough for their generation to get to a breaking point. </p>

<p>I honestly believe nothing will happen in our generation. We are entirely too docile, well fed and uneducated to reach a breaking point.  Except for the few of us that are the exception of course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you first become a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; you think there are just a couple of power hungry selfish bad apples at the top, and as soon as you get other people to look at the evidence they&#39;ll see you are right, then we can rid the system of corruption and all will be well.    </p>

<p>But then as time goes on you notice that most people will refuse to look at the evidence.    </p>

<p>Those that will look at the evidence will refuse to consider it.    </p>

<p>Meanwhile they <em>accept everything</em> they are told by the news, politicians, priests, professors (or whatever other authority figure is telling them something).    </p>

<p>Basically they are incapable of going against authority.  That is the bulk of the human species, and they actually are the ones <em>enabling</em> the whole thing.    </p>

<p>So, in the end, ironically, conspiracy theorists come to sympathise with the elites - of course you have to manipulate people <em>too stupid</em> to figure out the most obvious, basic shit on their own to do the right thing, you sure as hell can&#39;t explain it to them in rational terms.      </p>

<p>The bottom line is that unfortunately the human race is a violent, destructive, stupid, narrow-minded, short-sighted species, and the sooner the Earth&#39;s immune system kicks in the better.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what I have done/am doing for myself at least.</p>

<p>-Learned/learning basic survival skills (fire making, water filtering, First aid, etc...)</p>

<p>-Small investments in <em>physical</em> Gold/Silver  (be very weary of stock in precious metals.  I suggest only buying physical metal in a small qty over time)</p>

<p>-Stopped contributing in any way to conversations that are obvious distraction issues (other than maybe to point out that there are more important things that need to be discussed like the TPP, CISA, a possible WW3, etc...).</p>

<p>As far as trying to make a broader impact, I haven&#39;t done much to be honest. I&#39;ve e-mailed and called all of my federal representation multiple times in the past 3 months or so about an array of issues including the TPP and CISA but I know that doesn&#39;t do much if anything at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just my two cents; you should stop investing in gold and silver and start investing in tools.  Tools can make it possible to do a whole host of things (build, fix, create) whereas precious metals may not even be used as currency for much longer.  In a post-collapse environment, tools will bring you far more stability than precious metals.  Just say&#39;n.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly that is an important point and something I&#39;ve thought about. I haven&#39;t been dumping a lot of money into precious metals and I don&#39;t think it will be as important a currency as skills and tools will be in the event of a total collapse. However, before every big crash the price of Gold and Silver skyrockets. I&#39;m hoping to be able to dump it during that time and use the money to buy anything of importance that I can, such as tools, while money still has some value. If there is no crash then at least I&#39;m diversifying my wealth. </p>

<p>You are 100% correct though, tools, skills, and networking will be the most important things in the event of a full on crash. It makes sense that people will value things of practical use over things like precious metals. Very few will have a practical use for such things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The silver lining is that after you buy the tool, you start investing time in learning to use it.

    <div class="md"><p>OP makes an important point. You quickly reach a point when the &#39;doom porn&#39; can become a destructive addiction; there are only so many articles you can read. And they never stop, information grows at an exponential rate .. you can spend every second awake reading and you all youll have is an infinitesimal piece of it all .. and no skills, no social life, no connection to the world.</p>

<p>So, you&#39;re well read? What&#39;s the use in being hyper-aware of every wrong, every evil deed going on in the remote corners of the earth?  Now you must dodge several additional bullets: paranoia, faux-intellectualism, anhedonia, nihilism, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What have I done?  I&#39;ve been a positive influence on those around me.  I do my best to be a great human being although I&#39;m extremely flawed and scarred.  I do my best to not be jaded, to be positive, to be happy, to follow my dreams, to keep my morals.  Many people do not do this and they suffer and they hate people that do try to be genuine.  I&#39;ve seen my influence skitter around through people, it happens, we are all much more powerful than it seems.  I&#39;ve inspired people to find true happiness in their spirit.  That&#39;s what I CAN do and I&#39;ll keep trying to help people.  Small tiny almost insignificant actions can have massive effects on people.  The way that the powers that be got to where they are was small consistent actions over and over and over.  It&#39;s taken them hundreds of years.  The opposition needs to do the same and I see the results are slowly coming in.   Social change is a slow business, you can&#39;t just get on a megaphone and enlighten everyone.  Humans learn by coming to realizations on their own, giving them information bounces off, they need to deeply ingrain understanding.</p>

<p>Large actions may come someday if or whenever people can agree and come together, when we have social harmony.  There are no philosophical leaders, there is no clear direct path for us to take, when someone can simply and clearly show everyone a good action that everyone can do that will make life better, they&#39;ll do it.</p>

Many people work too hard, too long hours, battling to keep the wolf from the door, frightened to lose their job, this is their system.  Also, divide and rule.  Create new enemies such as immigrants, unemployed, working class etc.</p>

<p>Already people throughout the developed world are voting differently.  Take the US at the moment, you have Trump and Saunders, which wouldn&#39;t have happened 20 or 30 years ago.  Its because people are learning the truth about their politicians throughout the world.</p>

I currently work in mental healthcare development, have worked in health clinics and in research labs. My hope is that my work will, alongside the work of <em>thousands</em> of others, help bring about a new age of prosperity. I am a Marxist at heart and I honestly believe that the general trend is towards making the kind of hierarchical structures that rule the world today completely fucking obsolete. If they try and hold on after that point... well... that&#39;s where revolution comes in though obviously it&#39;s my sincere hope that we will make it there through non-violent means.  </p>
