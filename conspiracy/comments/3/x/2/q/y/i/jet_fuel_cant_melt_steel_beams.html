        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams, so why was there molten metal at the WTC collapse sites?</p>

<p>NIST claims that WTC 1&amp;2 collapsed due to jet fueled fires (just normal offices fires for WTC7) which were not hot enough to produce molten steel or iron, but also claim that if there had been molten steel or iron in the debris afterwards, it would have been irrelevant to the cause of the collapses. The evidence of molten steel or iron cannot be called “irrelevant,” given the fact that the building fires, as NIST pointed out, cannot explain it.</p>

<p><strong>Physical Evidence</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf">Early in 2002, Barnett and two WPI colleagues published an analysis of a section of steel from one of the Twin Towers, along with sections from WTC 7, as an appendix to FEMA’s 2002 World Trade Center Building Performance Study</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html">Their discoveries were also reported in a WPI article entitled “The ‘Deep Mystery’ of Melted Steel,” which said:</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Steel – which has a melting point of 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit – may weaken and bend, but does not melt during an ordinary office fire. Yet metallurgical studies on WTC steel brought back to WPI reveal that a novel phenomenon – called a eutectic reaction – occurred at the surface, causing intergranular melting capable of turning a solid steel girder into Swiss cheese.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html">Stating that the New York Times called these findings “perhaps the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation,” the article added:</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>A one-inch column has been reduced to half-inch thickness. Its edges – which are curled like a paper scroll – have been thinned to almost razor sharpness. Gaping holes – some larger than a silver dollar – let light shine through a formerly solid steel flange. This Swiss cheese appearance shocked all of the fire-wise professors, who expected to see distortion and bending – but not holes.</p>

<p><strong>Testimony from Firefighters:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQyIN6OTMyY">New York Fire Department Captain Philip Ruvolo said: “You’d get down below and you’d see molten steel, molten steel, running down the channel rails, like you’re in a foundry, like lava.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fallenbrothers.com/community/showthread.php?2062-Recovery-worker-reflects-on-months-spent-at-Ground-Zero&amp;p=2948">Joe O’Toole, a Bronx firefighter who worked on the rescue and cleanup efforts, reported that one beam lifted from deep below the surface months later, in February 2002, “was dripping from the molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_G21B2qiQM">New York firefighters recalled in the documentary film Collateral Damages, “heat so intense they encountered rivers of molten steel.”</a></li>

<p><strong>Testimony from Other Professionals:</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjmHqES_lto&amp;t=40s">Leslie Robertson, a member of the engineering firm that designed the World Trade Center, said 21 days after the attack: “When we were down at the B1 level, one of the firefighters said, ‘I think you’d be interested in this,’ and they pulled up a big block of concrete and there was a, like a little river of steel, flowing.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060909104247/http://www.seau.org/SEAUNews-2001-10.pdf">Ron Burger, a public health advisor at the National Center for Environmental Health who arrived at Ground Zero September 12, 2001, said: “Feeling the heat, seeing the molten steel, the layers upon layers of ash, like lava, it reminded me of Mt. St. Helen’s and the thousands who fled that disaster.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/Publications/Special/Welch.htm">In late fall 2001, Dr. Alison Geyh of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health reported: “Fires are still actively burning and the smoke is very intense. In some pockets now being uncovered, they are finding molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130730103131/http://911encyclopedia.com/wiki/index.php/Publication:20121014014812">Joe Allbaugh, the Director of FEMA, said in an October 2001 interview on CBS: “It’s just too hot for rescuers to get into [some] areas. So we do not know yet what’s in those areas, other than very hot, molten material.”</a></li>
<li>Dr. Keith Eaton reported in Structural Engineer: “They showed us many fascinating slides . . . ranging from molten metal which was still red hot weeks after the event, to 4-inch thick steel plates sheared and bent in the disaster.”</li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Underground fires burned at temperatures up to 2,000 degrees. As the
huge cranes pulled steel beams from the pile, safety experts worried about the
effects of the extreme heat on the crane rigging and the hazards of contact with the
hot steel. And they were concerned that applying water to cool the steel could cause
a steam explosion that would propel nearby objects with deadly force. Special
expertise was needed. <strong>OSHA called in Mohammad Ayub and Scott Jin, structural
engineers from its national office, to assess the situation. They recommended a
special handling procedure, including the use of specialized rigging and instruments.</strong></p>

<li><a href="http://gcn.com/articles/2002/09/09/handheld-app-eased-recovery-tasks.aspx">Greg Fuchek, vice president of a company that supplied computer equipment used to identify human remains, reported that “sometimes when a worker would pull a steel beam from the wreckage, the end of the beam would be dripping molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/sasalum/newsltr/summer2002/k911.html">Sarah Atlas, of New Jersey’s Task Force One Urban Search and Rescue, arrived at Ground Zero on September 11 and reported that “fires burned and molten steel flowed in the pile of ruins still settling beneath her feet.”</a></li>

<p>The fact that the rubble contained steel or iron that had been melted shows that the buildings were destroyed by something other than fire and airplane impact.</p>

<p>When all of this physical evidence is combined with the testimony about explosions from many types of professionals, the claim that the Twin Towers were brought down by nothing other than the airplane impacts and resulting fires is simply not credible</p>

<p>The response I saw in that thread was that there was a lot of insulation from the rubble, which created a &quot;kiln&quot;, where the temperature increased because it was in insulated. I think this is possible but incredibly improbable, especially if there was molten steel present weeks after. </p>

<p>Except Thermite (and other exothermic reactions) can.  Because thermite creates its own oxygen thats needed to burn.  This is why theyre so reluctant to acknowledge the molten metal in the ruble, because its physically impossible without an oxygen source.  </p>

<p>It is literally imposable. This &quot;theory&quot; has come about because NIST said that if there was molten steel or iron, it would have been </p>

<p>“due to the high temperature resulting from long exposure to combustion within the pile - NIST.”</p>

<p>This claim is stupidity of the highest order, they are trying to claim that molten steel or iron would <em>could have</em> been produced in the combustion pile, while offering zero evidence for this and outright rejecting all the evidence. </p>

<p>Further it would mean they are claiming, with no scientific evidence and no plausibility, that combustion in an oxygen-starved pile of metal and concrete could have heated steel to at least 1500°C (2800° F). </p>

<p>NIST claim all three buildings were brought down by building fires, which at most could have reached <strong>1,000°C (1,832°F.)</strong> So the idea that burning debris from these buildings could have reached anywhere close to the temperature needed to melt structural steel <strong>(1,482°C, 2,700°F)</strong> is a scientific impossibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok I&#39;m not going to just mock you for this. It sounds plausible: constant heat source, insulated to trap heat. Theoretically that might work. The problem is the heat source is oxygen starved. It doesn&#39;t really matter how big the smouldering mass is, it&#39;s not a hot fire. Now the presence of liquid metal is a problem. Arguing that over time it would just work is bizarre. I&#39;ve tried melting steel and it&#39;s not an accident at all. You cannot do it in a bonfire. It took man kind thousands of years to progress from iron to brass to steel for a good reason. If anybody could just do it by accident the hostory of warfare would be very different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The insulation on an art-studio cupola is only 6 inches or so of a clay/vermiculite type liner. The pile was several, insulating, stories deep. We all saw the smoke coming out of it; and, if there&#39;s smoke, there&#39;s oxygen (to coin a phrase). The pile obviously had oxygen that didn&#39;t come from a thermite source, or it would have extinguished. People forget that a subway tunnel ran down there, a few first responders survived in the stairwell and fires don&#39;t require that much room. Smoke emanating from the same place would mean that a fire(s) were venting through a consistent channel, which would continue heating up, burning any fuels in the &quot;walls&quot;. Have you ever seen a chimney fire? Any soft metals in the &quot;chimney&quot; formed would melt and/or burn right away if ground to dust; and don&#39;t forget the paper, wood, carpets, etc.  Edit: My point about the subway and other infrastructure is that the pile was pierced through with air sources, never mind oxygen from heat-decayed materials.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The presence of thermitic materials explains why the fires lasted for so many months, deep within the oxygen-poor pile, and why the fires were resistant to the extensive, but ineffective, efforts to extinguish them.  <strong>In this scenario, the extreme levels of VOCs would be the result of the complete thermal degradation of all plastic materials in the thermitic (incendiary) fires.  In normal structural fires with limited ventilation, plastic materials often burn incompletely.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The occurrence of such extreme, sharp spikes in VOCs in air at GZ indicate something other than the behavior of a typical structure fire. Oxygen influx as a result of shifting of materials within the pile might have created an increase in combustion of material in localized areas. But these spikes in VOCs, at levels thousands of times higher than seen in other structure fires, suggest extremely violent but short-lived fire events. Probably the most striking spike in toxic air emissions, found in EPA monitoring data, occurred on 9th February, 2002. Note (Table 1 ) that this was nearly 5 months after 9/11, and after nearly all the debris had been cleared from GZ. In fact, the levels of some species, like toluene and styrene, were some of the highest observed at the site. But the levels of benzene and propylene detected on that day were far above previous measurements, at 610,000 and 990,000 ppb, respectively. Other VOCs were measured at their peak levels on this date, including 1,3-butadiene at 400,000 ppb.&quot; &quot;EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion. Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/thermite/explosive_residues.html#faq"><strong>FAQ: Controlled Demolition With Aluminothermics</strong></a></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>How Could Thermite, an Incendiary, Demolish the Towers, When Buildings Are Normally Demolished Using High-Explosive Cutter Charges?</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>As is obvious from a review of the literature on energetic materials, thermite-based pyrotechnics can be engineered to have explosive power similar to conventional high-explosives while providing greater energy density and much greater stability.</p>

<p>Thus, aluminothermic cutter charges similar to the shaped charges used in commercial demolitions are entirely feasible. However, a variety of forms of thermite might be used to demolish a steel-framed skyscraper in a way that uses no cutter charges at all, as in this <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/thermite/blasting_scenario.html">Hypothetical Blasting Scenario</a>, which posits three types of aluminothermic pyrotechnics: a thermate incendiary coating sprayed onto steelwork, nano-thermite kicker charges placed near steelwork, and thin-film nano-composite high-explosives distributed throughout the building. </p>

<p>The strategically applied incendiary coatings, ignited several minutes before the building&#39;s take-down, weaken the structure; but obvious failures start only when the kicker charges break key supports, and the thin-film high-explosives begin pulverizing the building from the initial failure zone outward.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Why Weren&#39;t Demolition Charges Triggered by the Plane Crashes or the Subsequent Fires?</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>Perhaps the plane crashes did trigger some of the charges. If so, their blasts were lost in the jet-crash fireballs, and their damage was insufficient to budge the Towers&#39; tops. Thermite incendiaries in the core ignited by the crash would not be visible over the fires, unless dislodged to the building&#39;s exterior, <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/orangespout.html">as apparently happened in the South Tower.</a></p>

<p>However, this probably wasn&#39;t an issue because, in contrast to conventional explosives, thermite has a very high ignition temperature -- above 900ÂºC. Thus, thermitic incendiaries used around the crash zones could have been designed to survive the fires. </p>

<p>As for thermitic explosives, they could have been designed to detonate only on exposure to the very extreme conditions of temperature and pressure provided by specialized detonators, and to deflagrate (merely burn) in response to the kinds of pressures and temperatures produced by the plane crashes and fires. As a fail-safe, the demolition sequence could have been programmed to be triggered by premature ignitions of pyrotechnics.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>How Could the Demolition Equipment Have Been Installed in the Twin Towers Without Tenants Noticing?</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>The simple answer is by disguising the equipment as normal building components, so that not even the workers installing the components are aware of the concealed pyrotechnics. Three aspects of the Hypothetical Blasting Scenario that facilitate this are: </p>

<ol>
<li>the stability and specificity of ignition conditions achievable with aluminothermic pyrotechnics</li>
<li>minimization of the required access to steelwork, </li>
<li>and the use of a completely wireless ignition control system.</li>
</ol>

<p>Just one. And pieces of one. Not an entire &quot;building.&quot; Why exaggerate? And NIST states that this only (possibly - since they can&#39;t prove it) caused the fires. It did not help to initiate collapse. They also state that the building would have collapsed from a similar fire without the debris. </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Did debris from the collapse of WTC 1 cause damage to WTC 7&#39;s structure in a way that contributed to the building&#39;s collapse?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The debris from WTC 1 caused structural damage to the southwest region of WTC 7—severing seven exterior columns—<strong>but this structural damage did not initiate the collapse. The fires initiated by the debris, rather than the structural damage that resulted from the impacts, initiated the building&#39;s collapse</strong> after the fires grew and spread to the northeast region after several hours. The debris impact caused no damage to the spray-applied fire-resistive material that was applied to the steel columns, girders, and beams except in the immediate vicinity of the severed columns. The debris impact damage did play a secondary role in the last stages of the collapse sequence, where the exterior façade buckled at the lower floors where the impact damage was located. <strong>A separate analysis showed that even without the structural damage due to debris impact, WTC 7 would have collapsed in fires similar to those that occurred on Sept. 11, 2001.</strong> None of the large pieces of debris from WTC 2 hit WTC 7 because of the large distance between the two buildings.</p>

<p>&quot;Other than initiating the fires in WTC 7, the damage from the debris from WTC 1 had little effect on initiating the collapse of WTC 7.&quot; NCSTAR 1A, p xxxii</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These ingredients you mention do not even come close to accounting for the amount of VOCs measured at Ground Zero. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The presence of thermitic materials explains why the fires lasted for so many months, deep within the oxygen-poor pile, and why the fires were resistant to the extensive, but ineffective, efforts to extinguish them.  <strong>In this scenario, the extreme levels of VOCs would be the result of the complete thermal degradation of all plastic materials in the thermitic (incendiary) fires.  In normal structural fires with limited ventilation, plastic materials often burn incompletely.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The occurrence of such extreme, sharp spikes in VOCs in air at GZ indicate something other than the behavior of a typical structure fire. Oxygen influx as a result of shifting of materials within the pile might have created an increase in combustion of material in localized areas. But these spikes in VOCs, at levels thousands of times higher than seen in other structure fires, suggest extremely violent but short-lived fire events. Probably the most striking spike in toxic air emissions, found in EPA monitoring data, occurred on 9th February, 2002. Note (Table 1 ) that this was nearly 5 months after 9/11, and after nearly all the debris had been cleared from GZ. In fact, the levels of some species, like toluene and styrene, were some of the highest observed at the site. But the levels of benzene and propylene detected on that day were far above previous measurements, at 610,000 and 990,000 ppb, respectively. Other VOCs were measured at their peak levels on this date, including 1,3-butadiene at 400,000 ppb.&quot; &quot;EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion. Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite&quot;</p>

<p>If the destruction of WTC 1, WTC 2, and WTC 7 were caused by fire, this would make them the first steel framed high-rise buildings in history to suffer total fire-induced collapse (combined with structural damage from the airplane impacts in the case of WTC 1 and WTC 2). They would also be the first fire-induced collapses to exhibit nearly all of the features of controlled demolition and none of the features of fire-induced collapse</p>

<p>Good quote from that last one:</p>

<p>&quot;No explosives or incendiary devices were planted anywhere in that complex. None. Our dogs and the other EDD K9&#39;s would have alerted after the fact as well. It&#39;s what they are trained for. We staged for the two weeks we were there at the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island. This is where much of the structural steel was brought. Despite rumors to the contrary, chain of custody was maintained and virtually all of the steel was cataloged and vital pieces were inspected. Not a single dog ever alerted to the presence of either explosives or incendiary residue.
Not one.&quot;</p>

<p>Was probably pretty hard to get those dogs in on the conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, also, you would need a shit-ton of thermite to bring down those buildings. How did they sneak that in?</p>

<p>&quot;Assume 3000 lbs of aluminum fell from the towers. If it had been molten iron produced by thermite, then 6*3000 = 18,000 lbs of thermite reactants would have been required to produce that same volume of falling mass.</p>

<p>&quot;Suppose 10 tons of molten aluminum fell from the south tower, about 1/8th of that available from the airplane. If it had been molten iron produced from thermite, 60 tons of thermite reactants would have to have been stored in Fuji Bank to produce the same volume spilling out of the south tower. The section of floor would have to hold all of that plus the aircraft.</p>

<p>*Amount of aluminum can be ascertained by counting the droplets and measuring their size compared to the known size of the window. It&#39;s not easy to get a good number on this. It&#39;s based on the number of slugs seen in video stills, their size relative to the window width which was about 22 inches, and the density of aluminum, assuming this was aluminum.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I like this one too. It shoots down one of your bullshit papers:</p>

<p>&quot;Also, the article’s reference to “Danish Chemists” is misleading.
Here&#39;s the actual article itself; published again at the Bentham Open Journals, a vanity publishing outfit based in... wait for it... Pakistan.
<a href="http://www.bentham-open.org/pages/co...001/7TOCPJ.SGM">http://www.bentham-open.org/pages/co...001/7TOCPJ.SGM</a></p>

<p>Notice who the authors are…
Authors: Niels H. Harrit, Jeffrey Farrer, STEVEN E JONES, Kevin R. Ryan, Frank M. Legge, Daniel Farnsworth, Gregg Roberts, James R. Gourley, Bradley R. Larsen. (&quot;truthers&quot; all)</p>

<p>This is a rehash of Jones’ thermite theory that has been completely debunked already, and every one of the &quot;authors&quot; are members of various conspiracy groups and have had previous theories shot down in flames.</p>

<p>Google the names. While the OP tries to imply that this &quot;group of chemists&quot; are an independent study group, they are not.</p>

<p>The publisher is a pay to play vanity journal. (Open Chemical Physics Journal is the same company)
The only condition you must meet to publish in it is to send in your check. The owners of the journal cannot even provide a who-is of the peer reviewers. (“peer review itself is just the first step in authentication anyway). They are not even aware of the content they allow to be published. They just cash the checks. It’s a boiler room operation out of Pakistan. Jones himself has already been caught manipulating data to fit his “theory”. For example…</p>

<p>In Steven Jones&#39; PDF &quot;Answers to Objections and Questions&quot;, to support his claim for Sol-gels/Thermite he states:
&quot;One molecule, described by the EPA&#39;s Erik Swartz, was present at levels &quot;that dwarfed all others&quot;: 1,3-diphenylpropane. &quot;We&#39;ve never observed it in any sampling we&#39;ve ever done,&quot;
However when you look at the link he uses
<a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/health/n...age-right-area">http://www.newsday.com/news/health/n...age-right-area</a>
You find out Mr. Jones edits out the VERY next line which states
&quot;He said it was most likely produced by the plastic of tens of thousands of burning computers.&quot;
Apparently, Jones felt this was not important enough for his readers to know. This just one of the deceptions he used, including photos and false claims about thermite “devices” that didn’t exist then, and still don’t.</p>

<p>He seems to be being a bit more careful here, calling the substance “thermitic material” which means simply, any substance that burns… Then his group goes into fantasy land about “Nanotechnologically produced “super-thermite”, a substance that only exists in theoretical research and his imagination. In fact, although a patent was issued in the late 90&#39;s for &quot;nanothermite&quot; full research on manufacturing and developing true nanothermite only began in 2008 under a program being funded by the DOD. Jones willingly confuses nano thermitic materials, used to enhance explosive reaction, and &quot;nanothermite&quot;.</p>

<p>Here is the spectrographic signature for both military (top) and commercial thermite…</p>

<p>Element Weight % Atomic %
Carbon 5.18% 15.34%
Aluminum 24.78% 32.66%
Titanium 70.04% 52.00%</p>

<p>Element Weight % Atomic %
Carbon 5.13% 15.33%
Aluminum 23.50% 31.23%
Titanium 71.37% 53.44%</p>

<p>Below is a composite of the spectra from page 8 of Dr. Jones paper for the red dust and the spectra for thermite.
<a href="http://www.amazingrust.com/Experimen...mite_EDAX.html">http://www.amazingrust.com/Experimen...mite_EDAX.html</a></p>

<p>The spectra for thermite extends only to 5 keV. Perhaps Dr. Jones is talking another, imaginary flavor of thermite, but he is using the elements found in thermite as he stated in the OP.</p>

<p>I would think a more reasonable hypothesis is that the trace amount of titanium observed in the samples came from another source. I&#39;m sure among the computers and other office equipment in the WTC, titanium was present somewhere.</p>

<p>Or maybe from here?
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium</a>
Quote:
&quot;Titanium commercial aerospace requirements (including engine components such as blades, discs, rings and engine cases as well as airframe components including bulkheads, tail sections, landing gear, wing supports and fasteners) can account for a substantial proportion of the mass of modern aircraft, for example:</p>

<p>The four engines alone on the Airbus A380 use about 26 metric tons (57,000 pounds) of titaniumBoeing (including both the airframes and engines)</p>

<p>B787 – 134 metric tons (295,000 lb) of titanium
B777 – 59 metric tons (130,000 lb) of titanium
B747 – 45 metric tons (99,000 lb) of titanium
B737 – 18 metric tons (40,000 lb) of titanium&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;red chips&quot; are iron oxide, commonly known as rust, as has been shown in several other studies. There is nothing new in this &quot;study&quot;, just an attempt to try another angle. After being laughed at for his &quot;angle cuts&quot; and imaginary &quot;bundling devices&quot; as well as his use of misleading photos he now is coming back with a new &quot;find&quot; that has been known about for years.&quot;</p>

<p>you&#39;re right, thats why bellows were invented and used for hundreds and hundreds of years in foundries... because they don&#39;t work.</p>

<p>also your copypasta of truther bullshit about demolitions is tired old hat... it&#39;s all been debunked.</p>

<p>WTC towers were not &quot;typical buildings&quot; and the attacks on them were not &quot;typical structure fires&quot;</p>

<p>the collapse was not due to only the fires themselves, the building became susceptible to fire induced collapse <strong>beacuse</strong> of the damage inflicted by the impact of the planes.</p>

<p>those towers were <strong>designed</strong> to fall straight down</p>

<p>they were <strong>designed</strong> to withstand the impact of a smaller plane, flying at much slower speeds, low on fuel, lost in the fog looking to land (<strong>designed</strong> this way due to the bomber that flew into the empire state building).</p>

<p>they <strong>were not</strong> however designed to withstand the impact of much larger planes, flying at maximum speeds, fully loaded with fuel.</p>

<p>your little chart full of truther nonsense doesn&#39;t mean jack shit in this situation.</p>

<p>planes smashed into the buildings and damaged huge sections of the structure. fire then weakened those damaged areas until they could no longer support the weight of the building above them. this is <strong>proven</strong> by the fact that the second building hit was the first to fall... <strong>because</strong> it was hit lower on the tower and therefore the damaged area had more weight to support.</p>

<p>the fact is these buildings did exactly what they were supposed to do. they survived the impact, and held until the fire cooked the remaining supports of the damaged area to the point it could no longer carry the load. as soon as that tipping point was reached... the tops of the towers fall through the damaged areas of the towers into the undamaged areas below ripping them apart from the inside out.</p>

<p>again... how they were <strong>designed</strong> to fail.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Absurd claim, they were obviously designed to do the opposite.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they were designed to withstand the impact of a smaller plane</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Structural engineers who designed the Twin Towers carried out studies in the mid-1960s to determine how the buildings would fare if hit by large jetliners. In all cases the studies concluded that <strong>the Towers would survive the impacts and fires caused by the jetliners</strong></p>

<p>Contrary to widely promoted misconceptions, the Boeing 767-200s used on 9/11/01 were only slightly larger than 707s and DC 8s, the types of jetliners whose impacts the World Trade Center&#39;s designers anticipated</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/docs/aircraftcomparison.gif">FEMA&#39;s Report shows the sizes of a 707 and a 767 relative to the footprint of a WTC tower.</a>  Flight 11 and Flight 175 were Boeing 767-200s. Although a 767-200 has a slightly wider body than a 707, the two models are very similar in overall size, weight and fuel capacity</p>

<p>Given the differences in cruise speeds, a 707 in normal flight would actually have more kinetic energy than a 767, despite the slightly smaller size. Note the similar fuel capacities of both aircraft. The 767s used on September 11th were estimated to be carrying about 10,000 gallons of fuel each at the time of impact, only about 40% of the capacity of a 707</p>

<p><strong>Statements by Engineers</strong></p>

<p>John Skilling was the head structural engineer for the World Trade Center. In a 1993 interview, Skilling stated that the Towers were designed to withstand the impact and fires resulting from the collision of a large jetliner such as Boeing 707 or Douglas DC-8.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930227&amp;amp;slug=1687698">Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed, ... The building structure would still be there</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A white paper released on February 3, 1964 states that the Towers could have withstood impacts of jetliners travelling 600 mph -- a speed greater than the impact speed of either jetliner used on 9/11</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/City-Sky-World-Trade-Center/dp/0805076913">The buildings have been investigated and found to be safe in an assumed collision with a large jet airliner (Boeing 707—DC 8) traveling at 600 miles per hour. Analysis indicates that such collision would result in only local damage which could not cause collapse or substantial damage to the building and would not endanger the lives and safety of occupants not in the immediate area of impact, page 131</a></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.statemaster.com/encyclopedia/Factor-of-safety">One aspect of engineering that is not widely understood is that structures are over-engineered as a matter of standard practice.</a>  Steel structures like bridges and buildings are typically designed to withstand five times anticipated static loads and 3 times anticipated dynamic loads.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>this is proven by the fact that the second building hit was the first to fall</p>

<p>It proves controlled demolition</p>

<p>Although you and NIST offer <strong>ZERO</strong> evidence why all three skyscrapers collapse through the path of greatest resistance.</p>

NIST found no evidence to confirm this possibility, but the available data suggest that this was highly likely.” NIST NCSTAR 1-9, page 194</p>

<p>the buildings were designed to withstand the impact of smaller planes, flying at much lower speeds lost in the fog looking to land and low on fuel...</p>

<p>they were not designed to withstand much larger planes, flying at much faster speeds, fully loaded with fuel, being rammed into them on purpose.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the destruction of WTC 1, WTC 2, and WTC 7 were caused by fire, this would make them the first steel framed high-rise buildings in history to suffer total fire-induced collapse (combined with structural damage from the airplane impacts in the case of WTC 1 and WTC 2). They would also be the first fire-induced collapses to exhibit nearly all of the features of controlled demolition and none of the features of fire-induced collapse</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im from Texas and i will say this; The explosions, burns and melted steel look very similar to what thermite does. believe it or not, we use it to hunt invasive hogs and javelinas. You put the thermite in a steel container and surround it with sour corn mash. The hogs come in and shoot a round into the container and boomshakalaka. Whenever i see the damage and videos, i immediately think of a Thermite explosion. Im not expert though, just a guy who has witnessed it. Also, i know that police/military use thermite shotgun rounds to disable engine blocks. Thermite cuts through steel like butter.</p>

<p>Another accepted and provable fact, the reason we know it is molten steel is because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation">Thermal Radiation</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>FEMA does though, another government department. not forgetting</p>

<ul>
<li>The claim that no evidence of any molten steel or iron was found in any of the WTC buildings is <strong>refuted by three scientific reports,</strong> 

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.journalof911studies.com/articles/WTCHighTemp2.pdf">Extremely high temperatures during the WTC destruction</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2005/1165/508OF05-1165.html">Particle Atlas of World Trade Center Dust</a></li>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>There is also vast amounts of physical and testimonial evidence, which you are choosing to ignore, you even have John Gross, who represented NIST on the
FEMA Building Performance Study, posing next to eroded, sulfiated, massive  piece of steel</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the destruction of WTC 1, WTC 2, and WTC 7 were caused by fire, this would make them the first steel framed high-rise buildings in history to suffer total fire-induced collapse (combined with structural damage from the airplane impacts in the case of WTC 1 and WTC 2). They would also be the first fire-induced collapses to exhibit nearly all of the features of controlled demolition and none of the features of fire-induced collapse</p>

<p>It is literally imposable. This &quot;theory&quot; has come about because NIST said that if there was molten steel or iron, it would have been </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“due to the high temperature resulting from long exposure to combustion within the pile - NIST.”</p>

<p>This claim is stupidity of the highest order, they are trying to claim that molten steel or iron would <em>could have</em> been produced in the combustion pile, while offering zero evidence for this and outright rejecting all the evidence. </p>

<p>Further it would mean they are claiming, with no scientific evidence and no plausibility, that combustion in an oxygen-starved pile of metal and concrete could have heated steel to at least 1500°C (2800° F). </p>

<p>NIST claim all three buildings were brought down by building fires, which at most could have reached <strong>1,000°C (1,832°F.)</strong> So the idea that burning debris from these buildings could have reached anywhere close to the temperature needed to melt structural steel <strong>(1,482°C, 2,700°F)</strong> is a scientific impossibility.</p>
