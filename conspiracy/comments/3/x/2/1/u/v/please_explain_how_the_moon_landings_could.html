       I am aware of obvious conspiracy theories, government "stories", and cover ups. But I have seen countless evidence, from photos on the moon, photos of it from earth, testimony and evidence of chemists working on fuel, rockets designed by engineers, countless dollars and man hours spent on the project.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please explain logically how this feat of deception is possible on such a grand scale, how it was done, who ordered it, and for what purpose ? Also keep in mind China, Russia and a few other countries or groups would be on the investigation with much more capabilities than all of you conspiriscists combined and have a purpose to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       So who is to blame ? Aliens, council of 13, government, Rothschild's, Satan ? Bonus points if you can also explain images from satellites, probes, etc.

       yeah i don't believe all science is faked ... i mean, who created math then and how smart were they so it all makes such an awesome sense when you do some calculations? it's brilliant if it's all fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       and i don't believe we faked moon landing either. sure they tried to, or have just for backup, but faking, forging all these images, thousands were released just a few months ago, i mean it would take some
       <em>
        serious effort
       </em>
       just to fake these and we all know governments are incompetent. let alone have a conspiracy hidden this well  70 some years later.
      </p>
      <p>
       what i am eager about is see the results of some independent projects, make a drone, send it the moon and make some pics, it's not that expensive anymore.

       Sending unmanned aircraft to the moon is still a project upwards of a few hundred million, I wouldn't exactly say it's cheap either.

       The only logical explanation is faking it to prove superiority in technology or simply because they didnt want to waste resources. Which I don't believe the United States needs to do because they are always decades ahead behind the scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll see when we start sending probes, if it was faked our government would crumble from lack of credibility but by then they'll probably roll out martial law or terminators at that point.

       "Government" is not incompetent.  Lumping the people in "government" is a fallacy.  They want you to lump and categorize them that way.

       You suppose every single person that holds power is incompetent.  Really?

       Therein lies your problem.  You've already defined what you are and are not willing to accept without having been offered any evidence in support of (or leveled-against) either position.

       You're not the one who is paranoid? You're the one who continually claims that there are shadowy groups of people who hide the truth about the moon landings and hide the fact that the earth is flat. I only point out the (many) gaps in your various claims.

       I did answer all the questions. Your version of the story is not without gaps. The only difference is that you have the weight of the establishment backing your second hand facts.

       PS: I am not paranoid. I repeat, you are. Moreover, you are like that kid who is desperately holding on to the fairytale that Santa is real. The moon landings are myths bud. If it were not, we would be building on top of that accomplishment. Sadly, we aren't. I wish more than anyone it is true, but it isn't. You'll get over it too.

       Entire books have been written on the why the approach we took to go to the moon in the 1960s was not sustainable from an economic or political perspective. Just because we haven't been back yet doesn't mean the originally landings didn't happen. We have many individuals from around the world working to make it so future landings can be done in a more affordable and repeatable fashion, as well as continuing on to Mars.

       On the moon landing, it was an hoax orchestrated by the American govt and all the other govts chimed in. Because that is the only way to rule over the citizens via deception. It happens on a smaller scale in our lives, what makes it so different on a grander scale as well? How naive do you have to be to think the wealthy and powerful people don't lie to you?

       People always bring up the moon landing as an example of a "wacky" conspiracy that could never happen. Probably because the lie is so great, no one thinks it could be pulled off. If the moon landing happened, there would be overwhelming scientific evidence that it happened. Instead, there's a massive amount of scientific anomalies. Here's a list of such anomalies:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         No evidence of any radiation other than visible light on the pictures.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          No evidence that the PLSS ever vented any gas, water exhaust, or other materials
         </li>
         <li>
          Insufficient shielding on the spacesuits to protect against ionizing radiation
         </li>
         <li>
          Liftoff pattern as filmed by NASA shows a linear progression, rather than an exponential progression. (Exponential progression is how a rocket would act. Linear is how being lifted by a crane would act.)
         </li>
         <li>
          No evidence that the liftoff engines used hypergolic fuels.
         </li>
         <li>
          No explanation for how the LM weighed all the alleged moon rocks they brought back. (Fuel is precious, and they allegedly brought back hundreds of kilos of rock.)
         </li>
         <li>
          Dosimeter readings don't agree with modern radiation levels. (In other words, when the astronauts "got back", the scientists said their dosimeter readings were within expected calculations. Then 30-40 years later, scientists find out the moon is much more radioactive than once believed. Why wasn't this reflected in the dosimeter readings?)
         </li>
         <li>
          Insufficient shielding on the capsule to prevent against micrometeors
         </li>
         <li>
          Insufficient shielding on the capsule to prevent against ionizing radiation
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       That's just off the top of my head. There's many more.
And this isn't taking into account the ludicrous engineering standards we're supposed to believe went into this. For example, the first time anyone tested how mammalian cells would behave beyond Earth's magnetosphere was allegedly on Apollo 8, when the first manned test of the Atlas V rocket was sent on a circumlunar orbit. It seems insane to test whether or not the environment outside Earth's magnetosphere is suitable for humans by sending humans as your first test subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's add to that that no other country has been back in 40+ years - despite the fact that technology increases over time, not decreases. We allegedly went to the moon 40 years ago but don't have the technology to do it now? (And the argument that it costs too much is moot. The proposed moon landing mission by Bush (which has since been cancelled) set a landing date of 2020 when first announced. Why such a long date? Why not use the tech that worked 6/7 times in the first place?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, the idea that Russia would "blow the whistle" as a counterargument to the above is insufficient. Not only does this not explain away any of the scientific anomalies. But one may argue (calling upon the work of Antony C. Sutton) that the US financed the USSR from Day 1, and that the cold war was a scam to line the pockets of the military industrial complex. One might also point out the great grain robbery of 1972, which also might buy a lot of silence from our alleged enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think the moon landings happened, and think it's just too far fetched that this could have been faked, I urge you to do some basic research. The behaviour of NASA surrounding the Apollo missions is bizarre. (BTW, NASA lost all the original telemetry data and film footage of the alleged greatest engineering feat of all time. Whoops.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The more research one does into this subject, the more obvious it becomes the moon landings never happened.

       I am still in the beginning phases of this stuff, but I will explain what I've come across to the best of my ability. The theory that has made the most sense to me is that the moon landings were not completely faked, but partially faked. By this, I mean that NASA went to the moon, but when they got there, they found that there was already an alien lunar base on the dark side of the moon. Since that point, the moon landings have been faked with the purpose of hiding the alien existence/presence. As far as why this was done, I couldn't really tell you. One thing I've heard is that the aliens do not want to reveal themselves to us, because they know that we would turn to them to solve our problems, rather than solving them ourselves, and thus growing as a species. There is evidence out there to backup that this is the case, just like there is evidence out there to argue against it. So it really comes down to what you personally choose to believe. To me, it makes sense logically, but I don't draw any conclusions about it, as I haven't seen definitive evidence. Hope that helps you.

       Well one thing that I saw in an interview with an "insider" is that they are monitoring an experiment. The premise of this being that these alien beings actually created humanity by crossing their own genetic structure with that of the original "humans" that inhabited the earth, but left centuries ago. Again, another idea I've heard is that they are waiting for us to evolve to the point of being able to accept their existence without turning to them as our saviors. The idea being that they previously visited humanity, in ancient times, and were seen as gods. It all comes down to what you choose to believe. For me personally, I think it makes sense, or at least the logic behind it is sound, but I try not to jump to conclusions without evidence. May I ask what your thoughts are on the subject?

       The funny part is they're not omnipotent. God is technically above them and he guides it all, I am still figuring out their attitude or feelings behind it all if they have one.

       I agree. Even if a race of aliens were superior to us in terms of evolution and technology, that would not place them higher than source, or God. It's the same way that being so far advanced beyond animals and insects, does not place us above God either.

       Yes, I think that it all comes down to looking inward, and choosing to live a good life, to the best of your abilities. I think that if we all simultaneously chose to examine ourselves, instead of others, and to live well, then all of these problems would be solved overnight.

       Lol. No small task indeed! I've struggled with this from time to time. It's very frustrating to try and modify someone else's behavior. I've finally concluded that the only thing I can do is live my life the best way I can, and hope that other people see that, and are inspired to do the same. Fight the good fight my friend!

       Ok. Why would Free Mason's lie about going to the moon? It's a Jesuit conspiracy and merely cold war propaganda. Why would scientist play along? They aren't (useful idiots) they are brainwashed with thinking the math/science/physics/etc checks out ( it does, in a Heliocentric model). Math and such on earth is relative, it is not the "language of the universe". It's all relative and big fucking lie. Doesn't that answer your question?

       This is like describing a ant-farm to a kindergartner. Why? Control. For what purpose? Control. What is the end game? Control. I was trying to give you the reason, but you want to skip class and get cliff notes. It doesn't work that way and no, adderrall will not work. Revisit what I've said. Then go forward. I thought we were suppose to learn the alphabet, before writing sentences....

       There is a reason they want control and it's not as simple as power or greed, surprisingly many people don't put themselves in their shoes. I guarantee you there is a purpose for all this and it's for our benefit and survival.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why the hell else would they be gathering resources, power and control ? Probably to prepare us all for a world changing event, particularly one that strains our survival and would require us to leave the solar system.

       It's all just a setup or metaphor for a cosmic Noah's Ark.
      </p>
      <p>
       It'd be pretty funny in a way if the rapture ends up being a one way ticket to another solar system. That would explain the whole 'control' and 'resource hoarding' mentality the elite has. Somebody's gotta do it, and not everyone can go.

       is a conspiracy theory, nothing good or bad ever actually happens in the world, everything is simply a well coordinated event to further an ever-changing, often conflicting plot. As it has been since the industrial revolution, if not earlier, but definitely not any later.

       Don't fret, however, as the fearless Trump is here to protect our guns and skuddle dissent that disagrees with our dissent. Soon humans will go to the moon, for reals this time, to escape the horrors of climate scientists and parents of children shot to death in their classrooms.

       Yes, we'll fly far far away, up past earths "atmosphere" to a place with no FEMA camps, a place with no background checks, no antidepressants, no vaccines and a place where the only false flag is the one we'll view through a telescope while looking down on this shit planet.

       i read this is why no movie (sci-fi) has ever been made about going to the moon.

       good question. a post in this thread said that the landing may have been partially faked (NASA realized: "someone" was already there &amp; we weren't invited to the party).
      </p>
      <p>
       if that's true &amp; i think it is, obviously "we" (humans) are newbies, aliens have been living longer than us &amp; know more than us. no, they won't save us from ourselves, we have to evolve to that realization. i hope there's still
       <em>
        time
       </em>
       to get there.
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe humans are the experiment, we were created &amp; here we go again, running amok, trashing everything. hope this civilization isn't "reset", only to begin all over again, not knowing (or remembering) anything about what was before.
      </p>
      <p>
       imo, compared to other world beings we are so ignorant that we can't figure out how to live in peace amongst our

        own kind

       The logical answer is that the majority of the earth's populace can't fathom the possibility such "genius" men would lie and deceive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Appealing to authority isn't just a logical fallacy it's a psychological technique.

       You are asking this sub a rhetorical question because you believe what you haven't personally verified. You are hoping that the users here will be "awoken" to the absurdity that is disbelief in "authorities" and "popular consensus".
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem is, a good many of us in this sub have personally witnessed liars lying, and have empirical objective proof of deceit by the very people you trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you so arrogant that you do not think you can be deceived? The genuinely free thinking individuals on this sub are not...
