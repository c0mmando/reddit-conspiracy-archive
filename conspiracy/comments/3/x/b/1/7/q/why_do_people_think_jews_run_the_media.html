       No one "hates Jews."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's quite the reverse. Jews have been at the forefront of a movement to hate "white people" - what do you think Jewish organizations like the $PLC and the ADL do? Nothing but slander and defame white people.
      </p>
      <p>
       People say Jews "run the media" because the most prominent owners and managers of the media are Jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get over yourself. Any "anti-semitism" and "jew hate" are caused by Jewish people's racism and bigotry against non-Jewish people and "Whites" especially.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you ended Jewish bigotry against "the goyim" I can guarantee you that nobody would have any problems with Jewish people.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if your community promotes racism, bigotry, and hatred, you can be assured people will have hostile attitudes about your community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jewish people in Europe and America are NOT stupid, so you are obviously aware of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who do you think you are kidding here?

      <p>
       Why do you make it about "white people"? as if "white people" are the only people that are affected?  Wat?
      </p>
      <p>
       You become part of the problem when you fail to realize that it is unity that builds strength.  You become just as much a caustic detriment to humanity as the worst Zionist when you chastise their racism but then turn around continually spouting "pro white" propaganda yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with Zionists aren't that they are anti-white.  Hell, ashkenazi Jews - being German/Khazar based - are white
       <em>
        themselves
       </em>
       .  The problem is that they are anti "anyone who isn't a Zionist".
      </p>
      <p>
       You would do well to stand by
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       regardless of skin color.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, you become just as much a part of the problem by turning around and focusing on
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       race or people over any other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't that
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what Zionists are accused of?
      </p>
      <p>
       So why do the exact same thing then?  That is just plain and simple hypocrisy.

       A) that's a generalization that's just...bad.  B) Zionists hate everybody who's not Zionist.  Period.  Point blank.

       See?  It's like you're making the same mistake that the previous idiot did.  You're thinking that just because
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       as a "white Christian" may be effected by
       <del>
        Jews
       </del>
       Zionists, that it's "all about going against us white, God-fearing Christians!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, it's a LOT bigger than just about Christians - white or otherwise - and spending too much time making this some sort of crusade about "white Christians" ends up making anyone doing that look just as bad as the worst Zionist.

       Here's "no1113" - supposedly "defending jews" but what it is actually doing is attacking white people - ALL while pretending he is "defending jews."

      <p>
       Of course, "no1113" isn't actually "defending jews" - he is pretending to be pro-jew - while actually making Jewish people look bad.

      <p>
       It's all pretty obvious, isn't it? Remember, Joshua Goldberg pretending to be a "neo-naaaaazis" and also an "ISIS terrorist" - all while actually making people who are ethnically Ashkenazi, or perhaps culturally "Jewish" - look bad.

       It's all pretty obvious, isn't it?

       Did anyone ever ask posters like "no1113" to "protect" you from the "evil goyim anti-seeeeemites" he starts fights with?

       See that’s the thing.  It seems your “pro white” racism has gotten your (already bad) level of critical thinking to be even

       You claim I’m “defending Jews” and “attacking white people”.

       No, bro.  I’m not attacking white people.  I’m attacking your ignorance, your closed-mindedness, your stupidity.
       <em>
        That’s
       </em>
       what I’m attacking.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s almost like you’re a “pro white” version of Joshua Goldberg.  You just do nothing but spout “pro white” propaganda, and then turn around and try to be critical of Jews for doing
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       the same thing YOU keep doing.  WTF?  And apparently, you
       <em>

       don’t even see that you’re doing it.  It’s like the irony you demonstrate is just off the charts.

       You don’t have an argument here, you see, because I’m

       bigger and more expansive than that.

       How ironic that you mention Joshua Goldberg.  Are you fashioning your m.o. after him but tailoring it to white people instead of Ashkenazis?  If so, you’re doing a damn fine job, sir.

       Just imagine - you're some typical American who has "white skin" and some Jewish grandma - maybe even who escaped the Nazis in World War II - and all of a sudden, some "Jew" - an anonymous internet handle "no1113" - all of a sudden tells you you have to be against most people with "white skin" because - who knows? - something or other, "anti-seeeeeeeeeemisimitism" or something about "the goyim" etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself - if you were an actual NAZI that was actually trying to hurt Jewish people - would you do ANYTHING different than what "no1113" is doing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you really try to "divide and conquer" the average "Jew" from everyone else, and try to make some "racist" or "religious" issue about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       OR - if you were an actual NAZI - wouldn't you do EXACTLY what "no1113" is doing - and try to pit you against your neighbors - you know, regular "White people" - like "no1113" is doing?
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you know "no1113" is actually pro-Jewish?
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you know he isn't actually a "NAZI" - trying to harm Jewish people?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you actually VOTE for "no1113" to be your "representative?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I sure as hell didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who made him a spokesman for the "Jew Community" - I didn't.

       No one’s “attacking white people”, man.  Again I say, I’m attacking YOUR IGNORANCE.  If you chose to continue acting like the stereotypical Jew (ohhh the irony) and claim that I’m attacking “white people”, then that’s on
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       .  That, by the way, actually further solidifies the very point I’m making.
      </p>
      <p>
       Man…Wow.  Reading on, I tell you there is literally
       <em>
        such
       </em>
       an attempt at playing the victim here on your part that…I can’t actually tell
       <em>
        what
       </em>
       exactly you’re for or against, or who exactly you’re trying to vilify.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        try to pit you against your neighbors - you know, regular "White people"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I mean look at this statement.  It’s just…Like…you think “your neighbors” only consist of “regular ‘White people’”?  I mean…are you really
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       blind?
      </p>
      <p>
       Man…I don’t even know WHAT you’re trying to accomplish with what you said…but I hope maybe at least
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       understood it…cuz I know I sure didn’t, and I’m not sure anybody else really did.  It’s almost like you’re showing just how limited your intellect is when you’re forced to engage in an actual dialogue with someone.

       Notice that "Playerpianette" complains that people "hate Jews" - then he goes on to slander, attack, and promote bigotry against non-Jewish people - all under the banner of Jewish people.
      </p>
      <p>
       If (ostensibly) Jewish people like him stopped doing that, I can't see how there would be any "anti-semitism."
      </p>
      <p>
       But if Jewish people continue to promote bigotry and racism against non-Jewish people - against "the goyim" - I don't see how people WON'T react against it with hostility to Jewish people.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were an "anti-semite" or a "naaaazi" - I'd do exactly what (supposedly) Jewish people like "Playerpianette" do - make bigoted, racist comments against people who aren't Jewish - in an attempt to defame and slander people who are Jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you really have to ask yourself, are people like "Playerpianette" really Secret Nazis trying to defame Jewish people by spreading vicious "anti-gentile" crap like it does?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are they just crazy nuts?
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno - go figure. What do weirdos like Joshua Goldberg do? They are Jews that pose as "Naaaaazis" online and pretend to be their own worst enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it's a religious cultist thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would suggest people who are ethnically Ashkenazi drop the Jewish thing and just celebrate Christmas like the rest of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop the hate, people!

       You see it, folks?

       Playerpianette - SUPPOSEDLY a Jew - just posted a racist, bigoted attack on people who are not Jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do we know the poster with the handle "Playerpianette" is actually Jewish?
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you tell?
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you tell the poster using the handle "Playerpianette" isn't actually a NAAAAAAZI or an "anti-seeeemite" or some other person trying to make people who happen to be ethnically Ashkenazi, or raised in the Jewish religion, look bad?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would it make any DIFFERENCE?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were a "NAAAZI" or an "Anti-SEEEEMITE" you would do exactly what "Playerpianette" does in order to make "JEEEWS" look bad.

       Why don't you go ahead and watch a newly released Stanley kubrick interview. You know he was a jew right? Just because Jews direct movies doesn't mean they are in control of the subliminal contexts. It pretty obvious that the illuminati so called antichrist Is another work for jew. You're either really dumb or just a sneaky liar who won't fess up. The blatant intensions of the media making Jews look like losers is pretty ducking obvious. I already known my truth. I just wanted a straight answer, one most of you fail to be up front about. Pathetic

       Don’t be so completely obtuse and literal.  Not EVERY SINGLE JEW EVAAAAR runs “all of Hollywood” okay?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not even really talking about Jews here anyway.  I’m talking about A) Zionists, which are B) primarily Ashkenazis, who are C) not even Jews
       <em>
        anyway
       </em>
       .  Ashkenazis are Khazars who ages ago
       <em>
        hijacked
       </em>
       true Judaism so they can use the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       Jews as whipping boy scape goats for their own nefarious plans.  At the end of the day, the real Sephardic Jews are to a great extent just as much victims as non-Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, the real point here is that just because Kubrick himself was a Jew, it doesn’t mean that he wasn’t a focal piece of Zionist scorn.  That’s how Zionism works:  If you say or do anything that can even be construed as “anti-Israel”, then you become “the enemy!”  And if you just so happen to also be a Jew? then you’re a “self-hating” Jew.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell look into Norman Finkelstein.  He’s an amazing scholar, but is at the end of an insane amount of Zionist vitriol and has been denied much-deserved tenure and lost his teaching position all because he “dares” to be a very intelligent and well-spoken critic of Israel and Zionism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jew or not.  Doesn’t matter.

       You're literally admitting to being racist towards ashkenazi Jews yet denying your obvious racial bias and thats disgusting. You're trying to justify any form of self hatred over a race and that on an individual level is wrong. So how are ziomists and Israel bad? They are a small country surrounded by people who hate them and the reason why they have to be so defensive is because palestenians were intolerant of them.. you are basically saying that they should have stayed in concentration camps

       They are responsible for the death of untold numbers of Palestinians in a LAND THAT DOESN’T EVEN BELONG TO THEM.  It was literally

       for them by the Europeans in The Balfour Declaration.  Do you not realize that?  These are historical facts we’re talking about here.

       Oh just fuck off, you stupid, brainwashed, indoctrinated zombie Zionist.  This is what your parents have pounded into your little skull and it’s what you simply vomit back reflexively without thinking about what you’re even saying.

       next to the United States.  Do you realize that?  Israel is the equivalent of a multimillion dollar mansion living in the middle of a neighborhood of poor people, and the owners of that mansion keep taking over more and more of the poor people’s houses around them - all the while killing and raping and evicting the poor tenants around them.

       That's a good question considering they've gotten
       <a href="http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/expelled.htm">
        kicked out of literally everywhere they've gone
       </a>
       .  As such, the question really isn't so much "Where should they have gone?" as much as it is "How should they

        act

       so as not to continue getting themselves kicked out of everywhere they go?"
      </p>
      <p>
       If they didn't comport themselves like pieces of shit, then maybe the world wouldn't have such a big problem with where they go or stay.  Maybe the Palestinians themselves wouldn't have such a big fucking problem with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They should try maybe getting along with other human beings for a change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh but wait a minute.  That's right.  Most of them don't even think other non-Jews/non-Zionists even
       <em>
        are

Keep defending yourself, what proof do you have of Jews being mean and exclusive people? Have you ever met a jew yourself? What is wrong with the word goyim? It is just a word to describe non Jewish people. You're angry  response screams animosity and if you are going to  be a pussy about it than just leave. We're racist but we get kicked out of everywhere we go? Does that sound right? How do you want us to act? Kiss your asses like everyone else on the planet? People are such bullies.

       cause you come off as an arrogant hypocrite who likes to deflect your douche baggery by calling a group of people racist when that was my initial question. You're literally deflecting with "I know you are but what am I". Most people see Judaism and Zionists in such a monstrous light and vocalize it and than proceed to saying that were rude and exclusive. That makes zero sense, no white wasp or anyone of any other race or religion has shown an interest in the culture and have, in fact, made fun of it. You don't even know how many times I hear the word Jesus in a conversation glorifying the figure and not to mention the world is mainly westernized with the idea that Christianity is the main religuon- so to say that Jews are the bullies is completely hypocritical and manipulative. White people have a history of manipulating cultures and that is why most of this world is westernized with the white man values and beliefs. Jews have never tried imperialism and have a history of having to defend themselves tome and time again- I don't know why, either. Is it because they didn't choose to become Christian slaves and yet have come to power in a certain way? There is something very domineering and egotistical about westernized mentality which is driving this world into total chaos but for some reason the Jews are being targeted heacily. Sadly, even Jews aren't defending themselves the way they should on a social level. I see through the facade and you can't manipulate me into thinking that were the ones who are imperialising and hurting other people. Roger waters is literally telling people not to perform in israel. That's just sad, you say we're the bullies,?

       It’s the world’s business because A) Israel has over and over and over again violated the UN’s human rights peace keeping treaties and have (again) over and over and over again had their actions expressly condemned by multiple members of various different countries.

       Christianity is to a great extent the lap dog of Judaism in the sense that the central figure of Christianity is said to be a Jew in the first place.  Duh.  It matters not that, according to Christian documents, it was the Jews themselves that murdered him.  The point is that Christianity and Judaism (and Islam for that matter) are all tied together as practically identical religions.  They all have the very same root.  It’s just that they have been twisted and used as fodder to get the stupid humans who listen to those religions to fight and kill each other.

       Of course.  I’ll be the first one to rail against that as well.  Stop trying to deflect by pointing the finger elsewhere.  NO culture is a “100% saint”.  The point is that Zionism in Israel is currently at the top of the list of “countries who enslave people and commit genocide”.

       Oh shut the hell up.  Seriously.  You know what it is that you people have absolutely mastered?  What you’ve mastered is playing the whipping boy while simultaneously taking full advantage of the situation at the same time.  That’s QUITE a different thing altogether.  The reason you don’t see it is because you come from a culture that has indoctrinated its members to see themselves as nothing but “the victim” while simultaneously and covertly doing the very
       <em>
        opposite
       </em>
       of that.  It’s so deeply ingrained in your mind that you just don’t see that you belong to a people that have mastered saying “Oh I’m so hurt!” on one hand, and then turning around and
       <em>
        using
       </em>
       that proclamation to take as much advantage of everyone as absolutely possible.

      <p>
       I don’t know whether you’re trying to twist things because you’re being deceitful or because you’re simply that ignorant and don’t know, but it’s the JEWS that are greatly driving the world into chaos.  You want to know why?  That’s because the main entity that is responsible for ruining much of the world is the United States.  And who
       <em>
        controls
       </em>
       the United States?
      </p>
      <p>

       Jews RUN the media on a social level.  You are doing the
       <em>
        very

       thing that many high powered Jews constantly do by (again) crying crocodile tears while simultaneously turning around and taking as much advantage of every situation possible.

      <p>
       No.  The facade is that Jews seem like a “downtrodden, Ohhhh so manipulated people!”  when they’re anything but.  Some Sephardics
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       be.  Ashkenazis most definitely aren’t.

       Zionists in Israel - and anyone who supports them - are

       than bullies.

      <p>
       I wish it would all stop, as it is very evil, and it brings the whole world and the whole of humanity down as a result.

       I like how you just say movies, as if that incorporates all of the companies in the link provided.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority in that link are NOT movie production companies.  From a glance, most look like news agencies.  In other words, jews have a near monopoly on information control here in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       No wonder Israel is rarely bashed in the media, while the Palestines (the people the jews are committing genocide against) are demonized.

       Ah, no. It's Jews, and it's part of a sustained plan to control
       <em>
        all the media
       </em>
       of white Christians as a way of controlling the thought and speech, and ultimately the actions, of white Christians.
