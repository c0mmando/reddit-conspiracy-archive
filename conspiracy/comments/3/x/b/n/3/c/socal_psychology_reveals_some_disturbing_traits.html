<hr/>

<p>What do we do with all this information?  Well first of all, I believe that we first recognize it, acknowledge it and maintain this awareness in everything we do.  It&#39;s kind of like in Jungian psychology, we become actualized individuals when we recognize our &#39;shadow&#39; the ego&#39;s inverted twin--those naughty, perverse, wicked parts of ourselves and become at peace with them, incorporating them into our being.  I believe our first step then is acknowledgement of these &#39;dirty tricks&#39; and &#39;sneaky games&#39; we play with ourselves and others, look in the mirror more, and with this awareness, try to mitigate against these self-defeating tendencies in the decisions we make.</p>

<p>EDIT: Dr. Diana Alstad&#39;s essay, <em>&quot;<a href="http://joeldiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DEMOCRACY-Mental-Authoritarianism-1110-font.pdf">Exposing Mental Authoritarianism Strengthens Democracy</a>&quot;</em> tends to agree with those claims--which I myself derived from Bob Altemeyer&#39;s excellent work on the subject, <em><a href="http://members.shaw.ca/jeanaltemeyer/drbob/TheAuthoritarians.pdf">&quot;The Authoritarians&quot;</a></em>--in which she states that </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;A democracy can only be as democratic as the minds of its citizens&quot;</em></p>

<p>In the same way an individual go through this, I really think human kind will do this same process when it will reach a critical point.</p>

<p>So yes, a lot of pain, hatred will come out of it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid I must agree with this citation I see a lot which apear to be from Einstein, something about WW4 will be fought with sticks and rocks.</p>

<p>But yeah, great time after that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK so the first two are very interesting and sort of form a foundation for the rest of your post.</p>

<p>For the first one, the Milgram Experiments have a lot of interesting information with the actual experiments.  For one, he left out a lot of qualitative information about the experiment.  From his conclusions, we are led to believe that people just obeyed, but reality is quite a bit more nuanced.  But most importantly of all, <em>knowledge</em> of the Milgram Experiments conveys a high degree of immunity to authoritarian direction.  I am having some trouble finding the replications that showed this effect, but this <a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/03/milgram.aspx">replication in 2009</a> had to specifically exclude people who had taken psychology courses or who indicated knowledge of the Milgram experiment.</p>

<p>So.  Teach people about the obedience bias exposed by the Milgram experiments and they gain an ability to compensate for that bias.  Pretty freaking cool, if you ask me.</p>

<p>The second one is a little more interesting.  I don&#39;t know if anyone has really dug down into <em>why</em> the Stanford Prison Experiment went so badly wrong.  However, in the last few years, I&#39;ve been watching a steady stream of articles on the &quot;psychology of power&quot; and this seems to potentially explain what we saw.  In essence, when you give someone power over others, it removes their ability to empathize and turns them into a sociopath.  For the people without power, it generates depression and anxiety, and actually reduces their level of brain activity.  This applies to any power relationship, whether romantic, business, or political.  Here&#39;s a quote from an article about <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201401/love-and-power">power dynamics in personal relationships</a> from Psychology Today:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The possession of power changes powerholders—usually in ways invisible to them—by triggering activation of the behavioral approach system, based in the left frontal cortex and fueled by the neurotransmitter dopamine. It’s automatic. Nevertheless, it makes powerful people quick to act on appetites, to detect opportunities for material and social rewards such as food, money, attention, sex, and approval. They think about sex more and flirt more flagrantly. Poorly attuned to others, they pay little attention to others’ feelings and assess their attitudes, interests, and needs inaccurately. Politeness be damned, they act rudely, indulging their own whims. “Having power,” Keltner reports, “makes people more likely to act as sociopaths.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And for the other side of power:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The biological obverse marks the powerless. Their lack of power activates the brain’s inhibitory system, centered in the right frontal cortex, which directs attention to threat and punishment and sets in motion avoidant behavior. It also ushers in negative feelings, notably anxiety and depression, virtually hallmark emotions of those denied power. If the thwarting of identity isn’t distressing enough, add in the lack of partner responsiveness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doesn&#39;t that explain a lot about what we see going on in the world today?  To me, it also explains a lot of what we saw in the Stanford Prison Experiment.</p>

<p>So I think there&#39;s actually a lot of hope.  Yes, if you just look at the Milgram and Stanford experiments, things look pretty shitty.  But if you read further, it may be possible to compensate for these tendencies and behaviors and rise above them, not through willpower but through knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great catches, especially on the replication of millgrams with special attention to exclude people who&#39;ve taken psychology courses.  What that means is that <strong><em>awareness itself screws up the authoritarian&#39;s weaponized will (&quot;aww&quot;)</em></strong>.  This was anticipated but good to know it&#39;s also experimentally observed in repeat experiments and metastudies.</p>

<p>Stanford Prison Experiment went wrong because Zimbardo was part of the experiment himself, until his future wife told him to shut it down.  He said it was affecting him as well and he was starting to believe in his own power, a phenomenon which informed Dr. Zimbardo&#39;s general theory of the <em>Lucifer Effect</em>, how unchecked authority and diluted accountability grease the slippery slope of evil.  He discusses this in his TED talk the psychology of evil but he&#39;s gone into this in detail in the documentary about the experiment</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some other relevant experiments you might find interesting:</p>

<p>Asch Conformity experiment: showed that people will adjust their perceptions - or at least what they state about them - (in this case their judgement of the relative lengths of lines) to match the unified consensus of their peers (who were &quot;disinfo&quot; agents, and in on the experiment).</p>

<p>Darley/Latane and the Bystander Effect:  showed that the larger the group, the slower people are to help others in distress:  &quot;diffusion of responsibility&quot;.</p>

<p>Calhoun&#39;s Rat Utopia Experiment:  given a near-ideal (closed) environment with no predators and unlimited food and water, a rat population would not reach the mathematical carrying capacity of the space; it would instead plateau well below it, social structures would fragment, and behaviour would become increasingly abberant and violent, resulting in a population crash.</p>

<p>Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma competition (Hofstadter):  Not really an experiment, but it showed that the winning strategy for the iterated Prisoner&#39;s dilemma in computer game theory was incredibly simple: cooperate on the first move, and then play &quot;Tit-For-Tat&quot;.</p>

<p>Robbers Cave Experiment (Sharif):   Boys in summer camp were separated into groups and then induced to compete.  Hostile and aggressive attitudes toward an outgroup arise when groups compete in a zero-sum paradigm.  Contact with an outgroup is insufficient, by itself, to reduce negative attitudes. Friction between groups can be reduced only in the presence of superordinate goals that promote united, cooperative action.</p>

<p>Rosenzweig&#39;s experiment on environment and brain development:  Rats raised in &quot;enriched environments&quot; had a larger, thicker cerebral cortex and higher cortex activity, compared with rats subjected to &quot;impoverished conditions&quot;.</p>

<p>Pavlov&#39;s conditioned reflex experiment in dogs is iconic, but Watson and Raynor, in the &quot;Little Albert&quot; experiment in 1920, showed that in humans, conditioned <em>emotional</em> responses could be induced.</p>

<p>BF Skinner and Pigeon Superstition: Pigeons will learn and rehearse whatever random behaviours precede reinforcement (food), behaving as though they believe they are influencing their own reward.</p>

<p>Rosenthal&#39;s Teachers expectations:  children achieve higher IQ scores when their teachers praise them and expect them to.  Similar is the Monster Study in which children with speech impediments were given either positive or negative reinforcement.  Those positively reinforced were more likely to overcome their impediment, those negatively reinforced more likely to retain the impediments for life.</p>

<p>Bandura&#39;s Transmission of Aggression: Aggressive behaviour can be learned through imitation of those around us (poor Bobo the clown).</p>

<p>Halo Effect (Nisbett and Wilson): people who are perceived to be physically attractive are also perceived to have other positive characteristics such as intelligence, friendliness, and good judgment.</p>

<p>Loftus&#39; Eyewitness/leading question experiment:  showed that between the time that you witness an account and the time you recount it to someone else, your memory of the event may change drastically.
 The way questions are phrased can influence the answer of the person being questioned.</p>

<p>Selective Attention:  &quot;gorilla amongst basketball players&quot; - this is a recent one.  It shows that when we are given a task that requires focus - in this case counting passes of a ball - we can completely miss obvious intrusions into our field of perception.  We have limited information-processing ability.</p>

<p>Subway Violin Experiment (context and appreciation of beauty):  Joshua Bell, playing a 3.5 million dollar violin in the DC metro, did not garner much of an audience or money, despite having sold out expensive concerts.</p>

<p>...then we ask ourselves how these interact with the findings of the Double Slit and Ganzfeld Experiments...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You neglected to mention in-group/out-group studies, which is one of the biggest specializations in social psych. Extreme in-group/out-group aggression can lead to genocide. I don&#39;t know how it relates to groupthink, like academically, but I am guessing groupthink helps develop the biases within an in-group and facing out to the out-group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for reading it and the positive feedback!  </p>

<p>I&#39;m very proud of that post.  </p>

<p>I really felt like I was on to something big.  I am trying to bring that whole concept into a book.  On how the industry shapes people&#39;s time-orientations into the present and doesn&#39;t want you looking forward...or back.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like &quot;psychic driving&quot;, in the most literal sense, break off that rear view mirror and bust out the side one, then remove the brakes.  Now you&#39;re a perfect consumer, trapped in the perilous moment fraught with 1) danger, 2) urgency to respond (with money)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool. </p>

<p>Check out some material on marketing and neuro-marketing. Shit can get positively diabolical and also hilariously banal and absurd when you realize the monumental effort invested in convincing other people to give the marketers actually worthless bits of paper and bytes that everyone has collectively convinced themselves means something. </p>

<p>Direct response stuff—the most overt and needy kind of marketing— always plays on the target&#39;s insecurities. The goal of a letter is to make the target feel like shit, convince them that the letter writer/salesman/marketer is the only person that can help them <strong>and</strong> can help them <em>right now!</em>, convince them that the ridiculous amount they&#39;re going to pay for this shitty product is actually a steal of a deal and wow aren&#39;t you special/my friend/my best customer that you have the <em>opportunity</em> to get this deal!. Most of these products are never even used by the people after they buy them; that&#39;s the not-so-secret-secret everyone who&#39;s ever bought an $2 Chinese abcrunch at 3am for $100 already knows. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rteSvoogGv0">Here&#39;s a dude talking about the tricks he uses in this kind of marketing.</a></p>

<p>I think of those stupid videos you can&#39;t stop or fast forward, where they narrate a drawn cartoon.  The &#39;ron paul shows how the economy is going to collapse in a month&#39;, or &#39;buy our prepper DVDs&#39;, how to invest in quantitative marginal vapor bonds and certificates</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep in mind a lot of these studies have aged (Milgram 1963, Stanford 1971) and are subjected ideas connected to those time periods. Reproducibility is not that high in most of these original studies, last year there was a massive study done about the reproducibility of these &#39;older&#39; views we take for granted in social psychology. 
Nevertheless, it&#39;s a good thing to be aware of these biases no matter how hard it is to fight them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This kind of deception leading to such a stressful situation is seen as unethical and there is no proof the authority figures gave them the openness and right to withdraw (they had to continue). He did fully debrief them though, which speaks for Milgram, because the stressful situation should last for a short period of time. Although I think these kinds of experiments would be extremely useful for understanding human behavior, you wouldn&#39;t get an experiment like this past any ethical commission today. I had to explain a lot when I made an (10 minute) online survey with a very small, and to the participant unimportant, deception.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem, thanks for replying! My survey was fun, but I had too little participants to draw real conclusions (as every MA thesis). It was about the influence of online social support (via comments) on the motivation to take action against moral stances. I showed them a news article about angora rabbits being severely harmed for their fur and added mostly positive/negative/neutral comments (3 conditions). With a pre and post survey I measured their moral conviction and motivation to take action against it. I found some small effects but no big significant revelations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good idea for a thesis, it definitely seems that people are swayed by reading comments instead of using their own moral compass. Especially since we now have proof of JTRIG&#39;s manipulation of online discourse. Strange times we&#39;re living in!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only unethical to the extent that you manufacture consent to do wrong in the testee and reinforce the same.  </p>

<p>Although the subject is not being shocked, the testee believes they are and in so doing they are harmed into authoritarian consent for wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Unless the experiment&#39;s intent and mechanisms are revealed to the testee after-the-fact, they may go out into the world and do other bad things because they were told to do them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so, going to say it again.  You are citing one study that</p>

<ol>
<li>) Was coordinated by one person, who happens to <a href="http://nosek.socialpsychology.org/publications">ride the coattails of his coworkers work</a></li>
<li>) Makes an argument that hinges on a very narrow definition of one statistical aspect that is subjective p value.</li>
<li>) Makes a highly interpretive, skeptical analysis of other people&#39;s past peer-reviewed work that attempts to wholesale discredit all of the field of psychology&#39;s science.</li>
<li>) What I&#39;m getting at is that if your aim is to discredit something inherently subjective, then surely you&#39;ll succeed because in science just like in literature or even math and rhetoric, you can make anything say what you want.  But what this does is it buries trends and thereby attempts to obfuscate them and discredit an entire field of study.  Which then means, what?  Should all psychologists just give up and go home, start studying welding?</li>
