    <div class="md"><p>Yep. I made a thread about that yesterday as well, and posted a couple of times in <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>. Of coures it immediately gets discredited as mere coincidence. Just like the CIA torture/shit movie thing; another coincidence.</p>

<p>Like G.K. Chesterton said: &quot;Coincidence is just a spiritual pun&quot;. And one time is a chance. Something happening twice is a &quot;coincidence&quot;. The third time it becomes a pattern. The people who deny this pattern are simply being an ignorant fool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Protip:  If you consider two significant news items occurring on the same day to be a coincidence you&#39;ll see a lot of coincidences.  The MSM can and does just ignore shit like the CISA amendment all the time.  They just pump in more non-news and slow news day crap, and here they could just pass off some Star Wars shit as news etc.  </p>

<p>The vast majority of MSNBCNN viewers, like the vast majority of Americans have no idea who Shkreli is.  Likewise with CISA but that&#39;s actually important to the network owners so they just didn&#39;t cover it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m completely willing to agree that this is not just a coincidence, not because it was manufactured, but because there is nothing coincidental about it.  Have some news stories been overplayed to drown out awareness of others in the past?  Yes.  Is this a case of that?  Not even close.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even talking about coincedences since I don&#39;t believe this is a coincedence. I believe this another orchestrated propaganda act to deter people from questioning their government. Just like they&#39;ve done countless times before. </p>

<p>But go ahead, believe everything is a coincedence. Life is just a never ending shit storm of random shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you read my post?  First of all, I agree with you that this is not a coincidence because the Shkreli story didn&#39;t mean shit to the vast majority of Americans and wasn&#39;t covering the front page so it&#39;s not drowning out attention for anything else.  The major networks barely or didn&#39;t at all cover the CISA thing.  Why did they have to draw attention away from something most people didn&#39;t hear about and why would they do it with something most people have no context for and or don&#39;t care about?  This is a engineered.  This is two things happening.  You&#39;ll find that there are often more than two newsworthy things on a given day.  You will also find that when the mainstream media doesn&#39;t want something widely known they usually just under report it or don&#39;t report it.  Their owners don&#39;t work behind the scenes to conclude an ongoing investigation right when the it&#39;s convenient.  They especially don&#39;t  engineer stories that no one pays attention to in order to divert them from stories they weren&#39;t going to seriously cover anyway.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Going back to the &quot;did you read my post?&quot; thing, it&#39;s not like I said:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have some news stories been overplayed to drown out awareness of others in the past? Yes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just another baseless case of &quot;Two things happened at the same time!  I could say &quot;They snuck in the CISA language and announced Shkreli&#39;s arrest just as eaveryone was distracted by Star Wars comeing out!  You know, that&#39;s actually a much more logical theory, but it still only holds up to scrutiny a little better than this one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny how you think that me not buying into the distraction conspiracy automatically means I support the government or somehow believe the government is good. Trust me, I know the government is shit. I just think the whole &quot;this news story is a distraction from this other news story&quot; is incredibly overblown. </p>

<p>Just because I don&#39;t believe this little conspiracy doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m blind to the government&#39;s fuckery. I am more than capable of following two or more news stories at a time, as are most people. </p>
