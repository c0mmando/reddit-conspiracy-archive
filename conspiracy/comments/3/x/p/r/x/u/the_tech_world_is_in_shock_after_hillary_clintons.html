        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In what was perhaps the most egregious policy gaff at Saturday evening&#39;s Democratic Presidential Debate, former Senator Hilary Clinton proclaimed the need for a large scale government operation to undermine encryption at all costs. The former senator then explained to a befuddled moderator, &quot;I don&#39;t know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is&quot;.</p>

<p>The response from across the tech world was instant and consisted of mockery-laden comments from the likes of Edward Snowden and Netscape founder Marc Andreessen. With Snowden pointing to the instant alienation of nearly all tech-savvy voters;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/678396357145686016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Aaaaaaaaand Hillary just terrified everyone with an internet connection.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Displaying a professed wanton ignorance surrounding the importance of privacy rights within the Democratic party, Hilary seemed to double down on her lack of understanding surrounding her voting base with the following perplexing statement;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project — something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they&#39;re not adversaries, they&#39;ve got to be partners.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ms. Clinton&#39;s stance is quite confusing in light of the fervent tone of the discussion surrounding attempts by government agencies to use &quot;back door&quot; technologies to undermine personal security on technological devices. </p>

<p>Perhaps a glaring testament to her age and unwillingness to understand the issues facing contemporary voters, Ms. Clinton was brazen enough to actually acknowledge her own ignorance with regards to the very policy proposal she had just put forth.</p>

<p>This is, perhaps, a fitting tribute to an American political sphere dominated by bought-and-paid-for news coverage; which presents vacuous controversy as the epitome of informed opinion while neglecting the core tenets of a legitimate political order as reflected in the opinions of the polity.</p>

<p>What can be said of a Republic wherein public officials not only do not consider themselves beholden to public opinion, but mock the very nature of democratic participation by encouraging policies directly contrary to the will of the constituency?</p>

<p>What can be said of a country that can do nothing in the face of monopolized television/newspaper interests, which shove candidates down the throat of an unwilling polity ad nasuem?</p>

<p>I am left to wonder how Americans can look themselves in the face in light of current developments without feeling a hopeless, fleeting, sense of uselessness in the face of large scale corporate-political machines. It&#39;s one thing to rue the loss of a vibrant democracy, it&#39;s another matter entirely when the reverberations of that decay come in the form of brazen public calls for &quot;A Manhattan project for the internet&quot; from the mouth of a self-professed ignorant charlatan. </p>

<p>If these words, proclaimed by Ms. Clinton from on high, do not spell the end of her legitimacy as a candidate in the modern world, then our Republic is dead; and we have killed it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s about broad strokes. They don&#39;t aim to stop individual &quot;terrorists&quot; (however they choose to define that word), in fact the occasional terrorism incident helps add fuel to their fire.</p>

<p>Rather, the big picture with mass surveillance is stopping any threat to the power structure before it can gain critical mass, thus entrenching those who are already at the top of the pyramid, making revolution far less likely.</p>

<p>The knowledge that they&#39;re being surveilled also causes self censorship among people, which helps keep society in line with no overt effort.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difference is people are here out of worry. Paranoia comes naturally with that, certainly. When all you can see is the negative, it&#39;s hard and furthers that depressive state that seems to accompany uncomfortable fact.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to be wrong when trapped in that state. I&#39;ll take occasionally being wrong while being highly skeptical instead of trying to maintain ignorant bliss. That whole cognitive dissonance thing, hiding from the unhappy truths of our world, that will eventually lead to our downfall. <a href="/r/collapse">/r/collapse</a> had a great discussion recently on the irish potato famine and how people chose to ignore the unhappy truths about it, the parallels with that where pretty indicative of those sticky fingers regulars here like to keep an eye out for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. People fail to see that these agencies and security contractors already have access to tools that can decrypt almost anything with a certain degree of success. The point is that those clusters are used to decrypt important things, and Hillary and other idiots want there to just be no encryption for the general public. There&#39;s no actual security increase from this. People who want to encrypt and obfuscate things will use their own methods to do it anyway. </p>

<p>When major retailers are complaining about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrooming">showrooming</a> yes, I think they would be overjoyed to turnback the clock.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Project for the New American Century (PNAC) was a neoconservative[1][2][3] think tank based in Washington, D.C. that focused on United States foreign policy. It was established as a non-profit educational organization in 1997, and founded by William Kristol and Robert Kagan.[4][5] The PNAC&#39;s stated goal was &quot;to promote American global leadership&quot;.[6] The organization stated that &quot;American leadership is good both for America and for the world,&quot; and sought to build support for &quot;a Reaganite policy of military strength and moral clarity&quot;.[7]</p>

<p>We have absolutely terrible candidates for next year&#39;s election. I&#39;m not old enough to know if this is abnormal or not.</p>

<p>We can choose between a Bush, a Clinton, a socialist, or Trump.</p>

<p>I feel crazy to say that I support Trump. There&#39;s so much hate for supporters of any of them, and most people don&#39;t care enough to be alienated from social circles because of who they support. A more divided country with less political participation. Awesome.</p>

For decades ever since Kennedy&#39;s assassination (he stood against them and paid for it), politicians on both sides have been quietly and slowly building up a dictatorship in the shadows. No 2 party system, just 1 party that has worked hard to keep the people at each other&#39;s throats so they don&#39;t focus on what&#39;s been really going on in DC.</p>

<p>Now with the current administration we&#39;ve seen them come out of the shadows and blatantly attack the constitution and the freedoms of the people because they no longer fear any repercussions. We put another &quot;establishment&quot; puppet into office for the next term and we&#39;re fucked as a nation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There already is such a &quot;Manhattan Project&quot; to end encryption.</p>

<p>It is called Bitcoin.</p>

<p>You have millions of computers solving complex equations, and no one has any idea what those equations are for. The similarities to the actual Manhattan Project are striking; there were thousands of scientists and mathematicians who were just handed equations, solved them and passed them back up the chain with no clue they part of the development of the atom bomb.</p>

<p>When all of the bitcoins are mined, all encryption will basically be solved. Maybe people will devise new encryption methods, but existing systems will be totally compromised.</p>

<p>Someone is sure to respond to me here that no no no I&#39;m crazy, Bitcoin equations are meaningless. That&#39;s what lots of people say. But none of those people have phds in mathematics and encryption, so they&#39;re just repeating the propaganda.</p>

<p>Even if Bitcoin isn&#39;t some massively distributed NSA encryption breaker, it is exactly what such a project would look like. It doesn&#39;t cost the government anything, the government can&#39;t really be held liable for its use, the incentive for private persons to use it is built right into itself. Yes, if I were to design a Manhattan Project for encryption, it would look exactly like bitcoin. </p>

<p>Adding that Hillary now calling for such a Manhattan Project works as a limited hangout disinfo. It makes us think that such a project isn&#39;t already underway.</p>

<p>Well, okay here&#39;s the funny thing. What it has done is put an enormous bounty on breaking the encryption the network is using. Anyone able to do so could make themselves wildly wealthy, but so far no one&#39;s been able to do it :)</p>
