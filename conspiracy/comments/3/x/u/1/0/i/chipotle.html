<p>If you haven&#39;t heard, there&#39;s been two <em>back to back</em> E. coli outbreaks with two <em>completely different strains</em> at Chipotle restaurants: <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/21/cdc-investigating-another-outbreak-of-different-e-coli-strain-at-chipotle.html">http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/21/cdc-investigating-another-outbreak-of-different-e-coli-strain-at-chipotle.html</a></p>

<p>The &quot;Big 6&quot; pesticide/GMO corporations are BASF, Bayer, Dupont, Dow Chemical Company, Monsanto, and Syngenta. They cannot be happy that a very popular, growing fast food chain that brands itself as a healthy place to eat, is coming out against GMOs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a conspiracy blog kind of person but I have yet to see any story which explains how this is NOT sabotage. Does chipotle really have a source of ingredients which is so unique?</p>

<p>E coli AND norovirus? And as you say, &quot;rare&quot; strains of e coli?</p>

<p>I think about all the disgusting restaurants which exist, like the kitchen nightmare guests, which you know are only a small representation of poor food handling across the country and then wonder why this one particular restaurant chain out of all restaurant chains is having this issue. The one chain which was targeted recently by a bizarre anti-chipotle campaign with billboards...then within a year it is having all these outbreaks?</p>

<p>This was all turning through my head even before I saw a short blurb on fivethirtyeight recently explaining how the norovirus outbreak was statistically &quot;different&quot;.</p>

<p>Again, maybe Chipotle really does get its meat and such from places where no other chain gets ingredients. Maybe Chipotle has cooking methods which are very different from other restaurants. I have no idea. Any Chipotle insiders out there?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was initially skeptical. Spinach tends to be a frequent source of E. coli and salmonella contamination. It has happened numerous times over the years, and more frequently in big box stores like Kroger and Walmart than anywhere else.</p>

<p>Obviously, GMO vs organic is not really the issue at hand here. It is a dumb straw man perpetuated by biased &quot;science&quot; paid for by food manufacturers themselves to say that organic food is less safe.</p>

<p>But to get two different strains of E. coli, both of which are rare, is an interesting trend. Interested to see how this plays out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Chipotle buys a lot of their produce, and maybe their meats, from more independent farms. For instance, I read once (maybe it wasn&#39;t true, I didn&#39;t investigate), that Jason Mraz, and his avacado farm, supplies the avocados for some Chipotle&#39;s out west.  It seems they may have multiple (local-ish) sources for their &quot;all natural&quot; ingredients. Maybe that could help explain two varying strains of E. Coli? </p>

Trying to make the point that as an &quot;average consumer&quot;, not a Chipotle stock bro, or a Chipotle fanboy, this seems weird.</p>

<p>That wasn&#39;t an explanation. Do you really think Chipotle is unique in terms of employees not washing hands? That happens in restaurants all across the country every day. Something special about Chipotle employee shit? You haven&#39;t addressed the unique strains or the norovirus. I&#39;m willing to listen, but you don&#39;t have anything informative here other than colds spread via sneezing and doorknobs. </p>

<p>Corporate sabotage for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly your burrito is as healthy as you make it there. I get a bowl with white rice, chicken, mild salsa, corn salsa, sour cream AND cheese. Ooh hohohohoho. I don&#39;t try to make it healthy at all, lol. It&#39;s like 1700 calories. I can only eat half if it and save the other half for later. So 850 calories for dinner. That might be a lot depending on what else you eat during the day. Especially on days where I don&#39;t eat much, I don&#39;t care about going to town on it, and it&#39;s an occasional thing anyway.</p>

<p>You could get a burrito with brown rice, chicken, mild salsa, and lettuce. It&#39;d be way less calories. You can play with options on their website if you care to see how many calories are in your favorite burrito combination. </p>

<p>All the ingredients there are natural, with nothing being processed like if you ate at a cheaper fast food place. I can&#39;t imagine anything there is unhealthy on it&#39;s own. The danger just potentially comes from getting too many calories in one meal.</p>
