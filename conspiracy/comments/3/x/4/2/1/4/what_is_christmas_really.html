       We give our children toys that we tell them they will not get unless they are "good" boys and girls.  But when we think about it what are toys?  Parents give their children toys to be distracted with so that the parents can then go and be distracted with something else they think is more important than spending quality time with their children.  We consider a child to be "good" when they do not show any discontentment towards the idiot parents neglect.  I find this to be the crux of all the worlds problems, the substitution of things over relationships.

       You're aware that parents can play with their children with those toys, right? Imaginative, independent play is very important for development and if parents didn't buy them toys, they'd still play with sticks and rocks and other stuff. Holidays should be primarily about family. I don't know how you were raised, but calm yourself. If you want to get crotchety about parents neglecting their children for material gain, have an issue with the North American work week.

       A lot of families need a two (or more) person income just to keep their heads above the water.

       That's because people don't understand inflation and how free trade has hurt them.  When women started joining the workforce that was not the case.  It has made it a necessity to have a two income household now,

       Holds water just fine.  They initially wanted to leave the home when it was not a necessity.  You also have many situations where a home does not need two working parents but so so anyways.  Poor logic on your part.

       It is you fucking yards that think history doesn't matter that continue fucking things up for the rest us.  and Jesus fucking Christ.  To say you don't think toys and Christmas don't go together just goes to show how fucking stupid you really are.  FYI, Christmas is always about the kids.  Fucking Santa clause!  You ever hear of that?!  What a fucking joke!

       If that's what Christmas is to you, that's fine.  That's not what it is to me, nor a lot of other people.  In fact, there are quite a few of us that celebrate the holiday that don't even have children.  I'm guessing you're ten, though, so you may not yet understand.

       I think people should want to be with their kids. Women have evolved nesting behaviors and their bodies are literally designed to feed and care for young children.

       That's just it isn't it.  Get women to work so they stop having kids.  Don't tell me this shit hasn't been planned from the start.  Anyways the post is about spending time with your kids.  Not whether or not you should have any.

       We are disconnecting with being human.  Kids bring a joy to life that nothing else can.  The rockefellers created this population boom in the name of fighting communism with the "green revolution".  Now they want to bring it back down.  I don't like aristocrats like the rockefellers deciding when we live and when we die.

       I'm aware we are becoming further detached from nature and the environment we evolved in for millions of years.  Imagination is an escape from reality.  Kids also used to help their parents with daily tasks.  Now they are immersed in virtual worlds that are made by people with too MUCH imagination.  The body cannot evolve at the pace of technology.  We are soon to be obsolete.

       I think it's cute that you believe parents are spending so much time with their children.  The reality is people give their babies phones and iPads and let them amuse themselves.

       Maybe a better way to describe this practice is that it seems to globally effect the collective consciousness of children so that when they are told Santa isn't real they no longer embrace curiosity. In other words it normalizes anti imaginative thinking. Makes people not even seek or respect things of a magical nature such as meditation, collective consciousness, propaganda , and art. Ect
