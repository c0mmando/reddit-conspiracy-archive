<p>Some of you may have seen this propaganda video about steel yesterday on <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a> that the mods left up even though it clearly violates their rules: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzF1KySHmUA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzF1KySHmUA</a></p>

<p>Comments section full of retards here: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3wznry/for_the_undying_911_moronic_jet_fuel_argument/">https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3wznry/for_the_undying_911_moronic_jet_fuel_argument/</a></p>

<p>So the basics of the video: This guy claims he heated up the steel to &quot;1800 degrees, only 300 more than the temperature of burning jet fuel.&quot; Now, I have no idea why he decided to use 1800 degrees and not 1500. I also don&#39;t believe this was 1800. Using the color temp chart, it looks more like 2000 at least. There&#39;s a bunch of charts online and I&#39;m no expert, so I would appreciate if someone else found the best chart that specifically applies to structural steel. </p>

<p>This caused me to think: If they are using this as an argument that the steel was a &quot;friggin noodle,&quot; then the steel must have been a similar glowing color on 9/11. If the steel was even close to 1500 degrees, then there would be tons of footage of glowing redhot beams. Steel will start to glow around 900F. </p>

<p>Were there tons of glowing yellow hot or red hot beams all over the place on 9/11? If so, can&#39;t we just look at the pics and determine exactly what the temp was, and from that calculate exactly what percentage of the integrity was lost for each beam? </p>

<p>It seems more likely that the extremely thick beams just acted kind of like a &quot;heat sink,&quot; and the heat dissipated through the structure and probably rarely broke past 900F, but if 9/11 happened similar to the video here, there should be tons of red hot beams. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only the steel... the colour of the flames themselves.</p>

<p>Have a look at a match... yellow flame... butane lighter... yellow flame. None of them will melt steel. But a blowtorch has flames so hot they turn blue and you need specially darkened goggles to watch the flame as you cut the steel or you will damage your eyes.</p>

<p>I posted this on that thread, but it got quickly buried:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/wuAcTBJ.png">Here is a screenshot of the furnace</a></p>

<p>The entire interior is glowing white hot.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.debunking911.com/WTC_on_fire9.jpg">Here is a screenshot of the WTC fires</a></p>

<p>The interior is dark and only the dark red flames and dense black smoke coming out the windows are visible.</p>

<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5a/Example_incandescence_colors_%28temperature_range_550_-_1300_C%29.svg/214px-Example_incandescence_colors_%28temperature_range_550_-_1300_C%29.svg.png">Here is an image from the Wikipedia article on incandescence.</a></p>

<p>Using the given chart, estimate the temperature of the blast furnace and the WTC fires. You will see that the former was <em>much</em> hotter than the latter, and the latter was far too cold to even soften steel. In fact it was too cold to even heat steel enough for it to start glowing, and steel glows long before it gets hot enough to soften.</p>

<p>That yellow flame coming off your butane lighter is hotter than the dark red flames coming out of the WTC. Think about that.</p>

<p>Final bit of evidence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Battalion Seven...Ladder 15, we&#39;ve got two isolated pockets of fire. We should be able to knock it down with two lines. Radio...out of breath, gasping...radio that, 78th floor numerous 10-45 Code Ones</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/September_11th_FDNY_Radio_Transcripts">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/September_11th_FDNY_Radio_Transcripts</a></p>

<p>There were firefighters supposedly standing right in the middle of the fire that was hot enough to soften steel saying they had two isolated pockets of fire they could knock down with two hoses.</p>

<p>That <em>proves</em> beyond doubt that the WTC fires were not hot enough to soften steel. Period.</p>

<p>Would you expect it to topple sideways like a tree?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/collapses/docs/eh_wtc4.jpg">That&#39;s exactly what the top of one of the towers did.</a></p>

<p>And yet somehow it managed to crush the floors that were no longer directly underneath it. When that photo was taken, the top floors were tipping sideways, not falling downwards. How did the momentum of that movement suddenly stop? Because the building below suddenly and catastrophically lost all structural integrity. The bottom of the building fell out from under the top, clearing its path to the ground.</p>

<p>That seems highly unlikely considering much of the weight of the top floors was now directed to the side. If anything, the top falling sideways would have removed the weight of those floors from one side of the building and placed more on the other... but all sides collapsed evenly below that point.</p>

<p>Even if we ignore the video evidence of apparent explosions rippling down the building just before the bottom half collapsed, how is it that one side with more weight on it collapsed at exactly the same time as the other side with less weight on it?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iA35icy2-c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iA35icy2-c</a></p>

<p>In that video you can clearly see the majority of the debris from the top half of the building falling to the left and away from the remaining part of the tower... but the other side simply disintegrates, with very little above to explain it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was more referring to the sort of toppling that can be seen in <a href="/u/WhyDownvoteFacts">/u/WhyDownvoteFacts</a> video. However, we can talk about the rotation of the top of the towers too.</p>

<p>This rotation could not have moved the centroid of the falling chunk of building far at all because the shear forces required to do that were too high for the structure to have provided. Please do check out the top of page 15 in the paper I linked. Because of this, the center of mass of the falling part of the tower was still more or less directly over the building below it. </p>

<p>To address how the rotation slowed down, the paper addresses this as well: accretion of matter in the rotating segment would cause rotation to slow as the building collapsed.</p>

<p>I really do suggest you read that link I provided earlier. It addresses many of your complaints, and explains a lot of the mechanics behind building collapse so we don&#39;t have to rely on speculation. </p>

<p>Does it explain how WTC 7 fell at free fall speed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it does not. The paper I have been referencing, <a href="http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/people/bazant/PDFs/Papers/00%20WTC%20Collapse%20-%20What%20Did%20&amp;amp;%20Did%20Not%20Cause%20It.pdf">this guy</a>, discussed the mechanics behind the collapse of the twin towers. That&#39;s what we have been talking about. If you&#39;d like to talk about WTC7, I can, but I am not as knowledgeable about it. However, if I do this, I would like you to read the paper I linked. It discusses how the collapse of the twin towers is consistent with collapse, and I think you would at least find it interesting.</p>

<p>Now, on to your issues. From the NIST FAQs, they state the building underwent a progressive collapse. This is not consistent with your claim that every beam and girder lost strength simultaneously. Additionally, the collapse did not start out with free fall acceleration. I am not sure why having a face of the building undergo free fall necessitates that every beam and girder needs to lose all of their strength. From the graph on page 46 of <a href="http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=861610">this NIST report</a>, the velocity of the building gradually increased, which to me doesn&#39;t indicate all of the beams being cut simultaneously. If that were to occur, I presume you would expect the building to start off at free fall, not ramp up to free fall, then slow back down. In short, unless you can provide some model data or some sort of physical reason why that type of collapse can only be explained by explosives, I feel the NIST report explains it without them. Under NIST&#39;s report, WTC7 experienced progressive failure initially, then had a period of free fall when supports failed, then slowed down when it began to encounter the lower parts of the structure.</p>

<p>As for you wanting examples of this happening elsewhere, I do not have any. However, what we could do is model the collapse of a demolished building and see if it follows a similar pattern of starting and ending below free fall acceleration with a period of free fall in the middle. That being said, I don&#39;t know if I have been convinced enough of a controlled demolition to spend a couple hours hunting down videos of demolitions and plotting their collapses with Tracker.</p>

<p>The Bazant paper is irrelevant to WTC 7 as it is a completely different type of collapse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup, I am aware of that. However it deals with how the twin towers weren&#39;t staged, which I assume you believe. My apologies if I am mistaken, just normally that accompanies a belief that WTC7 was demolished. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For multiple floors to collapse at freefall the loss of strength in those floors must be essentially instant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not true. Fnet=ma. For simplicity, just say Fnet=Fstructure+Fgravity, or Fnet=Fs+Fg. For the structure to be in freefall, all that is needed is for Fs to equal zero. It does not need to instantaneously go from it&#39;s full value to zero, it simply needs to drop to zero, which is consistent with the acceleration of the building increasing from 0 (static) to g. </p>

<p>As for the web stiffener plates, I can&#39;t find too much on it. I watched the video, and I see no math done, just speculation. I cannot say whether or not the stiffener plates matter (<a href="http://911blogger.com/news/2013-11-06/nist-replies-stiffeners-inquiry">this</a> supposed email exchange with NIST seems to imply that at least NIST thinks they don&#39;t matter), nor can I confirm if they were included or not. However, even if I give you total benefit of the doubt, and the plates make NIST&#39;s report wrong, that doesn&#39;t validate any other theory, it simply puts us at &quot;we don&#39;t know.&quot; Do you have any evidence for an alternative theory?</p>

<p>Edit: I just realized you meant that the building collapsed uniformly, so that means the structure had to lose integrity simultaneously across the entire structure, and your issue was with the &quot;across the entire structure&quot; part. The issue with this is all of the beams are connected, and in a progressive failure, the failure of one component causes the load on the others to become too high, causing them to also fail. I don&#39;t see how this isn&#39;t consistent with what you can see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mamvq7LWqRU">here</a>.</p>

<p>I want to see the math because that&#39;s how science is done. As of right now, I do not know if NIST&#39;s report on WTC7 is valid or not, because someone brought up the issue with the stiffener plates. If you want me to take a stance besides this, I need evidence. Not someone saying &quot;well this clearly makes it bad,&quot; but either some modeling or some mathematics. </p>

<p>How does a bad WTC7 report imply a bad WTC1 and WTC2 report? Logically, it does not follow. The two reports are not dependent on one another. If NIST messed up the WTC7 report, then yeah, sure, it would be prudent to double check their work for the other reports, but it doesn&#39;t suddenly mean those reports must be wrong. </p>

You can invalidate the current leading theory on why the twin towers collapsed all you want, but it provides not one shred of evidence for your theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, I am again going to ask you what would cause the building to not collapse into it&#39;s own footprint. The shear forces required to make the building not come more or less straight down simply cannot be provided by the structure. If the structure of the building isn&#39;t providing the force that causes it to not collapse downward, what would? </p>

<p>Also, I am having a hard time finding collapsing skyscrapers that are the same size as the twin towers. Most of what I find is about 20 stories at most, which is approximately as large as the segment of the towers above the plane impacts. As <a href="/u/JoeBloggsNZ">/u/JoeBloggsNZ</a> pointed out, those segments of the towers did rotate, which is reminiscent of the collapse of the smaller buildings I found. Long story short, I can&#39;t find anything comparable, although the tops of the towers do behave more like you think they should.</p>

<p>What does that even mean? Energy is not a vector quantity, it has no direction. I think what you meant to say was it would redirect the momentum. However, this is not true: changing momentum requires a force. To &quot;redirect&quot; the momentum to the side, you would need to apply a force to the side. Where does this sideways shove come from?</p>

<p>No, gravity is a force. There is a potential energy associated with objects within a gravitational field however, which is what I think you were referring to. Although I do agree, the energy required to pulverize the floors came from the potential energy in the tower.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not ignoring just busy, also no, gravity can be a stored energy, like in this case. You can figure that out on your own, also I didn&#39;t mean momentum, I meant energy, as in the stored energy of the floor above.  See in order for there to be momentum there would have to be more energy pressing down the the total resistance of the floor below and be moving, correct? 
And for that to fall straight down the resistance would have to be overcome by this energy, aka gravity plus mass, of the floor below at all resistance point of the said floor below at exactly the same amount of energy and at the same time, if not, the falling floor would tilt toward the less reaistance, then momentum would continue the path until gravity wins again or differences in resistance from the next floor changed its falling path.  Make sense now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all good, I am busy too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in order for there to be momentum there would have to be more energy pressing down the the total resistance of the floor below and be moving</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First off, energy doesn&#39;t press down. Energy is simply the ability to do work. Next, a change in momentum is brought about any time the net force on an object is not zero. So all that you would need is the force of gravity on the floor to be greater than the force of the structure holding it up to see a change in the momentum of the floor. Since the floor was additionally stationary, this change in momentum would then cause the floor to start moving. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And for that to fall straight down the resistance would have to be overcome by this energy, aka gravity plus mass, of the floor below</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To fall straight down, all an object needs is to have no lateral forces applied when it begins to fall. I am not entirely sure what you&#39;re getting at with the overcoming of energy of the floor below thing. In all of my physics courses, I have not heard language like this.</p>

<p>The key point is that to make an object move sideways, you need to apply a force to the object, sideways. The tops of the towers did rotate as they fell: however, this will not cause the tower to move to the side. You can envision this rotation as happening because one side of the structure failed faster than the other side. This applies a torque to the tower segment, but not a net force to either side. If this is still confusing, just remember that Fnet=ma; to accelerate a mass, you need to have a net force. Try drawing what&#39;s called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_body_diagram">free body diagram</a> of the collapsing chunk of the tower, and see how you could possibly get a significant sideways force.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok the force is gravity so ya there is force pressing down, second ... picture this, if I drop a rock and it lads on a flat surface it&#39;s less likely to move sideways right? But if I dropped said rock on a surface that is on a 45* angle, it&#39;s gunna move sideways right? The resistance which is different from floor to floor would be the 45* angle, as opposed to an empty floor that would represent the flat surface, get it now?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, this is because the normal force from the surface would push the rock up and to the side. The problem is the floors below the falling building chunk are more or less flat. Deviations on how structurally sound the floors below were would result in a net torque on the piece above, which was observed. Still, you need some sideways force.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The buildings were designed with very open spaces, which would prove to be its downfall.  The only vertical supports you had were on the inside column, and on the outside facade.  Everything between them was non-load bearing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya I know the design, your pancake theory doesn&#39;t work though. There wasn&#39;t extra mass/weight so the unaffected floors would have continued to hold up the floors. Plus all the floors due to the stuff in them would cause the tip over because they would add extra resistance. Go tell your boss we know the truth, time for plan b or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gravity always pulls down, it would have taken ungodly amounts to tip the towers over at that height.  When the collapse started, the weight on top pulverized the inner columns and outer facade out of its way.  100,000 tons at any speed over 0 generates tremendous momentum that not much short of bedrock will stop.</p>

<p>If this was a regular post-and-beam building, it likely would have worked out differently.  But it was a one-of-a-kind structure and it collapsed the way it did due to its intrinsic design.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I&#39;m saying is as it&#39;s pulling down, the tower that is unhurt under it would still be able to hold the weight, causing it to tip not crash through it. And the different floors with all the materials (tons and tons) would add to the resistance of the mess above it.also causing a tip, unless the resistance was equal on every square in of the floor beneath it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You fail to realize that the falling debris has a lot of momentum.  The floors might be able to support it as a static load, but multiply it by 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> (gravity), and it &quot;weighs&quot; a whole lot more and smashes through everything below it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok the force is gravity so ya there is force pressing down, second ... picture this, if I drop a rock and it lads on a flat surface it&#39;s less likely to move sideways right? But if I dropped said rock on a surface that is on a 45* angle, it&#39;s gunna move sideways right? The resistance which is different from floor to floor would be the 45* angle, as opposed to an empty floor that would represent the flat surface, get it now?</p>
