It seems that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/12/11/scientists-claimed-they-found-the-elusive-planet-x-now-astronomers-are-in-an-uproar/">The Washington Post did report this</a> a few days ago.</p>

<p>If you follow some of the links in the WP article, you&#39;ll find that indeed <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02652">Cornell University</a> said:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>ALMA observations 10 months apart revealed a new blackbody point source that is apparently comoving with α Cen B. We exclude that source to be a sub-/stellar member of the α Centauri system, but argue that it is either an extreme TNO, a Super-Earth or a very cool brown dwarf in the outer realm of the solar system.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnjSFp8bSgs">Another interesting video</a> but not sure if the locations tie in the other links or if this is different.</p>

<p>Granted none of this has been peer reviewed yet but I found it interesting none the less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The calculation in that video (of 2 million miles per hour) is very wrong. The conversion of arcseconds/year to a linear speed depends on the distance of the object. What he did would only be valid if the object was at the same distance as Barnard&#39;s Star.</p>

<p>Also, Cornell University is the home of arXiv.org, which just hosts scientific papers. Cornell has nothing to do with these claims.</p>

<p>The astronomers, from Sweden and Mexico, claim two completely separate discoveries: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02650">arxiv.org/abs/1512.02650</a> in the direction of W Aquilae and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02652">arxiv.org/abs/1512.02652</a> in the direction of alpha Centauri. If you look at the second one, they have already withdrawn that claim for now.</p>

<p>Maybe so, but low probability does not equal impossibility. For example, the odds of winning the US Powerball lottery are 1 in 175,223,510</p>

<p>Yet it was won in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2011 and 2013</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. If they found a large planet in the Oort cloud it would be a large planet in the Oort cloud. If they found a rogue planet (it wouldn&#39;t be able to orbit the Sun if it were moving that fast), it would be interesting as a piece of evidence about how the galaxy works (what process could accelerate a planet that fast?), but the odds of it coming through the solar system would be miniscule. If you want to worry about space things, worry about the very real (but still very remote) threat posed by asteroids and comets.</p>

NASA doesn&#39;t think there is one because the evidence against one existing provided by WISE is very strong, but it&#39;s not like they wouldn&#39;t be excited about finding another large planet. I imagine most of them would think it pretty cool. And what do (most) Religions care about distant gas giants?

    <div class="md"><p>Acceleration is a change in speed. Going from rest to 10 miles per hour requires the same force as going from from 100 to 110. All force cares about is the amount it changes by, which is 10 miles per hour in both cases. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I recall correctly, I recall an experiment that suggests the Earth is curved (I am trying to use language that is more &quot;scientifically correct&quot; since the experiment alone does not decisively prove the earth has to be flat but proves evidence that suggests so). By repeating the experiment a few times in different locations, you can assume the earth is curved throughout; that it is a sphere. You can even calculate the radius of the Earth yourself, through experimental data (which is only as accurate as your measurements).</p>

<p>It involves being somewhere like a beach, where there are not many obtrusions to the horizon. At sunset, just as the sun goes below the horizon, use something like a cherry picker or even stand up really fast to lift yourself up a distance and you can experience the sunset again. This phenomenon can be more clearly seen in places like skyscrapers and high rises, where there can be several minutes between a sunset on the top floor and the ground floor. The flat earth with a curved dome model has no explanation that I am aware of for this phenomenon. If you measure the times between them and the distance you travelled you can do some calculations.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/ju79M5e">http://imgur.com/ju79M5e</a></p>

<p>In this hastily drawn diagram, you can see we have a right angled triangle because of the tangent line (it is a tangent line because we are observing a sunset where the observer, a single point of the earth and the sun are all in one line) with sides r and r+h with common angle Θ. To calculate Θ, you take the time between sunsets, divide it by the time in one day (which is the time it takes to complete one full rotation) and multiply it by 360 degrees. Now you use the height you moved up (h) and the angle Θ to calculate r using simple trigonometry. </p>

<p>cos(Θ) = adj/hyp</p>

<p>cos(Θ) = r/(r+h)</p>

<p>From here you need to substitute the values and rearrange for r.</p>

<p>Now the first flaw I see with your logic about the flat plane is that you can circumvent the globe without travelling backwards. How does your theory deal with this?</p>

<p>It also seems you made a mistake in your comment; you claim the times should be different according to theory and get surprised when one of them is shorter than the other.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t know anything about physics or astronomy but you like to declare that you know more about those topics than professionals in either field.  However, you are actually so ignorant of those topics that you can&#39;t even adequately weigh physical and astronomical evidence.

They start vertical and ALWAYS end up horizontal. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzCsDVfPQqk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzCsDVfPQqk</a></p>

<p>How does satellite-based technology (GPS, phones, internet, television) work?Replace GPS with &quot;cell&quot; tower triangulation. If satellites were real you would have ground based satellites pointing directly up. Phones and internet are based on fiber optic cabling that may branch out to copper. What about basic geology, such as plate tectonics (unproven), seismology (measuring vibrations?), carbon dating(laughable)? Coriolis force? (Doesn&#39;t exist) Hurricanes? Exist and based on the path of the sun dictates the spin it will have. Time zones? Works on flat earth just fine Tides? Electro-magnetism based on salt water content, salt water is diametrically opposed to a magnet, sun and or moon are magnetic (push not pull like gravity states).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL.  So you&#39;ve obviously never studied Astronomy if that is what you think.  And you obviously never studied Geometry in any serious way. In fact, it seems like the only research you are capable of doing is eating Cheetos and watching conspiracy vids on YouTube.  Education is what frees you to think for yourself -- you&#39;ve received all of your understandsting from YT videos and yet you call ME a controlled zombie.  Hilarious.</p>

<p>And your wife has 3 degrees and has been damaged by it?  I bet you think that because she&#39;s too well educated to fall for the same nonsense pseudoscience that you have, LOL.  Dunning-Kruger effect -- you are so ignorant of the actual issues that you cannot weight evidence for yourself.</p>

<p>All you need to know that the Earth is not flat is to know a little math and watch the sky.  It is LAUGHABLY easy to prove that the Earth is not flat.</p>

<p>Ah, it&#39;s actually cointelpro? So like, the CIA in 1956 used a time machine to travel forward to 2016 and post flat Earth Bullshit? And this is like what, going to help them win Vietnam, or something?</p>

<p>Do you have any actual proof this guy, or anyone else who posts baloney about the flat Earth, is actually a shill? Do you have copies of their orders? Copies of emails? Memos? Secret plans?

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say they weren&#39;t true you raging bucket of retard. You posted a link about the Russians paying people to post online. Why, exactly, would the Russian government want to post stupid shit about the earth being flat. </p>

<p>You also posted about COINTELPRO, which ended in the 70s. What, exactly, does a program designed to undermine protest about the Vietnam war which ended 40 years ago have to do with a dipshit new-ager nutbag posting bullshit about the Earth being flat?</p>

<p>Or could it be that maybe you don&#39;t really know anything about &quot;government shills,&quot; except some exaggerated horseshit on Infowars and what other like-minded dumbshits have <strong>speculated</strong> about.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right, it&#39;s all fucking speculation. Know how I can tell? Because you - in fact none of you, on this entire subreddit - have any proof of anything, especially &quot;government shills.&quot; You&#39;re so fucking sure he&#39;s a plant? Get me some proof. Show me his orders. Which government agency pays him? Let&#39;s see his pay stubs. I assume the CIA or whatever doesn&#39;t pay these people directly, correct? What&#39;s the name of the shell corporation? What about phone records? Emails? Memos? Photos of people in dark shady rooms planning this shit? Who are they? Where do they meet? Do you have names? Dates? Meetings usually have notes, minutes, plans, and so on, any proof of any of these? Who are the key people involved? The shills need equipment, correct? Computers? Laptops? Smartphones? How many people are involved? How many &quot;shills&quot; are there? Ten? Twenty? One Hundred? Do you have any proof anywhere that any of this is actually happening? </p>

<p>No, you don&#39;t have any proof, and you know why? <strong>BECAUSE IT DOESN&#39;T FUCKING EXIST.</strong> You are not a &quot;freedom fighter,&quot; nor are you a revolutionary, or even an activist. You sit around with a bunch of other nincompoops and speculate about shit on the internet. So don&#39;t try to pretend you know what you&#39;re talking about, because you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>&quot;counscious life news,&quot; huh? Yeah that&#39;s some trustworthy shit right there. Of course it&#39;s a story written by an &quot;anonymous&quot; insider - no actual names or proof of any kind, all with a very pronounced anti-Israel slant. Nothing about the flat Earth.</p>

<p>So a shill accidentally posted his own instructions? Wouldn&#39;t the guy just like, delete the thread immediately afterward? I&#39;m supposed to believe this, huh? Nothing about the Flat earth here either.</p>

<p>This one details dirty tricks against activists. The closest thing to proof here is the claim that someone in the Obama administration wrote a paper proposing teams infiltrate online groups (i.e. terrorists &amp; extremest groups.) No mention of the Flat Earth is made. </p>

<p>Apparently you only read the headline, else you&#39;d know this was for propoganda <em>overseas.</em> It is still illegal for the US government to produce propaganda for domestic consumption</p>

<p>Yes, we are aware that Russia was caught trying to influence online opinion. This in no way implicates our government, nor does it prove in any way that this stupid fucking idiot posting flat earth shit was paid by the Jews to make you look stupid. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra%5B9%5D">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra[9]</a></p>

<p>MKUltra happened 60 years ago, and has nothing to do with paying people to post lies on the internet.</p>

<p>In conclusion, you have fallen prey to the most common mistake that conspiracy theories make: <strong>YOU DRAW CONCLUSIONS FROM INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.</strong> None of the shit you posted actually supports your claim, nor does it offer any proof of any kind. Kindly remove your head from your ass and smell the bullshit.</p>

<p>It did in fact legalize domestic propaganda, you&#39;re wrong.</p>

<p>And if you really think MK Ultra ended when they say it did, you also probably think 19 arabs with box cutters pulled off 9/11.</p>

<p>I sure hope your other arguments are a little stronger then those, cause you&#39;re just flat out wrong if you think Obama didn&#39;t sign an NDAA to legalize domestic propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, there are small conspiracies every day. People lie. It&#39;s just stupidity to think that they don&#39;t occur on a larger scale, a mathematical impossibility. Now, we definitely look way to hard at things in this sub, and not everything is a conspiracy, but to say that there are no conspiracies at all is naive. Additionally, I would not be surprised at all if governments and other special interests across the world do pay people to spread conspiracy, especially the most ridiculous of them, to detract from the standing of anything far enough from normal sheep beliefs. I have no real evidence of this, and I&#39;m not a greek philosopher in my armchair so I won&#39;t say anything with conviction beyond the fact that it&#39;s possible and seems like one of the more likely conspiracies I&#39;ve seen in this sub. </p>

<p>Edit, to clarify I&#39;m talking in general, I in no way believe that this flatearther dumbass is a shill, but that&#39;s mainly because I think a pro shill would be a little better at their job. </p>

It is actually pretty smart to be able to hold an idea in your mind without believing it like Aristotle taught. I reacted vehemently to it at first but all the evidence points to flat. The shills I know attack ad hominem hmmmm....</p>

<p>Ah, it&#39;s actually cointelpro? So like, the CIA in 1956 used a time machine to travel forward to 2016 and post flat Earth Bullshit? And this is like what, going to help them win Vietnam, or something?</p>

<p>Do you have any actual proof this guy, or anyone else who posts baloney about the flat Earth, is actually a shill? Do you have copies of their orders? Copies of emails? Memos? Secret plans? Recorded phone calls? Secret data files? Any kind of evidence at all? Or, do you think it more likely that there are just people out there who believe in stupid things? </p>

<p>There is no conspiracy, you morons.</p>
