<p>DNA Reports:</p>

<p>The report has the following “AGENCY CASE#:”:
<strong>CFS12-00 704 597 (WDMCS)</strong>
<strong>CFS12-00 711 626 (WDMCS)</strong>
<strong>CFS12-00  705 354 (EDMCS)</strong>
<strong>12-17618 (OCME)</strong>
<strong>12-17626 (OCME)</strong></p>

<p>Laboratory Case #: ID12-002105</p>

<p>Supplemental DNA Reports, swab various areas of the murder weapon found at the Lanza home. 22cal. rifle. Other items swabbed include an envelope and adhesive side of the stamp, an XMAS card and the interior and exterior door handles of the car found at the crime scene. </p>

<p>Swabs compared to ‘known’ blood of Nancy Lanza and a liver swab from a person allegedly being Adam Lanza. Both Adam and Nancy Lanza are eliminated as contributors to the DNA found from trigger of rifle, pistol grip of rifle and shoulder stock of rifle.</p>

<p>Supposed DNA mixture of Adam Lanza’s DNA on Forearm of rifle. How could there be more than one persons DNA found at the crime scene, when according to the official report Adam Lanza acted alone?</p>

<p>January 7th 2013: A hit was obtained with the convicted offender DNA profile from the New York state police investigation center on the letter intended for the young kids of Sandy Hook Elementary school.</p>

<p>Envelope was said to be sent from Peter Lanza. No DNA match from any of the Lanza’s, only DNA match of unknown convicted felon, who supposedly licked the envelope shut. </p>

<p><strong>Amended supplemental DNA Report Six</strong> </p>

<p>Report include all weapons and magazines Lanza allegedly carried in the school. Lauren Rousseau&#39;s DNA found on pistol grip of rifle, shoulder stock of rifle, feed area inside of mag, Glock magazine, 9mm magazine, P-mag magazine, and 13 cartridges. Of the 27 results found in this report all but three are mixtures. The only unredacted DNA source that is listed alone is that of principle Dawn Hochsprung. Result #18. The results are consistent with D. Hochsprung (Item 01 02) being the source profile from Item #59-S1 (swabbing - 10mm Auto cartridge). Adam Lanza’s DNA was eliminated as a contributor to 59-S1. He was also eliminated as a contributor to DNA found on stock area and forearm of shotgun as well as the shotgun shells and various magazines/cartridges. </p>

<p>The shotgun was found in the trunk of the Honda Civic. The Honda Civics interior and exterior door handles were swabbed but once again Lanza’s DNA was not found.  </p>

<p>It is understandable that body fluids of victims could come in to contact with the weapons carried by the murderer. However, it stretches credibility when that same DNA is found on bullets inside of a loaded magazine. </p>

<p>investigation into the truth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t you mean &quot;investigation&quot;??? You don&#39;t get to decide it&#39;s &quot;truth&quot; WHILE you are investigating. You do see that, don&#39;t you? You&#39;ve already decided you are &quot;right&quot; so your &quot;investigation&quot; is tainted. </p>

<p>Sorry for pointing out the obvious. You can&#39;t &quot;investigate&quot; when you have already decided. You are just looking for justification for your bias, not &quot;investigating.&quot;</p>

<p>Downvote away...</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m willing to bet part of your &quot;investigation&quot; is deciding all the parents of dead children are lying, all the birth and death certificates are fake, all the open casket funerals are fake, all the townspeople are in on it, but you have NO evidence to back any of those claims.</p>

<p>So quit saying &quot;investigation.&quot; Say what it really is. You want to believe it is fake and you will ignore any evidence to the contrary. NOT how &quot;investigations&quot; work, unless you are a corrupt police department.</p>

<p>Its sounds like to me someone is a little cranky over the fact that anyone is investigating the underpinnings of Sandy Hook at all. And the truth will be found. The truth outweighs a lie every time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;How could there be more than one persons DNA found at the crime scene, when according to the official report Adam Lanza acted alone?&quot;</p>

<p>Because the crime scene involved multiple victims...</p>

<p>Okay, DNA is not like you think it is. This isn&#39;t CSI. It doesn&#39;t always show up, it isn&#39;t where you think it is always think it is.</p>

<p>FYI if you get blood in a magazine bullets will get blood on them. Thank you for your non-expert analysis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m so sick of all the Sandy Hook bullshit. You idiots are why no one ever takes actual conspiracy theories seriously. Here&#39;s a question: Why? If you think there&#39;s a conspiracy, and this whole town and all of these parents are actors, why? What&#39;s been accomplished? </p>

<p>It&#39;s absurd to think an element in the government would try to stage a mass shooting event in a country where that type of event has practically become a weekly occurrence. When exactly do you think they&#39;re coming for your guns? It&#39;s been 3 years and there has been exactly zero significant new gun legislation, and there have been hundreds of additional shootings. You have become a perfect caricature of tin-foil hat wearing conspiracy theorists. </p>

<p>I suggest you watch this video:    </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaR1YBR5g6U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaR1YBR5g6U</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s not some &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; video, although it is definitely about conspiracy.  It is a mainstream CDC documentary about the propaganda used in the first Gulf War - plrimarily the &quot;babies in incubators&quot; story, which was entirely fabricated, including using actors that appeared before congress.  </p>

<p>The problem with your viewpoint is that the way we are governed is through use of public relations techniques (Public Relations means propaganda, look up Edward Bernays who developed it).  There is always a &quot;pretext&quot; involved - &quot;babies in incubators&quot; or &quot;WMD in Iraq&quot; - the government knows these things are bullshit.  They actually spend an enormous amount of time and money coming up with ways of selling to the public what they want to do, albeit for entirely different reasons than what the public is told.   </p>

<p>So given those facts who is naive?  The person that questions what he sees on TV, or the person that doesn&#39;t?   </p>

<p>Uh, just look at the face... They&#39;re clearly the same person. If you can&#39;t see that you&#39;re either blind, stupid, or a shill. I&#39;m going to go with stupid, but who knows.</p>

<p>Ad-hominem, like I said, that&#39;s all you have to offer. A screenshot of a single cherrypicked section of a video and ad-hominem about being crazy. Hahaha. Too predictable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wasn&#39;t a different edit, you just have no idea what you&#39;re doing on Reddit. It&#39;s quite simple to use, so it&#39;s embarrassing that this is the case.</p>

<p>Not seeing what&#39;s &quot;hysterical&quot; about a single one of those screenshots? You can&#39;t just go and take random screenshots and claim they&#39;re &quot;hysterical&quot;, you need to explain why. Otherwise you&#39;re just full of shit. I mean, the first one is actually a great example of them being the exact same person... If you can&#39;t see that you are truly really stupid. I will admit the first one you posted of Adam Lanza (before your terrible list of screenshots) was slightly amusing (only due to the &quot;vertical line&quot; comment), but nothing else in that video was even remotely questionable. So I&#39;ll wait for a breakdown of your screenshots, until then, you have nothing to offer.</p>

<p>Also your last paragraph made little sense. You&#39;re not very bright. Keep up please.</p>

<p>A big part of your problem is that you think you&#39;re smart. It&#39;s actually made you quiet stupid, because your own delusion has clouded your judgement and given you the inability to see how dumb you really are. As a result, you&#39;ve been given no way to correct yourself. So I&#39;m letting you know, you&#39;re not smart. You&#39;re quite stupid. You should work on that. An excellent first step would be to learn how to provide evidence of your claims, a second step would be to learn how to assess evidence. Neither of which you are even remotely good at.</p>
