       It started as a frugal effort to save some pennies every month in order to afford healthier food. As the years went by, I noticed a better sense of stability and a reduction in my anxiety. For a long time I wondered if it was the lack of television, the better quality food, or a combination of the two that resulted in a happier, more clearly thinking me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, this morning I ate my breakfast in the break room at work. They had ABC news playing on the tv and they were discussing politics, LA terrorism training, the disgraced pharmaceutical CEO, and the best way to save money while continuing an endless consumer splurge while holiday shopping. I felt my stomach tie into a knot and could hear those faint whispers of anxiety in the back of my skull as the boob tube spewed a ceaseless stream of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen posts on this forum about the import of the r/conspiracy mission to help people break free and think for themselves, but ultimately the pursuit of becoming a happier and more fulfilled individual is the goal. I'm no expert on much of anything, but I would still like to offer my suggestion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you haven't already, turn off the television. Eat better quality food and get some exercise to blow off steam and hamper your anxieties. Browsing this forum can help to peel back the curtain that has been drawn, but it's up to individuals to think for themselves clearly and sensibly to understand what is concealed behind it. That's all I'll suggest, and please understand I'm not trying to intrude on anybody's lifestyle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks to those of you who discover and draw attention to those things others want hidden, and thank you for your time reading this off-topic comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I'm enthused by the positive responses from this post and feel compelled to add two more cents to my rationale on killing the tv.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hold what are admittedly ideal values and notions, and I won't lay them down here because my values are not what's important; the important takeaway from this is to develop your own conceptions of a fulfilling existence. Your purpose as a human being is to be happy, to put that down as possibly as possible. When you're happy, you think clearly, are physically healthy, hold positive values, and have no concept of hatred, bigotry, and existential sickness. Life becomes good, because you practice good and are consciously grateful for the good you experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tv fosters an anxiety about how pure your pours are, newest emission heavy vehicles, and all the inane chatter you can handle to keep you concerned about celebrities, but don't worry, they will appease you by featuring shows like The Chew. In other words, "Feel anxious, eat to feel better, and listen to these fucking hens cluck you into obviousness."

       I've noticed an improvement in my attitude since cutting cable and relying only on Netflix and the occasional DVD series. I do like the video entertainment once in a while, but TV as a whole is and apparently always has been, a wasteland.

       The Telescreen probably wasn't created for this particular reason, but like most any other medium meant to allow for a greater spread of ideas/content, it has been coopted by Big X to
       <em>
        sell you products and ideas
       </em>
       , and really nothing else at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like OP I haven't had cable for years, and through a Roku box can carefully control what little Jim sees and we spend a fraction of the time under the spell of the device than most parents and kids our age.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the results are mind boggling.

       Modern TV is a fucking joke.  There are still some good shows out there, but it's mostly just
       <del>
        news
       </del>
       propaganda, reality shows, and cringeworthy sitcoms with batshit retarded commercials in between.  It is turning America into a nation of brain-dead zombies obsessed with celebrity gossip and political correctness, and I'm glad I didn't end up being brainwashed like them.

       Naw, just get long HDMI cable and a DVD to HDMI adapter and watch YouTube, Netflix and other things on that amazing screen. It's the contrived programming that does the damage. When one uses the Internet instead, one can more easily avoid undesirable messages entering their minds. A few dozen or hundred channels turns into a search engine prompting your desires and imagination.

       Like OP, I haven't watched television since about 2009.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the rare occasion that I do find myself in front of "the thing", such as when visiting family or friends, or sitting in a waiting room, etc, I am mesmerized, aghast at the idiotic buffoonery and blatant psychological and social manipulation that streams from the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last year I sat in a dentist chair, and they "kindly" put a screen IN MY FACE to "entertain" me while I waited for the anesthetic to kick in so the doc could do his thing. Some daytime talk show was playing, and I was shocked. It was quite literally stupefying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing television now is like walking back into a bathroom after taking a steaming, stinking DUMP a few minutes earlier: You don't realize just how bad it stinks until you get away for a while, and are re-exposed to the assault on your senses.

       No TV 3 years going here. I no longer have Netflix. Trying to cut out vids all together. Easier said than done. But I am very careful about what I watch and listen to now.

       We are what we consume. What we put in our mouths, our eyes, our ears. It all shapes who we are. What are we consuming? Is it good for us?
      </p>
      <p>
       Without even getting into the darker side of how media is being used to manipulate the masses. Think about this. You know little to nothing about the people who create the content you are consuming. Both food and media. You might know something about the actors, but they are not the one's creating the content. It's the writers and producers who create the media. And what do you know of their values, beliefs, agendas?

       I've been researching the nature versus nurture scientific debate with a critical eye keeping your last sentence close to heart.  I'm of the opinion there is a strong reason for TPTB to emphasize the nature argument, since they don't want the citizens to think "You are what you consume" (and think!)  Watch out for this folks.  From a psychological standpoint, genetics is hard pressed on finding correlations which haven't yet been established passed just that (correlations)

       Agreed. I Work for a news broadcaster. All our journalist's have the corporates agenda. They report shit and the real news is buried.

       As an aside, I watch tv series, movies, documentaries etc. but don't have cable or  satellite; I stream everything and if it is not there I go without.  Avoid the news at work.

       I'm no longer being fed the news-of-the-day. When all of the mainstream news outlets are saying, "Look over here!" I'll be looking the other way to see what's going on behind the curtain.

       My congressman does this too. Every time he votes for a controversial bill such the TPP and CISPA he sends out an email announcing his stance on the 2nd Amendment or ISIS or San Bernardino or whatever or whatever. He never brags about the bullshit he votes for.

       Almost 7 years tv-free.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tv destroys your ability to think.  It tells people what to believe, and people believe what they are told to believe, without putting any conscious effort into whether it is true or not.  There isn't any discussion, no examination---just one-way information.  And the zombified population just nods along in agreement, never questioning.

       I was in a Chinese food restaurant with my brother and his GF.  We were the only customers.  There were 3 TV's on tuned into some useless main stream news network.  I politely asked if they could turn it off since my brother's eyes seemed to continually been entranced by 1 of the 2 TV's.
      </p>
      <p>
       The waiter complied and turned it off, but within 5 minutes he turned it back on.  I gave up.   THEY LIVE

       I'm the same way. I hate the TV being on... especially when nobody is watching and it just drones on and on and on.

       "Well now you see what you wanna be.
Just have your party on TV.
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars where the TV's on.

       all i use it for is reposting the news that i know those people glaze over, most ignore it, but every time i take a break for more than a week i have 1 or 2  people messaging me asking why i've stopped. that alone to me makes it worth while. if i can make one person question the bullshit then its worth it.

       My family dropped our cable subscription a few months ago. Mostly I don't even notice because I spend more time online than watching TV anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I've noticed is that most of what's on TV is shit. It's also a funny way to live. You just lay back and watch what they decide to provide you. Whereas the on internet (eg. reddit, youtube etc.) you actively pick and choose want you want to look at and how long you want to spend on each thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lately I've been watching sci-fi shorts on youtube. There's a striking difference between these short movies and what's on TV. For one thing, there's a lot more variety. The youtube videos also seem to have more
       <em>
        life
       </em>
       in them. They have a much higher level of pure creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also  nice to have some actual variety for a change. Fucking TV. I can flip through 40 or 50 channels and it's the same old thing. Spend 10 or 15 minutes searching online and I can line up 3 hours worth of entertainment I've never seen before.
      </p>
      <p>
       tldr; TV is kind of dull, repetitive and passive. Internet is a more interesting, varied and active experience

       It's the decentralization of the programming that makes all the difference. Fools could always embrace fiction as fact, since before vacuum tube packed, building sized computers were the fad.
      </p>
      <p>
       To program someone you have to have some control over what they receive as input, because deception requires an absence of believable contradictory information. The Internet offers a disciplined mind the opportunity to find such information and immunize itself against programming by unscrupulous beings.

       Ah I see. Still as bad as each other but more of an ability to be able to control what you watch/are fed online?
      </p>
      <p>
       Still doesn't detract from the fact that misinformation and fearmongering is rife on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, no media is 'bad' it's the individual's ability to be able to form rational thoughts that could be.

       I haven't owned a tv in 6 years. Since then, I've gotten sober, started a business, went from single to happily married, have 2 dogs. It's not all due to no tv, but one major thing has changed - I ask more questions instead of just being fed "information". When things don't add up, I  think about it and research it instead if being slammed from one "story" to the next. I'm now responsible for my own thought process instead of being one of two political sides. I ask questions and find answers, not just opinions masked as news to supplicate my ego, keeping me a loyal follower of the hive mind.

       Television programming is overwhelmingly designed to make you value "money".  Usually this isn't explicit, but the economic system is presented as just another fact of life, it's just a normal thing, like the air you breath.  At other times, "money" is presented as the best thing ever, to be lusted after and one the thing you should do anything for, even if your actions are immoral.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say "money" in quotes because the cultural programming is really getting you to desire "Federal Reserve Notes", which are nothing more than monopoly money.  But because economics is the actual religion that most people follow, it requires massive faith to get millions to believe it will be their savior.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more people that believe in Federal Reserve Notes, the more valuable they are, and therefore the people who get to create them on a whim are at the top of the power pyramid.

       One day those last three words may seem many times more profound for reasons most people are not currently aware. Suffice to say that such a being may very well exist and use tools like television through hierarchies of mind slaves to propagate his empire of, well, what is those three words.

       I cut the cord about 3 years ago.  Realized I was paying over $100 to comcast to fuck my face constantly with loud obnoxious commercials.   If I pay for satellite radio so I don't have listen ads, then why pay over $100 for the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would probably go back if I could get cable TV with 100% no ads, but that is silly talk.

       yeah, I like Netflix for that reason.  Once I figured out I could find and watch pretty much any of my favorite cable tv shows streaming online that was it for me.

       I just have my laptop plugged into my HDTV via HDMI cable.  Works great!  :-)

       I stopped watching normal TV about 2007 regularly and I can't even recall when I've last switched to a TV channel. I still use my TV for streaming/dvd/bluray movies/tvshows, NBA League Pass and games though.
      </p>

       When I see the news running at my mom's place the shallowness and loudness are just plain obnoxious. All the straight lies, spin and propaganda makes me literally sick listening to now. The genie is out of the bottle for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't say it made me a different person but not watching TV for long periods definitely changed my perception.

       No TV for years either. The simple act of removing the TV can literally free your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just wanted to add that that if you want to free your body as well, remove soda and soft drinks from your life. In my experience, I found that removing soda from my routine broke the snack food/fast food cycle. For some reason, the hyper-sweetness in the soda makes you crave the saltiness and fattiness in junk foods. It takes some time getting used to after possible decades of indoctrination, but you'll end up on the flip side much like turning off the TV liberates your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatives drinks are the old standbys - coffee, tea, water. But be careful about sweetened coffees, teas, and juices...those are just soft drinks in disguise. Ultimately, I guess what I'm saying is to remove your dependence on high doses of sugar. It enslaves your brain and body just as TV enslaves your mind.

       We did the same thing about 4 years ago OP, never looked back.  TV used to be on all the time growing up.  It's so obviously bad for the human psyche, so over-saturated with advertisements... so loud and filled with lies.  It's no wonder to me there is no concerted effort to get people to tune out (for health reasons)-- that would be bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm old enough to remember a time when the TV actually educated you at times.  Now, it seems to be a competition of what station can play the dumbest program.  There's pawn shop shows, pig wrangling, moonshine makers... and those are the "learning" channels.
      </p>
      <p>
       We refuse to fill our heads with that crap any longer, and then pay for the privilege!  It's like a trough of garbage that pigs unknowingly eat up.  I have no idea why people still watch TV, I refuse to subject myself to it any longer.  At the odd times I see it in a public place, I really notice how loud and obnoxious the ads are, and how obvious the brain washing and manipulation is.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: IMO, CNN is so obviously used to manipulate the public.  Others also, but just randomly sample CNN online, and wow...  Murrow would weep.

       I noticed the reverse effect too. After not having a TV for years I spent a few weeks of my vacation at a relative's houses watching a lot of TV during that time. I noticed afterwards that I would have anxiety attacks and at first wondered where they were coming from.

       That and get as much sleep as possible.  We think better and thus perform better here and in person when we are rested.

       If you have been a long time gamer, like me, that can be one of the biggest hurdles.  Getting away from the binge and resting up properly!

       You're right about the reduction in what seems needless anxiety, but....
      </p>
      <p>
       When I go into the bakery near my office where the owner is a Fox addict, or see the "news" on friends' televisions, sometimes the thought nags at me: If I and others were more aware of all this horseshit, would our ongoing dismay serve to diminish it any?
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose it boils down to this:  Do we owe it to our society to get stressed out when it goes full-tilt stupid on us?

       Based on the fact that the majority of the population is under the TV mindfuckery trick.
We should think about ways to get useful, real information on to the TV, instead of just hiding from it.  Starting up a new TV channel or even a TV station that can transmit shows without any interference from the manipulators.
      </p>
      <p>
       TV broadcasting is the most powerful tool in human history for conveying information.

       I, too, cut the cable many years ago for a number of reasons. For one, if you have any technological aptitude, it just makes sense. You can download HD or stream just about anything you'd like to watch. No commercials, no bullshit, hand-picked by you, free of charge.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was certainly liberating cutting TV out of the mix. I'll still watch the occasional series/doc/sports game, but I really have a hard time holding interest/justifying the time I'm wasting sitting in front of a TV screen anymore. I don't know how you could possibly sit in front of the screen all day and feel fulfilled, but I know the avg. American turns the tube on right when they get home from work and watch a bunch of mindless shit up until they go to bed. It's really quite a miserable way to live your life imo, but to each their own.

       Here's another fun exercise... Head over to the wallymart and buy yourself a 20 dollar tv antenna.  In my area it'll get you about 3 channels.  I get 2 abc affiliates and some crazy police state channel called the Justice Network.  Anyway... The NWO programming is heavy as shit on the channels you get with a free antenna... It's hilarious to watch as an awake person.

       "If you haven't already, turn off the television. Eat better quality food and get some exercise to blow off steam and hamper your anxieties."  So simple, but so right.  I have been decreasing my TV intake gradually for years, and I never watch or listen to an ad if I can help it (the mute button is your friend if you must watch cable).  And simply eating "real" food and being more active, and recently doing some of Wim Hof's awesome breathing exercises that anyone can do (if you have three hours to spare, check this out:
       <a href="http://podcasts.joerogan.net/podcasts/wim-hof">

       ), have started me on a path towards health and mastery over my own mind again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recently graduated from a major film school.  I also took classes at the journalism school there, which was far more enlightening intellectually.  Seeing the inner workings of these institutions has helped me understand how pernicious the media really can be.  Far from everyone involved in producing this stuff is aware of the wicked effects — compartmentalization.  Even the majority of the young journalism students themselves were brainwashed drones tunnel-visioned on finding a stable career out of school.  There were a minority of true questioners who gave me some small hope, but the struggle to keep some semblance of true journalism alive was palpable and disturbing.  Since then I have been trying to figure out how to make use of my skills in an actually positive way despite the sea of fuckery that is most media.  To fight propaganda with "good" propaganda, pointing out all these awful truths, perhaps?  But it is a very tricky thing to do this in an impactful way outside of the establishment, and is VERY difficult to do ANYTHING within the establishment without losing one's soul.

       One of my favorite quotes: 
"If you make people think they're thinking, they'll love you; but if you really make them think, they'll hate you." - Don Marquis
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I want the people to hate me, because I want them to actually think.

       I lived in Germany for three years as a kid, hence, no TV.  Yogi Bear in German sucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure if that helped me avoid the leash of big media, but I've only ever had TV in the house when I had kids.  The last one was only allowed to watch public television, which she thanks us for now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that we have choice, with the Internet, I expect big media will shrivel up like an orange from last year's Christmas stocking.

       Awesome post.  Thank for for sharing that.  I'm going to send to a friend of mine who grew up without TV.  I myself am a netflix / amazon junkie but at least I'm TV news and commercial free now and those changes alone, similarly caused a lot of anger / anxiety to go away.

       I suspect most people in here dissing tv will still watch television series on dvd/download, and almost all will still watch films. So long as you understand that you are watching something designed to program you, and keep this in the back of your mind at all times, I do not think there is too much harm in watching the occasional film/series. Some films are masterpieces of truthtelling, such as 'They Live' and 'Dark City'.

       You ever watch CNN for longer than, say, 20 hours in one day? I gotta cut that out. Watch CNN. It’s the most depressing thing you’ll ever see, man. “WAR, FAMINE, DEATH, AIDS, HOMELESS, RECESSION, DEPRESSION, WAR, FAMINE, DEATH, AIDS.” Over and over again. Then you look out your window - (crickets chirping) - where’s all this shit going on, man? Ted Turner is making this shit up. Jane Fonda won’t sleep with him, he runs to a typewriter: “By 1992 we will all die of AIDS. Read that on the air. I don’t get laid, nobody gets laid.” - bill hicks

       I agree, stop watching television. As long as you are addicted to that glowing agent of propaganda, you mind is going to find it almost impossible to have independent thoughts. The first and most important step towards freedom from the matrix is to stop watching television.

       My congressman does this too. Every time he votes for a controversial bill such the TPP and CISPA he sends out an email announcing his stance on the 2nd Amendment or ISIS or San Bernardino or whatever or whatever. He never brags about the bullshit he votes for.

       I used to call him out on it but it's like beating my head against the wall. I've pretty much given up.

       yeah, I like Netflix for that reason.  Once I figured out I could find and watch pretty much any of my favorite cable tv shows streaming online that was it for me.

       I just have my laptop plugged into my HDTV via HDMI cable.  Works great!  :-)
