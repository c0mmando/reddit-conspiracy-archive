Since that short time alone, I can already recognize the painfully obvious &quot;shills,&quot; or people that purposely derail conversations and/or submit false information and opinions to discredit whatever evidence is being shown. It puts me in a fiery rage, even though it might just be a small inconvenience. Is it just a small inconvenience? I see members here talk about the glory days of this site, before it was taken over by paid hitmen, and it makes me wonder what sort of affect this infiltration of shills has on the general public&#39;s (of this sub) opinion. How damaging are they, if at all? I realize I might be asking for immeasurable data..... </p>

The badness of it is up for interpretation but I think it&#39;s the worst thing to ever happen in written  history. The scope is mind boggling. There are ways to over load their workers destroy their convictions maybe even show some the light. This will take a huge effort on the part of those who are level headed and have good intentions to speak up and have their voice heard. If you lurk hear and like what your seeing participation is key to keeping this sub Reddit alive. We can drown out their bullshit!</p>

I believe we have allowed the language we use to become twisted ina way that doesn&#39;t allow clear communication about our conclusions. Usually when I see name calling on the interweb I internally shut down and withdraw from the conversation. With love. If ya get called a shill you have raised someone&#39;s hackles, that has an agenda. Read carefully what it is they say and don&#39;t say. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you talking about this site/sub specifically, or in general? I mean, I guess I know the answer...it happens outside of the confines of the internet, I know. So then, if most here (so far) agree that the presence of shills is pretty damaging and effective(?), what kind of role does this small scale trolling play in the larger picture? I&#39;m asking because when I see it, it makes me pretty pissed, but others seem to simply call these people out and move on, or ignore them and move on. Which makes it seem like their role is kind of insignificant, and doesn&#39;t warrant a ton of attention. Yet here I am lurking, mostly, and am completely blown away by the gall of some of the posters/comments. I also must admit, though, I am still not very savvy on this site, and don&#39;t know exactly how upvotes and downvotes work, so I might not be analyzing everything correctly. Sooooo I hope I&#39;m not making a big deal about nothing, when there are still bigger fish to fry....

<p>Control the narrative and you control everything. If you’re the one who dictates what is right and wrong to talk about, you’ve already won, even if your ideology isn’t the winner in any given debate.</p>

<p>Hegelian dialectic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am still not very savvy on this site, and don’t know exactly how upvotes and downvotes work</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The subreddits (styled as <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, <a href="/r/space">/r/space</a>, etc.) are run by moderators who have say over what is and isn’t posted or commented there. Meaning they’ll delete comments and submissions at their own will. Above that are the Reddit owners, who do their own dictation and can ban or shadowban accounts (meaning you can see your posts, but no one else can; when you log out, they’re invisible).</p>

<p>There is no free speech here. Anything that goes against the owners’ narrative is deleted. In some cases stronger than this, anything that goes against the subreddit moderators’ views is deleted, as they have control over individual subreddits.</p>

<p>I think scoring itself can even affect your ability to post. Too many negatives and you’re forced to go 9 minutes between posting. But “too many negatives” can even mean “you posted the truth and either a bunch of idiots or a bunch of bots/paid shills didn’t like it, so you were voted into SILENCE by proxy”.</p>

<p>I thought there&#39;d would have been more sublety to their ruses.  The guy was obviously trying to bait me into a rant using a script in one of the steal beam threads.</p>

<p>Unfortunately people with hot tempers will be drawn in and write something they might not have said otherwise.</p>

<ul>
<li>I find it absolutely astonishing that there are disinformation agents at all.  I don&#39;t think I have a price to be paid that would allow me to do it.  How do those fuckers sleep?<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>How damaging?  Someone here wrote a thread about how those that post first to popular threads can direct the narrative.  This is true about everything.  If someone is the first voice about something, it almost has to be addressed in context of what they said.  I hadn&#39;t realized that until then.  That&#39;s pretty big.</p>
