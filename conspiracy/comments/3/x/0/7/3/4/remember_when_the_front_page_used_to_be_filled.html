The government knew it had to silence us (Reddit).. And I think they are won in this case.. Reddit is no longer what it used to be.. No more discussions about civil liberties or privacy.. Nope, I see more headlines on the front page about &quot;ISIS&quot; then i do about our own government legalizing mass spying in front of our eyes right in the middle of holidays before the end of the year.. How convenient.. It&#39;s sad to see Reddit go this way.. I really thought we had the virtual voice to change how things were ran but they destroyed that..</p>

<p>We&#39;re allowed to post whatever articles here, but try post something like that on worldnews and see what happens. Either it gets removed for some weak reason or it gets downvoted into oblivion. Technically this isn&#39;t censorship, but it&#39;s exactly the same effect... people are kept from seeing &quot;inconvenient information&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The front page used to be majority politics long before that.  There were so many pro-Ron Paul posts in the lead-up to his &#39;08 campaign that even supporters found it over the top and there was eventually a huge cookie cutter mentality backlash; essentially &quot;Ron Paul can&#39;t melt steel girders&quot;.  Ridicule and ad hominem attacks with no valid arguments presented.</p>

<p>While acrimony, mod malpractice and corporate influence have played a role, there is a more important, less sinister trend.  <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/reddit-ngram/?keyword=congress.bill.song.star%20wars&amp;amp;start=20071015&amp;amp;end=20150831&amp;amp;smoothing=10">Observe</a>.  Look particularly at &quot;Star Wars&quot; relative to &quot;Congress&quot;.</p>

<p>The dethroning of the major news oriented subs is essentially based on the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>mod malfeasance turning people off of censored subs because of politicized deletions and bans.</p></li>
<li><p>Digg died and Reddit was flooded with less politically active users from there.</p></li>
<li><p>Reddit has gotten <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Pew-Reddit-Usage-by-Age-Gender-July2013.png">younger</a>.  I remember an informal survey in the original /r maybe 7 years ago that showed a median age in the mid-30&#39;s.</p></li>
<li><p>As Reddit grew more popular it attracted A) corporate and government shills and B) subs attracted extremist groups who actively distort the dialogue through vote brigading or trying to get mod positions.  /worldnews is worse than useless for anything even distantly, tangentially, barely a little related to Israel because of rabid Zionists who use programs like Megaphone.  Their views do not reflect the majority of subscribers but they reflect the majority of posts and votes.  Likewise in this sub.  A couple months ago a I saw a post titled essentially &quot;Say what you want about him but this guy was way ahead of his time&quot;.  It was a subtitled Hitler speech on the evils of internationals Jews to which someone had added text calling for all non-Jews to rise up against our Jewish masters and it ended with #hitlerwasright.  It had 66% approval.  This was the most flagrant, but hardly the only such case.  We are not immune to extremist infiltration any more than we are to misdirection and intentional stupidity by association (flat earth, nukes aren&#39;t real etc.).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Including lurking I&#39;ve been here well over 8 years and that&#39;s my 2 cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably partly because of the upcoming election.  4+ years ago there was a lot more discussion of policy.  Now usually the little politics that is posted is just regurgitated talking points, probably because the comment boards have become so uncivil and filled with childish attacks rather than discussion.  But if you want an uptick in regurgitating political talking points (pretty big on HuffPo boards I&#39;d imagine), there&#39;s nothing better than a presidential election.  All they are is talking points and sound bytes nowadays.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you used to be able to post about real stuff and hit the front page. Now all the real news and info is confined to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. So anytime anyone shares a link from here with real news, it has the word &quot;conspiracy&quot; in it, and then people go &quot;I&#39;m not a conspiracy theorist, this junk is garbage&quot; and then ignore it. </p>

<p>I wish the stuff that hits the top of this sub every day could hit the main page every day, because that&#39;s where it really belongs. But they&#39;ve made it very difficult to accomplish, by tightening the major subreddit rules and putting in mods that are friendly to their interests. So the only place  you can post about  a lot of things are here, which marginalizes the conversation under this &quot;conspiracy&quot; label when it should just be &quot;world news&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://voat.co/">voat.co</a> is very legit for now. don&#39;t expect it to be like reddit; it is uncensored and mod-logged so those that get offended easily will be offended.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes people just get tired. Tired of the same stupid bullshit as always. How many fucking times have we had to raise a ruckus over that whole PIPA or whatever the republicans are trying to rebrand this shit as nowadays. It&#39;s boring, it&#39;s played out. Inevitably, when these assholes crawl out of their pus filled orifices long enough to do a job they&#39;ve been taught to do, Reddit, along with the rest of the internet will breathe a heavy sigh before shambling up and croaking in protest. </p>
