       What I hate is that everyone thinks they can disprove the jet fuel/steel beams argument by claiming that the jet fuel was hot enough to weaken the buildings structural integrity. The problem with this argument is that it isn't about the buildings structural integrity! It's about the

       The 'jet fuel can't melt steel beams' is a distraction. When structural steel reaches a
       <em>
        core temperature
       </em>
       of 600 F, it loses a good portion of its strength. There is no evidence of the structural steel in the Towers reaching anywhere near the core temperatures needed to
       <em>
        soften
       </em>
       , in any of the reconstructions or reports I'm aware of. In particular the trusses themselves, which were not A-36 structural steel, but rather a mix of ASTM A-242 and an ASTM A-572 equivalent (ref. NIST NCSTAR 1-3D).
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, the video shows the heating of an
       <em>
        isolated
       </em>
       steel girder to a core temperature of 1800 F.  It doesn't take into account the conductive nature of steel, in particular how in a building frame design, the interconnected girders would work to disperse the heat energy, so the steel never reaches a core temperature high enough to soften it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, NIST itself observed that none of the debris samples tested reached a core temperature beyond 250 F. There were a few areas where
       <em>
        flash surface
       </em>
       temperatures of around 600 F were reached.

       They argue that the center pillars underwent extreme torsion and therefore collapsed upon themselves... my opinion is that the same torsion that they describe would have resulted in the tipping of the top piece and therefore you would've seen a piece fall in some other direction than straight above... the only way we've ever seen a building fall into it's footprint is from demolition...

       Buddy, gravity is always pulling the building straight down. Hence, if the building is at rest, then gravity does not have the required force to pull it down.

       Lmfao. Right. Tell me how they changed the direction that gravity pulls with their advanced structural techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only, here's the thing (Homer Simpson moment), the force of gravity always pulls down with precisely the same amount of force (relative to mass). It is what is known as a universal constant. That is, it doesn't fucking change.

       But thanks for the correction. I'll be more diligent next time. Lol.

       You answered your own question. If the stress was only on one side, then the damaged section would have fallen in that direction. Not vertically downwards (until it left the rest of the building)

       OK, then it was a statement which was incongruous with your initial statement. Your initial statement was:-
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        you are incorrect... they structured the building so that the force of gravity did not pull it straight down

      <p>
       Hence, gravity always pulls down, and the stress of the plane impact had merely weakened resistance to gravity in that part of the building.

       Yes, it's a misnomer when you're talking about initiation of collapse, but many witnesses reported of molten steel afterwards... The jet fuel is burned out by then, so the popular phrase isn't the right argument to make, but still, it is evidence that cannot be explained by a gravitational collapse.

       Yes, many people did report molten steel. This can't be explained with jet fuel-ignited office fires. If you assume a fire-induced collapse hypothesis before you start your investigation, like NIST did, you're led to all sorts of fun contradictions, because a fire hypothesis (as opposed to a controlled demo hypothesis) cannot explain the many anomalies in witness reports and investigative records. So, NIST decides to ignore them, because it can't explain them. Yet, it disproves its own hypothesis by admitting that there's no evidence fires were hot enough to soften steel!
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the 'molten steel' claim is a bit tricky. I accept it, because it agrees with other evidence of high temperature events which could not be explained with office fires. The problem we have here is whether non-expert witnesses were accurately reporting what they saw. For instance, it's difficult to differentiate molten steel from molten aluminum, because those metals glow yellow-orange hot at sufficiently high temperatures. But it's difficult to believe that every witness report was mistakenly reporting molten
       <em>
        aluminum
       </em>
       (or some other metal) simply owing to the sheer volume of shredded steel debris (a fact which NIST acknowledges).
      </p>
      <p>
       The presence of molten steel is indirectly established with the 2003 RJ Lee report and others which found iron-rich microspheres in the dust. 'Debunkers' will claim these iron-rich spheres are either:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        'Iron-oxide' spheres (
        <em>
         different
        </em>
        from the iron-rich spheres in composition) which formed from microscopic iron rust flakes (which have a lower melting point due to the thermodynamic size effect) as fires progressed;
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       and/or
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        'Fly ash' which is a common part of building components.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Neither of those two explanations holds water for the presence of iron-rich spheres, which share much the same composition as the Trade Center trusses. This led Scott Creighton (who I cited in my last comment) to conclude that the microspheres were in fact
       <em>
        the trusses themselves
       </em>
       ...a byproduct of the extreme heat (7000 + F which accounts for
       <em>
        molten molybdenum
       </em>
       which melts at over 4000 o F) generated from the explosion of PETN det cord, which he argues was used to destroy the floor systems of the towers, i.e. the long trusses and metal floor pans. This also explains why no long trusses or metal floor pans (of which 46,000 and 6000 existed respectively) were found in the Towers' debris pile.
      </p>
      <p>
       NIST found other sorts of trusses in NCSTAR 1-5A I believe, but those are not long trusses. Further, they were severely warped -- not consistent with a crush hypothesis. No purely gravitational collapse would have enough energy to warp the steel to that extent while also progressing at near free fall speed. The spheres were also found by RJ Lee to have formed via surface tension
       <em>
        in space
       </em>
       , which seems to argue against a crush hypothesis.
      </p>
      <p>
       I risk rambling on, but...yes, molten steel was found...in often unexpected forms, too!
      </p>
      <p>
       I will add citations for those claims as well...I've fact checked them already, but it's important that others can, too.

       The majority of the jet fuel exploded outside the buildings in the resultant fireballs; this was especially the case in the South Tower impact. The remaining jet fuel inside the building burned off in five minutes. The office fires ignited by the jet fuel; in no reconstruction I'm aware of, are such temperatures recorded. I also refer back to my point of how the interconnected girders would disperse the heat energy away. So I don't consider an isolated steel girder -- as in the video -- to represent how the fires in the building would affect the steel.

      <p>
       Now, I believe NIST has reconstructions which
       <em>
        predict

       a range of expected steel temperatures, but that's based on data it won't release. I'll have to recheck that claim, though.

       No that's not true. Yes heat can transfer via solid objets but just because the steel was connected to something doesn't mean it was instantly able to disperse the heat being applied to it. That's nonsense. In fact, the closed environment had he opposite effect. It acted like a furnace making the fire even hotter.

      <p>
       Indeed I have justification for that claim, from the NIST and FEMA reports.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Tower planes were carrying approximately 11,000 gallons of jet fuel. FEMA estimated that 3000 - 4000 gallons could have flowed out and away into the Towers, after accounting for the fireballs and impact zone fires. NIST stated, "No evidence or analysis emerged that significantly altered the FEMA estimate," (NCSTAR 1-5F, p. 56). NIST doesn't appear to challenge this estimate, so I'll take it at face value.
      </p>
      <p>
       My emphasis is added:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If one assumes that approximately 3,000 gallons of fuel were consumed in the initial fireballs, then the remainder (
        <strong>
         i.e. 8000 gallons
        </strong>
        ) either escaped the impact floors in the manners described above or was consumed by the fire on the impact floors. If half flowed away (
        <strong>
         i.e. ~4000 gallons
        </strong>
        ), then
        <strong>
         approximately 4,000 gallons remained on the impact floors to be consumed in the fires that followed
        </strong>
        . The jet fuel in the aerosol would have burned out as fast as the flame could spread through it, igniting almost every combustible on the floors involved. Fuel that fell to the floor and did not flow out of the building would have burned as a pool or spill fire at the point where it came to rest.

      <p>
       I didn't claim the heat would disperse instantly. There was an hour for it to happen, nearly two in the North Tower. I've decided to drop this claim, though. I read a great comment on how the fires could have heated the steel to that temperature. Authoritative results which could corroborate this need to be borne out.

       Correct... the fires became self sustaining... no longer being fueled... meaning the ignition fuel (much like using an accelerant for arson) was burned away... (otherwise known as I'm not assuming... it's common vernacular...)

       I've also felt that "jet fuel can't melt steel beams" is a terrible line for the 9/11 truth movement. There are so many better angles, starting with the standdown of the air defense system that day and especially the lack of defense by the fucking Pentagon. How does a plane run right into the Pentagon, the most defended air space in the entire world- at all, but especially an hour after a terrorist attack is underway?? And, furthermore, how and why did the pilot (who failed his flight test on a Cessna) do a loop-de-loop and hit the building from the back? This is assuming that it was a plane. It's beyond bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also look at the testimony of Michael Springmann, the U.S. Visa consulate who said that he was forced to allow the terrorists into the country. And check out the research if Daniel Hopsicker, who showed that the flight schools some of the hijackers were trained at we're CIA fronts.

       I'm not entirely convinced, and, regardless, I've found that noting the holes in the official story of a plane actually penetrating D.C. Air space turns a lot more heads of people who believe the bullshit official narrative. The Pentagon has surface to air missiles, and they would have shot it down.

       I'm not sure I follow you- where did the molten metal come from? I think, actually, that Dr. Judy Wood is onto something, and directed energy weapons were used- though the buildings may have been demolished, too; both are possible (and I think likely).
      </p>
      <p>
       But what I'm saying is, I was really active in the 9/11 truth movement for a long time, and I don't find that these angles are very efficacious with the average person, in comparison to the standdown of the air defense system and the anomalies at the Pentagon. And all the forewarning of the event, and Michael Spring,AMA's testimony, and Daniel Hopsicker's research, etc.

       Those pictures are from dimly lit foundries and factories. What about direct sunlight, dude? The way the molten material remained glowing while dropping hundreds of feet is what makes some believe it's molten iron from a thermitic reaction. Considering the perspective, it would've also been hundreds of pounds of molten material.

       , filmed in even dimmer settings, doesn't show much of a glow while pouring. They also didn't pour the aluminum down hundreds of feet (hundreds of millimeters, maybe). Also, a furnace specially designed to trap heat isn't very comparable to the floors of an office. How did all the "aluminum" gather in one concentrated area of the building long enough be totally heated to 1800-1900F only to pour out of a window?

       Every simulation I've seen of the plane crashes shows them being shredded into teeny tiny bits and scattered in and around the building. Even NIST admits that pure aluminum would appear to be silverey. There's also no evidence that any airplane or office material can react with molten aluminum to make it glow like that and stay glowing while dropping hundreds of feet.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Steel – which has a melting point of 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit – may weaken and bend, but does not melt during an ordinary office fire. Yet metallurgical studies on WTC steel brought back to WPI reveal that a novel phenomenon – called a eutectic reaction – occurred at the surface, causing intergranular melting capable of turning a solid steel girder into Swiss cheese.

       <p>
        A one-inch column has been reduced to half-inch thickness. Its edges – which are curled like a paper scroll – have been thinned to almost razor sharpness. Gaping holes – some larger than a silver dollar – let light shine through a formerly solid steel flange. This Swiss cheese appearance shocked all of the fire-wise professors, who expected to see distortion and bending – but not holes.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As you can see by the chart, at temperatures from 700 to about 980 degrees Celsius, Aluminum goes through a number of color phases, starting out as a cherry red, and going through to a pale orange.  It's only at its highest temperatures, in and above 1200 degrees Celsius, that it moves past this into the pale yellow and white colors.

       I don't think you know what resistance is. Explain to me how a top portion of the towers could somehow go from a standing position and gain enough momentum and force to pummel through the bottom 60-80 floors in ~9 seconds. Fire causes slow progressive collapses. The floors below were all built to be structurally redundant, it makes absolutely no sense that the floors below would all just start turning into rubble and bursting apart because a portion at the top weakened. If anything the top portion should have fallen off to the side. This argument is also ignoring the molten steel seen coming from the buildings as well underneath the wreckage that remained for months after. The people that focus on the"jet fuel can't melt steel beams" just ignore everything else about that day. The air defense stand down. Almost identical drills happening simultaneously. Insider trading. How anyone hit the Pentagon which is and was the most defended building in the world. The claims of hearing explosions. There's way more than this argument, but people refuse to learn about it and instead just laugh.

       How did you conclude she was about to jump due to extreme heat? If you understand the picture and its implications you will realize that person traveled from probably higher up in the building, through the entire impact layer of the building. If the heat was extreme she wouldn't have been able to do this. Extreme heat to a person would be say 100 deg c. Steel doesn't even begin to weaken or lose structural strength at that temperature.

       I understand the picture but I'm not understanding your interpretation. It may have been one of the coolest areas with relatively decent access to breathable air at the time. It was clearly an act of desperation.

        If the heat was extreme she wouldn't have been able to do this. Extreme heat to a person would be say 100 deg c. Steel doesn't even begin to weaken or lose structural strength at that temperature.

       It's a gigantic building, and heat wouldn't necessarily disperse uniformly over the entire width of it. There are 911 calls where people in the buildings talk of moving to cooler parts of the building.

       Nobody is disputing this. Do you know what we don't have photos of? The dozens to potentially hundreds of people who were immediately incinerated by the impact, or who succumbed to the heat before making it to a window.

       Howso? The collapse wouldn't require a uniform high temperature throughout the square width of the building. It would only require high temperatures amongst enough support structure to weaken it. Look at the sheer amount of smoke pouring out above the impact zones, and all the people above it desperately jumping. We're talking about what was essentially a coke oven full of paper products and a giant tube of burning fuel under it. With giant holes sucking in fresh air. You couldn't devise it more insidiously.

       I don't know dude. Anything that burns needs oxygen to burn, and I can't imagine that there's that enough oxygen to immediately combust all of the jet fuel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why does the burn time matter? If the energy of jet fuel is released immediately or over time doesn't matter, the same amount of energy is released (and correspondingly transferred to the steel). The fact that it burns quickly actually makes your point less sound, because the heat of the fire and steel has less time to radiate away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing that is interesting is the kinetic energy of the plane itself is enough to melt nearly two tons of steel. If you don't believe me, look
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(energy">
        here
       </a>
       ). (Look around the 10
       <sup>
        9
       </sup>
       J section) I'm not saying all of the energy of the plane goes into heating steel, but a significant amount of it does I'm sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or it's not steel, and it's aluminum.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For a large over-ventilated jet-fuel pool fire, the heat release rate per unit area is reported to be approximately 2 MW/m²[13]. As one limiting scenario, we consider that the plane dumped its whole fuel load over only one floor (smashing all material on that floor, including both combustible and non-combustible matter). Then the fuel would cover this floor to an average depth of nearly 0.8 cm, and the fuel load per unit area would be approximately 6.2 kg/m². In this case, we consider the fuel to be instantaneously ignited and begin burning with a heat release rate of approximately 2 MW/m², yielding a total heat release rate in this scenario of several GW. At this burning rate, the jet fuel would be consumed in only a few minutes, assuming an adequate air supply, and even in less time if the fuel were spread over a greater area. These estimates are consistent with those given in the FEMA/ASCE study[7] and are important because they demonstrate that the jet fuel would be consumed quickly relative to the duration of the tower fires.

       Who cares? Don't we have more pressing evidence of their misdeeds than aruing over how some bankers were killed? I mean, we have an NSA Director, Thomas Drake who said that the NSA had foreknowledge about the attacks and specifically failed to share that knowledge. If that doesn't paint them as treasonous terrorists then I don't see how arguing with a blacksmith about steel will accomplish anything.

       From the video "...1800 degrees, just 300 degrees hotter than jetfuel". That could be a critical 300 degrees. But anyway, clearly debunked jetfuel myth.

       The planes were going over 500 miles per hour. Those perimeter wall units were strong, yet made out of hollow steel. Even water can cut through steel if it's going fast enough. The perimeter wall units were bent INWARD.

       If a soft object cuts through a hard object in cookie cutter fashion then it's CG/animation.

       It took the FBI/ILM 8 years to superimpose CGI on all the collected video tapes before they released what they had collected in footage.
