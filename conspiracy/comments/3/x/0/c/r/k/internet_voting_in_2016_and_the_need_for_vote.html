        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>The USA needs to operate a parallel, auditable, intent voting system alongside the 2016 election&#39;s stone age fraudster system?</strong><br/>
If we don&#39;t, the USA is in deep trouble the next 4-8 years. If we missed any resources please comment and I will add them to the list.<br/>
<strong>Fraudsters on the rise</strong>:</p>

<p>Some of the 2016 presidential candidates have documented histories of computer fraud, like the 2015 server scandal, and <a href="https://medium.com/@1e3d0077c3ca4df4b260e1ee0bceb6/hillary-clinton-may-have-just-committed-election-fraud-and-the-internet-found-out-part-1-bb7647415a71">election fraud</a>, while they were employed by the government. One candidate was illegally using servers, and wiped them clean before handing them over.<br/>
<strong>You can guarantee there will be election fraud in 2016.</strong>
The solution to this problem is we NEED to run a nation wide blockchain based voting internet election in 2016 to use alongside of the antiquated and fraudster voting system in place now. If we get the nation to vote on the internet too we can cross compare these numbers to the NES&#39; &quot;official&quot; tally. We need to implement a new voting system where users can vote swiftly, safely, and privately over the internet. This type of internet voting can be achieved with blockchain related technologies. Cryptography based voting is the key to a peaceful democratic future for the United States. With internet voting like VoteCoin / Vote-Coin / VoteToken the Americans can seamlessly take firm control of their liberties, and freedoms, by voting directly for the candidate and issues and removing the hordes of middle men. This takes out the lobbying, money grabbing, the pandering, the monarchically funded election road shows, it takes out the TV NES &quot;vote count&quot; system. This would put all the votes on a VoteChain (blockchain) technology.  </p>

<p>There are forces out trying to sabotage internet voting and blockchain voting concept. Stealing the headlines with obscure tech that is not necessary for internet voting.  The press and media are not covering internet voting. The &quot;voting machine&quot; concept today is laughable, and is too fallible. A physical machine can be completely eliminated with an internet voting system with 2 step authentication system, which is a well known and tested technology! There are 380,000,000 Americans, and it&#39;s a huge waste of resources for people to take off work, having to drive to a facility, wait in the lines, deal with volunteers and obscure paper ballots, and then to never be able to see if their vote even counted! Internet voting is the only logical evolution in our democracy.<br/>
<strong>ATM machine companies make our voting machines ROFL:</strong>
You all should know that the company that made the old voting machines, DieBold, is an ATM money machine maker, and their company is listed and traded publicly on the stock market. Do you really trust these jokers to be the ones to create, program, sell, and maintain the US vote? <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=DBD">http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=DBD</a><br/>
<strong>Help the movement:</strong><br/>
If you have resources, please send me any great links to internet voting resources, beta software, essays, theory papers, or known specialists in the field, so we can compile it into our project. Thanks in advance for your help and I know there are some great minds in this sub who can point me to content I probably won&#39;t find in a web-search.   </p>

Where did it go?:<br/>
According to one source, counties did not want to buy the tech to replace their booths, and it was not profitable tech, so investors dissembled and sold off tech and patents.

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the ultimate goal would be to have a live, interactive voting system, to &quot;unvote&quot; losers as they start fucking up and turn out to be fraudsters. But first things first - the internet voting hash system will have to be running and tested. When you say &quot;machine&quot; - there is no machine. It&#39;s basically a decentralized block chain-like system where everyone&#39;s vote populates on the public ledger. You log in, and you can save your form etc. and take your time while you make the vote. Once you submit the vote, the &quot;token&quot; is essentially spent. The user interface would be incredibly simple, and streamlined, and almost impossible to f____ up. So I&#39;d have to say if you vote wrong, you are S.O.L. Just like the antiquated system in that case. You can&#39;t unvote. I suppose one way to &quot;prove&quot; you voted for candidate X, you could click &quot;record screen&quot; on the vote portal, an optional function, and you could record yourself &quot;clicking the vote&quot; and the video would include a R.N.G. hash within the video for authenticity, and this way, if your vote is somehow mis-tallied, you can use your &quot;proof&quot; recorded clip as substantial evidence in unvoting. This would be such an outlier event that this tech could come years later as an add on tech. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks so much for posting, checking out <a href="http://internetvotingforall.blogspot.com/2012/10/three-reasons-to-support-internet.html">http://internetvotingforall.blogspot.com/2012/10/three-reasons-to-support-internet.html</a> what an amazing resource. So how can we run a 2016 election parallel to the main one, next year? Millions of Americans are concerned about some of the fraudsters who are attempting to run for president, so maybe we can cut through all the bull shit and have a secondary vote process happening simultaneously to audit the main vote. If no one pulls it together we could fucked again for 8 years with someone the country didn&#39;t truly vote for. </p>
