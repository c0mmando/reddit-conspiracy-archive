By lack of understanding they remained sane.

<p>This is probably 95+% of people today. This feat of public ignorance was accomplished in a couple of ways. One, by the MSM not covering the stories that really matter. Two, by the MSM giving coverage to stuff that&#39;s totally irrelevant. </p>

<p>When the media covers a story that does matter, they tend to skim over it or deliberately make it as confusing as possible. Since most adults hate the feeling of being confused by a subject, they will react by not thinking about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>maybe the &#39;proles&#39; would be more moved by fact checking and citations in conspiracy theories. you don&#39;t have the leasure to asume granted credibility even if what you say is true to an unbeliving audience, the burden for proof falls on the accuser to produce proof and not &#39;damn sheeple&#39; musings when your wisdom isn&#39;t taken at face value. Isn&#39;t that the reason why schemes are able to be pulled anyway? lack of checking under the hood? I know there are people that know how to hang their passions up and cite their claims but ive been around &#39;conspiracy&#39; groups long enough to know that they produce and accept uncited theories of plots like the &#39;sheeple&#39; they claim to be so much better informed then. fact checking and citing may not be as sexy as the theory you propose even if true but without it you&#39;re just another person at a bar with big stories, no evidence, and yelling &#39;i swear by my mothers grave!&#39; to a eyerolling audience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because its public domain and has been such for a long time. things don&#39;t lose credibility to me based on who made the platform, but if the information doesn&#39;t have facts to support it, not what name or organization alone is attached to it. hell, a big motivator for the interstate highway system was military need to move resources around the country yet this one potential application for highways is absolutely dwarfed by public service highways provide, same for the internet. George Orwell as a topic in itself might make frowns on some faces prefering information control, yet here is 1984 being discussed on a piece of technology with its roots in darpa.</p>

<p>I know that real clandestine bs happens but its a strech to paint the government with either the ability or desire for ruthless thought control in all aspects. First place i read 1984 was online and the MIB never showed up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i openly tell people that voting is pointless since elections are just a tv show staged by political funders with strings attached to their campaign donations and people are merely given the illusion of political freedom by choosing candidates funded by similar interests if not some special interests hedging and buying both parties to ensure victory for themselves regardless how the political theatre ends. i basicly openly view the government detached from peoples influence other then a few appeasing bones it throws to not have to spend the kind of money needed for internal control like china does since it prefers throwing their people nothing.</p>

<p>I really wish I could reach people like you holocaust, you&#39;ve isolated yourself into thinking you live in a totalitarian police state glazing over the fact that you are able to suggest we live in 1984 world in a domain that in 1984 world, should have caused thought police to shut you down long ago. We certainly do have aspects of what 1984 warned us about, but to say we actually live in a world paralell to 1984 is a streach. This is one reason people shy away from conspiracy forums, being unwilling to sift through all the people like yourself that for whatever reason want to belive we live in the most ironfisted dystopia envisioned by political fiction parable writers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>before the internet peoples source of information on world happenings was the news alone, you either choose to trust it or not, even if they did cite i doubt most people had the resources to follow up anyway.</p>

<p>today we have the means to provide a reasonable amount of citation and fact checking ability that should bring the practice more past college and into daily affairs. love or hate wikipedia for example but the basic respect it manages to summon is high demand for citation. sometimes demanding proof for every sentence backfires but i feel it will be a lot easier to do anything meaningful if the basic issues can be agreed upon for a given story.</p>
