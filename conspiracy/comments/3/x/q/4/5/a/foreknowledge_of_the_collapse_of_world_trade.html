        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>WTC Building 7, also known as the Salomon Brothers Building or WTC 7, was a 47–story skyscraper that was part of the World Trade Center complex.</p>

<p>WTC7 was not hit by an airplane on 9/11 and suffered only minimal damage from debris falling from the North Tower. Several fires began burning on a few floors, and the entire building completely collapsed, almost into its own footprint, at 5:20 p.m.</p>

<p>There is well documented evidence that there was foreknowledge WTC7 was going to be demolished. Foreknowledge of the collapse of WTC7 is not only consistent with, but supportive of, the <strong>controlled demolition hypothesis</strong></p>

<p>There were even two premature announcements of the collapse by major television networks</p>

<hr/>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mxFRigYD3s"><strong>BBC</strong> Reports Collapse of WTC Building 7 Early (Twice)</a> at least 23 minutes prematurely</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1LetB0z8_o"><strong>CNN</strong> Reports WTC7 either collapsed or is collapsing</a> 1 hour and 10 minutes before it actuall did</li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<p>Contrary to what is often implied by supporters of the official 9/11 narrative, witnesses who expected WTC7 to come down, did not reach this conclusion because of anything they personally perceived but because of what they were told, <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/html/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPHIC/met_WTC_histories_full_01.html">there are in fact only seven FDNY Members that personally judged that WTC7 was likely to collapse, out of approximately 500 oral histories</a> </p>

<p>What these seven has to say can be read on page 18 in the <a href="http://www.journalof911studies.com/volume/200701/MacQueenWaitingforSeven.pdf">WTC 7 Collapse Warnings in the FDNY Oral Histories</a></p>

<li>“ … they pulled everyone back, and everybody stood there and we actually just waited and just waited and waited until it went down …” EMT Joseph Fortis, p. 15.</li>
<li>“I remember later on in the day as we were waiting for seven to come down, they kept backing us up Vesey, almost like a full block …”</li>
<li>“The whole time while we were waiting — there were hours that went by.” Vincent Massa, p. 17, 19.</li>
<li>“They had figured they knew that building was going to come down. It was just a question of time, and everybody was awaiting that.” Lieutenant Russell Stroebel, p. 5.</li>
<li>“Once they got us back together and organized somewhat, they sent us back down to Vesey, where we stood and waited for Seven World Trade Center to come down.” Firefighter Frank Sweeney, p. 14.</li>

<p><strong>Video evidence of foreknowledge of the collapse of WTC7</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/z9CXQY-bZn4?t=9s">&quot;Keep your eye on that building, it&#39;ll be coming down soon&quot;</a></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/z9CXQY-bZn4?t=11s">&quot;Move it back, the building is about to blow up&quot;</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-WZpXiEKAo">&quot;That is the building that is going to go down next&quot;</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9CXQY-bZn4">&quot;The building is about to blow up&quot;</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>Since no steel-framed building had ever collapsed before without being imploded, there would have been no basis for such predictions for a steel framed skyscraper to collapse, it would seem this foreknowledge must have come from people who intended to bring the building down.</p>

<p>Factual evidence contradicts the 9/11 official fairytale, WTC7 demolition had foreknowledge, it then went into literal freefall, through of greatest resistance, symetrically, into it&#39;s own footprint, moltom metal was found at the site, this is even <a href="http://rememberbuilding7.org/downloads/AppendixC-fema403_apc.pdf">documented by a government agency</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong><a href="http://cafr1.com/Beyond-Misinformation-2015.pdf">Foreknowledge of WTC 7’s Destruction - <sup>p.28</sup></a></strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>About an hour after the destruction of WTC 1 at 10:28 AM, the authorities at the World Trade Center began anticipating the collapse of WTC 7 with a high
degree of confience and precision. Their anticipation was so strong that the media widely reported on WTC 7’s imminent collapse, with some news outlets
even reporting the collapse before it occurred. This anticipation appears to be &quot;knowledge-based&quot; they knew there was going to be a controlled demolition, rather than “evidence-based,” prediction made on the basis of assessing the
damage and fires</p>

<hr/>

<p>The view that the anticipation was knowledge-based rather than evidence-based is strongly supported by the following facts:</p>

<ul>
<li> NIST’s probable collapse sequence consists
of an unprecedented and undetectable
series of structural failures that could
not be predicted on the basis of observing
structural damage (which NIST later claimed
did not contribute to the collapse) and fires.
If we assume NIST’s hypothesis to be true,
there would be no reason to anticipate a total
collapse, even within the seconds before
it occurred. Based on NIST’s scenario, the
event that the authorities predicted had an
infinitesimal probability of occurring until
just seconds before it did. At that point,
an extremely improbable chain of events
unfolded and made their prediction correct.
Such a scenario is not plausible.</li>
<li>A number of buildings in the vicinity were
on fire and sustained much greater damage
from the destruction of WTC 1 and WTC 2.
Yet authorities seized on WTC 7 as the one
building that was certain to go down and
established a safety zone around it.</li>
<li>The FEMA Building Performance Study
concluded that the best hypothesis it could
come up with had “only a low probability of
occurrence.” How were the authorities able
to predict such a low-probability event?</li>
<li>Engineers were “stunned by what happened
to 7 World Trade Center” and unable to
explain it. Even as late as March 2006, NIST’s lead investigator told New York Magazine, “I
don’t really know. We’ve had trouble getting
a handle on building No. 7.” <strong>How were the
authorities able to predict an event that
engineers would be unable to explain even
four and half years later?</strong></li>
<li>A CNN video captured both the sound of
an explosion coming from WTC 7 and an
emergency worker’s warning that WTC 7 was
“about to blow up” just seconds before its
destruction:
[Sound of explosion]. Unidentified voice: “You
hear that?” Voice of emergency worker #1:
“Keep your eye on that building, it’ll be coming
down….” Voice of emergency worker #2: “Building is about to blow up, move it back…. Here
we are looking back, there’s a building about to
blow up. Flame and debris coming down.”9</li>
<li>There are at least four accounts showing that
a <strong>controlled demolition was being considered
or planned.</strong></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I remember getting a call from the, uh, fire department commander, telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire. I said, &#39;you know we&#39;ve had such terrible loss of life, maybe the smartest thing to do is, is pull it.&#39; Uh, and they made that decision to pull, and then we watched the building collapse.&quot;</p>

<p>So first of all, <em>he</em> suggested that they &quot;pull it&quot;. In response to the suggestion, he said &quot;they&quot; made the decision to pull.</p>

<p>&quot;We should pull it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay.&quot;</p>

<p>That would be consistent with him suggesting it and them making the decision. But he also doesn&#39;t strictly say that the fire department commander was the one who made the decision, or that the decision was made right then on that phone call.</p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty decisive, I&#39;d say. It very clearly wasn&#39;t Silverstein&#39;s decision in the final call. The full quote also makes it pretty clear they are discussing evacuation, not explosive demolition. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.debunking911.com/pull.htm">Except there were</a>: </p>

<p>Daniel Nigro, Chief of Department: &quot;I ordered the evacuation of an area sufficient around to protect our members, so we had to give up some rescue operations that were going on at the time and back the people away far enough so that if 7 World Trade did collapse, we [wouldn&#39;t] lose any more people.&quot;</p>

<p>Chief Cruthers: &quot;We instructed that a collapse area be set up and maintained so that when the expected collapse of 7 happened, we wouldn&#39;t have people working in it.&quot;</p>

<p>Lieutenant William Ryan: &quot;We found out, I guess around 3:00, that they thought 7 was going to collapse. So, of course, [we&#39;ve] got guys all in this pile over here and the main concern was get everybody out, and I guess it took us over an hour and a half, two hours to get everybody out of there.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not decisive at all. Why would Silverstein have been the one to suggest evacuation of fire fighters on a call with the fire department commander??

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s simply not how he claimed the conversation went. You&#39;re making it up.</p>

<p><em>He</em> suggested that they &quot;pull it&quot;, and also he did not say it was mentioned on the call that the building looked like it was about to go down. If they determined there was a safety risk, why would they be first calling him about objections, and why would he be the one to raise the idea of &quot;pulling it&quot;??</p>

<p>It&#39;s not proof of a demolition, but it&#39;s equally not proof or &quot;pretty decisive&quot; evidence that they were talking about evacuating personnel like you claim, otherwise you wouldn&#39;t have to be making things up like this.</p>

<p>There is a US anchorman, Dan Rather, that made a similar claim on live TV</p>

<p>Amazing, incredible, pick your word. For the third time today, it is reminiscent of those pictures we have seen too much on television before, <strong>when a building was deliberately destroyed by well placed dynamite to knock it down</strong></p>
