<p>Yes, it is. You asked for a recording of moving visual images (pictures) that was made digitally.

    <div class="md"><p>I am not going to calculate the exact money, but lets say his monthly expenditure is </p>

<p>300$</p>

<p>One day would be 10$</p>

<p>And assuming he took about 20 minutes to comment with OP and find his YouTube video.</p>

<p>His &quot;waste&quot; would be </p>

<p>20minutes = x</p>

<p>86400 minutes =10</p>

<p>X = 2/864</p>

<p>=0.0023148148dollars</p>

<p>So it would be insignificant if you do it this way, but if you measure the data used ie 240p for 25minutes is about 50MB if I remember correctly.</p>

<p>It would be a different amount if he uses prepaid internet</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So in order to do this you&#39;d have to send a satellite into geosynchronous orbit or greater, else, from the frame of reference the satellite would be moving across the ear, not the earth spinning relative to the satellite.</p>

<p>in Geosynchronous orbit the earth would appear to not move. The satellite would be stationary compared to the reference point on the equator of the Earth. Here is a video of a geostationary satellite.  </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Ybh11kcDhfM">https://youtu.be/Ybh11kcDhfM</a></p>

<p>Sending a satellite above geosynchronous orbit would be prohibitively expensive as there are no other uses for a satellite in that type of orbit to my knowledge.</p>

<p>May I ask why you believe this is a conspiracy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your breakdown and I will just get to your question. We have spent a lot doing relatively nothing in a variety of fields, im not sure this can be considered too expensive to bother, I can only go off of publicly released figures when they report costings.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how much they have spent on this whole Mars deal, I don&#39;t know how much they will continue or plan to spend. They have sent vehicles to Mars, reportedly 350 million miles away, costing how much? I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>The ISS reportedly cost 3 billion a year to run to conduct experiments. They have a camera on board that cost 7 million.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t money be better spent on focusing on Earth, rather than Mars? or even Mars in a smaller capacity. I said in the post here, the live video of the globe could be such an educational tool, it would be worth financials.</p>

<p>The conspiracy is the actual question, now, you don&#39;t have to subscribe to any belief to simply ask, &quot;Why isn&#39;t there a video of the whole globe? even a live stream?&quot; It is possible, it is technically achievable and there is not a good enough reason to not already have this in 2015.</p>

<p>NASA is talking about sending humans to Mars in 2030s, but we haven&#39;t even got a video of the Earth in 2015.</p>

<p>Here is a video from a geostationary satellite in 4k used for weather mapping. I&#39;m sure others like it exist. Is this the type of thing you are looking for?</p>

<p>Funding space research leads to lots of discoveries. I think we have learned most of what we need to know about low earth orbit, I personally think there is much more we can learn about our solar system by sending objects outside of earths orbit. Again, this is totally an opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A video is a set of images that change in fractions of a second to make the illusion of movement. The speed at which these images change is the framerate. So it is a video no matter if you think it was faked or not. technically,  even a powerpoint is just a video with a low framerate.</p>

<p>Also, you have to ask yourself, why would anyone lie about the earth being flat? What would anyone get from that? The flat earth conspiracy is just that, a baseless conspiracy, nothing makes sense about it. There is no solid evidence that the Earth is flat, but plenty that it is spherical. Pretty much every physical property of are Earth acts like a spherical object, you can only see a few miles away until the curvature of the earth blocks the object from sight. There are plenty of what you call &quot;Collections of images&quot; of a spherical Earth, but none of a flat one. </p>

<p>So before shooting down our proof of a spherical Earth, where&#39;s your proof?</p>

Someone applied post-processing to the video to try and &#39;flatten&#39; the horizon, but it adds a distorted affect along the edges and to the antenna.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s worth noting, that this video <em>is not</em> a continuous video. It&#39;s a serious of photos (aka frames), which looks like 24 fps, to create a digital reel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before we get into the videos that do exist, it&#39;s worth noting some things about what you&#39;re asking for.  The first is just the environment of space and how it affects videos.  On Earth you have a bunch of stuff all around you.  You have the sky scattering light as it comes down, which means that shadows are still kind of bright.  We&#39;re so used to seeing things in this environment and seeing videos and pictures taken in this environment that we tend to see pictures taken in other light as being fake or at least really low quality because fake pictures tend to have the lighting messed up.  However, in the case of pictures taken from space it&#39;s caused by the lighting of the actual subject being messed up (by terrestrial standards).</p>

<p>Second, note that to get such a video you&#39;d have to use a lot of time on a satellite.  Satellites aren&#39;t cheap, and they&#39;re put into space to do specific jobs, which typically <em>isn&#39;t</em> to produce videos of earth spinning just for the sake of having videos of earth spinning.  What footage we do have means that there is little call for more to be taken—the definition of &quot;HD&quot; changes quite quickly for media on earth, but there are delays of years between launches that wind up in a place where they could take a convincing video of earth spinning.</p>

<p>Third, note that the earth spins <em>really</em> slowly.  It takes a day to make one revolution, obviously.  So getting a video of a whole revolution without time lapsing is just silly.  All video is just a series of still images, so that&#39;s the format that satellites tend to send their data back as.  I don&#39;t want you to even <em>try</em> to go down that bullshitty rabbit hole of video vs series of still images vs time lapse, because they&#39;re all the same thing.  This point shouldn&#39;t be an issue, and if you try to fight me on it as you&#39;ve done with others in this thread then I&#39;ll swear at you and leave you in your ignorance.  I refuse to get bogged down on this issue. </p>

<p>The fourth and final point to make before getting into the video that does exist comes down to orbital mechanics.  I have a degree in aerospace engineering and I can throw formulas at you if you want, but to keep things simple we mostly care about how velocity changes with orbital altitude, and we care about two main kinds of orbits:  low earth orbit, and geostationary orbit.  LEO is by far the most common orbit as it gets you all of the benefits of being in space without having to use as much fuel to get higher.  In LEO your speed is <em>incredibly</em> fast, so you&#39;re moving over Earth much faster than it is spinning—you complete one orbit in about 90 minutes.  This means that if you pointed a camera at the earth you&#39;d get video that is more akin to flying in a <em>very</em> fast plane than what you&#39;re probably imagining—a shot from a stationary observer of a spinning globe.  Geosynchronous orbits are better in this regard, and they&#39;re a popular orbit because you can put a satellite in this orbit and it will always be at the same point in the sky, since it&#39;s orbiting at the same speed that earth spins.  If you took a video from a satellite in this orbit then you&#39;d wind up with a stationary picture of Earth watching as it went from fully illuminated to partially, to fully dark, and so on, much like watching the moon (we are sort of in a lunar-stationary orbit of the moon; the moon is tidally locked which makes a lot of the same things true as in a lunar-stationary orbit).  If you&#39;re imagining a video that shows the earth spinning in space, like in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI9ta7qkazU">this</a> animation, then what you&#39;d need is a camera that stays stationary, but that&#39;s not really feasible with a satellite—in space if you&#39;re not moving then you&#39;re falling towards something.  The best you could get would be to be very far away with a very good zoom, but there just aren&#39;t satellites set up like this because there&#39;s no need for them.</p>

<hr/>

<p>With all of that out of the way, we can look at some videos.  The first one that people tend to bring up is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG0fTKAqZ5g">this</a> one, taken from the ISS.  It&#39;s the most recent such video and it has some of the best camera settings, likely thanks to being taken so recently (i.e. better cameras) and due to having a space station where astronauts get some down time to work on fun projects.  This technically doesn&#39;t show the earth spinning, as it is taken from LEO as mentioned above, but it gives a really beautiful shot of earth from above at night.  Note that they&#39;ve only taken the video at night so that they can have a more consistent exposure setting on their camera without maxing out their camera&#39;s sensor on the daylight half of the earth.</p>

<p>If you want a video that actually shows the earth spinning, consider <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVzl9Dqg2o4">this</a> video (and forgive the music if it&#39;s not to your taste; I didn&#39;t pick that).  This video was taken from Geosynchronous orbit, so you get a bit of an odd perspective on the rotation of earth—it&#39;s like taking a video of a merry-go-round while sitting on the merry-go-round:  you&#39;d see the merry-go-round as stationary while the background moves.  In this video you have exactly that going on, but Earth is so much brighter than everything in the background that there&#39;s nothing to see to get your bearings.  The camera that took this video wasn&#39;t set up as nicely as the cameras in the previous video, as this satellite (EchoStar 11) is a telecom satellite being used by Dish Network to broadcast TV—not a mission that even requires a camera so it&#39;s a lucky break that they bothered to put even a cheap one on the satellite in the first place.</p>

<p>Finally, I&#39;d like to present <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVuqcEuIRgs">this</a> video.  The only time when we have a spacecraft in a position to take a video much like you&#39;d like to see is when we have a scientific probe being sent out of Earth&#39;s orbit.  This tends to involve a pretty straight path away from earth, and if this happens to be on the daylight side of earth then the probe can take a series of pictures (again, this is all the probes are set up to do, and you wouldn&#39;t want hours of video anyway) that can be stitched together to make a video.  This happened in 1990 with the Galileo probe, which performed a flyby of Venus then two flybys of Earth to build up speed to make it to Jupiter.  This is an odd flight path to fly and was only chosen because Galileo missed its original launch window due to the Challenger disaster—typically a much simpler trajectory would be used which would not have afforded the opportunity to take this series of pictures; if the booster wasn&#39;t strong enough to get the probe to its destination then the probe would be designed to be smaller.  In the case of Galileo the probe was already designed and built when the launch was delayed and the new flight path had to be chosen.</p>

<p>So there you have it.  Three different videos that each show, in varying ways, earth from space, as well as the main reasons why we don&#39;t have better images.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You also forgot that to be far enough above the Earth to record the video, you have to be moving sideways really fast.  That&#39;s what an orbit is, moving sideways so fast that the Earth curves out from under you so you never hit it.  </p>

<p>Weather satellites record the Earth rotating all the time, as do many others.  But they&#39;re also moving, usually either faster or slower than the Earth&#39;s rotation [1] so it generally doesn&#39;t take a full 24 hours to see it.</p>

<p>To be seeing the Earth rotate once in 24 hours you&#39;d need to be stationary relative to the Earth and that&#39;s really difficult (if not outright impossible) to accomplish with modern tech.</p>

<p>From the moon you can watch the terminator (the day/night line) move across the Earth at ~1,000 MPH, but even there you won&#39;t see the Earth rotating every 24 hours because the moon is orbiting the Earth so that also induces its own motion.</p>

<p>Everything is always moving, which often makes seeing something move from offplanet the way you see it move from the surface difficult.</p>

<p>[1] There are a special class of satellites that are far enough out that their orbital speed is exactly equal to the Earth&#39;s rotation so they stay in the same place relative to the Earth&#39;s surface all the time, they&#39;re called &quot;geostationary&quot; satellites for that reason and they&#39;re useful for communications mostly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, come on.  Don&#39;t bury your head in the sand.  Just because the things I present are against a belief doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re wrong or inspired by pseudo-intellectual sources.  You can&#39;t just ignore everything that you don&#39;t like.  That&#39;s just childish. </p>

<p>You may be able to attack others in this thread and elsewhere for not having done the work to back up their beliefs, but I am not in that position.  I&#39;ve put in the time and done the work.  I&#39;ve done the theoretical derivations from first principles to arrive at my understanding of the universe.  I&#39;ve done real hands-on work in the lab and the field which backs up this understanding.  I&#39;ve been taught by professors who were very insightful about the subject matter and I&#39;ve had professors who have taught things that were wrong which I challenged.  As for the reasons I originally gave, those are my own.  While many aspects of the explanation were influenced by my education it was much more than a regurgitation; it was a combining of principles that I&#39;ve learned, which is only possible because the physics based on a round earth are self-consistent.  It&#39;s insulting to be dismissed as you&#39;ve done, but I understand why you do it.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve invested far too much of your identity in the idea that there is a global conspiracy about the shape of the world.  I see that you&#39;ve created a subreddit dedicated to the idea, and I have to assume your username is a reference to the same.  When you do this you back yourself into a corner:  if evidence pops up that suggests that your belief is flawed then to accept that evidence would mean denying your identity.  The cognitive dissonance you&#39;re harboring is so strong that that you seem to be unwilling or unable to even consider alternate viewpoints.</p>

<p>If you are not willing to consider evidence both for and against your beliefs then you are not in the right sub.  This is a place for open-minded thinkers, not people who are just looking for reassurance.  It&#39;s fine to challenge the widespread belief that the world is round, but it&#39;s not OK to spew insults when your challenge is met with answers.  <em>That</em> is why you&#39;re not having a good time in this thread, not because you asked the question in the first place. </p>

<p>Why would I wonder that, when I understand orbital mechanics.  It&#39;s easy to understand why accidental satellite collisions would be exceedingly rare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright let me explain.</p>

<p>An orbit is when any object is moving fast enough around a planet to &quot;fall&quot; around it before it hits the Earth </p>

<p><a href="http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2009/03/geostationary_orbit/10284273-3-eng-GB/Geostationary_orbit_node_full_image_2.jpg">Reference image</a></p>

<p>Lets say the earth is pulling &quot;down&quot; on your spacecraft at 1g (in reality it would not be exactly 1g but I digress).</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/TEokOb1.png">This is what you would expect to happen</a> (ignore my shitty drawing skills).</p>

<p>Now lets say we dont want to hit the ground. We would add velocity sideways. Now halfway through adding velocity our orbit would look like <a href="http://i.imgur.com/IZnABd5.png">this</a>. As you can see we are still hitting the ground but we are going further than before. This is because we are &quot;falling&quot; towards the horizion. Only problem is we are not moving fast enough. Now after adding enough velocity we end up with <a href="http://i.imgur.com/UwSrxxp.png">this</a>. We are still accelerating towards the Earth at 1g, however we are now moving fast enough sideways to fall away from the Earth.</p>

<p>Now lets add a second object into the mix. We put this object up to the same height as the first and accelerate into a stable <a href="http://i.imgur.com/iRsLkXf.png">orbit</a>.</p>

<p>Our second object. Although in the path for collision with the first never will. Why is this? because in order to orbit at the same height as another object we need to be moving at the same speed as that object. This is why in space collisions it is either caused by sloppy orbiting or because one object was going in the other direction.</p>

<p>The reason we don&#39;t see as many satellite collisions is because they are uber expensive. So companies that own them will keep track of them and keep them safe. Another reason is because we can track every single satellite in orbit, allowing us to see if they will collide.</p>

<p>Another factor is because <a href="http://sparkleberrysprings.com/v-web/b2/images/e/earthsats.png">we don&#39;t really have that many satellites in orbit to collide as we do with things such as cars</a>.</p>

<p>All but one of the above images (last one is not mine) are my own. But here are a few more and some other links.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would guess the number is at least 10k, (internet search says at least 24k) but since there are privately launched satellites I don&#39;t know if we could land on a hard number. (I mean maybe we could, but who is going to painstakingly count?) </p>

<p>My understanding is that when they fall out of orbit, they burn up upon reentry. As for collisions, I would guess that they&#39;re rare because each satellite orbits at a different distance from earth, in varying lengths. The distance from earth would determine it&#39;s orbital velocity, so satellites on the same arc would be traveling at the same speed. Probably most collisions would occur when one is being pulled back into earth and collides with another. </p>

<p>Why do you say supposedly up there? Haven&#39;t you seen a satellite travel across the horizon before?</p>

<p>Just look at MIR and Skylab.</p>

<p>The reason manned ones don&#39;t burn up is because they have heat resistant shedding called ablaitors on the bottom. These burn up instead of the spacecraft. When these fail you get stuff like Space shuttle Columbia.</p>

<p>Yes you can see geostationary and low orbit satellites in orbit. Geostationary ones are harder but can be caught on camera by taking a long photo.</p>

<p>Now low/mid orbit ones are different. These when you do see them cross the sky in a few seconds to minutes.</p>

<p>Stuff smaller than 10cm is really damn hard to track because its rather far away and doesn&#39;t give enough of a radar return to find easily.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if satellites burn up upon reentry, why don&#39;t NASA vehicles?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NASA vehicles are designed specifically to avoid burning up on reentry, and it doesn&#39;t always work.  That&#39;s what happened to Space Shuttle Columbia.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster</a></p>

<p>The heat shield was damaged on launch and when Columbia tried reentry [1] it failed and the shuttle was destroyed killing seven astronauts. </p>

<p>[1] Which is basically using the atmosphere to slow down, to stay in orbit a vehicle has to be going crazy fast, that&#39;s what all the giant rockets are mostly for, getting up to the ~200 miles or so above the surface that is low Earth orbit doesn&#39;t take all that much work, it&#39;s getting fast enough to stay there that does.   <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/58/">https://what-if.xkcd.com/58/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are collisions, actually, and its a concern.  Back when the space shuttle was used they had to replace the very thick quartz windows every few missions because tiny bits of crap [1] hitting the windows at speeds much faster than a speeding bullet.</p>

<p>They take great care to avoid putting satellites up in the path of other satellites, but there&#39;s actually quite a bit of concern about impacts causing one satellite to break up, which makes fragments which cause others to break up and so on until low Earth orbit is filled with derbies that makes being there completely unsafe.  It&#39;s called a Kessler Cascade, or Kessler Syndrome: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome</a></p>

<p>This is why all modern satellites are designed to deorbit themselves after they hit the end of their life cycle instead of staying up, and why there is talk about spending the many billions of dollars it&#39;d take to remove the derelict satellites.  </p>

<p>[1] Sometimes literal crap, back before anyone realized the danger astronauts used to dump all their trash out the airlock including feces and urine.  An early astronaut thought he was seeing aliens when, in fact, it was his own frozen piss that was making weird yellow lights outside his ship.</p>

What you&#39;re suggesting just isn&#39;t a good long term utilization of resources. Moreover, scientists know and accept that the images, time lapses, and short videos that they have indeed gathered from space crafts showing the earth rotating is more than sufficient. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re looking for 20+ FPS video with the entirety of earth in view? This would likely require a camera at a high orbit if you don&#39;t want to allow fisheye lenses or distortion, so let&#39;s calculate it for rectilinear lenses.</p>

<p>For the common consumer grade cameras that have non-fisheye lenses, angle of views between 46 degrees and 37 degrees are common. Using a 40 degree angle of view camera, the formula for getting the entire earth in frame is:</p>

<p>h = diameter of earth / 2 * tan (AoV / 2)</p>

<p>So for 40 degrees angle of view (AoV):</p>

<p>h = 3,958.75 mi / tan (20 degrees) = 10,876 mi
h = 6,371 km / tan (20 degrees) = 17,504 km</p>

<p>This would require a consumer-grade camera to be around the orbital height of GPS satellites (around the middle of MEO, Medium Earth Orbit). Many cameras that do get mounted on satellites for imaging purposes have smaller angles of view (for example, hubble has a 10 degree angle of view).</p>

<p>To address, then, why we may not (yet) have 20+ FPS video of the entire earth, it is probable that no satellites above that height are equipped with cameras that can take video (collections of still images) with that framerate - literally about the only reason for that would be to satiate requests like these, with less scientific value than sharp imagery at lower framerates. </p>

<p>There is then an additional complexity in the data transfer, as 20+ FPS at high resolution from that far of an orbit would be rather power intensive, and deorbiting the satellite to collect the data would also be an expensive process. To actually transmit the data, especially in real time with all the power handling and maneuvering requirements, would likely require a dedicated satellite and launch, so say ~$2-3 billion dollars or so, just for people who are already convinced of the contrary to move on to the next conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had the same thought recently. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my approach, and I share it with you in a -21 point TLC where noone cares: in the videos posted, note the clouds aren&#39;t moving, forming, dissipating - although they should; and they should be <em>superrotating</em>. That opens a huge can of worms, because mainstream science has it the earth is dragging the atmosphere with it. When you ask why the atmosphere of Earth is superrotating (and so is that of Venus, even much faster), you&#39;ll be told &quot;Coriolis force&quot;, although it is an effect observed from within the rotating frame<em>resulting</em> from the rotation, not a &quot;force&quot; in the sense that it could push the atmosphere ahead of the ball rotating underneath it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a flatearther, but I&#39;m baffled with how little some of those who disagree with you so vocally are satisfied. Billion-Dollar space programs, satellites everywhere, space probes to no end to measure and filter and record everything happening billions of miles away, space walks, golfing on the moon and &quot;Major Tom&quot; on the ISS, rovers on Mars, but installing one surplus cam to record a rotation sequence? Not possible. Not feasible. Not economic. You&#39;re a crackpot. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a 9/11 truther, but the kind of replies you got I&#39;m painfully familiar with and actually make me wonder if you aren&#39;t on to something. Not flat earth necessarily, god forbid, maybe more something towards aether conspiracy, Mach&#39;s principle or electric universe. The lack of genuine curiosity on the side of &quot;mainstream wisdom&quot; is mind-boggling in any case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So in order to do this you&#39;d have to send a satellite into geosynchronous orbit or greater, else, from the frame of reference the satellite would be moving across the ear, not the earth spinning relative to the satellite.</p>

<p>in Geosynchronous orbit the earth would appear to not move. The satellite would be stationary compared to the reference point on the equator of the Earth. Here is a video of a geostationary satellite.  </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Ybh11kcDhfM">https://youtu.be/Ybh11kcDhfM</a></p>

<p>Sending a satellite above geosynchronous orbit would be prohibitively expensive as there are no other uses for a satellite in that type of orbit to my knowledge.</p>

<p>May I ask why you believe this is a conspiracy?</p>

<p>It should only cost a few hundred million to give stoners something to watch. Why don&#39;t you put up the cash and then we can all enjoy it? </p>
