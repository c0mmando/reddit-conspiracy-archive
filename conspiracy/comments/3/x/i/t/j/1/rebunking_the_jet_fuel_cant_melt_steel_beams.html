<p>an aluminum plane can&#39;t slice through a steel building</p>

<p>Bullshit. It is simple physics. At the moment of impact there is a huge amount of energy being transferred. If that energy is enough to cause the steel to fail, then it will fail, no matter if the projectile is made of steel, aluminium, or feathers.</p>

<p>Put simply, if there is enough mass traveling fast enough, then even jello can penetrate steel. That&#39;s why we can use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLsO3U6yjfI">water jets to cut thick steel plate</a> with ease. </p>

<p>If fast moving water can cut steel, then so can fast moving aluminium. All that matters is how much and how fast.</p>

<p>The velocity of the collision is irrelevant in any calculation.</p>

<p>Force equals mass times <strong>acceleration</strong>.</p>

<p>Elementary physics, my dear retard.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The force of an aluminum plane wing impacting the steel exterior columns will never exceed the force of the steel column against the aluminum plane wing. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No shit, Sherlock. Ever heard the phrase &quot;<strong>equal and opposite reaction</strong>&quot;? Every newton of energy that is used to crush the aluminium is also felt by the steel. If the force is high enough, the steel breaks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is because aluminum compresses and distorts easily regardless of velocity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So... the Navy are wasting their money on that railgun?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The shot, fired on December 10th, broke the world record for the most powerful shot, <strong>as the 23-pound aluminum projectile rocketed out of the Navy’s electromagnetic railgun at a reported speed of Mach 7</strong>, or seven times the speed of sound.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2010/12/13/navys-new-railgun-shoots-at-mach-7-can-hit-targets-100-miles-away/">http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2010/12/13/navys-new-railgun-shoots-at-mach-7-can-hit-targets-100-miles-away/</a></p>

<p>Steel armour will always defeat that railgun... right?</p>

<p>An empty 757 (no fuel, no passengers, no cargo) weighs 5,652 times more than that aluminium railgun projectile. Mach 7 is 5190 miles per hour at sea level. The cruise speed of a 757 is 530 miles per hour. The railgun projectile is only 9.7 times faster than a 757.</p>

<p>5,600 times heavier, 1/10th the speed. That means a 757 at 530mph hits harder than a railgun projectile by a significant margin.</p>

<p>You&#39;re fucking moron. You really are.</p>

<p>What is the acceleration of a plane at 500 mph?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The acceleration is the short period of time between 500 mph and 0 miles per hour. During the WTC impacts over 130,000 pounds of jet slowed from over 500mph to 0mph in the space of 65 metres. The acceleration was incredible.</p>

<p>Your tiny brain would literally explode if it was subjected to anything near that sort of acceleration.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The function of those giant engines on a Boeing 747 is to provide the acceleration to push through air.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what? That has nothing to do with the fact that 130,000 pounds does not stop in 65m without releasing a <strong>huge</strong> amount of energy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The acceleration of the engines sustains the velocity of the plane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus, go back to school you moron.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In classical mechanics, linear momentum or translational momentum (pl. momenta; SI unit kg m/s, or equivalently, N s) is the product of the mass and velocity of an object. For example, a heavy truck moving rapidly has a large momentum—it takes a large or prolonged force to get the truck up to this speed, and it takes a large or prolonged force to bring it to a stop afterwards. If the truck were lighter, or moving more slowly, then it would have less momentum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum</a></p>

<p>Educate yourself. Your parents must be so embarrassed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The acceleration of the &quot;plane&quot; as it is supposedly hitting the Towers is virtually 0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually it was huge. Over 500 mph to 0 mph in under 65m and a fraction of a second.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The force that would be generated in such a collision would be a result a transfer of momentum from the plane to the building.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No shit, what do you think cut that steel? Jesus, now <em>you&#39;re</em> proving yourself wrong. Even you subconsciously know how stupid you are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there is a transfer of momentum there must be a decrease of velocity aka a deceleration of the plane as it impacts the building.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unless the building gives... and let&#39;s not forget that as you said aluminium is very pliant. The front half of the fuselage can be flat as a pancake while the tail is still doing hundreds of miles per hour.</p>

<p>Have you ever crushed an aluminium can? You know how the bottom of the can can be motionless on the floor while the top moves down towards it, compressing the can into a fraction of its size?</p>

<p>Turn that can on its side and you have a jet airliner fuselage.</p>

<p>Give up, moron. You&#39;re wrong, and only other morons don&#39;t know it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He apparently holds that same idea of acceleration as the majority of people who slept through their high school physics class, acceleration is the change in velocity over the time it took to do so, so to try to explain this to him in the simplest manner, imagine you are making $5000 an hour, and now there is $500 being removed every 6 minutes, you are not increasing your wealth, thus, no acceleration (you are gaining and losing $5000 each hour, so no net change), so there is no acceleration present to &quot;support the velocity&quot; which, honestly, makes zero sense to begin with. I hope this painfully dumbed down version of acceleration helps you to understand how hopelessly stupid you sound, p.s. high school physics should have taught you this, i aced the tests without doing <em>any</em> homework or studying, its kind of sad that you couldn&#39;t take the time to understand it before you try to &quot;debunk&quot; the majority of the civilized world...

<blockquote>
<p>For example, when a car starts from a standstill (zero relative velocity) and travels in a straight line at increasing speeds, it is accelerating in the direction of travel. If the car turns there is an acceleration toward the new direction. For this example, we can call the accelerating of the car forward a &quot;linear acceleration&quot;, which passengers in the car might experience as force pushing them back into their seats. When changing directions, we might call this &quot;non-linear acceleration&quot;, which passengers might experience as a sideways force. <strong>If the speed of the car decreases, this is an acceleration in the opposite direction of the direction of the vehicle, sometimes called deceleration.</strong>[4] Passengers may experience deceleration as a force lifting them away from their seats. Mathematically, there is no separate formula for deceleration, as both are changes in velocity. Each of these accelerations (linear, non-linear, deceleration) might be felt by passengers until their velocity (speed and direction) match that of the car.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration</a></p>

<p>The moment that aircraft hit the surface of the WTC it began accelerating in the opposite direction. We call this deceleration.</p>

<p>The 130,000 pound jets decelerated from over 530 mph to 0 in a fraction of a second. That is a <em>huge</em> acceleration.</p>

<p>Imagine the same jet accelerating from 0 to 530 mph in a fraction of a second... the humans on board would be instantly killed, and I doubt most of the structure of the aircraft would be able to withstand the forces.</p>

I was specifically referencing that he said &quot;the acceleration of the engines sustains the velocity&quot; but if the velocity is being maintained and I mean im pretty sure he isn&#39;t referencing that the plane was dropping because that would be acceleration but wouldn&#39;t have much to do with the velocity as neither would turns, therefore my hypothesis that he doesn&#39;t understand acceleration</p>

<p>Have you heard of momentum? Did you know that during a car collision, the front bumper can be completely stopped while the back bumper is still moving in the direction of travel?</p>

<p>That&#39;s how the tail of an aircraft travelling at over 530 miles per hour can compress itself right into the fucking nose of the plane. All that mass compressing into a hardened wad and releasing more energy than a railgun.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how an aluminium aircraft can cut through steel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, then I believe you&#39;re at an impasse.<br/>
Clearly, a plane cannot crash <em>through</em> the ground, so an explosion is expected at the point of impact. However, in the case of 9/11, the plane crashed <em>through</em> the building since the facade is not a rigid, solid wall. It makes sense <em>to me</em> that the exploding fuel (a fluid) is able to largely pass through to the other side of the building. I don&#39;t know what to say if you can&#39;t consider the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I mean is that a plane crashing into the ground or a body of water won&#39;t crash <em>through</em> to the other side. There is no other side of the ground or a body of water. The plane clearly won&#39;t pass to the other side of the earth. Do you see how the two aren&#39;t comparable?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that very picture helps explain why a plane might better enter the building than water. There&#39;s open space filled with air behind that exterior. I&#39;m sure a significant portion (likely a large majority) of the building&#39;s cross section is open air. That&#39;s room for a plane at high speed to enter, break apart, and partially break through to the other side. Structures bend and break, and that space allows them to do so more easily. With a body of water, there is zero open space. I think that&#39;s a big difference. </p>

<p>I think your comparison would be better if you compared the, say, 100 ft deep body of water to a 100 ft thick wall of steel. That&#39;s not what the building was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s an argument anymore about the controlled demolition theory. </p>

<p>The real focus should be on why wasn&#39;t there a broadcasted investigation like say the California shooting? Why were their passports on a sidewalk? How did we know who was responsible within hours? Why were the media interviewing actors about what they saw? There are ton of questions that went unanswered. 15 years later we all know the truth there&#39;s no reason to deny it. The government has done an amazing job of putting negative light around any conspiracies about 9/11 to the point where the title of this post is a damn joke to most of this site. </p>

<p>The answer is simple, they needed a reason to invade the Middle East so they put all the pieces in place and turned their heads until it was over. Even 15 years later we are still over there for the very thing we sought after, oil. Now there is a new boogey man and we have current refugee system in place that could allow it all to happen again. The fact that they tried to turn the Cali shooting into a gun and Internet control argument should be a red flag to anyone about the true agendas. </p>
