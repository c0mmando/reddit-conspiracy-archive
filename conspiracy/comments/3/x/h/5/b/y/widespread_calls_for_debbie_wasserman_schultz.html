        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">228</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-12-19 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/AssuredlyAThrowAway.html">AssuredlyAThrowAway</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>(I could not find a news article regarding the above developments, so I have decided to write one).</p>

<p>In a drastic turn of events Friday evening, tens of thousands of democrats have embroiled the party in a scandal regarding the leadership of DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz.  Party leadership appeared shaken as more than 214,800 people signed on to an online petition lambasting the treatment of the Sanders camp by DNC leadership in light of a breach of contract which saw the Sanders camp temporarily denied access to instrumental voter phone bank data through Friday evening; MoveOn.org collected another 250,000 petition signatures while Democracy for America collected 100,000.</p>

<p>A separate petition on the MoveOn.org site, calling for the immediate resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz,  has gathered 40,000 signatures <a href="http://petitions.moveon.org/sign/remove-debbie-wasserman">within the first 24 hours</a>, staffers at the newly launched Assuredly A News Agency are working to independently verify these numbers. </p>

<p>Having previously served as campaign co-chair for Hillary Clinton&#39;s 2008 unsuccessful run for President; Ms. Schultz has already been faced with longstanding questions among the democratic base with regards to her impartiality during the hotly contested primary race between Senator Sanders and the Clinton political machine (which, some suggest, has seen little turnover since the failed 2008 cycle).</p>

<p>Earlier on Friday Democracy for America issued a statement from Executive Director Charles Chamberlain saying, “The Democratic National Committee’s decision to attack the campaign that figured out the problem, rather than go after the vendor that made the mistake, is profoundly damaging to the party’s Democratic process. DNC leaders should immediately reverse this disturbing decision before the committee does even more to bring its neutrality in the race for President into question.”</p>

<p>The Sanders campaign, in contrast, was more reserved in tone as they marked the about-face turn of party leadership;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The about face came late on Friday night as a deadline neared for a hearing on a motion for an emergency injunction which the Sanders campaign sought after he sued the party in U.S. District Court in Washington.</p>

<p>The lawsuit sought the “immediate restoration” of the campaign’s access to the voter database. It argued that without the database, the campaign would lose some $600,000 a day in donations.</p>

<p>The campaign’s access to the database should be restored by Saturday morning in time for the campaign staff and volunteers to contact voters over the weekend.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not withstanding the seemingly tense atmosphere within the leadership, this evening&#39;s Democratic National Debate (ABC, 8 ET) is primed to serve as a powder keg for this series of factional crises within the DNC; as Mr. Sanders will look to cast the actions of cooperating factions within the party as a threat to his soaring populist movement, while Hilary will seek to deflect attacks against the bias of party leadership in favor of her candidacy.</p>

<p>I admit I voted for him, but it was for the hope that the status quo would change. Now I am more inclined to think that he&#39;s been a puppet all along.</p>

<p>Who knows? Maybe a gay president will be the next puppet.</p>
