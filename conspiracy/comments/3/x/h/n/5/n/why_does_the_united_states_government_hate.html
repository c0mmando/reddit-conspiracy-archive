    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever tried any psychedelics personally? Have you ever tried marijuana? </p>

<p>In my experience, psychedelics allow you to view yourself in an unbiased light. They allow you to view other people and objects in an unbiased light too. </p>

<p>When viewing yourself, you become aware of the different layers of your physical and mental awareness. Physically, you feel all the bones in your body, your blood, your muscles. You feel every inch of your intestinal tract. You feel parts of your body that your mind otherwise chooses to ignore. Mentally, you notice that you have several different dialogues and perspectives running simultaneously at once. Jung talks a lot about these different levels of awareness in an attempt to separate and discuss the function of each <a href="http://www.mind-development.eu/jung.html">link.</a> On a trip, if you are so inclined, you can easily distinguish between them and feel their individual effects. It&#39;s an experience that&#39;s difficult to describe and truly it&#39;s something you have to experience yourself.</p>

<p>Psychedelics can cause you to feel more introspective than you might typically be under normal circumstances. You can snap out of depression, you can snap out of OCD behaviors, anxiety, anger, etc. You are able to more easily identify and understand these behaviors in yourself. For me personally, I had the realization that anxiety was dominating a huge portion of my life, and all of it was completely unjustified-- merely a story I told myself. A story that my brain concocted and repeated ad nauseum. Everybody has a different experience examining their own mental state and their daily perspective. In a healthy mind, you may not experience these particular things, but you will begin to develop a better understanding of how you form your thoughts and habits. </p>

<p>When I say that psychedelics let you see objects in an unbiased light, this concept may be even more difficult to explain. Personally when I&#39;m under the influence of psychedelics, I see everyday objects as being <em>very</em> foreign. Buildings and rooms, their contents, they all seem artificial. Their construction seems strange. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn&#39;t question why rooms are square. Logically I know it saves on building materials while maxing out available floor space. During a trip, I wonder instead why we build walls at all. They seem to contain, separate, and trap us so unnecessarily. I think about how they&#39;re made to divide us from each other, how we are fixated on privacy. I wonder what we have to hide from each other and why we&#39;re so afraid to show our true selves. Obviously when sober, you think about these matters differently, but I&#39;d argue ego has a lot to do with it!</p>

<p>Now for the hippy trip stuff that only those who have experienced psychedelics can accept. You feel a stronger connection to the natural world. Everything is breathing, and I don&#39;t mean visually that you see things breathing, although this is a common hallucination. Everything is teeming with life! Colors are so vibrant. There are a myriad of sensations to be discovered and felt and experienced. 
I was visiting New Mexico last winter and took some mushrooms. I went outside to find everything had been covered in a layer of light snow and frost. A bush had been covered so completely in ice, all of it&#39;s red buds were like little vibrant cherries. The ice felt so smooth and cold I couldn&#39;t resist running my fingers over it again and again, even though I knew it was freezing my fingers. The night sky was endless velvet. All of the trees were alive and swaying. Trees move <em>a lot more</em> than we notice typically. They&#39;re stretching and reaching and yawning just as much as any of us. </p>

<p>Why am I telling you all of this when you simply asked what the government is worried about? Well, having an experience like this makes you realize that money doesn&#39;t matter at all. Your career doesn&#39;t matter at all. Most importantly you realize that peace and harmony with your fellow man is the only thing we should strive for. You see that any bad actions or thoughts are just a sickness in an individual&#39;s mind. We take bad thoughts and turn them into bad actions. Our bad actions create bad thoughts in others and the evil cycle continues. Even if you&#39;re not religious, if you trip, you understand and sympathize with the teaching of jesus, of buddha, you want people to be good to each other and stop worrying about petty things that occupy our time. You realize tv and media are largely programming and controlling people. It influences their emotions and strums at their feelings carelessly. You just want harmony and peace. </p>

<p>Governments can&#39;t rule efficiently if they can&#39;t control the minds of the governed. They can&#39;t create wars when the people won&#39;t fight in them. They can&#39;t create disparity when people work together. You can&#39;t control someone who thinks for themselves. </p>

<p>I realize that this doesn&#39;t sound academic. I&#39;m just trying to share with you my experience and understanding as best as I can. I think that our language hasn&#39;t developed enough to properly discuss these topics. I think that the majority of the things I attempted to express are the very fringe of what is considered to be the human experience, something we probe occasionally, but haven&#39;t devoted enough time to understanding. In our modern society, &quot;practical&quot; subjects such as chemistry, engineering, and mathematics are held in a higher regard than social sciences such as philosophy and literature. Our western scientific methods have so far been reductionist. Exclusive. Fact seeking. There is nothing wrong with that type of science! There are other methods of inquiry that we have to explore, especially when first starting out on the journey to understanding the mind however. </p>

<p>You can dissect the brain, label it&#39;s parts. Know everything about it&#39;s critical functions, and yet, it would fail to describe what it means to be a thinking individual. What it means to have thoughts and what it means to have a human experience-- these are questions equally worth exploring philosophically. </p>

<p>If this post seems like an acid trip in and of itself, then maybe I got close to answering your question. </p>

<p>If you want to know more about the philosophy of taking drugs, drug culture, and drug policy, I heavily recommend reading the works of Timothy Leary, Terence McKenna, and Rick Strassmen to start. </p>

<p>I hope you will excuse me if this post got too long for you! Cheers!  </p>

<p>Edit: a few mistakes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you live in a metro area, look for a <em>botanica</em>.  This is a syncretic voodoo-jesus spanish religious shamanism shop.  They have jesus candles and incense and other weird shit like bat blood and different woods.  Ask them for raw herb <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimosa_tenuiflora">tepezcohuite or jurema</a></em>, for &#39;burns&#39;.  If you know spanish they will trust you.  If you are white, be very nice and open to the experience.  This is Mimosa tenuiflora root bark.  They may have ground in pills--this is good also.  Pay cash, tell no one.</p>

<p>Now find an Iranian / Syrian grocery.  Go there, look for Asphand/Esphand. These are syrian rue seeds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peganum_harmala">Peganum Harmala</a>, burned as incense against the &#39;evil eye&#39;. </p>

<p><a href="https://erowid.org/chemicals/ayahuasca/ayahuasca_info11.shtml">Staring with</a> 1-3g of the seeds, ground on an empty stomach and then 10g of tepezcohuite would do it.  Start small and wait a day in between attempts.  Taking more than 2g of seeds is bad, these are dangerous.  I&#39;ve had a friend who had a very bad reaction from trying to have a psychedlic experience on the syrian rue seeds alone.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is an <em>urban pharmahuasca recipe</em> that is as I understand it, legal.  It&#39;s a trip but not like real ayahuasca as the real thing has many more &#39;helper plants&#39;.  Don&#39;t do it alone, have a sitter.  You can take ground herb in pill or brew a tea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws permitting immediate search, or &quot;no knock&quot; entry, against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations. But <strong>a government could also supply drugs to help control a population.</strong> This method, foreseen by Aldous Huxley in Brave New World (1932), has the governing element employing drugs selectively to manipulate the governed in various ways.&quot; - Louis Jolyon West, Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory. 1975. p. 298.</p>

<p>For those trying to understand the history of psychedelics and social control, all of the articles in the series <a href="http://www.gnosticmedia.com/SecretHistoryMagicMushroomsProject">The Secret History of Magic Mushrooms</a> are recommended reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Psychedelics are the chemical equivalent of the &quot;THEY LIVE&quot; sunglasses.  You take them and then you see how society <em>really</em> is and you start to doubt other messaging by cultural engineers.  You begin to realize that Terence McKenna was right--that culture is <em>not</em> your friend.  That it tries everything it can, to have you give up your powers of personal sovereignty and personal life direction in favor of supporting an economy that betrays you every day and lies to your face of empty promises.  Ultimately this society of the Spectacle depletes your wealth, your energy and your spirit until there&#39;s nothing--and then it has you continually support it, replenish it, so that the matrix can inflict itself upon your children and theirs, eternally, until an actual resistance is mounted.</p>

<p>This is why psychedelis are more dangerous than a million atomic bombs or psychotronic weapons or anything like this.  It&#39;s a superweapon, used against hierarchies.  It destroys authority itself by giving it back to the user.  It&#39;s difficult to have a society where everyone is soverign.  </p>

<p>Because fearful leaders think that this means chaos and banditry; whereas people who have actually taken psychedelics experience a union with others and understand that you have to cooperate in order to move on to the next level, and so the idea of banditry is absolutely impossible for those who &quot;get the message&quot;, the cosmic call, experience the mind of God almighty, the one, the only the everything.  <strong><em>Its&#39; very difficult for people who get this message to suffer the goddamned foolishness and fearfulness and fearscaping and fearmongering of petty people  (NORMALS, PINKs, BOZOs) who have never done psychedelics and therefore just &#39;get in the way&#39; of our evolution into a starfaring people who understand the critical necessity of altruism for all beings.</em></strong></p>

<p>The CIA introduced psychedelics to the US population, CIA connected media companies like the Luce empire spent decades advertising psychedelics, and spooky types like &quot;Bear&quot; of the Grateful Dead - real name Augustus Owsley Stanley III - spent decades manufacturing and distributing psychedelics to the population - sometimes for free!</p>

<p>The real question is &quot;why does the US government use and promote psychedelics so often?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically you have what&#39;s known as axioms of truth. You believe something is true because they&#39;re based on other things you know are true etc, etc. </p>

<p>You wont accept something that doesn&#39;t fit into your perceived truths. </p>

<p>Psychedelics change your perception on reality which effect the core levels of these truths. It makes it easier to accept the fact that other core truths you hold could be wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The government hates psychedelics because the first thing that happens is you see through the bullshit of propaganda, advertising and social engineering that they impose on you.  The first thing you say is, &quot;what is this bullshit...<em>&quot;They&quot;</em> are trying to get me to believe&quot;. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like the film, <em>&quot;They live&quot;</em>, except instead of xray sunglasses, it&#39;s your mind and whole world that&#39;s now tuned into a totally different frequency that sees the psychopathic reptard talking heads as the conniving shits they are. Some are more reptilian than others (ann coulter, carly fiorina, the bushes, bill oreilly, dick cheney, everyone on fox and cnn, even bill maher and steven colbert come to mind).</p>

<p>Clearly, governments hate any kind of drug that auto-deprograms a person from their manufactured spectacle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my experience, truck stops, fast food restaurants, and music festivals always have someone who knows where to look. Do you have friends that smoke regularly? Their guy might know a guy, etc. You need to expand your network of people a bit to find them, something which I don&#39;t care to do. It just comes down to knowing the right people, unfortunately.</p>
