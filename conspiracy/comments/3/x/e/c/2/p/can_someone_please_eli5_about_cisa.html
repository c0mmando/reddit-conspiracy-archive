    <div class="md"><p>CISA is pretty long. There are a lot of shitty points to it. Give me a minute, and I&#39;ll go through what I found</p>

<p>It gives companies immunity in submitting your data to the federal government.</p>

<p>it gives permanent immunity to private contractors building, maintaining, and working on the systems collecting and storing the data of innocent citizens. If it&#39;s hacked due to negligence, then there&#39;s nobody held responsible</p>

<p>the bill expires in ten years, but any action taken under this bill will extend the bill for the life of the action (a never-ending war declared on cyberterror makes this a permanent law)</p>

<p>any federal agency has the ability to save and use your data for almost any reason. CISA defined a &quot;cybersecurity risk&quot; as an entire list of things from an online threat of bodily harm to leaking corporate trade secrets.</p>

<p>The federal government has the ability to declare a state of emergency, and this gives them the power to take control of and shut down any network (from FBI databases to things like Twitter, due to loopholes)</p>

<p>None of the databases or networks storing or transmitting your data have to be encrypted if it&#39;s determined to be unnecessary, or too cumbersome to implement.</p>

<p>immunity is granted to any monitoring of any informations systems</p>

<p>antitrust exemptions for companies working together against cyberthreats. This loophole could be exploited to take out competitors to create a duopoly (for example, Mcdonalds and Burger King team up to share info about an imminent attack on fast food restaurants and the attack takes out Wendy&#39;s, Subway, etc)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but people need to fight to take it back from the slippery slope we&#39;re on. </p>

<p>That whole &quot;First they came for...</p>

<p>&quot;and then they came for me&quot; proverb is happening to us now. I&#39;d say it started with the Patriot Act, but it may have been sooner. (I know people hate to hear G-S)</p>

<p>Shit is going to happen to us as a country that will make us scared. Scared people back bad decisions and tend to go overboard with policy changes. What we have to learn as a society is that it&#39;s OK to be scared. It&#39;s not OK to panic, make snap decisions, and give up or compromise the civil rights the founders of our country made sure the citizens had. </p>

<p>The Patriot Act was a mistake.</p>

<p>Extending it was another mistake.</p>

<p>CISA is a third strike of equal magnitude. We need to fight to take this country back, and fast. We will not live in constant fear, as constant fear is a form of oppression. We cant accept th fear of being attacked or fear of our own elected representatives selling the Bill of Rights to pay for our defense and sense of security.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its time to rethink the internet.  Just because the government decided it should have power over it doesnt mean we cant create something new that funtions differently.  They dont just automatically become the ultimate authority on anything they wish just because it exists.</p>

(Yes, I know I&#39;m talking crazy but you never know what you dont know, right?)  Nothing automatically gives them the right to regulate this creation.

<p>what we need is encryption.</p>

<p>encrypt everything, emails, chats, browsing, even if you&#39;re not doing anything illegal. in fact, it&#39;s far more usefull to do it, if <em>you&#39;re not doing anything illegal</em> ... just create some noise. if everything is encrypted they can&#39;t track shit.</p>

<p>ok, so what if ... what if we start a open source project, make some software to track and make a profile of every person on the internet... sorta like facebook and google is doing. but instead, open source it, put it on github and allow anyone in the world access to this data...</p>

<p>you think Europe is any better? UK is basically a child puppet to the states, Germany hasn&#39;t done anything but destroy the economy of half the Europe. France is quickly becoming totalitarian state. Sweden will be the first cashless society, favoring, the people or the bank owners? Switzerland is basically a money laundering machine for mafia since its inception. who else? it&#39;s all rigged and faked.</p>

<p>it&#39;s the same everywhere. the global elite have the whole world under their command and if we&#39;re gonna fix it, we&#39;re gonna need a global revolution.</p>
