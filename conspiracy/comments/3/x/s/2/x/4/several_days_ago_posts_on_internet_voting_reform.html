<p>Highly suspect if you ask me. It&#39;s almost as if they are trying to derail, disprove, and subvert the power of internet voting.  </p>

<p>We are in deep trouble 2016 people. Wake up and look at the candidates. Some even have histories of server fraud while they were employed by the government. One candidate was illegally using servers, and wiped them clean before handing them over. You can  guarantee there will be election fraud in 2016. This is why we NEED to run a nation wide blockchain based voting internet election in 2016 to use alongside of the antiquated and fraudster voting system in place now. If we get the nation to vote on the internet too we can cross compare these numbers to the NES&#39; &quot;official&quot; tally. We need to implement a new voting system where users can vote swiftly, safely, and privately over the internet. This type of internet voting can be achieved with blockchain related technologies. Cryptography based voting is the key to a peaceful democratic future for the United States. With internet voting like VoteCoin / Vote-Coin / VoteToken the Americans can seamlessly take firm control of their liberties, and freedoms, by voting directly for the candidate and issues and removing the hordes of middle men. This takes out the lobbying, money grabbing, the pandering, the monarchically funded election road shows, it takes out the TV NES &quot;vote count&quot; system. This would put all the votes on a VoteChain (blockchain) technology. There are forces out trying to sabotage internet voting and blockchain voting concept. Stealing the headlines with obscure tech that is not necessary for internet voting.  The press and media are not covering internet voting, they are down playing and marginalizing it, and misstating the facts.You can read where VoteCoin was talked about early on here:  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1g350g/could_bitcoin_the_blockchain_and_p2p_currency/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1g350g/could_bitcoin_the_blockchain_and_p2p_currency/</a> I read this man went on to publish the VoteCoin site here <a href="https://votecoin.wordpress.com">https://votecoin.wordpress.com</a>. The &quot; voting machine&quot; concept today is laughable, and is too fallible. A physical machine can be completely eliminated with an internet voting system with 2 step authentication system, which is a well known and tested technology! There are 380,000,000 Americans, and it&#39;s a huge waste of resources for people to take off work, having to drive to a facility, wait in the lines, deal with volunteers and obscure paper ballots, and then to never be able to see if their vote even counted! Internet voting is the only logical evolution in our democracy.</p>

<p>Hilary just made even more of a foolish cunt put of herself. &quot;Hey, we need something to get at criminals when we have a reason to.&quot; it&#39;s called a warrant. You get it from a judge, who decides if you need it since, you know, it&#39;s what the constitution calls for, and since you can&#39;t trust people who make their money and promotions catching &quot;bad guys&quot; to decide who needs their privacy invaded. 
&quot;I don&#39;t actually understand the technology that I&#39;m arguing against or arguing for at all, I&#39;m just telling you that I want more power.&quot; for real. She said stuff needs to change, then said she doesn&#39;t actually understand the stuff she thinks needs changing.</p>

<p>ROFL yeah you know you have struck intellectual gold when only bots are commenting on your posts, and down voting them to shit. Dude if they put that 70 year old fraudster lady in the &quot;white house&quot; the US is fucked. We are just sitting here in the UK cracking jokes on it... though we have the queen so not really that different I guess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If only it wasn&#39;t possible. I don&#39;t know why the dnc would even let her run after Bengazi and the email leaks. But, alas, it is possible she will be elected, voter fraud or not. The stuff this guy is talking about actually has more pertinent issues, like the government bullshitting its was into bypassing the constitutional procedures on lawful search and seizure. She&#39;s promising something that only congress can do. And she&#39;s promising a law, which would be illegal because of the constitutional. But America isn&#39;t exactly a rational country. The politicians are actors are puppets, and the people are subdued or at least inactive.</p>
