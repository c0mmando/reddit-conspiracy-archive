        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is it conformation bias to assume that a type of person exists that would do everything in his power to satisfy whatever whim happens to occupy their fancy for that particular moment? </p>

<p>That these individuals would naturally gravitate towards positions of power simply <em>because</em> they are willing to do things that others would deem monstrous? If someone has been found to lie repeatedly, is it wise to believe any new thing they say?</p>

<p>If you talk to a person in the street about how they feel about the level of representation they receive from their government, do you often hear that they feel the government is doing a good job? Are they passionate about the opportunities they have to see their particular concerns addressed in a clear way that attempts to be beneficial to all parties involved?</p>

<p>Do people often tell you stories about how they were glad that peace officers were on hand to prevent violence and deescalate dramatic situations? Do people talk about how they live in a society that will let someone stumble, but won&#39;t let let them fall flat on their face? That because they pay a bit of a paycheck they have a real safety net they can depend on?</p>

<p>Do you know many Americans with the free time to do things like participate in political events? Perhaps even better, do you know many Americans with the <em>desire</em> to participate in political events? In a nation of approximately 350 million, ~40% of families make less than 40k a year. Should we tell congress to increase bootstrap imports?</p>

<p>Most people are not active politically in any sense, save once every four years when the media starts making money hand over fist to inundate the population with a blitz of campaign ads. The nation puts on the team colors and goes to the circus. Someone wins, and everyone goes home and goes to sleep for another four years, covered in elephant and donkey shit.</p>

<p>Why are most Americans apathetic to the political process? Ignorance, Resignation, and Cognitive Dissonance. </p>

<p>An inquisitive mind, an internet connection, and a paltry speck of empathy its all it takes to see the layer of muck that lurks just under the surface of this American system. It is not unusual to be sickened enough to simply turn away. </p>

<p>Do any of you honestly believe that electing new politicians can fix these things?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t even think a majority of those who vote think a politician can fix anything, but rather vote because they fear the other party&#39;s candidate will break things more. Even many of the candidates quite candidly state this as one of their strongest benefits. In the last Republican debates, everyone was saying how they will prevent Clinton from being the next president, and vice versa in the Democratic debate.</p>

<p>The only major exceptions I really see to this general rule are for the outsider candidates. We saw it with Obama in 2008 (who was not even remotely an outsider candidate, just appeared that way), Ron Paul in 2012 (who was I think a fairly outside candidate), and Trump and Sanders in this election. I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s everyone who votes for these candidates who think they have a chance to fix things, but it&#39;s a significantly higher percentage.</p>

<p>I think the fundamental realization (or maybe just one important one) is that the united states is not a democracy, nor a republic, nor even a mere plutocratic oligarchy; it is the latest manifestation of Empire. </p>

<p>Empire cannot be reformed. It&#39;s very workings are not subject to the whims of individuals, nor bureaucrats nor even the oligarchs that would try to use it for their own enrichment. People either act in furtherance of the goals of Empire or ejected from positions of power within it. </p>

<p>Empire cannot be overthrown. Sure, one could argue that it has been overthrown in a military or MIC coup, and that probably wouldn&#39;t be inaccurate, but it&#39;s more nominal than actual. New people in positions of power, but the system proceeds as is. Meet the new boss...</p>

<p>I would contend that the only way to defeat Empire is to starve it, and there are really two ways this could happen. One is just to stop giving it fuel. Stop producing and consuming from it; grow your own food, limit your usage of industrial products and energy, stop feeding the beast. </p>

<p>The other way is to let the machine consume itself. I would argue this is what happened to Rome. Now with Rome, Empire did not really disappear, it just changed form and went somewhat underground as the RCC. </p>

<p>The tree of Empire can whither, but the seed is ever-present. As long as man is able to have dominion over his fellow man, the world will tend toward Empire. I don&#39;t know how to keep the seed from sprouting or the sapling from growing, but I know that awareness of the tendency is essential.</p>

<p>You are correct of course, and it&#39;s a god damn shame that this is the motivation that gets americans into voting booths. No other job selects candidates on the basis of who will fuck up less.  How about people that only fuck up every once in a while or <em>gasp</em> people that have qualifications other than &quot;sociopath&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And do everything in your power to accelerate the process. No brakes? Fuck it hit the gas.</p>

<p>I could not agree more. There can be no real freedom under dominion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure it &quot;fixes&quot; things. Fix as in preventing change and fix as in the elections are &quot;fixed&quot;. </p>

<p>It can also fix things for corporations. Because of the &quot;change we can believe in&quot; the banks no longer have to worry about bailouts, the issue of going to the government has been &quot;fixed&quot;, now the bailout is guaranteed. It also fixes things for the government. Obama &quot;fixed&quot; due process. Now the government can kill, invade your home, privacy, and freeze your funds, lock you up, etc. without the &quot;problem&quot; of due process.</p>

<p>As for benefits to the average voter, the issues which would help fix our problems are not open for discussion during elections: see Ron Paul.</p>

1) Person gets elected by riding the popular opinion wave
2) Person convinced himself/herself that they will change everything and be loved by many
3) Person gets inaugurated.
4) then the secret panel tells them &quot;Look, you have some great ideas but they won&#39;t work, here&#39;s why&quot;
5) Person starts aging at a very fast rate.
6) Person gets re-elected because Americans don&#39;t like change.
7) Person becomes lame duck, with a fuck you attitude
8) They leave office and make millions by speaking</p>

Clinton was just personally ambitious (or had a very ambitious wife), Obama was likely groomed since a rather early age, HW was a lifelong CIA man from a powerful family and his son was just following in the family business. Reagan and Nixon were Bohemian Grove. Carter might have been sincere; his administration was chock full of Rockefeller Trilateral Commission members, but that might reflect naïveté more so than complicity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pot legalization, gay marriage, abortion, and other such social issues are palliatives to persuade the masses that they have a say in government and distract them from the economic and authoritarian aspects of the system. For those affected by these issues, they are important to an extent, but they have nowhere near the effect that other issues do.</p>

<p>The Princeton study from a couple years ago shows quite conclusively that the political opinion of average Americans has no statistical influence on policy, while the opinion of elites and business interest groups is positively correlated with policy decisions.</p>

<p>I would agree with you that locally, political action and activism can have actual results.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe. But what do you think he&#39;ll realistically be able to accomplish?  I think he would be less inclined to intervene in foreign affairs either militarily or through covert regime change, but a lot of that is directed by the deep state, with less input and control from the president than is commonly portrayed. </p>

<p>If the House retains a Republican majority, which it likely will due to gerrymandering and voter turnout, it&#39;s unlikely that he will be able to pass any meaningful legislation on any of the issues he&#39;s been running on. We&#39;ll see more of the same gridlock that has been characteristic of Congress for the last 7 years. Approval for Congress is at all time lows, but incumbents&#39; reelection rates are still sky-high. He&#39;ll get one or two proposals through in a watered down form, but that&#39;s it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll probably still vote for him in the primary as a vote of disapproval toward Hillary if he&#39;s still in the race when my late voting states holds its polls, but I don&#39;t expect much in the way of results if he wins. I think he&#39;s the least authoritarian and hawkish of the major candidates, and I do agree at least in principle with his diagnosis of economic issues in America, but I&#39;m not sure if his solutions are much more than bandaids on a system and political ideology that&#39;s rotten to its core.</p>

<p>Again, what, specifically? Let&#39;s say he&#39;s not an establishment shill and the he genuinely want to effect the change he&#39;s campaigning on, he&#39;d still have to deal with the Congress, and even if he were to somehow get a Democratic House <em>and</em> Senate, a significant enough portion of congressional democrats are equally establishment whores. Every one of his policy positions require passing meaningful legislation. </p>

<p>I think you could make a much stronger case that Ron Paul would have been able to effect the change he spoke of, as he could have done a lot merely by vetoing bills.</p>

<p>Your position seems somewhat contradictory to me if I understand you right: you think democracy is a sham (I agree) but that if one man were elected president, he could actually bring meaningful change to the system?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t this question itself somewhat defeatist logic, that if someone doesn&#39;t have the solution for a problem they see, that they should not point out the problem? Wouldn&#39;t continuing to participate in a system you believe to be broken only because you do not currently have a viable alternative be defeatist?</p>

<p>Being able to identify a problem and being able to identify a solution to a problem are related skills for sure, but having one does not imply that one has the other. In pointing out the to problem to others, OP may inspire someone to come up with a solution to a problem they had not considered before. Maybe OP does have a solution in mind, but would rather let the conversation develop and see what solutions or objections to his premise are offered before proposing his own solution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got other rhetoric that isn&#39;t defeatist, but I don&#39;t think solutions involve any rhetoric at all. You can get 31 flavors of rhetoric on any party ticket you choose. They all taste the same though.</p>

<p>If you are critical of my viewpoint, please tell us of your &quot;solutions&quot; to problems like the ones described. There are none, because too many people refuse to acknowledge them as such.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that American demlcracy is a sham because the winner is pre-determined and the voting process is an illusion. If that process worked properly and dumb people were not manipulated by media then people would be voting for Bernie. Hillary is going to be the next president and the next year is just a formality. The banks and multinats are behind psychopathic Hillary.</p>

<p>What he has to say about everything is supportive a burgeoning middle class rather than neofeudal serfdom by banksters.</p>

<p>Not hard to understand.</p>
