Mine was about the refugees but some of them were about politics, economy, etc...</p>

<p>When I told the class that I disagreed with all that info and that some of those things were lies, everyone laughed and they even said &quot;Cmon, how could this be a lie if it is on TV&quot;. I eventualy agreed with them because everyone thinking that you are weirdo while you are in highschool is a bit inconvienient.</p>

<p>However, I wish that I didnt have to step back on what I said and that people understood that what is showed on the news is controlled and that we only get the info that they want us to get.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  The owners of the media have convinced people that they can&#39;t/won&#39;t lie.  People can see there are liars in the media---for instance, some people prefer &quot;the truth&quot; espoused by Fox over &quot;the lies&quot; of MSNBC---yet they think their chosen medium would never lie, and that the media may make mistakes occasionally, or &quot;spin&quot; stories differently, but overall they try to tell the truth.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s just not true.  What if a media owner could make a fortune if a war started in a certain part of the world?  What if that media owner pushed propaganda in order to foment a war in that area?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t change their minds for them. Comfort yourself that those who couldn&#39;t believe what you said are drones stuck in the hivemind and you are not. Attempt to find others like yourself, though I know they are few. I comfort myself by watching the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3xacx0/z/cy301gv">&quot;truth bomb&quot; videos</a> that pop up in my YT feed every day. Maybe some of these videos from these people will help you find stronger words to help convince those sitting on the fence at your high school.</p>

<p>Remember, high school is literally an indoctrination center. You and the others who sit with you are not there to have creative, original thought. You are meant to consume the official narrative and regurgitate it back...nothing more. I know standing alone is difficult, especially in high school, but do not continue accepting the hivemind narrative as your own. Set yourself apart. Make others curious. If they never become curious, that is on them. Know that you have the courage to question the authority of the te-lie-vision screen and wait for good opportunities to break the matrix for the curious if/when they ask you questions. You did a brave thing already by originally disagreeing. Don&#39;t back down. Much love to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s sad to see the burden of proof taken away from the government and media and placed on the shoulders of the individual, who has the least access to being able to provide evidence that would make up the burden of proof they are required to provide.</p>

<p>The government can say whatever it wants, anonymously, and have it parroted by the major media outlets, and saying that it is not true and that it hasn&#39;t been shown to be true is nearly impossible for someone without the resources of the government or major media networks.</p>

<p>Even if a person can show it not to be true, they then don&#39;t have the means to engage in an information campaign against the media/government.</p>

<p>You can prove it, but only to a limited number of people. This was the case with Gary Webb. He showed the CIA introduced crack into south central LA. He worked for a small-time paper and then moved to the early internet, but people were hearing what he was about through the NYT, WaPo and LATimes. They distorted and challenged his message using only anonymous sources. Unless you were paying close attention to Gary Webb directly, would you even hear about crack being introduced by the CIA to south central. The other papers were saying he was making wild accusations about the CIA turning a blind eye as their convenient bed-fellows were supplying some coke.</p>

<p>So for most people, it becomes a &quot;reasonable&quot; act: the CIA needs to further democracy abroad and in order to do so, they need to close their eye to some things the &quot;lesser of two evils&quot; is doing.</p>

<p>In reality, the CIA were helping promote the drug war, making a cheap, highly addictive and long-lasting drug reach millions of people. They were creating a crack epidemic to justify a police state. </p>

<p>But, you can&#39;t point this out, because people &quot;know&quot; all about it from the NYT and the NYT provides them a comforting perspective, while yours challenges their worldview and accepting it places them in the fringe. </p>

<p>Propaganda doesn&#39;t work because it is convincing, well-supported, and reflects reality. It works because people are herd animals looking to the person they&#39;ve decided to be the leader of herd and taking direction from them. They will not listen to you not because you are not more convincing, not because your view isn&#39;t more insightful on the true state of things, not because you are not leading them in a better direction, but because you are not the head of the herd.</p>

<p>To lose the herd, they need to lack direction in a time of crisis, but when the crises are created and directed by them, they already have the direction in place to lead the herd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you did the right thing. stay strong. and yeah it&#39;s ok to bend a little from social pressure esp when it feels overwhelming while you are standing in front of the class. the good thing is you put those ideas out there, they heard you, even if they disagreed with you. keep trying - you may find a way to communicate your ideas and also keep your friends. the best thing to do is ask the questions out loud you are asking in your mind. you don&#39;t have to provide the answers, it&#39;s more interesting for people to seek the answers with you then to be told them. but there are so many lies in the news you can start with even small ones --  to continue to spark the curiosity of your friends. -- keep on speaking your mind and over time your friends will hear you. you are right. but it&#39;s a scary idea the news may be lying. and most of your peers are going to resist. you but are right, and even if your friends don&#39;t know it yet - you got a large part of the greater public on your side. </p>

<p>Thanks for that thoughtful chuckle. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it funny how quickly the social &quot;norms&quot; of that situation snapped you right back into consensus with the group? </p>

<p>The question I&#39;d ask myself there is &quot;are these the kind of people whose opinions I care about upsetting&quot;?</p>

<p>If the answer to that question is no, then get used to that weirdo bit because it will follow you for the rest of your life. After high school, people will find that part about you enjoyable and it will cease to be weird.</p>

<p>If the answer to the question is yes, well... You&#39;ll soon learn to stop asking questions about what you are told to believe.</p>
