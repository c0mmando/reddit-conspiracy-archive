    <div class="md"><p>The earth is the only place that we are.  Why should we be on something that is similar to what we see in the sky?  To me this comes down to a trick of labeling:  call what we see in the sky planets, call what we are on a planet and then there is an expectation that they should be similar.  </p>

<p>The questions that are being asked in the OP suggest we should rethink the issue, including our assumptions based on labeling that someone else has given us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m supposed to change my original labeling to something he says cause of 7 questions I&#39;m supposed to ponder about.</p>

<p>Why haven&#39;t we found another flat &#39;earth&#39; in our sky? </p>

<p>If we&#39;re not supposed to think about celestial bodies being what they are, then tell me how they got to be &#39;ball&#39; shaped?</p>

<p>I would like to see computer simulations used for &#39;celestial body&#39; forming to try and create some flat &#39;body&#39;.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s flat, what&#39;s above and whats below, is top down circular or square? Why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are making an assumption that we are on an object in space.  The type of questions being asked challenge that assumption.  The publicly testable boundaries of our universe are at issue here.  Under the standard flat earth model Antarctica is a ring around us.  We do not have public knowledge or testability much past the edge of Antarctica.  As far as drilling down, the furthest reported drilling is around 12km down.  Equipment starts to break down at that point.  </p>

<p>As far a celestial body forming, that assumes a force of gravity.  Gravity is not as well proven a theory as you might think.  I know that sounds outlandish, but when you look into the history of how it came to be accepted, it is not so clear cut.  Demonstrating gravity on a smaller scale is a problem.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have proper answers to all your questions.  To be quite honest I can&#39;t say that I support any model 100%, but I do know that the official model doesn&#39;t work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t buy flat earth. I agree OP has good questions. I just see more questions arising about flat earth than a globe. </p>

<p>Your question is easy to answer. Flat Earth, with celestial bodies orbiting it places is at the center of the universe. Children grow to citizens believing we are the central creation of everything. You may be less inclined to torture &quot;enemy combatants&quot; for heroin profits if you realized the whole universe was observing an act that lives on for eternity. </p>

<p>A society that develops around an understanding that our lives are ordained and eternal makes appropriate complementary decisions in regards to its interactions. But a society adrift, randomly generated and destined for oblivion in a sea of potential extraterrestrial life, provides a foundation for the elevation of material over spiritual. </p>

<p>I think it was just 17 shaolin monks that withstood an army of 421. If instead of crippling spiritual belief, science explicitly promoted it, such monasteries would have developed into disconnected but mutually respectful city states at the cost of monarchies, large governments and large religions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point.  Most people already do go about their day to day lives as if they are the center of the universe, it is human nature.  Even if not true, we are the center of our own universe, our own personal story.  </p>

<p>Related to your reason of why someone would want to hide flat earth if it were true, I think so much attention is given to the theory of evolution because it supposes that we are simply the byproduct of millions of years of random genetic changes and that the only thing that matters is survival of the fittest.  Any action can be justified by the survival of the fittest mentality, in which one presupposes that because they have the ability to exert power over others this must mean that they are &quot;more fit&quot; to survive and therefore should not worry about the consequences of their actions, even if those actions destroy the lives of others.  </p>

Looking at the wiki for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon">horizon</a> we can see that the standard formula for judging  the distance to the horizon is d=roughly 3.57 multiplied by the root of the height of observation from the ground. </p>

<p>The average man (6&#39; or ~180 cm) can therefore view the horizon at about 5 km. If the earth has a circumference of roughly 25000mi(~40200Km) and you can only see 5 km out how do you expect to see significant curvature? unless your almost 100 mi up you will see a negligible amount of curvature.</p>

Looking at the wiki for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon">horizon</a> we can see that the standard formula for judging  the distance to the horizon is d=roughly 3.57 multiplied by the root of the height of observation from the ground. </p>

<p>The average man (6&#39; or ~180 cm) can therefore view the horizon at about 5 km. If the earth has a circumference of roughly 25000mi(~40200Km) and you can only see 5 km out how do you expect to see significant curvature? unless your almost 100 mi up you will see a negligible amount of curvature.</p>

<p>The notion is that the sun orbits the North Pole in increasingly larger concentric circles until it  reaches the lower tropic, then returns north again.</p>

<p>So in an hour of footage, that&#39;s 60/3=20*625= 12,500 miles!</p>

<p>Woooo!</p>

<p>Please Copernicus, show me where I can traverse 12,500 miles without encountering a single identifiable landmass!</p>

<p>The footage is fake and our world is flat.</p>

<p>Now get over it and have a lovely day!</p>

<p>Bye now.</p>

<p>Wow, you really have a grasp of how science works. Lets just throw out any old numbers to sound important! </p>

<p>That&#39;s not how the scientific method works.</p>

<p>By the way, I cant help but notice that you have no rebuttal to the lens correction distortion to the picture from earlier (or, for that matter any of my other points). That&#39;s typical of you people - when someone presents evidence, you conveniently clam up on the subject and change the subject.</p>

<p>You might be a raving loonie of the highest order, but it&#39;s been a fascinating look inside your brain.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fish eye lens, I don&#39;t feel the need to argue that point. You saying that it isn&#39;t, is not convincing evidence. </p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s actually geometry, which isn&#39;t science, it&#39;s math.</p>

<p>To appease you and the other morons who can&#39;t accurately estimate arc length, I&#39;ll measure it later, that way we can be certain exactly how much of the earth&#39;s surface we&#39;re supposed to be seeing. </p>

<p>But I can promise you there is no math that can make a globe with that arc length and rotation compatible with the planet we call earth. </p>

<p>You know, the funny thing is - you could easily verify my statement one way or the other, by simply distorting the picture yourself. But hey, that might actually be scientific method at work, and lord knows you wouldn&#39;t want to challenge your feeble assertions, lest they fall over. </p>

<p>Ooooh, someone found a dictionary and figured out a Big Word for today. Good for you, your parents must be SO proud of you.</p>

<p>No, I meant &quot;you know nothing about science&quot; in that this entire fucking theory is utter nonsense - astrophysics, astronomy, physics, geology, meteorology, really every branch of the school of science is laughing at your idiocy.</p>

<p>You know what - fuck it. It&#39;s too hot for this, I have a soccer match to go to and I have much better things to do than argue with a mongoloid. You win. Earth is flat as a fucking pancake, NASA is really run by the lizard people from the center of the earth, and we&#39;ve been lied to since Ptolemy took his measurements of the <del>globe</del> plane back in 120 AD.

    <div class="md"><p>I did a quick little test to demonstrate <a href="http://i.imgur.com/V7qhOKT.jpg?1">arc length.</a></p>

<p>Looks like this camera view is capturing a whopping 1/12 of the curvature of earth!</p>

<p>That&#39;s 2083 miles from end to end. </p>

<p>That means from camera to horizon, were viewing, at a minimum, 1,000 miles. You can confirm this when you consider that the diameter of this circle should be 12,500 miles. </p>

<p>Again, while watching the video, the horizon clears the screen in just under 3 minutes. </p>

<p>That means you&#39;re actually watching the ISS travel approximately 20,000 miles in 1 hour...which is impossible. </p>

<p>The visual mathematics of this footage purports to show that this &quot;space station&quot; travels at an impossible speed, covering 4/5 the circumference of the globe without encountering a single identifiable land mass? </p>

<p>You are delusional if you believe this to be reality. </p>

<li>Why are there no real-time high definition videos of the earth rotating on it&#39;s axis from space? Both interest and opportunity present themselves, why does no footage exist?</li>
</ol>

<p>There is. </p>

<ol>
<li>If the Van-Allen radiation belts are as toxic as today&#39;s aerospace believe them to be, how did the Apollo missions pass through them unprepared and unscathed?</li>
</ol>

<p>The same way people take X-rays. You don&#39;t want to live in the van allen belts either. Pass through. </p>

<ol>
<li>Why do we observe no curvature over vast distances where mathematically there must be curvature? Earth&#39;s atmosphere is thin, variable in density and moving constantly. Only a hard prism could refract the quality of images produced in these photos.</li>
</ol>

<p>Cool pics and it&#39;s the shitty WTC impossible math you probably used. </p>

<ol>
<li>Why does the sun form an analemma in the sky during the year? This pattern is highly irregular and incompatible without major adjustments to orbital theory?</li>
</ol>

<p>Earth has the wobble not the sun. </p>

<ol>
<li>Why have 50 developed nations signed a treaty to protect Antarctica from exploration and private interest if according to Admiral Byrd in his Antarctic expeditions it &quot;is a vast barren land wealthy in natural resources with a territory larger than the United States left unexplored?&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>To keep them all from pillaging it and giving only a few access. You can go if you have some cash. It sucks though. No casinos. </p>

<ol>
<li>Why on flight radar are no flights in the southern hemisphere tracked by GPS off shore on their intercontinental flights? While northern hemisphere flights are tracked? </li>
</ol>

<p>Where&#39;s Russia and America and why do you get to pick and chose when you refer to the Earth as a globe? </p>

<ol>
<li>What is the statistical probability that the moon and the sun are nearly identical in size in the sky? </li>
</ol>

<p>In our galaxy there are a billions of Earth scenarios.</p>

<p>In conclusion you&#39;d have an easier time convincing people the Earth is hollow. Seriously. </p>

<p>So we&#39;re three dimensional objects on a 2D surface? Wouldn&#39;t FTE make the piece of rock we&#39;re on also three dimensional?</p>

<p>So you&#39;re trying to convert minds while I can&#39;t defend them from this dark ages thought process?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point.  Most people already do go about their day to day lives as if they are the center of the universe, it is human nature.  Even if not true, we are the center of our own universe, our own personal story.  </p>

<p>Related to your reason of why someone would want to hide flat earth if it were true, I think so much attention is given to the theory of evolution because it supposes that we are simply the byproduct of millions of years of random genetic changes and that the only thing that matters is survival of the fittest.  Any action can be justified by the survival of the fittest mentality, in which one presupposes that because they have the ability to exert power over others this must mean that they are &quot;more fit&quot; to survive and therefore should not worry about the consequences of their actions, even if those actions destroy the lives of others.  </p>
