<p>the upvote/downvote model for reddit is broken.  it can be easily manipulated by mods removing legitimate posts or abused by groups that wish to push their own agenda by eliminating dissenting voices.  </p>

<p>aside from the gamergate fiasco, 4chan does not delete posts and 4chan cannot silence you with a downvote.  you either contribute something meaningful or you are ignored.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>go to /pol/.  there might be a ton of shit on there that you dont agree with, but that&#39;s what you get in a total free-speech zone.  </p>

<p>the only problem with /pol/ is its smaller userbase compared to reddit.  for example if a big news story breaks and i have a question about it i might not be able to get an answer on /pol/ but if i pull up the same thread on reddit the question is usually already asked and answered.  This has only happened to me a few times though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s complete and utter bullshit.</p>

<p>/pol/ is a place that is just as bad as liveleak. Filled to the brim with bigoted idiots and Hasbara shills. A long time ago, it was used for political discussion, but after the fiasco where the IDF got unmasked as murderous cowards, it received(and still is) a constant barrage of Israeli propaganda. </p>

<p>Now it&#39;s nothing more than a loose circlejerk American-based zio-christian group with zero support for any form of critical thinking.</p>

<p>If you want actual discussion, I&#39;d suggest investing yourself in small-time clubs that promote active political discussion IRL. Why small-time? Quite frankly, there aren&#39;t many places that are open for free thought.</p>

<p>As for on the internet, I had most succes with 1-on-1 discussions on various topics contacting blog-owners. At a certain point, you simply outgrow the hivemind, and believe me, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a BIG step up from the hivemind that exists /pol/.</p>

<p>sort of comparing apples to oranges here because /pol/ discusses all current events.  </p>

<p>also, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has become completely distracted by reddit conspiracies instead of focusing on actual corporate and government conspiracies.  i&#39;d much rather participate in a discussion on conspiracies where the website&#39;s own censorship isnt a major topic of discussion.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>About 95% of all /pol/ posts are repeating slider-threads. While this may sound alien to newcomers, for those that dwelled in /pol/ for a multitude of years you&#39;d know its a neverending spiral of the same old story held together by a set of paradigms which determines what is cool and what isn&#39;t. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s true, It indeed is a place full of anti-semitism and bigotry. And guess what? Being openly critical towards Israeli atrocities does not equal anti-semitism. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> offers compelling dialogue and tracability where people discuss recent events and correlates them with past events. I&#39;m not saying this doesn&#39;t exist in /pol/, but the demographic that lives there is more interested in coming off as edgy using racial slurs rather than stimulating thoughts and sharing bright ideas. </p>

That&#39;s more of your personal assessment of what is and what is not a major topic of discussion. I personally think that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is doing the community a service by showcasing the corruption that festers in reddit. By saying that this hub is distracted by it, you would devalue reddit to an extent that this issue is not worth tracking. In my opinion, that is a huge underestimation of the power of reddit, as it is primarily used by the new generation for news-feeds and &quot;fun&quot;. Just like 9gag. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you were to somehow manipulate the news-feed, you would influence the mind of the newer generation. And this is exactly what is happening in reddit. Every week there is some sort of bullshit story about the holohoax on the popular page, or something about the promotion of sodomy and other depraved acts as being healthy and empowering. Exposing this systematic abuse is incredibly important because that would help waking up the community, scratch that, the new generation. It would open their minds to how they are being gamed, not only on reddit, but by extension of logic also on other mediasources. </p>

<p>A second argument would be the preservation and integrity of this sub. Assessing how compromised the website is as a whole would determine whether or not it is worth staying on Reddit, or whether it is time to move on to the next beacon of free thought. Possibly even going underground.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a matter of taste. I personally like having a voting system, although I do recognize the potential of abuse where opinions get rigged, for better or worse. </p>

<p>Also, here you have some upvotes. Because some shill keeps downvoting everyone in this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the tip, I&#39;ll check it out. But I am no longer interested in politics. Years of political activism has left me jaded. I think we need a change of attitudes, on a personal, some would say &quot;spiritual&quot; level. We need to embrace nature, humanity and love and be at peace with everyone, everyone is our brother/sister/mother/father, god resides in everyone one of us, and in nature. The least we can do is to protect it. Went on a tangent there, but yea, politics is no longer for me.</p>
