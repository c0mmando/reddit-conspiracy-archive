    <div class="md"><p>I heard that as well. Cops in NYC sre no longer obligated to help you. If you call 911 they will, but if they see you getting mugged its up to them if they wanna help or not. Maybe its the amount of crime in the city at all times or something more sinoster. Protect and serve is no longer on any cars ive seen recently. Living in Va Beach for 27 years, none of those cop cars had &quot;protect and serve&quot; on them.</p>

<p>each level would have a split floor and a door, then they have to avoid the firefighters bring hoses up the stairs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple answer Yes. People who came down stairs after the first tower was hit were told to go back up to their offices. Also securacom the security company who handled the sucurity for the World  Trade Center on 9/11 had GwB brother Marvin Bush serving on the board of directors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Appreciate your feedback.  Hate to ask, but if you happen to rediscover where you heard the security was ushering people trying to escape back to their offices, we&#39;d appreciate that.</p>
