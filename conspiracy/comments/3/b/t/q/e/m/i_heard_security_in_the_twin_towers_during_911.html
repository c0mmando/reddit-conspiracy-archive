       I've seen videos where people were just standing in their offices of one building watching the other burn and some were still working so most victims just stayed on their own apparently instead of evacuating.

       When do cops and Security ever help in crisis anyways?

       They are, legally, under no pressure to protect you at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, why are they there, if not to protect?  What exactly are they paid to do?

       To help control you.  That's it.

       Protection of property and social control are the only purpose for police and security. The concept in which they somehow fight crime is just propaganda, so people accept their presence and listen to them.

       I heard that as well. Cops in NYC sre no longer obligated to help you. If you call 911 they will, but if they see you getting mugged its up to them if they wanna help or not. Maybe its the amount of crime in the city at all times or something more sinoster. Protect and serve is no longer on any cars ive seen recently. Living in Va Beach for 27 years, none of those cop cars had "protect and serve" on them.

       I have serious doubts about the heroic stories of people evacuating 90 or 100 floors via split level stair in the WTC in an hour or less.
      </p>
      <p>
       each level would have a split floor and a door, then they have to avoid the firefighters bring hoses up the stairs.

       I can see this. Panic causes more problems, by having some people go back to their office it will ease the flow of escape. Have you ever see a building do a full evacuation? The people cant handle it.

       Simple answer Yes. People who came down stairs after the first tower was hit were told to go back up to their offices. Also securacom the security company who handled the sucurity for the World  Trade Center on 9/11 had GwB brother Marvin Bush serving on the board of directors.

       Appreciate your feedback.  Hate to ask, but if you happen to rediscover where you heard the security was ushering people trying to escape back to their offices, we'd appreciate that.

       Personally, I don't doubt it, but people will ask for proof.

       I believe it was on loose change but i could have seen it on another youtube video. There was an interview with a woman who had just left the buildings and described the security telling people that the building was safe and it was ok to return to their offices.

       Moreover, after Larry Silverstein bought the buildings, the security company got changed to be Bush's brother or cousin or something, can't remember. Anybody can follow up on this?

       The guy running security in the Twin Towers on the day on 9/11 was a Bush brother.

       They weren't school children: I can't imagine a security clerk (or a police officer) having the authority to tell me to return to my office for any reason, much less a plane hitting my building.

       i agree but i think that maybe they
       <em>
        were not aware
       </em>
       of wth was happening. more people (before 9/11) just believed (&amp; trusted) whatever authority told them.
