       I really like how in this sub the level of effort to like keep 9-11 under perpetual scrutiny! I just wish these posts could gain more traction hahah, that way even like casual people who pass this sub are exposed to it! Omg that would be so awesome if like every day people were constantly reminded of the absurd level of tyranny, treason and manufactured civil conflict that we are exposed to! Lol I bet there would be some type of response eventually :)

       Good post!! Chomsky and the 911 Gatekeeper brigade say you need science credentials since they have ruled out high-level government malfeasance (i.e., murder).  Who cares? is what they say uber alles. Also, the real demolition experts have learned from the gubmint and are now using only jet fuel. As a suicided comedian used to say, Mork to Ork: Nano-nano.

       The government has never proven their own story!  I can't emphasize this enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fundamentally, you will end up at the collapse of building 7. In order for something to be considered factual based on the scientific method, an experiment must be repeatable.
      </p>
      <p>
       They made the data to verify their models classified on the grounds of "national security". That makes their claim unprovable and also unproven. There is no way around this fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       So then you have to ask yourself, "What reason could there be for classifying that information in the name of 'national security'?"  "Would they really need to do that if they were being honest?"
      </p>
      <p>
       My mind leads me to this logic: The only reason that it would be a threat to national security is if the official story were a lie and the exposure of this lie would lead to a rebellion of the people. That certainly wouldn't be good for "national security".

       911 happened.  911falsity happened with or without 911truth computer models; that should bother any and all loyal Americans at any and all times with no exceptions. Loyal Americans should not support the outrageous conduct of their evil pro-murder anti-investigation terroristic government. Disloyal Americans and sleepwalking zombie Americans support scum government as directed by MSM; reinstituting the loyalty oath might help get 911 discussions between truthers and the kabal of Lyndonian Satanists, NWO Bush crime family members, and other communists on a fast track to prosecutions or other meaningful settlement findings.

       I'm convinced! And even Chomsky is not a brilliant enough genius to tell non-scientists &amp; non-architects that they can't think simply because he refuses to think. The non-investigation with excessive secrecy is a national disgrace and, with all his cleverness (I'm speaking as a fan asking for recantation), Chomsky is an academic disgrace.

       I have to disagree, what sense would it make getting another countries intelligence agency involved in our own countries false flag attack?
      </p>
      <p>
       Every thing i have ever read only ever implicates high ranking government and military officials, alone with the alphabet agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Countries like Israeli and the UK etc directly gained from this event, i do not deny that, i also do not deny other intelligence agencies from other countries even knew about the event before it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try to implicate another country is deflection.

      <p>
       It makes perfect sense if you don't want anybody in your country to find out you've just planned a false flag attack. Obviously.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry, but you can think whatever the hell you like. All the evidence points towards Israel and it's as simple as that. One of their Mossad teams were caught
       <em>

       This makes absolutely no logical sense as a reply. The initial question was why outsource the attacks to Israel. Clearly the stand-down orders didn't need to be outsourced. Not if someone like Cheney was involved. There is a chain of command in America which must be followed.

       Again, this makes absolutely no logical sense. I was just asked why the attacks were outsourced, so clearly there was complicity at the highest level in America. Why are you now ignoring the part where the people who outsourced the attacks were American?

       I think we agree but a clarification might help. The American government and the Israeli Mossad may have colluded on 911 as with the USS Liberty strike LBJ authorized, but the Lyndonian Bush crime family deliberately subordinated all government employees (and therefore media) to Israel as well as lending personnel to the murderous enterprise.  Letting the disloyal American scum off right before July 4 to claim Israel went it alone (and, again, I know you didn't intend to give the Mossad subsidiary we call the CIA a free pass) on 911 would be a mistake.

       Oh, there were absolutely collaborators on the American end. It couldn't have been achieved without them. The crime itself was a Zionist plot, but it was almost certainly hatched in America.

       Were there special bombs in the basement? How much is known about the demolition/bomb squads who must have had days or weeks to run wires and charges around the building? The cover-up is insulting but the stealthy preplanning and execution of the building demolition and murders with planes,etc rivals larger-than-life villains I've only found before in comic books.

       Given that NIST didn't even test for explosives residue and have spent the last ten years denying the laws of physics in order to avoid admitting the towers were blown up, then how much investigation do you think has been done into the teams who wired the buildings?

       I am sorry but not a shill; I thought maybe you knew how they did it.  The CIA whistleblower (who, like you, said who-done-it is a dumb question while stating quite a bit about the preplanning) and others have piqued my interest and i'm asking stupid questions because I know I haven't got it figured and figured maybe you did.  With regard to my mention of bin Laden being set up as a comic book villain, I think I meant and said the MSM as well as NIST and the neocon conspirators did quite a job getting stupid people like me to believe (at least initially) the Humpty-dumpty buildings all fell down because of a Saudi-royal type dude living in a cave...And the planes, hijackers with drivers license found in rubble, dialysis, on-and-on...I'm probably convincing you again and me with you that i'm stupid but (to answer your last two questions), 911 happened and I don't get the bin Laden hijack thread so much as the Pearl Harbor narrative.  The government is still covering up Pearl Harbor and the 911 planners knew that referring to it.

      <p>
       It's pretty obvious how they did it. There was construction work going on in the towers for months. Just ask some of the users here who were there and they'll tell you how easy it would have been to wire the buildings for a demolition. Unless people were specifically looking out for Israeli terrorists planting military grade TH3 in the buildings then there is just no way they'd have even known about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In sum, snorting in derision at the idea that it is possible to wire a couple of buildings with high grade explosives is a shill's argument. It's fallacious. Not only is it contrary to the scientific evidence that the buildings were demolished, but it's the equivalent of denying any bombing in history (say for example, the King David Hotel bombing), on the grounds that you think it's impossible to get explosives into a building.
      </p>
      <p>
       My genuine apologies for misunderstanding your intent though. I read the rest of your post and I don't think you're a shill. I just have a tendency to jump to that conclusion these days because I've encountered so many people who are.

Do you know about any detectably high radioactive readings at demolition site (I know they had their EPA recommending the safe clean air so just any Geiger counter might not be accurate, operator error being such a factor) or did I get a curveball on this?

       There's so much disinformation which has been put out there about 9/11 that it can be difficult to know what to believe. I have also heard claims that some type of "mini-nuke" was used on the WTC, but I have never seen any evidence of this, and don't understand why a nuke would be necessary to demolish a building. The WTC Janitor and others did report sub-basement explosions, but again no evidence of anything nuclear.

       And the company they allegedly worked for, Urban Moving Systems:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Possible fraudulent operation. Little evidence of a legitimate business operation.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       And...
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Urban Moving Systems, Israeli nationals' unscheduled trip to vicinity of the "Flight 93" crash site in the early hours of 9/11.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       And...
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Urban Moving Systems, Israeli employee said, "Give us twenty years and we'll take over your media and destroy your country".
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       And...
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        FBI-NK noted the unusually large number of computers relative to the number of employees for such a fairly small business. Further investigation identified several pseudo-names or aliases associated with Urban Moving Systems and its operations.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       And...
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        During the search conducted by the WPD, it was revealed that the building and all of its contents had been abandoned by the owner of Urban Moving Systems.

       I've read all that too.. But.. Not conclusive. Is the fbi still hiding their results of the investigation or did they just not try hard enough?

       It isn't an isolated piece of evidence, but rather the gem in a treasure chest of clues that Israel was involved. And it is significantly more conclusive than the evidence against bin Laden, which is exactly zero.

       I've seen what people like you do. You try to separate each of the pieces of evidence against Israel and then you explain each of them with a different Biblical miracle. This isn't a courtroom, and you aren't a slick lawyer. The information I posted is conclusive to anybody who isn't insanely biased and unwilling to listen to reason. There was no reason for them to have explosives residue on their clothes and in their van, and even less reason for NIST not to have tested the WTC site for explosives.

       Whether you want to accept it or not is irrelevant. The Zionists did this, and they have been able to do it because they have wormed their way into the very highest levels of the American political establishment. It is very easy to join the dots, right down to the Zionist Jew they put in charge of the WTC 7 analysis. If you miss them then it is because you refuse to look, and that's something which is up to you.
