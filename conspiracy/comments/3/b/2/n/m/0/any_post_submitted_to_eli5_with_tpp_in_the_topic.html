<p>Yes, their subreddit has rules.  And they don&#39;t want their whole page flooded with TPP-related ELI5s everywhere, so they &quot;corral&quot; all TPP-related discussion into <strong>one post only</strong>.   Which will be gone tomorrow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s mocking you.  That&#39;s exactly how you are typing.  If you want people to take you seriously, arbitrarily bolding and italicizing random words is not going to help your case.  Besides, your entire argument is simply an appeal to emotions.  I&#39;m against corporate censorship of &quot;muh reddits&quot; as much as the next <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> user, but you are barking up the wrong tree here.</p>

<p>Rule #9 from <a href="/r/explainlikeimfive">/r/explainlikeimfive</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You must search before submitting. All posts on ELI5 are archived, so you should search before making a submission. Remember to search using keywords, don&#39;t just paste your title into the search bar. If your search results don&#39;t yield an adequate explanation, mentioning it in the body of your post is a good idea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The current thread discussing the TPP is still on the front page.  Of course they are going to delete new threads about it.   I agree that having their modbots deleting threads instantly isn&#39;t very good, but it may be set up to filter threads that are similar to any that are currently on the front page.  Flooding a single sub with countless threads about the TPP isn&#39;t going to help as much as you seem to think.  Having one, quality submission that answers all of the questions is the best way to get informed.  People who don&#39;t know about the TPP aren&#39;t very likely to peruse through 12 different threads to try and get an answer.</p>

<p>edit: Jesus Christ, I just saw your post where you quote a mod directly telling you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You don&#39;t have to use a non-participation link for that thread. <strong>It&#39;s the official one that we moderators put up specifically to keep the rest of ELI5 from being flooded with non-stop duplicate questions (which was exactly what was happening).</strong> We&#39;re not going to suddenly remove it when we&#39;re the ones who created it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just stop, man.  There is a clear explanation provided from the mods that isn&#39;t unreasonable.  You are being unreasonable to continue making this particular instance a big deal.  It&#39;s not like <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> where NO posts relating to the TPP were allowed.  You are making the users of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> look crazy.  Since everyone already seems to think that we are, we don&#39;t need any more help, thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be.  There simply isn&#39;t enough transparency from different subs and their moderation rules.   I think forum moderation should have a term limit, and moderators selected from within and by the community, but that&#39;s neither here nor there.</p>

<p>I have to say, it must be a fucking awful way to live, constantly agitated to the point of near meltdown. I know Republicans and conservatives have been like this for decades, but it really does seem worse than ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>If the users of ELI5 wish to post and discuss the tee pee pee, shouldn&#39;t they be allowed to do so without automated censorship being done by algorithms?</em></p>

<p>No. ELI5 is not a discussion subreddit. It&#39;s an explanation subreddit. You post to have some concept explained, not to discuss a topic.</p>

<p><em>Shouldn&#39;t Redditors be allowed to make whatever kind of post they like, and then let the upvotes and downvotes from other Redditors decide what rises and what sinks?</em></p>

<p>No. Different subreddits have different rules. You don&#39;t go into <a href="/r/askscience">/r/askscience</a> to post jokes or to <a href="/r/creepy">/r/creepy</a> to post cat pictures, and you don&#39;t go to <a href="/r/explainlikeimfive">/r/explainlikeimfive</a> to have discussions. If you want to participate in a subreddit that has no rules that necessitate the removal of posts, feel free to create your own.</p>

<p><em>or sectioned off towards the &quot;protest area&quot; of one single post <a href="http://np.reddit.com/3az0fa">http://np.reddit.com/3az0fa</a> , which is not likely to survive the night...</em></p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to use a non-participation link for that thread. It&#39;s the official one that we moderators put up specifically to keep the rest of ELI5 from being flooded with non-stop duplicate questions (which was exactly what was happening).  We&#39;re not going to suddenly remove it when we&#39;re the ones who created it.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you haven&#39;t guessed, the submission of yours has also been removed, because ELI5 also doesn&#39;t allow posts that are intended as a soapbox. And <strong>don&#39;t attempt to evade AutoModerator again.</strong>  If you have concerns about how we operate the subreddit, feel free to message us directly.  <strong>But further attempts to avoid our moderation tools may result in a ban.</strong></p>

<p>Listen to that guy!  This is the kind of automated evil, machines versus humans, The-Terminator-Internet, that made me want to bring this issue to the attention of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> in the first place.</p>
