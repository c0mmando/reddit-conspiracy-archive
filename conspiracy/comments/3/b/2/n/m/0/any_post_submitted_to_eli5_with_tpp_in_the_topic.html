       Yes, their subreddit has rules.  And they don't want their whole page flooded with TPP-related ELI5s everywhere, so they "corral" all TPP-related discussion into
       <strong>
        one post only
       </strong>
       .   Which will be gone tomorrow.

       He's mocking you.  That's exactly how you are typing.  If you want people to take you seriously, arbitrarily bolding and italicizing random words is not going to help your case.  Besides, your entire argument is simply an appeal to emotions.  I'm against corporate censorship of "muh reddits" as much as the next

        You must search before submitting. All posts on ELI5 are archived, so you should search before making a submission. Remember to search using keywords, don't just paste your title into the search bar. If your search results don't yield an adequate explanation, mentioning it in the body of your post is a good idea.

      <p>
       The current thread discussing the TPP is still on the front page.  Of course they are going to delete new threads about it.   I agree that having their modbots deleting threads instantly isn't very good, but it may be set up to filter threads that are similar to any that are currently on the front page.  Flooding a single sub with countless threads about the TPP isn't going to help as much as you seem to think.  Having one, quality submission that answers all of the questions is the best way to get informed.  People who don't know about the TPP aren't very likely to peruse through 12 different threads to try and get an answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: Jesus Christ, I just saw your post where you quote a mod directly telling you:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You don't have to use a non-participation link for that thread.
        <strong>
         It's the official one that we moderators put up specifically to keep the rest of ELI5 from being flooded with non-stop duplicate questions (which was exactly what was happening).
        </strong>
        We're not going to suddenly remove it when we're the ones who created it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Just stop, man.  There is a clear explanation provided from the mods that isn't unreasonable.  You are being unreasonable to continue making this particular instance a big deal.  It's not like
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       where NO posts relating to the TPP were allowed.  You are making the users of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       look crazy.  Since everyone already seems to think that we are, we don't need any more help, thanks.

       Listen, you obviously don't get it: Everything starts with "I am a massive victim and totalitarian fascism is being imposed on me right now by Obama and Reddit."
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything follows from that. That's the starting point; if everything you say and think doesn't follow from that premise, you won't understand them and they won't understand you. I mean, think of it from their point of view: Fascist dictatorship is happening this very minute thanks to Reddit and their collusion with "The Powers That Be." You come along and speak reason. How do you think that's going to go down?

       Tomorrow though, even though that post will have 5000 upvotes,
       <strong>
        it won't be on the ELI5 frontpage anymore

       Oh.  The TPP, that was YESTERDAY's big post.  We can't have that TODAY.  Or, ever again.  Give up, conspiretards.

       ELI5 mod here - we had it stickied to the top all day yesterday, as well. We can only sticky one at a time, though, and the Obamacare story was blowing up this morning, so it got bumped. We're filtering out posts about the Obamacare ruling now, and directing people to the central post, it's standard practice.

       Well, because ever since Aaron Swartz had his name dragged through the mud and threatened so much by our government that he decided it was better to take his own life, this site is just a place for the lowest common denominator to be placated with bread and circuses while Chairman Pao works as hard as she can to make sure any dissenting opinion is designated to "free speech zones" where we can all just echo each other's concerns without upsetting the masses.

       This is why I like the concept of being able to flood the subreddit with the same topic whenever the need arises.  This happened here when that fat subreddit got banned and people wanted to the front page to not be full of that one particular topic.  In this case I want the front page of ELI5 to be flooded with TPP posts if that is what the userbase wants.  Damn it.

       Could be.  There simply isn't enough transparency from different subs and their moderation rules.   I think forum moderation should have a term limit, and moderators selected from within and by the community, but that's neither here nor there.

       No. Different subreddits have different rules. You don't go into
       <a href="/r/askscience">
        /r/askscience
       </a>
       to post jokes or to
       <a href="/r/creepy">
        /r/creepy
       </a>
       to post cat pictures, and you don't go to
       <a href="/r/explainlikeimfive">
        /r/explainlikeimfive
       </a>
       to have discussions. If you want to participate in a subreddit that has no rules that necessitate the removal of posts, feel free to create your own.

       You don't have to use a non-participation link for that thread. It's the official one that we moderators put up specifically to keep the rest of ELI5 from being flooded with non-stop duplicate questions (which was exactly what was happening).  We're not going to suddenly remove it when we're the ones who created it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and if you haven't guessed, the submission of yours has also been removed, because ELI5 also doesn't allow posts that are intended as a soapbox. And

       No problem.  I'm splitting my time between here and Voat until it has more users, but honestly I spew so much venom about this kind of thing I'm sure it won't be long before the shadow ban is looming over me too.
