<p>This is the problem I have with this sub, but I really can&#39;t figure out a better alternative. There seems to be a potential conspiracy hiding in every story. People throw everything - virtually <em>everything</em> - at the wall they possibly can to see what sticks. Some of it does. But a lot of it, like this post, simply doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>But like I said, I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a way around it. I feel like a lot of the convoluted, paranoid garbage is a necessary evil to get to the legitimately good information that&#39;s posted here as well.</p>

<p>I agree, which is why I said even posts that are probably garbage are necessary to the sub. What I meant is that I do genuinely believe the majority of posters here have their hearts in the right place, and it&#39;s not always clear which theories &quot;stick&quot; without opening up just about everything to discussion.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean it still doesn&#39;t occasionally make browsing here a bit tedious though.</p>

<p>And they should question their own theories, as well, to make sure they make sense. This one clearly doesn&#39;t, as they think gay marriage was somehow &quot;passed&quot; because tpp was up. </p>

<p>Uh, what? Maybe you just mistyped, but the exact opposite is true. Networks intentionally <em>avoid</em> broadcasting new shows or buzzworthy episodes on the same days as major sporting events (with the exception being when the game is on the same network, and they use that as a lead-in - to wit, though, none of the other networks are trying to compete with the Super Bowl every year). And when large unexpected news stories occur, they preempt their usual scheduled programming. </p>

<p>And who cares if the &quot;designers&quot; admit it? It&#39;s not exactly a conspiracy, it&#39;s just a smart move for ratings-minded executives trying to offset production costs. It makes perfect sense.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>TPP affects every American. Very few people seem to care. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Gay marriage has been one of the biggest issues dominating our political landscape for the last 15 years. There have been dozens of state laws passed to either ban it or allow it. There have been many amendments add to State Constitutions to ban it. There have been hundreds of court decisions related to gay marriage. And prior to this decision, we had some courts ruling that it was legal and others ruling that it was illegal.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the Supreme Court&#39;s job to intervene in situations like this when the Circuit Courts come to different conclusions about federal law. If Circuit Court A says something is legal and Circuit Court B says it&#39;s illegal, the Supreme Court is needed to make a final ruling.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why the Supreme Court took up this case last year, and why they heard argument a few months ago.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court works on the same calendar every year; They convene the court on the first Monday in October. They hear cases throughout the fall, winter, and spring. And they release their rulings in June. Then, finally, the choose the cases they will take up next year. </p>

<p>To summarize:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Supreme Court follows the same schedule, every year.</li>
<li>The Supreme Court decided to rule on this case last year.</li>
<li>There have been thousands of court cases over recent years with differing outcomes, forcing the court to act.</li>
</ul>

<p>It just doesn&#39;t make sense that the Court would have planned all this out in advance in anticipation of what a small group of people on Reddit would be obsessing over this week. That&#39;s just not how things work.</p>

<p>Well, help me out, then. When you say &quot;it&#39;s too convenient&quot; what exactly are you trying to suggest? It sounds like you think there was a plot involving the court to distract from TPP. But when confronted with that specific question, you deny it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>another comment that doesn&#39;t explain why reddit is deleting TPP posts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But Reddit isn&#39;t deleting TPP posts. There are tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of TPP posts all over Reddit. The mods of <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> are deleting TPP threads, but they are not &quot;reddit,&quot; any more than the mods of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are &quot;reddit.&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how familiar you are with how reddit works, but it&#39;s basically a giant user-controlled web site. Any user can create a subreddit, and any user can become a mod. Once a mod, you have more or less absolute authority to manage the sub how you see fit, and there is almost no interference from Reddit the company. (There is a vast amount of whining when the admins do step in from time to time, but it is very infrequent and 99.99% of subs are able to do whatever they please without any interference.)</p>

<p>There is a giant disinfo campaign going on to claim that Reddit is deleting TPP threads, but this just isn&#39;t the case. Where deletions have happened it is because of mod actions, not Reddit actions. </p>

<p>We may not like it -- I don&#39;t -- but <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> mods can run their sub however they want.</p>

<p>IF we don&#39;t want them telling us how to manage <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, we have to give them the same freedom to manage <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> how they want. That&#39;s the thing about liberty: it&#39;s very messy. I can say what I want, but so can other people. </p>

<p>Too many people seem to want authoritarianism instead of liberty, smashing everyone who has an opinion they don&#39;t agree with.</p>

<p>Sounds like, precisely. I never said it, you did. I mean to say that, whomever orchestrated it, they intended to distract people from the TPP signing. I never spoke as to who or why they would do this.</p>

<p>Okay. Reddit itself isn&#39;t deleting posts. But someone is. That sub is all about correct info. The whole point of news is to educate people on things they otherwise wouldn&#39;t hear about. So yeah. There is something wrong with <em>the</em> news sub of reddit cutting out news from the frontpage about TPP. No news source should ever omit information. Like I said to someone else, there has to be some motivation to delete these posts, regardless of who is doing it.</p>

<p>We know who orchestrated it. The Supreme Court did. No one tells them what to do. They pick their own cases. They chose the gay marriage case last year, and they listened to arguments a few months ago. They spent the last few weeks writing their opinions. And they released their opinions today. They release their opinions in the last week of June every year. </p>

<p>So, now that you know who orchestrated it, are you going to claim that &quot;they intended to distract people from the TPP signing?&quot;</p>

<p>How would you even know that? Where is your evidence that &quot;whomever orchestrated it, they intended to distract people from the TPP signing?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I agree. I think it&#39;s ridiculous. But here&#39;s the thing: Normal ordinary users run Reddit. The mods over there have exactly the same freedom to run that sub however they want that every other sub&#39;s mods have. If you start trying to regulate how they behave, what&#39;s to keep them from regulating how you behave?</p>

<p>Freedom is messy. You either accept it warts and all, or you don&#39;t. It sounds like you don&#39;t. It sounds like you want an ideologically-managed Reddit, where certain opinions are forbidden.  </p>

Furthermore, freedom to run a sub is one thing. I&#39;m not arguing their right to delete posts, I&#39;m arguing the implications. What was the motivation? Why TPP and not something else? Why aid an already secretive trade agreement by deleting posts regarding it from a major distributor of news?</p>

<p>Freedom does not have warts, and I&#39;m not &quot;not accepting freedom&quot;.  Goes back to what I said about you being narrow-minded. I have no further desire to read your ideas.

<p>It&#39;s the fact that it is THIS day that the decision is made. The same day TPP is fast tracked. Reddit deleting posts about TPP on r/news. There is no reason for that other than to keep people in the dark about it. Sure if you were looking for posts about it, you&#39;ll find the few that haven&#39;t gotten up voted enough to show up on hot news. But anyone who is clueless about it will remain that way. A result that r/news is meant to prevent.</p>

<p>Gay marriage shouldn&#39;t even be an argument at this point. I don&#39;t think it ever really was, as far as the lawmakers are concerned. You are the one who is not aware my friend. There was no talk of gay marriage being legalized recently on r/news. Nothing until today. Considering how much crap thus issue has caused in the past years, you&#39;d think this decision would have grabbed more space on r/news as of late. But it hasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Just do a little research on reddit for anything about TPP. It&#39;s like a fucking graveyard. A few different posts, none of which have any up votes. It&#39;s like someone doesn&#39;t want people talking about TPP on reddit.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court had nothing to do with this. They were doing what they always do. Whomever decides the dates of the TPP&#39;S voting lined it up with the Supreme Court&#39;s scheduled ruling.</p>

<p>r/news deleting high ranking TPP posts is highly suspicious. Why choose TPP posts to delete? What&#39;s the motivation there?

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an interesting theory. I don&#39;t see how you have any proof, and speaking as though it were true doesn&#39;t make it fact. That would be stupid. Perhaps I&#39;m simply trying to help widen people&#39;s perspectives on the topic. Besides, the nature of the reason why I&#39;m talking about it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with whether or not I&#39;m right. So try again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you can trust me on this. I promise you, if you look out for this you will see it happen again and again and again.</p>

<p>Every single time something happens that people don&#39;t like, they will instantly invent a conspiracy theory to explain it. Right on the spot.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not how a serious person works. A serious person builds an argument with evidence and fact. You can&#39;t just pull brand new conspiracy theories out of your ass without any evidence as a way to insulate yourself from news you don&#39;t like.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s face it: No matter what happened today, if it distracted from TPP, people would say it&#39;s a conspiracy.</p>

<p>If a rock star had died of a drug overdose ...</p>

<p>If a plane had crashed somewhere ...</p>

<p>If a gunman shot up another school ...</p>

<p>All of these would have become instant conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Literally everything that happens is instantly assumed to be a conspiracy theory if it &quot;distracts&quot; from something people care about, or if it hurts their cause in some way.</p>

<p>Does that seem like a reasonable way to interpret the events happening in the world? Does it seem reasonable to just claim everything is a conspiracy the minute it happens?</p>

<p>I know people invent theories to fit their opinions, but that isn&#39;t grounds to discredit every single theory that comes into existence. There&#39;s a fallicy involving that.</p>

<p>Okay, well, I appreciate what you&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>Just a couple final thoughts for now:</p>

<p>(1) There have been a lot of votes recently on TPP. This has been bouncing back and forth between the House and the Senate and I think the latest vote was the 4th in the last two weeks. (Maybe the 3rd; I&#39;ve lost count.)</p>

<p>(2) Nothing has been signed. You mention &quot;TPP signing.&quot; But the signing won&#39;t happen until the bill reaches the president&#39;s desk.</p>

<p>(3) It&#39;s not the TPP that they have been voting on. They have been voting on fast track authority. Votes on the actual TPP are many months away. The treaty will not become law until Congress debates it and votes on it in a few months.</p>

<p>Basically all that has been happening the last couple of weeks is debate on whether to fast track it.</p>

<p>(4) The other thing you might not know is that all trade and treaty deals have been handled using fast track for several decades. There is nothing at all unusual about seeking fast track for TPP. It&#39;s how these things are always done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding points 1, 2 and 3.</p>

<p>They have voted to fast track it, and it has reached Obama&#39;s desk. All he has to do is sign it, and I doubt there will be much hesitation.</p>

<p>Regarding point 4.</p>

<p>Although fast tracking isn&#39;t irregular, a secret agreement is. When else has such laws been passed before the public was allowed to review it? Oh yeah, the Patriot Act, which gives the government too much power. They didn&#39;t want people to know about it because they knew it wouldn&#39;t fly. That&#39;s why they hid TPP from the public. The small amount that was leaked sparked a lot of distress in people, and that&#39;s not even the whole thing.</p>

<p>I know that these recent proceedings seem innocent. So does everything else the government does. Not everything they have done was innocent though.</p>

<p>I appreciate your calm manner, and you raise valid points, unlike some other comments I&#39;ve received regarding this topic. I hope our discussion has been mutually beneficial. It&#39;s unfortunate that one cannot suspect the government of bad behavior without being spotlighted as a wack job conspiracy theorist. History provides much on the bad behavior of our government, as well as many others. They are not above creating conspiracies to achieve theit goals. Therefore it would seem beneficial to constantly suspect them of such. Unless every theory is shit canned as quickly as a schizophrenic&#39;s babblings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please man. I know it&#39;s difficult. But listen, it may seem like nothing, but the fact that we are discussing this here and now mean&#39;s it&#39;s worth fighting for.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t give up because the odds are against us. They&#39;re counting on that...   I don&#39;t have an exact answer on what needs to be done. Hell, I think Bernie Sanders 2016 is a GREAT start. </p>

<p>Awareness is key. Educate yourself, and those around you, so when the time comes, we&#39;ll have a majority of the population on the same page.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. It&#39;s just frustrating wen everyone around you is on <em>their</em> agenda. I get called a conspiracy theorist and a nut. Reaching a majority seems impossible.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any faith in any candidate to be honest. Nobody who will do the right thing will ever get to the top. Bernie looks just as good as Obama did. They&#39;re all puppets, they&#39;re all masks hiding the true monster that politics consists of. That&#39;s why I mention revolution. Throughout history, the most effective way to motivate the masses is through hatred and fear. Only through these means will people turn off their netflix and fox news and grab their pitchforks. So long as their reality is better than the one we would make apparent to them, they&#39;ll be content with watching House m.d. or some other mindless distraction.</p>

<p>What really gets me is Reddit. Deleting TPP posts? What the fuck is that? Where&#39;s the free speech and unadulterated exchange of information? Part of me wants to stop using reddit, it clearly isn&#39;t a safe place, they don&#39;t have my back. I don&#39;t know what their motivation is for hiding this immensely important news from its users. It can&#39;t be a good one.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you and I exist, and there are more like us. We need to find them and bring them all together so we can start making a difference in the world. Before it goes entirely Big Brother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen this dismissal of Sanders as an candidate even from those who support his ideology, but in reality, that kind of response only serves to hurt the chances he might otherwise have at winning the election. Let&#39;s just assume that right at this moment, there is a God-given 1% chance of Sanders becoming the next US president. Now, would you say &quot;fuck it, it&#39;s too hard&quot;, or would you do everything you can to achieve the improbable? The more people who choose the latter, the greater his chances of winning become, and the less people who turn to apathy in the face of continued government corruption. It&#39;s a positive feedback loop either way, so make sure you&#39;re on the side that will actually fix this fucked up country!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you to an extent. But hear me out.</p>

<p>Say we get (at least) 51% of this country&#39;s population on board with Sanders 2016.  We all spread the word and actually vote for him. Then the preselected puppet get&#39;s picked, regardless of our majority vote. </p>

<p>Yes, It happens all the time, but the more energy we build up, the more like-minded people that actually vote for this guy, will realize, democracy is dead in the U.S. They will see it first hand! THAT could be the fuel to the fire this population so desperately needs.</p>
