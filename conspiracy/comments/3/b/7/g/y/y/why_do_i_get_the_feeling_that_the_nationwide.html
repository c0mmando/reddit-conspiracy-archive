    <div class="md"><p>From Wikipedia. &quot;In psychology, cognitive dissonance is the mental stress or discomfort experienced by an individual who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values at the same time, or is confronted by new information that conflicts with existing beliefs, ideas, or values.&quot;</p>

<p>The part that impedes progress is the part of the sentence that talks about  the discomfort stemming from being confronted by new information that conflicts with existing beliefs. It&#39;s literally the reason a fanatical Muslim or Christian reacts so negatively towards homosexuality, or why some people might have a problem listening to someone bring up the idea that our government might have had at least some involvement in 9/11. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The part that impedes progress is the part of the sentence that doesn&#39;t describe cognitive dissonance, but merely one category of thing that can cause it?</p>

<p>Yeah, no. You&#39;re conflating things here, please stop misleading people. Cognitive dissonance is not a thing to be worked about, it&#39;s a descriptive (not prescriptive) concept for use in patient care re: psychological and social sciences. It has some application in other disciplines, but it&#39;s academic in nature. Pick a different buzz word, it&#39;s anti-intellectual to proceed with this line of thinking.</p>

<p>The world seems like it couldn&#39;t be mostly planned and orchestrated because of the chaos and randomness, but <em>ordo ab chao</em> is their calling card, after all. Easier to reorganize something to your liking after its been decimated then when it&#39;s running swell.

<p>Totally. Obama as well. Bush was the good old boy white Texan, just a regular guy you could have a beer with. What better contrast to that than a well spoken black president with seemingly progressive ideals? It sickened me the amount of celebration when Obama won-- it was like everybody felt like we&#39;d fixed everything and we could all relax because we&#39;d saved the world-- just by going and voting! Meanwhile those in power had a good laugh and continued on with the plan, albeit with much less resistance! Now they gave us gay marriage and destroyed the rebel flag... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I must admit I was <em>tentatively</em> a <em>little bit</em> hopeful that when Obama came into power, the system would change at least a little bit for the better, simply because he had made so many broad, sweeping statements that he <em>couldn&#39;t go back</em> on <strong>all of them</strong>. </p>

<p>We saw how that went. Torture continued, war in the middle east continued, NSA scandal broke and the spying continued, NDAA got signed, (literally legally authorizing the extrajudicial assassination of US citizens), false flags aimed at gun control exploded, etc etc. Business as fucking usual. </p>

<p>And yet, what do we see from the left? Fucking CRICKETS. YAY GAY MARRIAGE!! Gay marriage happens and the internet fucking EXPLODES. Everything else, all the violations, it&#39;s like oh, everything is forgiven, everything is all right after all! This past years have really given me a hate for the left, watching their incredible hypocrisy and endless race baiting and holding up ridiculous excuses for &quot;feminists&quot; as their spokespeople. </p>

<p>And now we have the same old story with Bernie Sanders, the underdog who might rise to the pinnacles of power, it&#39;s like we&#39;re goldfish who learn nothing. I&#39;m very cynical lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Equal rights? To do what, give the government a ton of money? Marriage is a government system, and is therefore worthless and arbitrary. The very idea of marriage is corrupted and insane. Most people who are married just become even more complacent to the system, because now they&#39;ve got each other to delude and distract.</p>

<p>If you truly want equal rights, then stop supporting the fucking government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a slight problem with your statement that groups / collectives are usually stupid etc etc.</p>

<p>My opinion is that groups as a whole will turn out as you treat them or raise them to be. For example, if the government treats and raises black people as imbeciles, I believe that naturally the black people, under the influence of their government, will become more and more stupid as a result of their environment. Education will be tarnished, needless drug wars will take place, etc etc and it all works to make them and / or keep them stupid. On the other hand, I also feel that if we treat society as intelligent, if we treat everyone as able to partake in conversations that concern them (such as with TPP) then society as a whole will become smarter. If &quot;the American people are not smart enough to understand how the TPP is good for the American people&quot; then they just need to talk with us about it, show us what we are too stupid to understand, and eventually we will come to be able to understand just what is going on. (As far as I can tell though, it&#39;s baaaad.)</p>

<p>It&#39;s such an obnoxious and arrogant way to go about things. This sub is filled with people who believe anything the government says is false, making them just as dumb as people who believe everything the government says is true.

<p>EDIT: Why is this being downvoted? A lot of upset blue collar workers I&#39;m guessing. Listen, guys, (and ladies, and any other gender reading)....this is how the world works, alright? Don&#39;t be upset with me because I am fortunate enough to be in a position of financial and mental stability. Y&#39;all are upset, and because of that you are aggressive. It&#39;s ok to lash out, and I know that downvoting my comment gave you that inkling of &#39;justice&#39; in your mind, and your passive agressiveness was momentarily calmed. But rest assured if not me, someone else tomorrow..or the next day, etc. will do <em>something</em> to piss you off, and remind you of your reality. Truth hurts...yep...I know this fact first hand as it wasn&#39;t all roses. Heck, it never really is for ANYONE. Please feel free to PM me if you can overlook your upset mindframe.

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently his speech at an lgbt rally was interrupted by a transgender undocumented immigrant and he told her no rudeness allowed in his house and had her removed. The meme I saw going around showed Biden with his head in his hands next to Obama and said something along the lines of that moment your boss silences a transgender colored women at an event started by a transgender woman of color. It was followed up with statements that the white house is the peoples house, not his and how he apparently ignored the lgbt families in his immigration policies.</p>

<p>You are probably right though, soon the tpp will be the only remaining cause I can think of that the hard core liberals will be addressing, other than the whole proposed socialist education system and marijuana.</p>

<p>&quot;...the timing of this Michael Jackson shit is what makes me doubt it. Every time there’s wars going out of control, or the economy is bad or something is wrong with the world at large it’s always these moments in history that Michael Jackson will coincidentally jerk off a kid. This is getting ridiculous. Are you planning this shit? Do you have meetings? “Michael, thank you for coming. As you know Michael, the war has not been going as well as we expected. There’s been a lot of hiccups, and the public is asking us a lot of questions of course and well, Michael, there’s no nice way to say this and all I know how to do is be direct, so let me just be direct. We’re going to need you to jerk off another child, Mike. I’m sorry. I am sorry. But it would really help out.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory is that this week is meant to distract, separate, and create public interest in a potential global policing agency. I think chaos is unlikely for awhile, the majority of the public has been lulled into obedience by the media, education system, and popular culture. Horrible acts are going to keep increasing at an accelerated rate with the majority of people never putting the dots together. Massive government overhaul is the only way the systems big money created can be broken. Reddit was the only glimpse at this ever being possible, but in the last month we&#39;ve truly lost our incredible medium to censorship. I feel nuts believing every piece of media is some form of PR for a very diabolical plan, but what makes me feel more nuts is that I can&#39;t even conjure up a possible intervention that could slow this evil system down, let alone stop it completely. </p>

<p>If you want to be cynical of the media and the government, be my guest. But double-guessing every fucking thing that happens isn&#39;t going to get you anywhere in the long run. If the media wants to distract the people, they can do it whenever they want. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make any sense to say &#39;they&#39;re distracting us from X&#39; whenever something good happens. Otherwise you could say that every single news story that isn&#39;t about TPP was distracting the people from TPP. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are 1,138 benefits, rights and protections available to married couples in federal law alone, according to a General Accounting Office assessment made in 2004. [86] Benefits only available to married couples include hospital visitation during an illness, the option of filing a joint tax return to reduce a tax burden, access to family health coverage, US residency and family unification for partners from another country, and bereavement leave and inheritance rights if a partner dies. [6] [95] Married couples also have access to protections if the relationship ends, such as child custody, spousal or child support, and an equitable division of property.[93] Married couples in the US armed forces are offered health insurance and other benefits unavailable to domestic partners. [125] The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the US Department of Labor also recognize married couples, for the purpose of granting tax, retirement and health insurance benefits. [126] The US federal government does not grant equivalent benefits to gay couples in civil unions or domestic partnerships. [153] [154] An Oct. 2, 2009 analysis by the New York Times estimated that same-sex couples denied marriage benefits will incur an additional $41,196 to $467,562 in expenses over their lifetimes compared with married heterosexual couples. [7] A Jan. 2014 analysis published by the Atlantic concluded that unmarried women pay up to one million dollars more over their lifetimes than married women for healthcare, taxes, and other expenses.

<p>But for 85% of the country, it&#39;s already a done deal.  Had the court done literally nothing, it would have happened within 3-5 years.  Sure there were a few holdouts, but it&#39;s not like the idea is controversial anymore.  And if you look at gens x and y almost none of them oppose gay marriage.  It&#39;s an ongoing issue but it&#39;s not one with huge opposition.  I mean if gay marriage is legal in Alabama, it&#39;s pretty much a Matter of time anywhere else.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not aimed that way.  Most people scan headlines if that.  Or they watch the news.  I follow politics as a hobby, (I&#39;m under no delusion that I have a voice) but most people only know the headlines in the paper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They decided that it was illegal for states to pass laws preventing gay marriage because of the 14th amendment. They didn&#39;t suddenly decide that it was legal. </p>

<p>Look up Loving v. Virginia. Very similar case involving interracial marriage in the 60&#39;s.</p>

<p>Edit: <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/1960-1969/1966/1966_395">http://www.oyez.org/cases/1960-1969/1966/1966_395</a> here&#39;s a link to a good summary of the case </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the 14th amendment </p>

<p>&quot;No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.&quot;  </p>

<p>So yes I am. The Supreme Court ruled that marriage was a fundamental right and that states did not the ability to prevent people from being married based on sex. I highly encourage you to read up on Loving V. Virginia </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to figure this out. So how does the 14th ammendment and the 10th ammendment work out. I know that&#39;s not the best way to ask, but marriage isn&#39;t defined in the Constitution, therefore should be a state issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No that&#39;s a great question. Any powers not explicitly granted to the federal government are left to states. 
However, states are not allowed to pass laws that violate the United States Constitution, because the constitution is the supreme law of the land. </p>

<p>So, the SCOTUS ruled that laws preventing same-sex marriage violated the 14th amendment, specifically the equal protection clause, and therefore all laws preventing same-marriage are unconstitutional and cannot be enforced.  </p>

<p>I hope that clears it up </p>

<p>Seriously, this thread is literally &quot;this is probably a distraction&quot; and up to the top it goes without any evidence to support that supposition.  I&#39;m not necessarily saying there&#39;s no truth to that statement, but can we at least accept the possibility that <strong>sometimes</strong> big news breaks while other important shit is  concurrently developing?  </p>

<p>I can definitely accept that often the conversation is steered away from important issues, but I&#39;m not going to accept the premise that important news is completely and intentionally fabricated in order to &quot;hide&quot; other news without evidence.  And you shouldn&#39;t either.  </p>

<p>What I see is a sharper and sharper divide between conservative and progressive (socially liberal) America. And bolstered by SJW, &quot;political correctness&quot; is becoming &quot;newspeak&quot;. Paradoxically social-liberals have allied themselves to political correct-SJW.</p>

<p>Much like any &quot;social engineering&quot; attempt at this scale, it will backfire badly, with the &quot;artificial&quot; divide between Dems and GOPs giving more sway for corporate interests to finally takeover America. Embittered conservatives will feed the revival of neocons, talks of &quot;Texas Secession&quot; along with government critical groups (soon to be labelled &quot;terrorists&quot;) exerting more pressure</p>

Think about it: the SCOTUS says Obamacare is legit, and gay marriage is legit, and at the same time the conservative South (who would generally be against both) has to give up a symbol of their history and heritage. A symbol of resistance to Federal tyranny (not slavery). All the blacks are pissed about cops and crazy white kids &quot;killing them&quot; and all of the rednecks are pissed that the gays can marry, and the latinos get free health care, but they lose their battle flag.

<p>hopefully the gay marriage thing can be put to bed now, it&#39;s done, over. not that i don&#39;t support it but enough is enough in terms of media attention, it doesn&#39;t effect that many people relative to things like this! it&#39;s incredible how many people are totally blind to the pending trade agreement, it&#39;s consequences are HUGE!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s spin.  First of all the issue had largely been decided years ago.  36 of 50 states already had legal gay marriage, and more would have been added every year.  Even if the ruling had gone the other way or no ruling had been issued, within 3-5 years the results would have been the same.  I don&#39;t know of many people under 30 who oppose this.  So asking why they had to be in a huge rush to issue a ruling that 80% of the country agrees with isn&#39;t that weird.  Especially when the TPP is being fast tracked (and we aren&#39;t allowed to know about it) nor is it being covered.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I suppose the thousands of gay citizens across the country would have been ok to wait for gay marriage to be legalized on a slow news day right? Seriously, fuck yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3 years tops, and it&#39;s legal in 85% of the country if the court said no.  36 of 50 states allow gay marriage, they have for years in some cases.  And again given that 90% of the country allows gay marriage, and at least 70% of the population wants gay marriage, including pretty much every major corporation, the wait even in the worst places wasn&#39;t going to be long. </p>

Cognitive dissonance is not a thing to be worked about, it&#39;s a descriptive (not prescriptive) concept for use in patient care re: psychological and social sciences.
