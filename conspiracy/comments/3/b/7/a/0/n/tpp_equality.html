    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not the only one that noticed.   Legalized same swx marriage has been coming. They could have ruled on that last week, last month, last year, or a year from now. They chose today. That&#39;s not a coincidence.   Not only does it distract the masses from TPP, youcan guarantee no one in media will talk about the ruling that merely having constructive posession of an unregistered nfa weapon is now considered a violent felony. Not the use of, not the actual possession of, the knowledge the whereabouts and ability to obtain an unregistered nfa weapon is itself a violent felony now. But what journalist in the right mind is going to tryto push that story mainstream when YAY GAY MARRIAGE!</p>

<p>Don&#39;t mistake me, equality is good. I don&#39;t personally agree with gay marriage, but it should be the right of the individual to do what they wish. But the point is, they could have ruled on this at any point. They saved it as a smokescreen for something big.</p>

<p>Restructuring our government to the point where we are underneath the authority of a union with other countries is another step towarda globalism.  Equating knowledge of the whereabouts of an nfa weapon to violent crime is in the most literal way thought crime. The only step they need to take now is classify semi auto rifles or semi auto pistols or pump or semi auto rifles NFA weapons and they can say anyone with KNOWLEDGE is commiting violent crime.</p>

<p>&quot;You know of anyone with an AR-15?&quot; &quot;No, officer.&quot; &quot;Are you sure? If we find out you do, and you lied about it, we can only assume you have constructive posession of that weapon.&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t! They guy next door! He has a safe full! He can get to them, I wouldnt even know the code! They&#39;re his!&quot; Now they have probable cause, no need for a warrant.  Opsec is about to become worlds more important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of noise was being made online about TPP and TTIP which could&#39;ve bubbled up to mainstream, they can&#39;t have that. And suddenly we have gay marriage in the US (which is still mainstream news in Europe) and a wave of terrorist attacks around the world. Or the overly gruesome ISIS video, for which I hold no opinion on its veracity, but the timing, as always, spot on.</p>

<p>By the time this all blows over (literally?) and that the informational noise it generated reduces, it&#39;ll be too late for anything serious to get good traction against these treaties.</p>

<p>TTIP might not be at the same stage as TPP, but as I view it, if TPP is adopted, Europe will have no choice but to follow suite. Going the other way would probably hurt Europe economically, forcing them to adopt TTIP. Even then I don&#39;t see them refusing it as it is.</p>

<p>And I have a feeling that the few international conflicts that are boiling up (Ukraine, Syria, ISIS, ...) are being manipulated and can be made to escalate in violence in order to generate the informational noise needed to drown the wave of globalism oriented laws and trades that are popping up at an accelerating rate for a good half century now. They seem to have adopted the same approach for the social agenda, making sure they have the control of the narrative and when things unfold.</p>

<p>They are not without goals -good or bad- of their own these conflicts and social advances, but from their perspective I think it&#39;s fair to assume they want to make sure the dominoes fall in the right order as it would surely increase their control of the economy thus insuring their capital grows while minimizing risk. </p>

<p>It feels though that right now their are exasperated with the increased awareness and scrutiny they have come under since the &quot;rebirth&quot; of the internet after the bubble of the early 2000s, which has seen it truly reach the global state as an informational channel for the masses. Almost by accident one could say, but that&#39;s a whole other story and I&#39;m already way out there.</p>

<p>So, that seems convoluted, and hard to execute, but I think we&#39;ve seen enough evidence that the powers that be have the tools and have used them repeatedly in various scenarios that demonstrate their ability to control the narrative and indeed make the masses and client nations march to their rhythm. From spying on people to taking over nations, they have demonstrated that nothing will prevent them from increasing their profits and capital, as well as their grasp on society, what it is, what it will become, and at times even what it was.</p>

<p>Internet has proven to be a bit of a pea under the mattress of these hoarders, their are still not in full control and people are starting to connect the dots. Those that cross borders, the international nature of the internet has allowed many to get a better look at the big pictures, and realize the global nature of these entities and the threat they represent to every human being.</p>

<p>TL;DR They are pushing their agenda all around the world, they are making sure internet doesn&#39;t spoil the party before they can shut its trap indefinitely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who cares about same-sex marriage when even hetero-marriages have a ton of problems already with people being divorced? Just another media distraction.</p>

<p>Leave it to the government and media to promote gay marriage to further the depopulation agenda. There&#39;s been far too much emphasis on sexuality that deviates outside of the norm. Will people still remember that human beings have survived for this long due to healthy, normal hetero relationships when we placed more emphasis on the family?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work as an accountant for a small firm doing work for small business. I&#39;m subscribed to several newsletters relating to tax in order to help our clients not get screwed over. Anyway, one of the newsletters recently reported on this and I shit you not, it said something along the lines of &quot;while this is not tax related, it may have implications for future tax issues.&quot; It&#39;s pretty disgusting that these agencies (not even big agencies) are sending out breaking news alerts and point out that it doesn&#39;t relate to what they normally do. </p>

<p>Edit: Just dug it out of my trash:</p>

<p>&quot;The Supreme Court, in a landmark 5-4 decision, has ruled that same-sex marriage is a right guaranteed by the 14th Amendment and that a States are thus required to both license a marriage between two people of the same sex and recognize a lawful same-sex marriage performed out-of-State. (Obergefell v. Hodges)</p>

<p>The majority opinion, written by Justice Kennedy and joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, described the history of marriage as “one of both continuity and change,” and described the Court’s jurisprudence on marriage as guaranteeing a fundamental right that carries with it a host of social, economic, and legal consequences.  </p>

<p>Four separate dissents were filed by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito.  </p>

<p><strong>Although Obergefell is not a tax case</strong>, it will certainly impact the taxes of same-sex married couples.  Many same-sex couples have been subject to conflicting treatment of their marital status by the State and Federal government because, although the Supreme Court’s Windsor decision in 2013 mandated Federal recognition of same-sex marriage, it did not compel that States do the same.&quot;</p>

<p>This was from RIA Checkpoint. My initial wording wasn&#39;t exact but there you have it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well on that note, being married doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you pay more taxes even though you may get bumped to a higher tax bracket. It&#39;s all about the effective rate. Married couples will also have more expenses that typically offset taxable income. </p>

<p>Maybe I just misunderstood your point there, but I felt that was a necessary clarification. I agree that taxes suck and the system is broken. My coworkers often say we&#39;re in the industry of deciphering stupid laws created by stupid people so that people who aren&#39;t smart enough or simply don&#39;t care can collect their interest free loans back from the government.. </p>
