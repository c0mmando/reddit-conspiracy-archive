        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Aurora Massacre was a shooting that took place at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado in 2012. The lone suspect, James Eagan Holmes, is currently on trial for murder.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Aurora_shooting">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Aurora_shooting</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>On July 20, 2012, a mass shooting occurred inside of a Century movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, during a midnight screening of the film The Dark Knight Rises. A gunman, dressed in tactical clothing, set off tear gas grenades and shot into the audience with multiple firearms, killing 12 people and injuring 70 others. <strong>The sole suspect, James Eagan Holmes, was arrested in his car parked outside the cinema minutes later.</strong> It was the deadliest shooting in Colorado since the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, and had the largest number of casualties of any shooting in U.S. history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although James Holmes is the sole subject, initial reports spoke of multiple shooters:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://willyloman.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/aurora-massacre-abc-reports-multiple-shooters/">Aurora Massacre: ABC Reports Multiple Shooters</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout the investigation, there has been speculation that James Holmes either had assistance or was entirely framed. This speculation is bolstered by the presence of a second gasmask:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>If there was indeed a second gunman, this would be confirmed by video of the emergency exit. Unfortunately, all videos appear to have been seized by police.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://willyloman.wordpress.com/2012/08/14/aurora-massacre-recordings-seized-by-police/">Aurora Massacre: Recordings “Seized” by Police?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Who was the police chief in Aurora at the time?</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Oates">Dan Oates</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Daniel J. Oates (born January 2, 1955) is the police chief in Miami Beach.[2] He was formerly the Police Chief of Aurora, Colorado[3][4] He was also formerly the Chief of Police and Safety Services Administrator for the City of Ann Arbor, Michigan. <strong>Oates was appointed Chief of Police on August 20, 2001</strong> after serving 21 years in the New York Police Department. In August 2002, Oates became Ann Arbor&#39;s first Safety Services Administrator. He is a charter member of the federal Criminal Intelligence Coordinating Council.[5] While with the Aurora Police department the department was responsible for the criminal investigation of the 2012 movie theatre shootings in Aurora, Colorado, one of the largest mass shootings in American history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, note that he is currently the police chief of Miami Beach:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Daniel J. Oates (born January 2, 1955) is the police chief in Miami Beach.[2]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>reference: <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/miami-beach/article1963693.html">http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/miami-beach/article1963693.html</a></p>

<p>additionally:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Theater shooting
Main article: 2012 Aurora shooting</p>

<p>Oates was the chief of police in Aurora at the time of a shooting at the midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises.[12] In a remark on the booby traps in the suspect&#39;s apartment, Oates stated that the apartment was rigged &quot;to kill whoever entered it&quot;.[12] He expanded on this by saying &quot;It was going to be a police officer...We sure as hell are angry&quot;.[12] When asked about the strength of the case against the alleged shooter, Oates responded, &quot;We will convict him. Yes.&quot;[13]</p>

<p>Despite his assurances, <strong>Oates twice ignored during a press conference reporters who asked him if there were any cameras at the theater &amp; refused to speculate how Holmes might have entered the theater without outside help.[14]</strong> Further, Oates did not address the concerns of witness Corbin Dates who told Hardball with Chris Matthews that there was <strong>a man with a goatee</strong> (Holmes did not have a goatee), who was lingering near the emergency exit.[15]**</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A &quot;man with a goatee&quot;. A goatee. Like Alex Milano. A noted gun-control advocate, present at the shooting and interviewed on local news:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHVQOMxzrqI&amp;t=1m10s">Aurora Theater Shooting Eyewitness Alex Milano Interview</a></li>
</ul>

<p>One of the youtube comments for the above interview notes that he was in the gun control advocacy movie, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_3MFZYni6Y">Bowling for Columbine</a>, but <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310793/fullcredits">if that&#39;s true he&#39;s scrubbed from the IMDB credits</a>.</p>

<p>Yep, there&#39;s that fucker, &quot;DJ&quot;:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_3MFZYni6Y&amp;t=9m5s">Bowling for Columbine (fast-forwarded</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Screenshots/portraits:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/uaNFaNx.png">&quot;DJ&quot; from Bowling for Columbine</a> -- notably given NO CREDIT on the IMDB page</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZSFBeNo.png">Alex Milano from the Aurora Massacre interview</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Side by side:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/BkjRHNB.png">Alex Milano from Aurora Massacre vs &quot;DJ&quot; from <em>Bowling for Columbine</em></a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So the second gunman appears to be Alex Milano. Evidence is being withheld by the (now) Miami beach police chief, Daniel J. Oates.</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>Looking ahead:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/authorities-warn-homeland-july/2015/06/27/id/652535/">Authorities Warn of Potential Fourth of July Terror Attacks</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>A gunman killed at least 37 people and wounded 36 in an attack on a beach resort in Tunisia Friday.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/27/africa/tunisia-terror-attack/">Tourists flee Tunisia after resort attack</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And, remember:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Daniel J. Oates (born January 2, 1955) is the police chief in Miami Beach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>So it&#39;s looking like an &quot;ISIS&quot; attack at Miami Beach on July 4th.</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>Notice that the FBI is setting up across the country, including Miami Beach. They have access to all the information compiled in this thread, so surely they are aware of the threat. If it still takes place, it is clear they are corrupted as well. So far, we have no arrests, so we may assume they are indeed corrupt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No? My point was that Alex Milano was reportedly 19 during Aurora in 2012. If &quot;DJ&quot; were in Bowling for Columbine in 2002 and in high school during 1999, he&#39;d have to have at least been born no later than 1984. Making him, at the youngest, 15 during Columbine, 18 for the movie, and 32 for Aurora. And, that the dude in the Bowling for Columbine video almost looks older than the acne faced Alex Milano of 2012.</p>

<p>Cool. First is it his real name and age? Second I think He looked older in 2012. The guy looked over 30 IMO. </p>

<p>What about Dan and the Videos? To me that&#39;s more important and not as subjective. </p>
