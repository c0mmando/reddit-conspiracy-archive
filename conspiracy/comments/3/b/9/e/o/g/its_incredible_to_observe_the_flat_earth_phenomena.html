<p>I&#39;ve been around &quot;conspiracies&quot; quite some time, but I never ever seen anything this well organized as these flat earth bums.</p>

<p>All the usual shit they assign to &quot;looney conspiracy theories&quot; (oh so you believe the government killed Kennedy? oh what, now you gonna tell me 9-11 was an inside job? oh, now you gonna blame neocon ashkenazi jews?) is long gone now.</p>

<p>They&#39;re gonna replace is soon, as soon as they choose to pick their prime muppet and we&#39;ll see, in couple of months, the term conspiracy theory, bastardized as it is right now, will be bastardized even more (I don&#39;t even know how is that even possible).</p>

<p>Behold.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists. Those people who believe 9-11 was an inside job and the earth is flat.</p>

<p>What? Earth if flat? Oh gimme a break. They ain&#39;t that nuts.</p>

<p>Yes they are - click.</p>

<p>Well, have to say - brilliant execution, whoever came up with this. Brilliant. Even better than censoring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know the true nature of the earth. All I do know is that flat earthers and concave earthers raise some valid points and questions that we need to answer.</p>

<p>Why is it impossible to see the earth&#39;s curvature? No matter how high up you go? There is a YouTube video where they send up a balloon to 120,000 feet, and the horizon is still flat. Whereas nasa pictures from similar Heights show substantial curvature. </p>

<p>The only pictures of the earth&#39;s curvature are a) released by nasa, b) taken with a fish eye lens. There are even many videos where they compare nasa&#39;s pictures of earth from space to satellite images of earth, and there are many inconsistencies. </p>

<p>Idk the truth but there is definitely something fishy going on. I am certain there is a secret space program, and then there is a nasa space program for us to follow. I know flat earth sounds crazy, but that is the conspiracy. The conspiracy is the fact that they convinced you its a conspiracy. </p>

Fact #2...if the earth was flat an approaching ship on the sea would appear whole as soon as you saw it. Obviously this does not happen, why? Because the earth is round and you always see the top of the mast BEFORE you see anything else.
Seriously dude, how old are you? To even entertain the idea that the earth is ANYTHING but round makes you and any other person who thinks the earth is flat look like, well, hate to say, but an ignoramus!</p>

<p>Your post history shows absolutely no research, or investigation of your own just shutting down the stuff you don&#39;t like.</p>

<p>Hell even your opinions are Luke warm at best. </p>

<p>If this subject bothers you so much and you won&#39;t take a dispassionate look at evidence then ignore it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TL;DR</p>

<p>You&#39;re not a TRUE conspiracy theorist.  A true theorist would accept this regardless of anything based in reality.  Your post does not satisfy my need for &quot;research or investigation&quot;, something that is totally subjective but I will push it on you regardless.</p>

<p>Your opinions also don&#39;t align with my own, hence the jab at being &quot;luke warm&quot;.  (Totally subjective)</p>

<p>If the topic bothers you, you would accept it blindly without any real investigation nor balance it with what math/science and PICTURES OF THE EARTH from above shows us clearly.</p>

<p>(I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m still typing this nonsense)</p>

<p>You&#39;re not a &quot;critical thinker&quot; because I say so.  (Again subjective)</p>

<p>Be a &quot;better&quot; person according to me......you should feel bad for where you are and should strive to be more like the subjective person that am or feel that I am.  (subjective?  duh huh!!!)</p>

<p>What a asinine comment to make.</p>

<p>Just fucking prove it isn&#39;t. You guys like to throw out the moving charts about how you THINK the sun and moon revolve aroundHave you been to space? Have you seen a flat earth? No. What dumb questions to base your argument on.

<p>Yeah, so can I and from what I&#39;ve seen, the ships do not go over the horizon as if it was a sphere. They just go out of our range of sight. Take a telescope and watch a ship go over the horizon, you can still see it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kids can study circumnavigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So how is circumnavigation not applicable if the earth is not a sphere? They still could&#39;ve sailed around the earth. That doesn&#39;t really prove much.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>How does that prove a sphere?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>How does that prove a sphere? Also, no need to be rude.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>How does that prove a sphere? That&#39;s when the moon goes in front of the sun, has nothing to do with earth.</p>

<p>You obviously haven&#39;t looked into the flat earth theory. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0nHCP_yVEI">Check out this 30 minute clip.</a>. I&#39;m not saying I believe it, just entertaining the thought and playing devil&#39;s advocate.</p>
