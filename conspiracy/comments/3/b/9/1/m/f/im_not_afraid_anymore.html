<p>But also when you go down the rabbit hole, the people you are close to in the real world are no longer in the same place as you are. I have spent hundreds of hours looking into some conspiracies and explaining (persuasively) why you think they are conspiracies in a few sentences is extremely difficult. As a result, I have had some fairly antagonistic conversations with friends and family who either don&#39;t want to know or who think I have lost the plot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, I have the same result. I&#39;ve realized the facebook stereotype of &quot;guy who is constantly posting status updates about crazy stuff&quot; is not the best. What I&#39;ve found works for me, on FB, is to occasionally post something relatively uncontroversial (anti C-51, etc) and to &quot;like&quot; the posts of some of the more hardcore stuff. It pops up in the newsfeed of others that I have liked this article or post, I don&#39;t have to &quot;put myself out there&quot; by posting it as a status update, and maybe wake some people up in the process. </p>

<p>In the end, the &quot;I&#39;m not afraid anymore&quot; mindset is exactly where we need to be, it&#39;s too late in the game for that, but going ham and posting CHEMTRAILS 9-11 as your status every 25 minutes is not helping anyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if the data collection isn&#39;t about just getting us to self censor? What if all the data they collect goes to teams of researchers who compile it and form algorithms that they use to program AI? </p>

<p>All the sock puppet accounts on social media would be a lot easier to coordinate with an algorithm and one human to edit vs thousands of humans to write and self edit...</p>

<p>What if the data they collect is as much about targeting everyone as much as it&#39;s about learning dialogue, values, ideals, and hot button issues we deem important? </p>

<p>What if they use the data to group and categorize people on an ideological and emotional level effectively know us better than we know ourselves?</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it be a thousand times easier to spot potential lone wolfs, infiltrate grassroot activists and gain trust, squash or placate an uprising before it gained traction? </p>

<p>Does it seem like they&#39;d use the data for this sort of thing because it&#39;s easier and allows them to kill in a discerning sort of way and thus satisfying their need for tyrannical control as well as anonymity?</p>

<p>The real shot callers desire control not worship. Those who desire worship are controllable and disposable. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a game remember?</p>

<p>Or yeah they actually think cheetos stained fingers furiously ranting on random reddit and other social media forums are threats... That masters degree from YouTube U and PhD form Wikipedia isn&#39;t something they take lightly :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve been looking at things about conspiracies and stuff for the better part of a decade.   I (when I had a social media account) was very outspoken about it.   Now I am sure I&#39;m on some list.   I have never had trouble with the law,  but everytime I fly somewhere I get pulled aside for more searching and questioning about where I&#39;m going/doing.   I have applied for several jobs where I need a background check ran (I wanted to be a police officer at one time.  Then a bodyguard, and lastly a fire fighter which I applied for on several counties), and each one I met all minimum requirements yet failed a background check everytime.  Again,  I have no history that would cause me to be denied advancement to the other parts of application.  But everytime.   I may be being a nut, but I honestly believe it&#39;s because I&#39;m on a list of undesirables due to things I&#39;ve looked up,  statements I&#39;ve made about it,  and what I believe. </p>

<p>I think when this Jade Helm 15 stuff ends they&#39;re going to bring down the hammer. And honestly,  I think I will be one of the people black bagged in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a way to get people who enjoy making themselves rich by making problems for the rest of us  out of office and a way of  replacing them with   more human leaders.</p>
