<p>If you look at posts from <a href="/u/OWNtheNWO">/u/OWNtheNWO</a> (who I firmly believe shares some of the best info on this sub) it seems they put a target on his/her head.  Vote fluctuation, comment harrassment, repetitive attempts to discredit shared articles, you name it.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re reading this, please don&#39;t let em get to you.  In the end, I think that&#39;s a big goal of theirs, to get the brightest thinkers and those vigilant to share all they can to either explode under pressure or outright leave the website.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks I appreciate that, there are far better self-posters than me, I&#39;m just a news hound and I&#39;m far from perfect, I get shit wrong - but I also won&#39;t let personal bias about websites or media personalities dissuade me from posting an article if I think it&#39;s good or worthwhile in some way to help better understand the overall puzzle.  I know I have a reputation of Infowars and NaturalNews and I do like a lot of the articles they post, but I also post from many other sites, that vary wildly in their personal politics.</p>

<p>I&#39;m the type of person that censorship or gangstalking or other shit like that just makes me double down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, that&#39;s one of the best parts about this sub, it gives us the chance to fully dissect each video or article, take a bit of info from each stance [whether it be alt media, self-posts, mainstream, or blatant propaganda filth] and -hopefully- get just one piece of the 1 trillion piece puzzle, even if we don&#39;t quite know where it fits yet.</p>

<p>The downside is the clearly biased folk that want to act like they know EXACTLY what is going on, but it&#39;s been pretty easy to notice them and shrug them off.  In example, anything mentioning chemtrails brings forth the vapor brigade, instead of critically analyzing anything that clearly comes from a plane, we are called dumb and told &quot;vapor, shut up,&quot; and given no absolute proof.</p>

<p>This forum should always be about critical thinking and debate, not ultimate truths, for those are so few and far between in the world today that I doubt anyone here has even one, but together is where we can begin to put this puzzle together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your words of encouragement.  I have wanted to be active in this sub but it seems like a mine field.  In the broader world, there is a HUGE stigma for questioning the official version of events.  I have a hard time explaining that I&#39;m not out to see everything as manipulated by aliens but that I might be believing the collective yet unofficial voices about America engaging in foreign covert operations.  I&#39;ve found youtube is helpful and I&#39;ve been watching lots of episodes of Alternative Views and hopefully will find some current sources and find people wanting to engage in conversation about the whole spectrum of what is really going on or what really happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. While i think some of his posts are little more than crackpot theories, i also think he has a right to post them regardless, and that some of his posts are actually interesting tidbits that help piece together the puzzle. We live in such a totalitarian age of information. ideas are mocked because they didn&#39;t come from the right source of information, regardless of content. Rational unbiased thought is hard to come by now, whether it is IRL or on reddit. And when i say unbiased thought, i dont just mean anti-authoritarian thought, i mean all thoughts regardless of political view, just thoughts that are well researched and open to new ideas. </p>

AGW and carbon taxes is a perfect example, it&#39;s two industries (coal and oil) at each other throats, with a bunch of other vultures using it as a global regulatory control system to get their greedy talons in and create a multi trillion dollar industry off of a lifecycle (carbon) of the planet.
