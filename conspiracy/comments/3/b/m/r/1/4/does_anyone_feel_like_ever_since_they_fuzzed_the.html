<p>They paid off reddit with the tax money that is stolen from you by the government so that they can lie to and manipulate you and call it &quot;strengthening communities&quot;.  Isn&#39;t it wonderful?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.  You are reading that correctly.  </p>

<p>Remember that the government is a corporation with $3Trillion in revenue.  People worry about the dishonest influence of corporations like Wal-Mart, but the government has 6x (wal-mart has annual revenue of about $486B) the amount of wealth.  This doesn&#39;t even count the money that we don&#39;t see or that they can literally print money and hand it out to their friends (see:  the banks).</p>

<p>That is a lot of wealth and power... too much, if you ask me.</p>

<p>For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, Walmart increased net sales by 1.9% to $482.2 billion and returned $7.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Walmart ranked first on the 2014 Fortune 500 list of the world&#39;s largest companies by revenue.</p>

I forget exactly what you were talking about and don&#39;t care enough to navigate back to the comment on my phone, but do you understand the difference between an income statement and a balance sheet?

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  I compared the revenue to each other and then pointed out how much wealth that can be.  You are correct, revenue and wealth are not the same but also obviously related, however that doesn&#39;t change the fundamental point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In June 2010 the Department of Health and Human Services created the Strengthening Communities Fund[9] as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The fund was appropriated $50 million to be given as grants to organizations in the United States who were engaged in Capacity Building programs. The grants were given to two different types of capacity builders:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>State, Local and Tribal governments engaged in capacity building: grants will go to state local and tribal governments to equip them with the capacity to more effectively partner with faith-based or non-faith based nonprofit organizations.[10]

    Capacity building in this program will involve education and outreach that catalyzes more involvement of nonprofit organizations in economic recovery
</code></pre>

<p>and building up nonprofit organization&#39;s abilities to tackle economic problems. State, Local and Tribal governments can receive up to $250,000 in two year grants</p>

<pre><code>Nonprofit Social Service Providers engaged in capacity building: they will make grants available to nonprofit organizations who can assist other nonprofit organizations in organizational development, program development, leadership, and evaluations. Nonprofits can receive up to $1 million in two year grants.

<p>Wow... in just 2 minutes I can find 5 posts where our good friend nomed_yob walks in perfect lock-step with blacksunalchemy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like this account exists just to try to give the perception of consensus and credibility to blacksunalchemy...</p>

<p>Funny how that username has now been magically deleted along with all of those comments after me and JamesColes called you out for it.</p>

<p>Dumping more links from a conversation I had with another mod:</p>

<p>So it looks like <a href="/u/75000_Tokkul">/u/75000_Tokkul</a> [-2] seems to make SRD threads for our good friend blacksunalchemy.</p>

<p>They clearly don&#39;t make them about every little post, but anywhere that he is able to take control away and steer conversations seem to get a &quot;LOL look how dumb&quot; post.</p>

<p>He&#39;s desperate and I think this web is probably bigger than just what we have seen.</p>

<p>Lol@ this thread where he is talking to himself on his new <a href="/u/jibrish2">/u/jibrish2</a> account: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/pzecx/this_should_be_illegal_billionaire_sheldon/c3tmd4n?context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/pzecx/this_should_be_illegal_billionaire_sheldon/c3tmd4n?context=3</a></p>

<p>Jesus... this guy is fucking crazy.</p>

<p>How do we know nomed_yob is him?</p>

<p>Oh? You posted that yourself! <a href="http://www.redditfun.com/reddit/funny/163070965/Harrison-Ford-in-the-new-live-action-Duck-Tales-movie">http://www.redditfun.com/reddit/funny/163070965/Harrison-Ford-in-the-new-live-action-Duck-Tales-movie</a></p>

<p>Here is a little post I made about nomed_yob on that thread a few days ago:</p>

<p>Here is another good example:</p>

<p>So <a href="/u/blacksunalchemy">/u/blacksunalchemy</a> used the <a href="/u/nomed_yob">/u/nomed_yob</a> account to make a SRD thread about this post: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/shamelessplug/comments/u0wct/i_run_rdailydot_where_i_post_a_reddit_news/c4rmsnh">http://www.reddit.com/r/shamelessplug/comments/u0wct/i_run_rdailydot_where_i_post_a_reddit_news/c4rmsnh</a></p>

<p>And he also &quot;just coincidentally&quot; happened to post on the m&#39;lady thread here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2kvxdw/my_friend_who_owns_a_photo_booth_had_a_halloween/">https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2kvxdw/my_friend_who_owns_a_photo_booth_had_a_halloween/</a></p>

<p>Along with both blacksunalchemy and jibrish2? The connection seems crystal clear to me.</p>

<p>Some of these are probably repeats, but that is what I have for now.</p>

<p>In summary, the known accounts linked to him so far are:</p>

<p><a href="/u/blacksunalchemy">/u/blacksunalchemy</a> <a href="/u/jibrish">/u/jibrish</a> <a href="/u/jibrish2">/u/jibrish2</a> <a href="/u/nomed_yob">/u/nomed_yob</a></p>

<p>Has anyone else noticed that front page posts seem to have a lot fewer comments than they used to? Posts with 5k points and only 200 comments seem common now.</p>

<p>I wonder if the demographic has changed or if they&#39;re inflating the vote counts to make it seem like the site is doing as well as ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s something I&#39;ve noticed this past year that is very blatant. I think they are relying on redditors chalking it up to, “oh it’s just reddit up to the same old silliness with pun threads etc.” It wasn’t always that way though. I’ve had this account for almost 4 years now and lurked long before that. It didn’t used to be that way. I’m not saying every single thread was filled with intellectual discussion, but I remember threads with 1000+ comments and the majority, especially the top ones, were usually good solid debates in regards to whatever the article/topic was. I’ve slowly watched it all turn into complete bullshit and I know others have seen the same thing. One by one I watched r/politics, r/news, etc. turn into a total cesspool. I guess what I’m trying to say is it’s not by accident.</p>

More often than not after I give a article in support of my argument that makes them look really soulless (on the subjects of illegal war and police brutality I get very suspect replies), all of a sudden, all of their comments are deleted and my comments burred under [delete] + 3 children.
