The idea that I meant to convey, was, that I did not believe that the Lodges of Free Masons in <em>this</em> Country had, as Societies, endeavoured to propagate the diabolical tenets of the first, or pernicious principles of the latter (if they are susceptible of separation). That Individuals of them may have done it, or that the founder, or instrument employed to found, the Democratic Societies in the United States, may have had these objects; and actually had a separation of the People from their Government in view, is too evident to be questioned.&quot; ~ George Washington
&quot;If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered...I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.&quot; ~ Thomas Jefferson</p>

It can also be found in The Writings of George Washington, vol. 20, p. 518.</p>

<p>There is not enough proof for Thomas Jefferson&#39;s quote. Although he did say this in a letter to John Taylor in 1816: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And I sincerely believe, with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies; and that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have thought the same but I also think that he would be opposed. He wanted a federal govt that would have enough authority over the states to acquiesce to London financial interests, which really was the most practical. Basically his plan was to establish independence with the mother country and then make them a willing ally because you appease the financial powers that run said mother country. I don&#39;t necessarily support such an idea but I see the logic in it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know of no prohibition of specific information being forbidden to be taught. The local systems chose not to teach these seemingly esoteric points of government that are actually lynchpins</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve was created in 1913.  Here&#39;s some early history from DOE&#39;s website:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The original Department of Education was created in 1867 to collect information on schools and teaching that would help the States establish effective school systems. While the agency&#39;s name and location within the Executive Branch have changed over the past 130 years, this early emphasis on getting information on what works in education to teachers and education policymakers continues down to the present day.</p>

<p>The passage of the Second Morrill Act in 1890 gave the then-named Office of Education responsibility for administering support for the original system of land-grant colleges and universities. Vocational education became the next major area of Federal aid to schools, with the 1917 Smith-Hughes Act and the 1946 George-Barden Act focusing on agricultural, industrial, and home economics training for high school students.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By the time the Federal DOE had been around long enough to form an actual agenda, the Federal Reserve had already been created.  But absence of any mention of the Fed and its true function in policy and government in courses like &quot;Introduction to US Government&quot; is troubling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that this information is forbidden, it&#39;s that it&#39;s not in the government&#39;s interests to educate people about how badly the government has fucked everyone over. Claiming responsibility over education is a fantastic way of ensuring that the public only learns what the government wants them to learn. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But everything he said was in the first sentence was wrong. The federal Reserve system is a private central banking system that keeps inflation and deflation in check. Before the fed reserve, inflation/deflation was less predictable and controlled. US citizens have far more property than they did in Jefferson&#39;s day and his children became homeless because he lived on borrowed money and sucked at business and the government had to bail out his estate after he died.</p>
