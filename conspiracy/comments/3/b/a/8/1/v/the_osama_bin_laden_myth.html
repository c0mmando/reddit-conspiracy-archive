        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>The interview below with Osama bin Laden was conducted by the Karachi, Pakistan, daily newspaper, Ummat and published on September 28, 2001, 17 days after the alleged, but unsubstantiated, al Qaeda attack of September 11, 2001, on the World Trade Center twin towers and Pentagon. The interview was sensational. The alleged “mastermind” of 9/11 said that he and al Qaeda had nothing to do with the 9/11 attack. The British Broadcasting Corporation’s World Monitoring Service had the interview translated into English and made public on September 29, 2001.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Osama bin Laden’s sensational denial was not reported by the US print and TV media. It was not investigated by the executive branch. No one in the US Congress called attention to bin Laden’s refusal of responsibility for the greatest humiliation ever inflicted on a superpower.</strong></p>

<p><strong>To check my memory of the lack of coverage, I googled “Osama bin Laden’s interview denying responsibility for 9/11.” Some Internet sites reproduced the interview, but the only mainstream news source that I found was a 1 minute YouTube video from CNN in which the anchor, after quoting an al Jazeera report of bin Laden’s denial, concludes that “we can all weigh that in the scale of credibility and come to our own conclusions.” In other words, bin Laden had already been demonized, and his denial was not credible.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The sensational news was unfit for US citizens and was withheld from them by the american “free press,” a press free to lie for the government but not to tell the truth.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Obviously, if bin Laden had outwitted not only the National Security Agency, the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the FBI, but also all 16 US intelligence agencies, all intelligence agencies of Washington’s NATO puppet states, Israel’s Mossad, and in addition the National Security Council, NORAD, US air traffic control, and airport security four times on the same morning, it would be the greatest feat in world history, a movement building feat that would have made al Qaeda the most successful anti-imperialist organization in human history, an extraordinary victory over “the great satan” that would have brought millions of new recruits into al Qaeda’s ranks. Yet the alleged “mastermind” denied all responsibility.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I remember decades ago when a terrorist attack occurred in Europe, whether real or an Operation Gladio <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gladio">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gladio</a> false flag attack, innumerable organizations would claim credit. Perhaps this was the CIA’s way of diverting attention from itself, but it illustrates that every intelligence service understands the value to an organization of claiming credit for a successful attack.Although bin Laden denied responsibility, in 2011 some al Qaeda leaders, realizing the prestige value of the 9/11 attack, claimed credit for the attack and criticized Iranian President Ahmadinejad for questioning the official US story.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Although only a few Americans are aware of the September 28, 2001 interview in which bin Laden states his non-involvement with the 9/11 attacks, many Americans have seen post-2001 videos in which a person alleged to be bin Laden takes credit for the attacks. There are two problems with these videos. Experts have examined them and found them to be fakes, and all of the videos appeared after bin Laden was reported by the Pakistan Observer, the Egyptian press, and Fox News to have died in mid-December, 2001, from lung disease.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41576,00.html">http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41576,00.html</a> </p>

<p><strong>Bin Laden also suffered from kidney disease. According to a CBS news report on January 28, 2002, Osama bin Laden was hospitalized for dialysis treatment in the Pakistani military hospital in Rawalpindi on September 10, 2001, the day before 9/11.</strong> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/where-was-osama-on-september-11-2001/3194">http://www.globalresearch.ca/where-was-osama-on-september-11-2001/3194</a></p>

<p><strong>Obviously, a man suffering from terminal lung and kidney disease did not survive for another decade to be murdered by a US Navy SEAL team in Abbottabad. A Pakistani TV interview with the neighbor of the alleged “bin Laden compound” exposed the assassination hoax. This sensational interview also went unreported by america’s “free press.” I had the interview translated, and it is available here:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Shortly after the alleged assassination 30 members of the SEAL unit died in a mysterious helicopter crash in Afghanistan, and now we learn that not a single one of the thousands of sailors on the aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson, witnessed bin Laden’s alleged burial at sea from that ship. The press reports with a straight face that for unexplained reasons it was kept secret from the ship’s sailors. This is supposed to be the explanation of the sailors’ emails reporting to family and friends that they witnessed no burial at sea. Some speculate that the SEALs were bumped off before their questions to one another, “Were you on that raid?,” reached outside the unit. Apparently, it doesn’t strike the media or the public as strange that the US government captured and killed the terror mastermind without interrogating him and without keeping any evidence or presenting any witnesses to support the assassination claim.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Adolf Hitler claimed that communists burned down the Reichstag and that Polish troops had crossed the frontier and attacked Germany. With 9/11 americans experienced Washington’s version of these grand lies. An omniscient bin Laden dying from terminal illnesses in distant Afghanistan defeated the American National Security State and drove his attack through the walls of the Pentagon itself, requiring for our defense a “war on terror” that destroyed US civil liberties and financially ruined the country in order to prevent the triumph of a man who died of natural causes in December 2001.</strong></p>

<p><strong>On May 9, 2011, Professor Michel Chossudovsky republished the September 28, 2001, Osama bin Laden interview in Global Research.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post. </p>

<p>I suspect the US misjudged Osama bin Laden, assuming he would accept the &quot;glory&quot; of 9/11 even though he wasn&#39;t responsible.</p>

<p>But Osama had pure jihadist principles - he only attacked US military targets, and then only in occupying bases in the Middle East/East Africa. Attacking American civilians inside the US would be cowardly, and unIslamic from his perspective. </p>

<p>In fact, when Osama went &quot;off script&quot; this posed quite a serious problem for the US administration, and his death shortly afterwards was very convenient for them (suggesting that Marfan syndrome may not have been the whole story perhaps?). The secret death of the real Osama allowed the US to ramp up the Osama bogeyman myth, with videos of lookalike Osamas issuing bloodcurdling threats...whilst wearing gold rings (oops, something forbidden to a Wahhabi like Osama).</p>

<p>Edit: clarification</p>

<p>A highly pertinent point which many people seem to be oblivious to.</p>

<p>Exactly. I&#39;m glad we agree with each other. And we do -- entirely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s actually easier to read that way...</p>

<p>As for the post...I started watching this doc from 1992 a few days ago <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo6yVNWcGCo"><strong>THE PANAMA DECEPTION</strong></a> which starts out by pointing out how slanted the US media was towards the US invasion of Panama...really shocking to see how brainwashed we are to have believed the US media for so long--&quot;a free press&quot;...i&#39;ve come to realize maybe the media in Russia is less dangerous than the US media--at least the Russians question everything their spin machine churns out...while here in the US, most Americans just see a report on TV and accept the &quot;official US version&quot; of events (even when the lie is exposed a day or two later).</p>

<p>I assembled a few other facts--mostly about Pakistan, that I found interesting: </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>STRANGE</strong> that the CIA spent untold amounts on operations as well as untold amounts of cash bribing everyone they could in Afghanistan and Pakistan to find out where UBL was...then they finally get lucky--after spending BILLIONS--and have an informer  WALK-IN who worked for the Pakistani ISI come in and cough up UBL&#39;s location. </p>

<p><strong>STRANGE</strong> that the U.S. gave <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/pakaid.pdf">Military Aid to Pakistan</a>--over $30 Billion since 9/11. </p>

<p><strong>STRANGE</strong> that <a href="http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2014/03/17/the-911-joint-congressional-inquiry-and-28-missing-pages/">Porter Goss and Bob Graham</a> were with the head of the Pakistan&#39;s ISI on 9/11 in Washington DC</p>

<p><strong>STRANGE</strong> that the head of Pakistan&#39;s ISI quit about a week after 9/11 because a newspaper from India published an <a href="http://www.propagandamatrix.com/india_helped_fbi_trace_isi_terrorist_links.htm">article outing him as having sent the 9/11 hijackers money</a></p>

<p>...but most folks don&#39;t remember all that.</p>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely right. Russians tend to accept institutional lies and propaganda as a part of everyday life, but many Americans want to fight you if you even suggest their media is less than impartial. </p>

<p>I had read that they traced some of the funding back to a Colonel in the ISI, but instead of arresting him, he was allowed to simply transfer his duties elsewhere. As far as I know he&#39;s never even been questioned.</p>
