<p>The data is conclusive. We do not do double blind Randomized Controlled Trials for vaccines so we do not have independent authentication that most of them actually do what is advertised, and many, many health care professionals see the connection between injections and (often) severe reactions. </p>

<p>The only thing keeping the farce up is the bandwagon effect. These type of threads (pro-vaccine worship threads) are essentially to keeping the charade up. But the general populous of the world is by no means the make-up of Reddit. It only took one boy to point out the Emperor had no clothes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The study has to test to see if the vaccine works. This one tested if people who took the vaccine missed less work. Correlation does not equal causation. People sometimes go to work sick. </p>

<p>It was not measuring vaccine efficacy. </p>

<p>Now the larger question is why is this OK? All vaccines should be required to be proven to work under double blind RCT&#39;s, which then must be repeated by unaffiliated 3rd parties. Especially before we mandate that everyone, including children, are forced to take them. </p>

<p>Every single vaccine should be proven to work. </p>

That is a ridiculous standard and shows you aren&#39;t actually in any field that uses the scientific method. No one is forcing anything and vaccine are proven to work before they used. Hell they even optimize for the best antibodies.</p>

<p>I have still yet to see even one RCT that is designed to prove any vaccine does what it is designed for, but I don&#39;t think we, the public, deserve one. We deserve multiple trials for every vaccine in existence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A so-called Harvard grad should understand basic principles of immunology and that the solid vaccine science is built upon those principles.</p>

<p>Come on, be honest.  You&#39;re not really a Harvard grad, are you?  The only sub you spend any amount of time in is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  You have yet to post in a sub such as <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a>, <a href="/r/medicine">/r/medicine</a>, <a href="/r/immunology">/r/immunology</a>.  You just regurgitate the talking point from anti-vaccine sites such as naturalnews.  You have not yet posted any sort of scholarly work published in a recognized specialty publication such as the NEJM, JAMA, BMJ, etc.  Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I believe the Harvard curriculum would include at least one research course that would have taught you to be more rigorous in your ehm &quot;research,&quot; no?  No, I highly doubt you went to Harvard.  In fact, I doubt you have any sort of higher education.</p>

<p>Now, go ahead and report this post to the mods, but know one thing: the only place you&#39;re taken seriously is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></p>

<p>Harvard grad - LOL!!!!</p>

<p>Except it was: An ad hominem is an argument that attacks a person&#39;s character rather then their argument. If you had pointed out that one had used an ad hominem that would have been fine, but the second you used that to attack the speaker you yourself were committing the same ad hominem fallacy, their by insulting yourself. </p>
