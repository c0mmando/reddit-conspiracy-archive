       I'd like to say that I believe that Huxley's interpretation of a dictatorship is much more prescient than Orwell's with regards to the first world - but it's only accurate for as long as it remains a 1st world quality of life and can change at any time given the right set of crises.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now with that in mind I was thinking about what Orwell said about the proletariat, with studies have shown that if the people were suitably annoyed, they could theoretically overrun law enforcement and military with a relatively small percentage of the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       This paradigm has, I imagine existed unchanged probably for most of human civilization. However there could very well be, for the first time ever, a paradigm shift when robotics are perfected. The numbers advantage will quickly dissolve when a technology like this, a force multiplier, becomes ubiquitous and can be scaled to match the needs of those that seek to maintain order.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be argued that, while we see attacks on human rights by those in power today, the consequences of these attacks aren't necessarily expressed in a significant way against the population at large, yet. Obviously we can show examples where it does happen, but it isn't at a significant level that the population would seek to revolt. This status quo may be maintained as long as the balance of real power sits in the hands of the proletariat* but with the advent of robotic technology, this force multiplier will shift the balance of power into the hands of the establishment and will mean that their behaviour could go unregulated, either by form or formality because they would not have to concern themselves with the consequence of their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       This to me seems like an extremely dangerous prospect.
      </p>
      <p>
       *I am completely aware of the contradiction described by Orwell regarding the true power that the proletariat posses. That's not the point here though.

       Flesh and blood cops are by nature EMP proof though. It would also not be murder to take out a bot presumably, it'd be property damage.

       EMP shielding is old technology and it's important not to underestimate the power of robotics. Not just in their numerical advantage but in their capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine a single robot that can not only predict your actions physically but can also tell what kind of mood you are in. That can react to your movements, lightning fast. With a centralised network that can dispatch necessary units to a problem location and maintain pressure indefinitely, utlizing high altitude and city embedded sensors that can make it nigh on impossible to hide, even in an urban environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Movies typically display the capabilities of robots in a limited way to help the story along, to balance capabilities with humans so that they aren't too powerful and allows the story to actually be told in a way that lets the humans win (usually) but the type of technology we are dealing with has endless potential.
      </p>
      <p>
       It won't be like the matrix where we could let off an emp bomb and they all fall to the floor and we win that round... even if they weren't shielded with EMP the waves of units won't stop there, they will keep coming and coming and coming until you run out of breath or bullets.

       Resistance (taking out a bot for example) will be met with punishment, that's how this works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every meat sack that takes out a bot will get to spend some time in prison at best.  Another simple option is financial ostracisation, incomless, then homeless, marginalized, powerless and at some point...  well at that point it doesn't really matter to them what happens to you.   It's not a death sentence.... kinda.
      </p>
      <p>
       This plan has nothing to do with bots.  It's how it's worked for thousands of years.  The balance is shifting against the less powerful, as always.

       I agree that our desires is what enslaves us (perfectly elaborated by Bernays and Lippmann already). As for Orwellian surveillance, it is supposed to be covert, this unknown has both a "chilling effect" and "artificial freedom" over different segments of the population. For which an Orwellian O'Brien agent can always be summoned when needed.

       As for machines.... we are fucked. With complete automation the masses won't be needed anymore, neither as workers nor consumers.

       I just can't take this post seriously. I mean the kind of robot you're talking about is dangerous for everyone. You wasted so many words trying to say, "Robots are dangerous because they are stronger than humans."

       It is what you're saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       The jist of what you're saying is that if people can band together, they can overrun their respective governments. But with perfected robot technology, the number advantage doesn't matter anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       AKA robots are dangerous because they're stronger, in many ways, than humans and therefore negate the number advantage.

       Seriously, it's like you're a high school kid and you just finished the required class reading of a Huxley or Orwell book. All of that shit in your post was just fluff. I know what you're trying to say. And it certainly isn't a new revelation, so stop trying to make it sound like one.

       If you want more discussion on how robots can be abused by the government, ala Terminator, you can talk to some highschoolers lol.

       Edit: Actually, there are a lot of reasonable highschool-age people
