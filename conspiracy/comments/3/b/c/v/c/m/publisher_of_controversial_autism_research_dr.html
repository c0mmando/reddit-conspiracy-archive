<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dr. Jeff Bradstreet, an autism researcher hailed as a hero by some, dismissed as a fringe conspiracy theorist by others</strong>, is believed to have committed suicide following a visit to his Buford office by federal agents, authorities confirmed Thursday.</p>

<p><strong>The FDA has yet to reveal why agents searched the office of the doctor</strong>, reportedly a former pastor who has been controversial for well over a decade. Robert Hiser, an assistant special agent in charge with the federal agency’s criminal investigations division, referred questions to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Atlanta, which couldn’t immediately be reached Thursday.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bradstreet"><strong>Dr Jeff Bradstreet WIKI</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bradstreet has published some controversial autism research, which implicates vaccines in the causation thereof</strong>, in the fringe journal Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, which is not indexed by PubMed. This research has concluded that autistic children have a higher body burden of mercury, as well as that three autistic children have measles virus RNA in their cerebrospinal fluid</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am always intrigued by the incredible resistance new ideas engender in the medical community.  Literally, every potentially effective intervention must first survive the internet onslaught of critiques and vilification.  That is absolutely the case for stem cells in the therapy of autism. Various websites state there is NO evidence for any number of treatments.  But claim simply isn’t true as you will see in the post.  <strong>But in the circle of autism debates, researchers at Duke University are being criticized for even studying stem cells..</strong> The Duke study is unlikely to generate impressive results since it using autologous (self-derived) stem cells from the umbilical cord of the affected child.  That implies the environment and genetics of the individual were healthy at the time of delivery and that whatever caused the autism – wasn’t already present. I’m not confident that is a good assumption.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dateline NBC aired her story in October 1998. Literally overnight, physicians were besieged with requests for secretin. A few doctors have joined the parade, including Dr. Jeff Bradstreet of Palm Bay, whose son, Matthew, is autistic.</p>

<p>Matthew, now 6, showed tremendous gains after being given secretin two years ago, said Bradstreet, who now runs the Autism Research Center in Palm Bay, and has treated about 400 children. About 70 percent of them have improved markedly, but it usually requires continued treatment, he said.</p>

<p>The drug is typically injected by a doctor or nurse and costs $250 to $350 per treatment.</p>

<p>Bradstreet, who testified on Cislo&#39;s behalf in court last week, disparages the studies that dismiss secretin. He points instead to work by him and several other researchers that shows it is effective.</p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s happening with secretin is not a debate of science, but a debate on an emotional level,&quot; he said. &quot;And that&#39;s unfortunate.&quot;</p>

<p>Its role in autism is not clear, although digestive troubles, particularly diarrhea and constipation, are common among autistic children. Researchers are searching for a gut-to-brain connection.</p>

<p>Repligen Corp., which makes synthetic secretin, recently began clinical trials for its effectiveness in treating autism. The company hopes to enroll 2,500 children, which would make it the largest study yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Committed suicide? I call bullshit on this. He was murdered. I say this due to the old saying &quot;Who gains&quot;? The Big Pharma companies, that&#39;s who. The number of sources provided do not suddenly make up a fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently he was about to testify in a lawsuit brought by families of vaccine damaged autistic children against vaccine makers. Now the other doctors that were going to testify with him are scared for their lives and refusing to testify, effectively delaying hearing by years of not indefinitely.
The vaccine defense is painting these normal people as members of a &#39;cult&#39; and only twelve families remain in the lawsuit after being intimidated</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only conspiracy here is that he probably was embezzling funds or was falsifying data (which isn&#39;t a crime unless it&#39;s fraud), or something similar.</p>

<p>He probably had caches of child porn. Lots of people commit suicide after being investigated for fraud or child porn because they know their life is over.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fine to believe that big pharma is lying to you, but you have to look at things logically. It&#39;s much more likely that it was a suicide instead of a murder because he was already speaking out about mercury and he wasn&#39;t becoming a &quot;bigger threat&quot;, so there would be no motive.</p>

<p>By saying that he was murdered makes any truth to the vaccination controversy sound loony tunes because it&#39;s all so ridiculous then. You&#39;re hurting your own argument but being so &quot;out there&quot;. Any willingness someone like myself might have had in listening to these theories is thrown out the window by believing someone that was obviously guilty of something and who took his own life for it, is somehow a victim of murder. It sounds crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t understand your point in the last part, but I just think the fact that he committed suicide speaks volumes.</p>

<p>Edit: And for the record, having worked at a children&#39;s hospital and seeing the effects of not immunizing your children I think it&#39;s fucked up to NOT get your kids immunized EVEN IF IT DID CAUSE AUTISM IN A SMALL PERCENTAGE, which it has never been proven to, BUT EVEN IF IT DID I WOULD STILL TAKE THE RISK FOR MY CHILD and more importantly the safety of all people especially the weak and vulnerable to these horrific diseases.</p>

That being said, I doubt someone who committed suicide due to illegal drug trade or use (he was investigated by drug enforcement) would want resources used to find a non-existent murderer.
