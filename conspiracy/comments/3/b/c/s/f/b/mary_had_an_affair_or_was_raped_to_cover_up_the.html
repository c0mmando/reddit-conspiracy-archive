       Yes we have a greater list of historians who never were there at the time of jesus' miracle working period (including Pliny the younger etc etc),then we have a list of historians who actually lived in that area or were living there at the time of jesus' miracle tour - who never even mentions a revolutionary great man. Compare jesus with Alexander and historians would give us more reason to worship Alex considering his legacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the problem with proto-roman Christianity and of course time. Alot of historians on the accepted list wrote about jesus with a time marginal way off his existence. Tacitus 100 years after J's birth, Josephus source was "found" by Constantine's advisor some 300+ years afterwards (which was claimed to be written AD 71). And alot of said sources also consist of Christian names and titles. Meaning the historical accounts are "sources" created in a Christian biased environment, mostly cause of their explanatory capacities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tacitus source is however genuine (in the sense that he actually wrote it) but it is a historiographical catastrophe... it  can't be hold as a factual historical source since he was never present and  never cited his sources which all seem to come from the Nazareethan cult (early christians).

      <p>
       That's the problem about Christianity (or Judaism and Islam) ... is that it's  hard to undermine a dominant religion as false when it holds so much power. Regardless of atheism in the world, religions hold more power than anything. And everyone think in synchrony with faith, it's MK Ultra on steroids. So much so that simple historiograpgical errors are considered truth, because we must uphold the fairytale lie of a miracle worker's existence. Wether or not he was magical.

       Do you believe the Egyptian god Horus was born when Osiris impregnated the goddess Isis with his golden penis? The biblical narrative of God impregnating the virgin Mary is scarcely any less ridiculous.

      <p>
       There is no reliable historical evidence that the Jesus/Iesus/Yeshua or Isa (as he would have been known in Aramaic) of the New Testament was based on a person who actually lived. NONE. It seems not a single person thought to write about "the Messiah" during his lifetime, including the Roman authorities who supposedly crucified him.

       You do realize that the Bible was written
       <em>
        over 300 hundred years
       </em>
       after the supposed events took place, don't you? And this was
       <em>
        over ten centuries
       </em>
       before the printing press. We can't even trust a court witness to remember an event accurately after 10 years. But we are going to trust peoples memory over three centuries?

       Paul wrote his first letters around ~52AD, meaning when the original disciples were still alive. Jesus ascended into Heaven around 30AD, so ~20 years after is the when the
       <em>
        New Testament
       </em>
       began to be written down, however the Jews had an oral tradition that carried on before, during and after Jesus.

      <p>
       The
       <em>
        Old Testament
       </em>
       was written long before Jesus. There's two sections of the Bible, you know.

       Yes, I know that. And "oral tradition" doesn't suddenly equal accurate passing of information. When I was a boy scout, the troop was sat in a large semi-circle. The boy at one end was told a phrase and then told to whisper the phrase into the ear of the boy next to hi,...and so to the other end. The two boys at either end of the semi-circle reported two completely different phrases and this after just ten minutes. So you are trying to tell me that "oral tradition" is accurate after more than 300 hundred years? Really?

       Whether it is 300, 200 or 500 years isn't the point and you know it. The point is it is a lot longer the human memory can be reasonably expected to be accurate - by a major long shot.

       TBH by that time there were already historians !!
      </p>
      <p>
       Tacitus is usually the most noted, since in 110 AD, he documented about the execution of Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Historically there isn't much denial of his existence. The point remains about the miracles, which are only seen in Christian literature, and nonexistent elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR there was a Jesus and he was executed, this is fact (98%). As for the miracles, resurrection, that is (still) fiction.

       You are comparing apples and oranges here. At least in archaeology there is a solid clue or two. The bible is just an
       <em>
        inaccurate

       translation (many inaccurate translations, actually) of the dead sea scrolls. Even Homer didn't get it all correct.

       Jesus born to the virgin Mary... Horus born to the virgin Isis. Only thing that interests me about the event, fictional or otherwise ; is the repetition so many years apart in lore. Why?, Where it came from?, reasons for the repetition / evolution?, who propagated it?.. Like it or not, it is part of history and worth study.
