This place is infested with controlled opposition just like anywhere else.

<p>For the specific topic of flat earth you believe the narrative that it is both false, and merely exists to make people who don&#39;t believe the official narrative on other topics lose credibility.  But have you actually looked for yourself?  Have you taken the time to be sure that your conclusion is correct?  There is a lot of material to look at.  If you don&#39;t look for yourself then you give away your own opportunity to reason and allow what is true to be dictated by someone else.</p>

<p>I just approach this sub from the perspective that a lot of what you see here (maybe most) will be garbage, some of it intentionally and some of it merely misguided. But you will also see a lot well-reasoned and well-sourced arguments for perspectives that you will not find on any of the major news subs. Often things discussed here for years and ignored or suppressed elsewhere will eventually break out in the rest of reddit (TPP being a recent example).</p>

<p>Trolls will be anywhere you go, but the existence of shills would seem to indicate that there&#39;s discussion here worth manipulating. I think the amount of actual shills is often overstated--I think it&#39;s usually more a case of useful idiots--but there&#39;s evidence that they do exist here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t expect that flat earth would be given many votes. </p>

<p>I would hope this would be a means of disassociating the sub with unreasonable theories. If it turned out that the sub is in favor of them, which I don&#39;t expect, then it would tell me it&#39;s not the place for me.</p>

<p>Move on to where?</p>

<p>I think this sub provides people with a background. We understand that the lies have been on-going, that they are used to manipulate and advance a social structure. You see a stark difference between those that grasp this and those that don&#39;t. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s just a background and one that is only as clear as the info available. The info suggests to me that we should stop providing means and funding to the government. We have the tools and will to promote an alternative or a vast number of alternative systems that would invest us in our future. </p>

<p>The disinfo doesn&#39;t help and the repetiveness doesn&#39;t develop anything out of the info we have. I think there should be a way to build practical solutions and means of sharing them with individuals who realize there is a need. I see some such folks on here, but it gets lost and there isn&#39;t a framework to extend knowledge beyond these Kafkesque confines.</p>

<p>Very well said. There is a period we must go through to understand the deception we have been born into, but then we must too build something new. I see <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as being pretty good for the former (if one is willing to dig), yet fairly weak on the latter.</p>

<p>Agreed. Have you checked out <a href="/r/C_S_T">/r/C_S_T</a>? There&#39;s a lot of us there who have &quot;graduated&quot; so to speak from uncovering the lies, and now have a desire to act on that knowledge in some manner. I think your last sentence about creating a &quot;framework to extend knowledge&quot; would likely get some traction there, especially with people like <a href="/u/JamesColesPardon">/u/JamesColesPardon</a>. If you could expand upon what you mean by that and how people could participate, it could make a pretty good post there.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is it that if one were to fly continually in one direction they would never see this &quot;wall&quot;, but instead come back to where they started?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you fly south, you&#39;ll reach it. You can still travel east and west continually without an issue.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is all of the aviation industry in on the &quot;conspiracy&quot; (which, by the way, WHY?)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, and commercial aviation is handled by autopilot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ever seen a flight path?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. I did look into flight paths and they confirm the flat earth map is used for aviation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ever wonder out how flat earth theory in no way explains our view of the stars or tides based on our moon?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, it does explain the stars and the tides aren&#39;t caused by the moon. The explanation that the moon causes the tides was considered ridiculous when it was introduced and still is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This theory was out of date in some parts of the world literally 2500 years ago.</p>

<p>Nobody believed in a ball earth until the 14th and 15th centuries when the Jesuit counter-reformation began to take shape.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It makes so little scientific sense it is mind-boggling to me that anyone in a developed nation would think it anything but a joke.</p>

<p>Actually, it makes total scientific sense when you look beyond preconceived notions and re-evaluate your beliefs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you explain how I have flown over it and been teleported to the opposite side?</p>

<p>When? Where? Why? What path did you take from where to where and for what purpose?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All that is doing is ripping the earth apart from the antarctic and flattening it into a disk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, rather, the globe model is taking apart the flat earth and wrapping it around a ball.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This notion flies against so many laws of physics it is astounding.</p>

<p>Wrong again. This notion is more in conformity with reality than all of the theoretical physics necessary to explain how a ball could possibly work.</p>

<p>Yeah, that&#39;s completely at odds with both the map you sent me and with logic.</p>

<p>Some, but there are still two pilots doing a lot it right there.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is patently false.  The notion that the idea came into existence that late is a myth we&#39;re told in schools.  The fact is that well before 0 a guy estimated the circumference of the earth at ~24,000 miles and long before Colombus every educated elite in Europe knew it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually, it makes total scientific sense when you look beyond preconceived notions and re-evaluate your beliefs.</p>

<p>Deep dude.  I&#39;m now totally convinced.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This notion is more in conformity with reality than all of the theoretical physics necessary to explain how a ball could possibly work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fuck it.  I&#39;m done.  You clearly know exactly nothing about astronomy, geology history or physics.  Write back if you want.  Whatever.</p>

<p>Edit:  Also.  Ever seen a horizon on flat land?  Ever seen one from a mountain.  You would be able to see the same distance if the curvature of the earth didn&#39;t block your view.</p>

<p>Edit 2:  OK, I guess I&#39;ve never flown over that imaginary wall because I&#39;ve never flown over Antarctica but many have.</p>
