        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Fishy stuff. Lots of &lt;1 day old accounts, lots of older accounts that have a post here or there from a while back and then suddenly content submitted to one of the two re-opened subreddits. These are all obvious shill accounts, here you go guys. I&#39;m still going through the new feeds of each and updating the list.</p>

<p>Many were created RIGHT BEFORE the subs were seized. Others have been around for up to a year and have been more or less inactive (maybe a couple old posts) and decided that now was the right time to start submitting content to r/aww, which seems to be getting hit the hardest - apparently, to the people who currently run Reddit, it appears that they think that as long as people can come here for cute pictures of cats, their revenue is, to a degree, secured. r/aww looks unaffected; at this time, the front page of r/pics is completely taken up by pictures related to Victoria&#39;s dismissal and the blackout.</p>

<p>With less proof, I suspect that the huge-karma accounts that have also started posting on r/pics and r/aww within the last couple hours are reddit-owned plants.</p>

<p>Anyway, here&#39;s the list of the obvious shills (new accounts, empty accounts, etc)</p>

<p>This seems a new low for their petty bullshit. &quot;Guys all of reddit hates us right now, we better fix it with very obvious vote manipulation instead of actually doing the right thing by people!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dont you think reddit would be smart enough to fake the join-up and karma data for shill accounts? Lots of redditors delete their old posts and history, but that doesnt affect their karma. I have an old reddit account from 6 or 7 years ago that has no history bc i deleted it, but has a tons of karma. If they were going to create shill accounts, they woukd likely a. Already have a whole slew of them created over the years, b. Fake the join up date if they indeed, created the accounts yesterday. That said, i cant imagine that the admins sit around all day and post to reddit. They have jobs to do - manage the infrastructure, mange advertising accounts, repond to server issues etc. That, and i am betting they are in meetings all day today trying to figure out how to respond. </p>

<p>Dont forget that when ever reddit makes it into the news for shit like this, lots of new users do infact join up because if a celebrity tweet or huffpost article. </p>
