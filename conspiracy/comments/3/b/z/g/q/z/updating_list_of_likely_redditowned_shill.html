       Fishy stuff. Lots of &lt;1 day old accounts, lots of older accounts that have a post here or there from a while back and then suddenly content submitted to one of the two re-opened subreddits. These are all obvious shill accounts, here you go guys. I'm still going through the new feeds of each and updating the list.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many were created RIGHT BEFORE the subs were seized. Others have been around for up to a year and have been more or less inactive (maybe a couple old posts) and decided that now was the right time to start submitting content to r/aww, which seems to be getting hit the hardest - apparently, to the people who currently run Reddit, it appears that they think that as long as people can come here for cute pictures of cats, their revenue is, to a degree, secured. r/aww looks unaffected; at this time, the front page of r/pics is completely taken up by pictures related to Victoria's dismissal and the blackout.
      </p>
      <p>
       With less proof, I suspect that the huge-karma accounts that have also started posting on r/pics and r/aww within the last couple hours are reddit-owned plants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, here's the list of the obvious shills (new accounts, empty accounts, etc)

       So whats the plan, force the reopening of pics and aww, spam it with shitloads of content, vote manipulate that content to the front page and pretend its back to business as usual with the moderators consent?
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems a new low for their petty bullshit. "Guys all of reddit hates us right now, we better fix it with very obvious vote manipulation instead of actually doing the right thing by people!"

       Speaking of vote manipulation, did anyone else notice the sudden 3k drop in upvotes on this thread?

       And what is the right thing by people?  Did anyone ever consider this entire scenario is just another manufactured event to drum up some free publicity?  I mean this Victoria person, if that even is her real name, has regularly setup AMA's that were nothing more than candy coated ads, complete with shill softball questions and vote/content manipulation.

       Of course, I would be more shocked by the response this entire event has received IF I had ever seen most of you people in here getting upvoted EVER BEFORE TODAY.

       Those are very popular subs. Keeping them closed drives away traffic from reddit. Hence the need to re-open them ASAP.

       It's their website. If they want to spam it with cute cat pictures it's their legal right to do it. Why is everyone trying to introduce morality into capitalism? Capitalism is amoral at best, and usually rewards immorality. If you want to live in a communist environment, create one, but Reddit is not that and at it's heart never has been.

       Dont you think reddit would be smart enough to fake the join-up and karma data for shill accounts? Lots of redditors delete their old posts and history, but that doesnt affect their karma. I have an old reddit account from 6 or 7 years ago that has no history bc i deleted it, but has a tons of karma. If they were going to create shill accounts, they woukd likely a. Already have a whole slew of them created over the years, b. Fake the join up date if they indeed, created the accounts yesterday. That said, i cant imagine that the admins sit around all day and post to reddit. They have jobs to do - manage the infrastructure, mange advertising accounts, repond to server issues etc. That, and i am betting they are in meetings all day today trying to figure out how to respond.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dont forget that when ever reddit makes it into the news for shit like this, lots of new users do infact join up because if a celebrity tweet or huffpost article.

       They clearly aren't intelligent enough to plan the next 5 steps out.  They have low IQ idiots create accounts, then post the same tired bullshit.  They do however somewhat learn from their mistakes.  It only takes months to years for them to do this.  Removing actual vote counts, for example.

       its actually quite amusing to follow some of the obvious shills, low IQ does describe some of them to a tee.
