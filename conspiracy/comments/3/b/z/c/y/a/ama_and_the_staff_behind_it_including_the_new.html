<p>if the rumors that behind the sack of victoria is the ama of jesse (whatever his name is I don&#39;t remeber) then we have one big proof that those fucking amas were paid promotions. I understand that dude, if you pay a load of money and then you are treated as fucking shit, you get really piss off.</p>

Yet, whenever I point out this obvious truth I am called names and shamed like I&#39;m wearing the scarlet letter.  mmmm, social justice, gotta love it.

I don&#39;t presume to know why she was &quot;fired&quot; but it&#39;s more important to remember that she had to be &quot;in the know&quot; to a certain extent. Hence why you don&#39;t see her shouting from the mountain tops about this shit.</p>
