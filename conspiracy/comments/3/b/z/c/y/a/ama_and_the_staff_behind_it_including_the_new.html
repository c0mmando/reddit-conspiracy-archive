       I still have to see any of the "celebrities" doing an AMA just because. Always they had some product to promote, some propaganda to spread.
      </p>
      <p>
       if the rumors that behind the sack of victoria is the ama of jesse (whatever his name is I don't remeber) then we have one big proof that those fucking amas were paid promotions. I understand that dude, if you pay a load of money and then you are treated as fucking shit, you get really piss off.

       m0q is absolutely right.  Yet, whenever I point out this obvious truth I am called names and shamed like I'm wearing the scarlet letter.  mmmm, social justice, gotta love it.  This entire issue is nothing more than a PR stunt to try to revive dwindling numbers for this site.

       Please!! Don't forget this. Victoria was in with Jim. I don't presume to know why she was "fired" but it's more important to remember that she had to be "in the know" to a certain extent. Hence why you don't see her shouting from the mountain tops about this shit.

       As a relatively new reddit user I found the AMA's interesting but started to notice they were fairly lame in the questions considering it is an AMA. The self promotion was obvious and kind of expected but ultimately disappointing.
