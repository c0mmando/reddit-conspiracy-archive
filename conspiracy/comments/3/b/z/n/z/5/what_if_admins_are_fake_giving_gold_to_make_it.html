    <div class="md"><p>Bing! (not the search engine)</p>

<p>If only there were searchable user comment histories. It would make perfect sense that reddit was seeding fake gold for a bunch of reasons. First, the bandwagon effect, where people will tend to do the things that they think other people are doing. There was a whole period where donation scams <em>racked</em> reddit. And a bunch of bandwagon trends, like &quot;Nailed it?&quot;.</p>

<p>Second, it takes the wind out of the suggesting that people not buy reddit gold. It converts it into something of a joke, if the comments saying that all have 3x gold. </p>

<p>Except everyone&#39;s too dirt poor and busy buying Mr. Noodles to spend extra money on Reddit of all places.</p>

<p>So Reddit is just spending money on themselves to make themselves feel better.  Hope you&#39;re enjoying those pats your giving yourselves on the back guys.</p>

<p>I doubt they are spending anything. They can just make it look like gold is given, one hand paying the other. Standard confidence scam. </p>

<p>It still works. The intent is not to get more people to buy Reddit gold, the intent is for everyone to get on board with the gold comment/thought/opinion.</p>

It&#39;s simple dynamics that if you make something look popular more people will join in and I don&#39;t EVER remember a day when it hasn&#39;t reached max gold.

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s not baseless speculation at all. You are absolutely right, it was even openly admitted in a thread, unfortunately I don&#39;t have the link saved. It was made into a running joke. Dozens of people were being gilded for no reason.</p>

<p>There was one thread in particular in one of the default subs sometime last year (I think) where there was an insane amount of gilded comments and admins even admitted they were giving out gold. It&#39;s very doubtful that it was just an isolated incident. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s some big marketing conspiracy behind it but they were trying to create a buzz.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That seems likely in some of the larger subs where mods are still loyal to pao...cough r/twochromosomes. I also wonder if the amount of gold is significantly different today, though I don&#39;t know if normal people have access to that data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, exactly what I wanted to post now here! Totally agree, as much as I know Reddit employees can give gold for free. Also, possibly they created some shitty bot that gives Gold automatically (with some % chance maybe, to make it look less suspicious) to posts that mention &quot;Reddit Gold&quot;.  ☺</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It definitely makes sense that they would do that.  Some weird things are happening around here that&#39;s for sure.  I made a dumb meme in protest of whats been going on, it was shadowbanned immediately and then I messaged the mods &quot;nice shadowban btw&quot; and then I notice my posts that were successful (2 posts, 1 was like 4K karma and the other was 2.5K or so) were gone.  I didn&#39;t delete them, someone did.</p>
