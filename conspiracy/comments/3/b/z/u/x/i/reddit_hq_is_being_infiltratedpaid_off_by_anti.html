       Bernie Sanders seems to be committed in getting political influence out of the hands of the rich few and back into those of the larger American public. There's no direct correlation here, but whenever such powerful individuals join together, you can bet it's not for some tea and crackers.

       Is it known why Ellen Pao was specifically chosen and why she seems to be so un-fireable? Seems like she came with a lot of baggage. Why would they want that?

       I guess you can look at it from two ways:
      </p>
      <p>
       A) Reddit's board may have been unaware how much mess Pao would bring and all of these other recent events are coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) Reddit's board knew exactly what they were doing. They hired her as a defender of their nest egg, something more likely for those looking to make a profit. FatPeopleHate was first to go because some don't want to advertise where they can be associated with abusive behavior. The rest of the story can be contributed to the same goal: making Reddit profitable while doing away with those who stand in the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad to see how many mods are resisting these efforts, but worried the admins will gain control of virtually everything and do their best to restore Reddit to happy days. I surmise most readers on Reddit do not care about whether or not free speech is maintained effectively, and this could all be forgotten just like every other media craze.

       You cannot have revolution without the truth.

       This is like French revolution all over again, where feudalistic monarch dictatorship was replaced by capitalist dictatorship by selling the lies of freedom and equality.

       What do you suppose we do then? Withhold political participation? Vote independent?
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand all politicians are loyal to their own, but I believe that loyalty cannot be boiled down to "he's a Zionist, and is therefore no good."

       I'm all for an alternative, but I've yet to see anything worthy of support.

       Have I been duped?  I was going to vote for Bernie, at least am planning on it.

       Has reddit influenced my mind?  Is this their goal?

       I read so much on here about how he's the man that's actually going to represent the people and wants to fix problems in government and get money out of it.

       I need to look further into it, I'm never going to fall for another Obama again, I voted for that turd in 2008 and was completely naive then.  I may still be, but not nearly as much.

       American propaganda is a powerful tool and I'd be foolish to think I'm immune to it despite my efforts to be.

       That's what I'm saying. Maybe someone doesn't like that and is worried that over the coming year that a lot of support for him will be organized on reddit. He just very recently has become an actual contender. And I promise you, there is a lot of people with a lot of money who don't like that.

       It will be way easier for them to attempt to dismantle his platform and prevent him becoming president than to assassinate him and cover it up.
As much as I'd love to see him as your president, it will never happen.

       Bernie Sanders seems to be committed in getting political influence out of the hands of the rich few and back into those of the larger American public. There's no direct correlation here, but whenever such powerful individuals join together, you can bet it's not for some tea and crackers.
