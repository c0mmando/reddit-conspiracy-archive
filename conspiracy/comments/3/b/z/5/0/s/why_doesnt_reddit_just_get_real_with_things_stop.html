        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You remember your user base don&#39;t you?  The people who spent hours of unpaid time building this site to what it is.  </p>

<p>They were sold on free speech, then networked, sold others, did the dirty work.   They were told what a  great site this was, and how it was the last bastion of free speech.  </p>

<p>Only to be made to look stupid for believing it and for the time they had invested.   </p>

<p>Soon as this site was on the radar as a potential customer base to big business, is when every user here became worthless to the admins.   They were getting theirs.  </p>

<p>What did the users get who give this site its value to advertisers?</p>

<p>A dick sandwich, and shadow banned for saying it didn&#39;t taste good..   </p>

<p>Their free speech was sold to the highest bidder.  Any one that said anything about it was kicked out.  </p>

<p>With out the users here, this site would be nothing.  And worth nothing.   Once they got money in their pockets, the admins  showed what the users meant to them.  And crowned King Nothing.    </p>

<p>A site built on free speech.  Now a site that shadow bans people for exercising it.  Picking scabs again.</p>

<p>A culture of free speech.  What a fucking joke.  Between that and the AMA&#39;s, or AM Almost anythings,  why hasn&#39;t someone filed false advertising against them.  Hit them where it hurts.  In the costly legal system.   And the only speech they understand.</p>

<p>Until you do that, you are nothing but the dumb masses that they sit and laugh about.  The more you bitch, the harder they laugh.  </p>

<p>They probably have tears coming out of their eyes today.   </p>

<p>If you think about it for a second, why wouldn&#39;t we be e a joke to them? </p>

<p>They get paid, the user gets fucked and kicked out to boot.  Then after they kick us out, instead of saying fuck you,  and this place, what do we do?  Tell every one we &quot;fell down the stairs&quot; wear sunglasses for a week and hope no one recognizes you. </p>

<p>Or come back crawling on your belly just to sneak in again, so they can do the same thing to you again.  Or cry to them, tell them its your fault and beg to be let back in.  So they can do it again.  </p>

<p>Wake up dummies.  This site has run its course.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xrlf3taEo">Que the band.</a> </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtJ2f8_lfn4">Give the eulogy.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The writing is on the walls. I think the last 12 months has been particularly demonstrative of this fact. The new direction for us all is getting clearer and clearer. We have the technology, now all we have to do is <em>just start to change direction</em>. It&#39;ll build and will become massive. The opposition that we anticipate will be a roar might just be a whisper.</p>

<p>Think about AirBnB and Uber. Both of those are disrupting regulatory frameworks and people are kicking up a fuss, but the opposition is going nowhere – the wave of public support is overwhelming. Why? Because large numbers of people save money. It seems like that&#39;s the key ingredient for change – it has to increase efficiency in a way that translates to a lower cost to the consumer.</p>
