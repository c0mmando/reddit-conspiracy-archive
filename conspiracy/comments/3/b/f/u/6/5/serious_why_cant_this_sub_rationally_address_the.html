       As a true skeptic, I have to say that my initial reactions to FE were similar to this subs. That being said, there are some serious issues raised that I cannot dismiss out of hand. I have been forced by reason to re-evaluate my original position. I would ask that you restrain your initial visceral response, hear the arguments and respond to them clearly and concisely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disregard allusions to religion and the consequences of such a thing and just examine the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0FuO8lQV18&amp;index=8&amp;list=PLltxIX4B8_URNUzDE2sXctnUAEXgEDDGn">
        This is one of the arguments I consider the most compelling
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you explain an utter lack of non-stop flights from AUS to anywhere in South America. Why are they not tracked on flight radar? For that matter why don't flights pass over Antarctica, surely it's a shorter distance between two points? After all they pass over the north pole and arctic circle all the time. Why is the southern hemisphere so different in terms of flight paths?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another compelling argument is this:
       <a href="http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wkar/files/styles/medium/public/201505/lake_michigan_mirage.jpg">
        Why can Chicago be observed from Grand Mere state park in Michigan 60 miles across the lake?
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're going to tell me that this is simply a 3,000 ft mirage. I would tell you to have your head examined. A mirage is a trick of light on a
       <em>
        heated
       </em>
       surface. Google any picture of a
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mirages&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UGGQVabzN8T3oATY6qLAAg&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=699">
        mirage
       </a>
       . The image is
       <em>
        reflected
       </em>
       (and note that a reflection is an inversion of the original image) back onto the surface, not into the atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can't cause unique 1,400 ft structures to be refracted back perfectly into your view.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if we can agree that this is a real and genuine image of Chicago from 60 miles away. How is it possible?
      </p>
      <p>
       By simple geometry demonstrated
       <a href="http://www.davidsenesac.com/Information/line_of_sight.html">
        here
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       At 60 miles away, the Chicago skyline is some 2,380 feet below the visible horizon from this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sears tower stands at 1,451 feet. That means that for the Chicago skyline to be seen as it is. The earth is miraculously refracting almost 4,000 feet of light into perfect view?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you really ever seen a mirage stand perfectly still for a picture?
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't think so.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'll ask the question again. Without resorting to ad hominem attacks and unscientific explanations of completely unrepeatable and untestable "atmospheric conditions."
      </p>
      <p>
       How does this sub address the very compelling arguments put forth for a flat earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit: As predicted, this sub reacts exactly as outlined in the title. Bravo!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit 2: For a thread with less than 30% upvotes, that is ultimately buried into oblivion, there sure does seem to be an awful lot of activity. What's really going on here?

       This theory might have some legs if the sum total of the proof offered didn't amount to "Nu-uh. Doesn't happen."
      </p>
      <p>
       What about people who fly regularly between Chile and Sydney? "There are no flights - it's a ruse".
      </p>
      <p>
       What about all the satellites? "There aren't any - it's a ruse."
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the residents of Tiera del Fuego who experience the midnight sun every year at the Austral solstice? "Doesn't happen - they're lying."
      </p>
      <p>
       What about cruise and tour operators who offer excursions to the South Pole specifically to experience this midnight sun phenomenon? "Try to book one."
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the fact that long-range snipers and ballistics infantrymen have to adjust their shots to account for the Coriolis and Eötvös effects? "They're lying. All of them."
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the ISS? Shuttle flights? Soyuz flights? "Never happened - it's a ruse."
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that the whole of your argument is nothing more than a series of blanket denials. It's no wonder no-one takes you seriously.

       I love how they always use flightaware or flightradar and the like but have NO UNDERSTANDING of how they work. ADS-B is not going to be relayed from the middle of the ocean because there is no receivers within range to broadcast that information to the websites. That's why "flights zomg disappear." I also love how they use flight booking sites as further proof. No one has any understanding of direct flights and the economics behind them either. It's all about profit to the airlines. You can't get a direct flight because sending you to an area where more people want to go is more profitable. They want a loaded plane, not an empty 747 for the 8 people who might want to go to Auckland from Santiago. They also have no idea about how those planes require the help of the jet streams to achieve these cruising speeds and that these craft don't do those speeds right from take-off.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's amazing how much they waste their brain power computing all these flat earth possibilities while ignoring the facts right in their face.

       It's not ironic when you and people like you ignore so many valid requests like: explain 24 hours of daylight, explain the lunar cycle, explain eclipses and so on. You're the one casting aside reason to buy into a theory that is full of holes.

       What gets me is how easy it would be to verify that there is indeed a conspiracy. Why don't they simply take a trip to Tiera del Fuego in late December? Spherical earth theory says that below 66 degrees, the sun will not set at all during that time. Seems like that would be fairly easy to verify.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, simply book
       <a href="http://www.cruisecompete.com/itins/queen_mary_2_cruises_bfege.html">
        this 22 day cruise
       </a>
       between Santiago and Sydney. Spherical earth says that the distance should be about 11,000 Km. A flat earth projection says that a direct route would be 30,000 Km (over the North Pole), while a 'great circle' route would be closer to 50,000 Km. Bring your own homemade compass and anemometer, and carefully plot the route and average wind speed. The fact that the ship is not travelling 400 Km/h should be a clue that the distance is not nearly that great.

       We could all pitch in to get them a flight into a polluted city at dusk so that they could see the curvature themselves...but I suspect that proof isn't what these folks (? Folks? Person? Could be sockpuppets of the same actor) are looking for.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole sudden "movement" is kind of interesting in that they're using the classicly transparent "debate" tactics you typically see employed by PR departments on message boards, but they're using them to push flat earth theory. Why? Is it purely to prove a point?

       I honestly couldn't say one way or the other. My working hypothesis is perhaps it's here to muddy the water and take away from thoughtful discussion about actual issues and to make the sub as a whole look bad to casual viewers. I just tag those who support it and make sure to take anything they might be submitting with a grain of salt. The problem is a few of them go on to post some thought provoking articles on other topics that in my opinion are provable conspiracies.

       I have already pointed out that you can find the same evidence from the Soviet, Chinese, Indian and European space agencies. Not to mention a host of private contractors. Are they
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       in on the conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that at one time the Soviets and the US were mortal enemies. The Soviets would have had a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       to gain by exposing the US space program as a hoax. Not only did they never do that, they actually provided their own evidence of a spherical earth.

       It's unfortunate that, yes, we are dealing with a ton of deception going on here. There's no other way around it. You guys can't refute the simplest experiment, the horizon at altitude, so you nitpick all sorts of other insignificant garbage built on the assumption that you're correct before you even start.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        If you can't prove the horizon, you have nothing.
       </strong>
       We have a flat, eye-level horizon at 20mi+ altitude which is
       <strong>
        completely impossible on a ball
       </strong>
       . The only way there would be a curve is if you were on a cylinder and the only way you would have an eye level horizon is if
       <strong>
        it's a plane
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Rising off of a ball does not, under any circumstances, bring the horizon up with the observer. It doesn't matter how big it is. Any altitude above a ball results in a horizon that is below eye level, period; no ifs, ands, or buts. The world is flat. Case closed.
       </strong>
       The ramifications of that truth are yours to clarify on your own, but there is no getting out of it without lying to yourself or choosing ignorance.

       You really have no clue how gravity works, do you? Also - try hard to think what the difference is between a bullet and a helicopter. (I'll give you a hint because you're obviously struggling - one of them has a powered engine, the other does not).

      <p>
       The 20 mile thing that you keep harping on is a red herring. The earth's radius is close to 4,000 miles. Since humans are extremely small by comparison, it looks flat from the surface. Even if you change your elevation by 20 miles, that means that in relation to the earth's radius, you have only changed your perspective by 0.5%. You would have to get up a lot higher than that before you would start to notice the curvature. Like in
       <a href="http://petapixel.com/2013/05/28/25-space-camera-raspberry-pi-camera-snaps-photos-of-earth-on-a-balloon/">
        this
       </a>
       picture, which was taken from a weather balloon at about 40,000 meters. At this height you can start to make out the curvature of the earth. This is why pictures taken from the ISS and the shuttles at about 400 Km clearly show the earth's curvature.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you get to about 45,000 Km, you will be able to see the
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/BabDZ4Z.jpg">
        entire planet
       </a>
       . And at about 400,000 Km, you will be able to get both the
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/0qgcCoI.jpg">
        earth and the moon
       </a>
       in one frame.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have carefully made sure that your theory is unfalsifiable. You demand proof, and yet every picture I show you is denounced as a fake. The fact is that you simply don't want to believe the obvious.

       No, I'm sorry, that's not how physics works. The atmosphere of the Earth is dragged along by the rotating planet beneath it, and its absolute velocity is usually a pretty close match to the surface rotational speed - this is why we don't, say, experience
       <strong>
        <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/26623/how-fast-does-the-earth-rotate/">
         a constant 1,040 mile-per-hour wind at the equator
        </a>
       </strong>
       . The atmosphere's minimal motion, relative to the surface, is why a helicopter can hover over one spot with ease - in essence, it is surfing on the atmosphere itself, which is moving (in an absolute sense) at quite a high speed, keeping up with the Earth below it. Or perhaps a better analogy than surfing might be: for the same reason that the ice in a drink sitting in a speeding car's cupholder doesn't all get pressed to one side (except during sudden accelerations, of course). The medium (soft drink or atmosphere) already has momentum, and the objects immersed in it (ice cubes or helicopters) are carried along with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm interested to hear your rebuttals to these, and the other points, raised in this discussion.

       Okay, I'll start off my saying I am not a scientist, and am not very knowledgeable on the science of the spherical earth nor the theories put forth by flat earth theorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you a scientist? Do you hold scientific credentials? This is important because it gives you legitimacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, my real question is not whether or not the earth is flat. My question is: what is the intention of lying about the earth being flat, what is to be gained, and how do millions of scientist continue to believe the facts and evidence that the earth is a sphere?

       I definitely believe you that the scientific field is, a community, and that science is not absolute or infallible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the argument about the big bang is a good example, especially as cosmological theories are being postulated right now with alternative theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       But again, I ask you, what is to be gained from disregarding a flat earth and postulating a spherical earth? Why do scientists not watch the YouTube video you posted and thing, "A-HA! All this time my scientific theories were wrong!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I don't think that having a degree or doctorate in science makes one more rational than the other, you just haven't answered my question.

       I asked a few different questions and gave out a few things for you to look at, and you didn't answer them or respond to them. They need to answered for you to prove that the earth is flat.

       Quit acting like a fucking child if you want this shit taken seriously, and answer and refute what people ask you.

        Otherwise, my real question is not whether or not the earth is flat. My question is: what is the intention of lying about the earth being flat, what is to be gained, and how do millions of scientist continue to believe the facts and evidence that the earth is a sphere?

       It doesn't matter how strong the evidence is.  They cannot look, because they can't risk that it might be true.  The blow to their world view would be too large.  They are too distracted by questions like "how could it be kept secret this long?" and "why would anyone do this, what do they have to gain?"  As if those questions matter in the face of first order physical evidence right in their faces.

       Im glad you can read, truly I am, but im not too impressed with your follow-up skills. When's the last time you've been on a plane? Ever even been?  You need to open your mind and realize not everything you read and see on the internet is true. Btw blue is really green and green is really blue. In case you didn't already know... figured you'd wanna go tell a million people they've been wrong their whole life.. see the problem here? If there was any damn proof of a flat earth it would be on every news station and also would have academically funded research to back it up, not just Joe smoes research from a youtube vid some teen made in his basement. If your trying to prove us all wrong go ahead, but dont drop internet resources on the table and declare it "proof"

       This is an incredible fallacy and it is so painfully naive. They have keep far less important things off of "the news." If you're seriously dependent on the television to tell you what reality is, you're as close to hopeless as it gets.

       You think the u.s. is the only country with news? Just because the u.s. doesn't show you every little secret you wanna know doesn't imply that every country in the world follows the same narration. Out of every country on this planet your telling me that if someone ever had proof of a flat earth that it would be concealed? I dont think so. Your the naive one and obviously your brain is clouded with conspiracies. Seriously tho im gonna go ask my dog what she thinks because you and her have about the same "critical thinking skills"

       Yes you can. The station looks like a very fast moving airplane, but it's a steady white pinpoint of light instead of the blinking lights that planes sport. The station is bright enough that you can typically see it even in the middle of a city.

       Whoa whoa whoa. Fellow skeptic here, Shillyourself. Personally I love space and the idea of aliens so it's difficult to disagree with the sphere model, and there being a universe, for me. However I have seen enough evidence to shake my faith in it. When the epiphany occurred, it was like nothing I had ever experienced.  "I may not be ON a planet. I might be IN something else." People will not respect you, they will not listen, they will fear the very notion of what you are saying. I wish we lived in a society where critical thinking was common and all we had to do was work together and supersede the people in power. Alas, they have us by the balls. I mean let's face itone way or the other NASA's fake. Either the world's flat or the U.S. Is an interstellar power. We have no fucking clue. You people can sit there all day with your "facts" and your engineering degrees and your relatives who work for NASA, I don't care! You haven't seen it! If they're smart enough to travel millions of miles to other planetoids they're smart enough to fake it too. Wake the FUCK UP people and stop acting like bigoted know it alls.

       I don't know much about satellites. But I have not seen ONE convincing picture of a satellite in orbit. And all the objects appearing in the night sky (ISS etc etc) could be explained in other ways as well as by satellites. For instance, hologram technology has made huge leaps in recent decades. Have you actually looked at pictures OF satellites? I mean, they are taken by other .. picture satellites? Maybe I'm a moron. Also, Nikola Tesla erected towers that can do what satellites do and the U.S. took many of his patents.

       Who knows man this could be a simulation, this could be an endless, expansive plane. It could be a very large world like Jupiter with multiple hundreds or thousands of "worlds" (more like zoos). If you have researched demons, freemasonry, extraterrestrials, etc you may be under the impression that we ain't the main show on Earth. The show must go on, and you can't have good without evil. No yin no yang. That is the nature of the universe we can SEE. Let's just all keep an open mind and topple the control system. Peace on Earth

       The round earth is the foundation of evolution, space, extra-terrestrials, etc... It induces the kind of mindset they want in people. Those who don't believe in God yet buy into their 'science' will feel the crushing weight of their insignificance and give into sin... and that's what the devil is after.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter what you believe as long as you don't believe the scriptures. If they can't get you to reject them, they feed you false teachings instead to try and derail you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look... we're surrounded by Babylon (meaning confusion). We're in bondage to it. There are so many paths and so many truths we don't know what to believe. God brings us out of Babylon with the truth and sets us free. He saves us from confusion and saves our mind.
      </p>

       I challenge you to watch
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtGurtmUa04">
        this one sermon
       </a>
       . You wouldn't believe how openly all of these connections are put forward in public knowledge and we don't see it because they're the ones who educate us. They think we're stupid and they teach us to be that way. It's systematic psychological warfare.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the veil is lifted and people begin to see... the spirit of persecution will rise up. If they can't keep us blind, they'll just start killing us again.

       Dinosaurs were created with man on the sixth day of creation around six thousand years ago. They were called dragons throughout history until very, very recently when the word dinosaur was invented. The strata and fossils were created by a worldwide flood that swept away the surface of the land and laid down sedimentary layers of rock, rapidly burying vast swarms of creatures.

       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbikBVVkrNA">

       When you take a serious study of the scriptures seeking only the truth, you will find it. God will lead you into all truth and take a hundred steps toward you for every one you take toward Him. He has made it simple for us to understand... the only complication that will get in your way is trying to fit preconceived notions onto the text.
      </p>

       His signature is all over the scriptures. The only way you'll find it and begin to see it is to start studying for yourself.

       The only thing you said I agree with is the Jesuit part, in that it was a Jesuit who proposed the big bang theory to put forth Thomas Aquinas postulate that everything has a creator.

       Science has had models that reflect a big bang, but other cosmological theories are beginning to replace it.

       Or a convection zone where warm air interacts with cold air, creating optical illusions. Its hypothesized that's why the lookouts on the Titanic didn't see the iceberg until it was on top of them - it was, in essence, cloaked in an optical illusion from the warm air/cold air/colder water.

       My Dad lives in Johannesburg, and has family in Sydney. He flies there nonstop about once every three years, and has done so for the last thirty-five years. Are you suggesting that the flight actually takes far longer than stated, but he just never noticed?

       I'm aware of that. The point is that on an

       , Africa is significantly further from Australia than it would be on a spherical earth. A subsonic jetliner has a maximum top speed. If the two destinations were really as far apart as the FE suggests, the flight would be significantly longer than it is. Someone would have noticed.

       If you had half a brain you'd see that the flight plan from AUS to

       As such it is not part of the long haul argument.

       This is fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the flights, Occam's razor suggests a very simple explanation: there simply isn't very much demand for non-stop flights from Oceana to South America - at least not at the astronomical prices that would be required to cover the expense of fuel. By making layovers in popular, central destinations like Dubai, the airlines expand their clientele for these flights enormously, and allow the small number of people making the trip from Oceana to South America to be augmented by travelers making more popular, less expensive trips. Even as an anti-capitalist, the economics of this are evident to me. I would even presume that, should the economies of these two regions flourish further in the future, that demand for nonstop flights might overtake these pricing considerations and nonstop flights would become a regular feature. For now, the market just doesn't support it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same factors perfectly explain the lack of trans-polar flights over Antarctica (is that actually confirmed, by the way?).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all perfectly reasonable, and quite a bit more credible than your argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Re: the Chicago image, I direct you to this:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_refraction">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_refraction
       </a>
       . The effect can be quite potent. It's unfortunate that this example has been labeled a
       <em>
        mirage
       </em>
       by some, because you are indeed correct - it isn't one - but it is still very easily explained by atmospheric refraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some further thoughts:
      </p>
      <p>
       In the video, we're presented with various "maps" of this flat Earth several times, exemplified here:
       <a href="https://imgur.com/Yhh12mk">
        https://imgur.com/Yhh12mk
       </a>
       . So, let's plan
       <a href="http://www.traveller.com.au/coming-soon-australia-to-london-nonstop-1utjz">
        a nonstop flight from Sydney, Australia to London, England
       </a>
       - a route which only in the last couple of years, mind you, became economically feasible for airlines to offer.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the flat Earth map as presented, such a flight along its shortest route would take us almost precisely over what is commonly known as the North Pole, also crossing over some of Northern Russia, and frankly, not much else.
      </p>
      <p>
       As plotted on a round Earth, however,
       <a href="https://imgur.com/D6alDAQ">
        the route is dramatically different
       </a>
       (the red line, in this example) - brushing by tropical Thailand, through China, over Kazakhstan and so on, nary a pole in sight.
      </p>
      <p>
       One would think, quite reasonably, that the pilots, crew, and indeed even the passengers of these nonstop flights might be able to look down at the ground and distinguish, at a glance, whether they were crossing over Thailand or over the North Pole. Should the flight crew's instruments happen to tell them that they're over subtropical Southern China, while meanwhile the terrain outside their windows is marked by glaciers and permafrosted taiga, one would think that one of them, any of them, might happen to raise the issue to someone - or at least share it on Facebook. So the essential question is, why haven't they?
      </p>
      <p>
       Naturally, you might say, the flights are deliberately diverted on a significantly bent course that keeps the plane more "Southerly" (as much as such a bearing exists on a flat Earth), in such a way that it better follows the expected path. But to do so would not only make the flight outrageously lengthy (likely well beyond the maximum range of any such nonstop flight), but would also require very plain and apparent course corrections for the flight crew to make, which, in their expected framework, would make no sense whatsoever. Do you mean to tell me that hundreds, maybe thousands of professional pilots and navigators have never once wondered seriously about why they would adjust their heading by a significant factor (perhaps 20 degrees or more) twice in such a flight, ostensibly increasing their flight time and fuel consumption enormously, for literally no explicable reason whatsoever?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm very curious to hear your thoughts on these matters, as this is a great critical thinking exercise for me and rather enjoyable. I hope that these points find an welcome place in an open mind - yours.

       Have a closer look. The route the plane would take on "the globe" is perfectly compatible with the azimuth equidistant map. I don't suppose they would fly the shortest distance between two points. They aren't interested in tipping their hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one flight that simply doesn't work is anywhere in AUS to anywhere in Southern South America. I promise you, you can't find one of these flights that doesn't have multiple layovers, or disappears from flight radar with a non-existent air-speed log.

       Ah, now I see. You don't actually have any interest in facts, or the truth. You are entirely committed to your delusion. In your OP, you asked for legitimate arguments, and when presented with them, you make a fool of yourself with nonsensical "refutations." But just to humor you (and honestly, because I enjoy an easy debate), I'll take the bait:
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There is a lot wrong with this. For one thing, our atmosphere does not extend all the way to the sun - it is in fact a remarkably thin layer, comparable to the thickness of a single coat of paint on an Easter Egg. The atmospheric refraction effects for both the Sun
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       the City of Chicago in your example are wrought by roughly the same amount of atmosphere. And it is plenty to exert quite an effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, the science is indeed testable, and has indeed been tested, over, and over, and over again.
       <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/earth-curvature-refraction-experiments-debunking-flat-concave-earth.t6042/">
        The effect follows simple and demonstrable mathematical laws that have not only been tested outright, but that provide predictions of future phenomena with accuracy.
       </a>
       That is, in fact, the gold standard of verified, in a scientific sense. This effect is so "solved," and so well-observed, that it is a known and necessary component of many routine operations, like radio communications with aircraft, long-distance surveying, and certainly a thousand other fields that I can't even think of at the moment.

      <p>
       Right, and this is exactly what I expected you to say. But I also refuted it, and the point remains outstanding. The alternative that you propose would require significant course corrections for no reason that the flight crew would understand. Why wouldn't some pilot at some point say, "hey, you know, we could probably save about 50% of our fuel cost if we just went in a straight line." You don't think they would say that? Why not?

      <p>
       Taking a heading does not rely on GPS. All it requires is a compass - a very simple instrument. The course corrections you propose would be very, very apparent to anyone with a compass at hand (and I assure you, this is an instrument that is
       <strong>
        front and center
       </strong>
       in any plane's cockpit). If they started out bearing 280 degrees, then ended their route bearing 340 degrees, you don't think that that

       odd to the crew, whose entire

       possible to take reasonably accurate headings based on the Sun alone - certainly to with ten degrees or so. Do you mean to tell me that a difference of 60 degrees or more in the Sun's expected position would be something that thousands of professional pilots, with decades of experience in navigation, would simply not seem to notice or mind much?

       Those aren't the whole buildings dude. It's obvious that skyline is cut off along the bottom.

       a good chunk of that is cut off because it is below sea level from the POV of the picture you posted. You can only see about the top half of the Willis Tower.

       Well explain why you only see the top half of it. That certainly would not be consistent with the earth being flat. Is it "a magical trick of light that can't even be addressed through sound science?" If not, then what is it?

       I don't agree with the supposition that I'm not seeing the whole skyline. I believe with the proper lens you could in fact see the bottom of the buildings. The effect you are observing is the limit of your vision creating a convergence known as the horizon.

       Then the buildings should be diminished in more or less equal proportion rather than taller buildings looking even larger by comparison. The Willis tower dwarfs nearby buildings in this picture which are nearly half as tall.

       A skyline is not linear. Relative distances of the buildings from each other would effect their perceived height.

       The relevant buildings are all on Wacker Drive on a section that runs more or less parallel to the shore of Lake Michigan. Specifically the Willis Tower and 311 Wacker Drive. Grande Mere State Park happens to lie along a line running perpendicular to that street. Also because the distances between those buildings very small compared to the distance from which they are being observed they should still scale proportionally to the human eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Willis tower basically divides into three discrete sections that grow thinner from bottom to top. You can only see two sections in this picture. The bottom, and largest, section is completely occluded. How can you obviously see the divides in the other two sections while not seeing the bottom section at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to grant you that you shouldn't see these at all. I will completely cede the point. Now explain this fucking phenomenon within your model in a satisfactory way.

       How is the picture of the Chicago Skyline an argument FOR a flat earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or to elaborate:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Using the numbers in the table you've linked, the skyline should not be visible.
       </li>
       <li>
        On a flat earth, shouldn't the bottom of the skyline be visible?
       </li>
       <li>
        While point 1. could be tweaked by including the following statement from your source - point 2. stays unexplained:
       </li>
      </ol>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the real world there are however atmospheric effects of mainly ray refraction that tend to cause objects beyond the theoretical horizon to sometimes be visible
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So on our layman level of argumentation, the round earth arguments are stronger, imho.

       The conception of an 'edge' is a strawman argument pre-planted in your mind by the false narrative sold to all of us in

       The continents in the southern hemisphere do not go nearly as far south as the continrnts in the northern hemisphere go north. They are also not nearly as populated nor as weslthy, thus so few flights in the south and they do not go over the south pole. That said, flights go every day from Santiago, Chile to Auckland, NZ in 11-13 hours. This Is not possible on a flat earth map.

       The earth is not a globe, but it is not flat. Careful geodetic measurements done with the Rectilineator conclusively proved concave curviture. Hence spatial 2d geometry holds the same, but 3d geometry is invented. Strange but true!

       Flat earth cannot model the stars/planets nor account for southern pole rotation. Concave can do both, plus they have fancy classical music to make it extra convincing.

       I do agree that there are problems with the traditional flat earth model! I will further research the concave hypothesis.

       Not at all.

      <p>
       There's a particular pattern in arguing, especially on Reddit, where instead of actually debating something on its merits, the arguer will put forth false evidence, and then will dodge and hedge and discount any evidence that is put forth. This will then devolve into complaints about those who engage in the debate or whining about downvotes. My assumption has always been that people who argue in this manner don't themselves really believe what they're arguing for/against, and that's why the odd, avoidant, and generally lackluster debating performance comes out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just find the whole thing really interesting, is all, and trying to test my own perceptions of the phenomenon and whether they're accurate sometimes, often, always, or not at all.

       This evidence is damning that NASA faked the Apollo missions and continues to fake space exploration. I'm not saying "nuh uh." I'm saying look at the evidence, you've been sold a lie.

       The Jesuits began disseminating the ball earth doctrine in the 15th century. They're out to undo everything the protestant reformation accomplished in the world and place the papacy back into power over the whole world.

       Pay attention to the (Jesuit) pope's visit to congress in September (coinciding with a blood moon, no less). They're pushing a super UN, Sunday sacredness, and religious unity... along with global taxes, "sustainable development," etc...

       Not at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a particular pattern in arguing, especially on Reddit, where instead of actually debating something on its merits, the arguer will put forth false evidence, and then will dodge and hedge and discount any evidence that is put forth. This will then devolve into complaints about those who engage in the debate or whining about downvotes. My assumption has always been that people who argue in this manner don't themselves really believe what they're arguing for/against, and that's why the odd, avoidant, and generally lackluster debating performance comes out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just find the whole thing really interesting, is all, and trying to test my own perceptions of the phenomenon and whether they're accurate sometimes, often, always, or not at all.

       I'm not dodging your question by saying it doesn't have a known explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       This evidence is damning that NASA faked the Apollo missions and continues to fake space exploration. I'm not saying "nuh uh." I'm saying look at the evidence, you've been sold a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question from there goes: "Okay, so why did they lie?"

       The pieces of the puzzle are all laid out for you. You are too afraid to even pick up the first piece.

       Being curious doesn't mean you yell "It's a lie, everything is fake!" like you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       My curiosity has led me to use scientific evidence on the topic, while your curiosity ends with you claiming all our evidence and photos are fake. But yours is real?
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish it was as easy for me as it is for you to tell people to wake up or call evidence fake without any proof that it is.
