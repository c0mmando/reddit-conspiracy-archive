    <div class="md"><p>It is deliberate, in my view. The purpose is to antagonise both whites and blacks in the Southern States in order to create civic unrest - people demonstrating against the government. This will give an excuse for the military to be deployed (under the auspices of Jade Helm) to restore order.</p>

<p>Edit: clarification. I don&#39;t think there will be a race war - the government are just pressing different buttons to get the same response from different sections of society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;ll say this. I live in Alabama and the majority of white people I know don&#39;t give two shits about the confederate flag being taken away from government property. Yes they&#39;re bitching about it, but they aren&#39;t going to go out and kill some &quot;niggers&quot; just because of a flag. Black people didn&#39;t do this. The media painted a picture and the political correct people voiced an opinion and their opinion was heard. I don&#39;t care about a stupid rebel flag because 1.) The south lost. 2.) It was used to fuel racism. The rebel flag isn&#39;t even the real flag of the confederacy. It was the battle flag of Virginia I think. No one I know is going to revolt because of this, but it is kind of pissing some people off. I couldn&#39;t care less because obviously it&#39;s being used to get people looking one way while the government fucks is while we have our head turned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, always good to get feedback from people on the ground. </p>

<p>It seems to me that everyone is reacting very calmly to pretty obvious provocation. The government wants to see some civil unrest which they can then use as justification for responding with a massively disproportionate show of force. And if there isn&#39;t any civil unrest, the government will just fake some.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean let me play devils advocate here. Say that there was an unrest and it was Whites vs Blacks. Why and how would that even be fair? 1.) White people out number black people by a lot. 2.) Black people are getting killed by other black people most of the time now. I don&#39;t even want to know how it would be if their was a full on race war with whites killing them too. I think they&#39;ll instigate it just enough for something big to slip by the American people. That or they&#39;ll have a &quot;savior&quot; come in and charm and get everyone back to being friends with each other. That &quot;savior&quot; could be the leader of the New World Order or Antichrist or possibly same person. Something bigs going to happen soon though. Racial tensions are kind of high, Obama is going kind of rogue, Greece economy is falling. Something big is going to happen soon and whatever it is is going to be bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think there will be a race war, and I certainly hope there isn&#39;t. I think the government is just pressing certain triggers to get specific sections of society agitated and react against the system (government, police). To rile the black community they use race-bait stories. To rile the Southern whites, they threaten their civil liberties, while extending civil liberties of others (gay marriage).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I mean I&#39;m not that worried about it. I&#39;m not going to fight in a civil war if it&#39;s blacks vs whites or anything like that. Now if its citizens vs government bureaucrats then I&#39;m all in. The government uses the media to show racism to make it seem like it&#39;s happening more now to push some kind of agenda or something. I just try not to focus on it and try and see the shit happening behind the scenes.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve got to think though the people in the military just want to do their time and get back to their family. If they&#39;re told to kill or harm American people on American soil I&#39;d like to think a lot of military men and women wouldn&#39;t stand for it. I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be martial law. I think it&#39;ll be a police state. Some police already think it&#39;s like a war zone that they to out into everyday. Yes being a policeman is risky, but it isn&#39;t war in another country. So if there was a martial law type thing I don&#39;t think or I hope it wouldn&#39;t be military people. I think it&#39;ll probably be police officers. </p>

<p>As a vet, I agree. I think they state/fed will put in NG quickly as a deterrent for the most part. Things seem to get real calm when the NG comes. But I only think this will happen if there are actually skirmishes happening.. not just one person shooting a bunch of people. Police can handle that.</p>

<p>flag banning </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That hyperbole is pissing off white southerners.</p>

<p>Fact:  You can still wave a Confederate flag on your property even though you cannot buy more at Amazon or eBay.  Indeed, there is no law that bans you from a painting a Confederate flag across your truck or wearing one as a hat pin.  No law bans wearing a Confederate flag as a cape or a t-shirt.</p>

<p>Furthermore, no law was passed to ban the sales of Confederate flags.  Some American retailers still sell them.</p>

<p>All irrelevant of course.</p>

<p>I said the confederate flag is just that and nothing else. The confedrate flag. Not the &#39;racist&#39; flag, there is no flag of &#39;racism&#39;.</p>

<p>Because some &#39;racists&#39; fly the confedate flag doesn&#39;t make it the flag of racism.</p>

<p>There are &#39;racists&#39; all over the world flying all manner of flags. BTW, they aren&#39;t all white people despite your hatred of white people and false insistence that they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the confederate flag was raised since the Civil War then the situation would be different . But no, it was raised in the 1960 area and so the argument that it&#39;s allowed for &quot;historical&quot; reasons is wrong . I would argue that you haven&#39;t been involved in Black Culture and if you have you wouldn&#39;t support the Confederate Flag.</p>

<p>Allowing fags to marry ? Are you seriously using that word ? I won&#39;t waste my time now defending gay rights unless you respond to my comment but for simple economic reasons it makes sense .

    <div class="md"><p>I would say the fact you posted in r/conspiracy implies these acts are a conspiracy and not simply the right thing to do. Your title also implies these actions are meant to piss off southern white Christians as if the rest of the U.S isn&#39;t affected by the oppression of Black or Gay rights and pride. I think the title is what ultimately gave me this impression. I did though then misinterpret your intentions however and forgive me . My words then are directed towards the individuals or groups who think the purpose of these actions is to further divide when these actions actually give power to Gays and Blacks who have been harmed by society and the media in the past  . Religion and State are separate and so Christians should not be upset and they have the rights to keep their internal community the way they like . Southerners can keep the flags all they want but to put The flag in the state house when the state is to represent all colors of humanity is wrong and needs to be removed . I have spent time in the land of southern Christians and they were deeply bothered when Obama was elected specifically for his skin color. Any symbol that perpetuates these beliefs should be removed from the State.</p>

<p>If you are still uncertain of these actions ask a question and I&#39;ll respond .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think there will be a race war, and I certainly hope there isn&#39;t. I think the government is just pressing certain triggers to get specific sections of society agitated and react against the system (government, police). To rile the black community they use race-bait stories. To rile the Southern whites, they threaten their civil liberties, while extending civil liberties of others (gay marriage).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d think whom ever is in control understands how fragile things are right now. IMO (and i have no credibility or experience in this area) If violence were to break out, there would be 1 or 2 skirmishes before Martial Law. Huge if though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say the fact you posted in r/conspiracy implies these acts are a conspiracy and not simply the right thing to do. Your title also implies these actions are meant to piss off southern white Christians as if the rest of the U.S isn&#39;t affected by the oppression of Black or Gay rights and pride. I think the title is what ultimately gave me this impression. I did though then misinterpret your intentions however and forgive me . My words then are directed towards the individuals or groups who think the purpose of these actions is to further divide when these actions actually give power to Gays and Blacks who have been harmed by society and the media in the past  . Religion and State are separate and so Christians should not be upset and they have the rights to keep their internal community the way they like . Southerners can keep the flags all they want but to put The flag in the state house when the state is to represent all colors of humanity is wrong and needs to be removed . I have spent time in the land of southern Christians and they were deeply bothered when Obama was elected specifically for his skin color. Any symbol that perpetuates these beliefs should be removed from the State.</p>

<p>If you are still uncertain of these actions ask a question and I&#39;ll respond .</p>
