    <div class="md"><p>yes. because without the ability to work together, there will be no change. revolution cannot come from an individual. black vs white, democrat vs republican, country vs hip hop, gays vs straights, police vs citizens etc etc etc. Keep it in mind when you browse ALL news (not /all, that&#39;s a scary place) .. you erode away at people&#39;s trust, and convince them that they cannot trust anybody.. reduce human interaction, go digital.. shut down any attempt to cross that barrier. it&#39;s constantly portrayed to keep people at war with themselves opposed to fighting together to obtain results.</p>

<p>edit: it might help if there were an outsource in between the main stream and the alex jones types. main stream won&#39;t accept anything that would deviate from the narrative whilst the alex jones types accept everything which in turn keeps fear/doubt high. a middle ground would be nice, reddit is the closest thing i know of but even then you have to weed thru the bullshit constantly.</p>

Caring for others is nice and wonderful but at our base we are designed to spread our own progeny, even at the expense of others.

    <div class="md"><p>The scariest proposition in the TPP from what I&#39;ve gathered is that corporations would legally have the right to defend against &quot;anything&quot; that interferes with it&#39;s trade and goals. Apparently this could even include lawful disregard for the environment in order to facilitate business growth. I&#39;m not very familiar with it but that&#39;s what I&#39;ve gathered. US politics are a huge scam haha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yes! I did realize this is much larger than just a U.S. problem. Apparently the courts that would enforce the TPP bill would be international courts (or whatever that means). I&#39;m not too sure why the U.S. alone even has the power to create a bill like this and put it into effect, possibly each country involved need to pass similar legislation? Again I&#39;m very unfamiliar with the bill but I do know that &quot;trade negotiations&quot; have not yet been made and this is just the first step. I doubt it has much to do with &quot;trade&quot; anyway.</p>

From the reading I have done the only thing that can supersede our Constitutional rights is a treaty and that&#39;s what the TPP is.

The very principle of random distribution entails that there will be clumps, especially if you get to artificially determine which data-points are relevant, and which are not.

<p>True, but if you look at the news cycle, there&#39;s a definite pattern. The stern-faced, matter of fact news people will tell you about &#39;mass shootings&#39;, fires, scandal, and controversy. They want to paint a picture of direness and imminent peril. Then show you the sports and weather! They&#39;re not massacring people, at least not outright. They do it in the name of freedom, or &quot;fighting terrorism&quot;, or drugs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>or pass long-awaited legislation just to distract people that weren&#39;t even paying attention to begin with.</p>

<p>Ever heard of the Patriot Act? Sept 11 was the perfect chance for some rat bastard to pull it off of his desk, dust it off and push it through. And surprise, it made it in record time. Now we all get to live like shivering chihuahuas.</p>

<p>I tune into MSM ony to know exactly what they purposely aren&#39;t covering in order to distract/manipulate the people. I&#39;m aware there is very little if none at all on the news about TPP. Yet they love talking about stories that inherently polarize the common folk, not real news.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s talk about the white racist and sensationize him killing black people at a church, and the Confederate flag too.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s cover shit that doesn&#39;t even compare to things actually going on that matter a great deal more. Let&#39;s keep racism and division alive. Care more a out what&#39;s going on with the Confederate flag than a treaty that will change the entire world in favor for the already corrupt corportacracy.</p>

Gay marriage needed to be legalized on one hand, but a majority of the Christian masses are against it. 
So we got &#39;God&#39; against Homosexuals.
And the flag thing. We basically got history vs. racism.
And it is doing a good job tearing Americans apart. 
Which means, a false flag will come around soon to joint us as a nation, to show that &#39;being divided is pointless because terrorists.&#39; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not <em>to</em> polarize the masses as much as it reflects how much the masses are already polarized.</p>

<p>Many of us surround ourselves with like-minded people.  It&#39;s only when issues like these are in the news that we&#39;re made aware that millions of people with an opposite view actually exist.</p>

<p>In any case, this polarization is about to end.</p>

<p>If a Democrat gets into the white house in 2016, then the Christian right&#39;s dreams of resurgency in US politics are over.  The Supreme Court nominations will seal the deal -- solid liberal majorities for the next generation.  There will be loud, lame cries for rebellion, but ultimately the Christian right will fade, and America will gradually become more secular.</p>

<p>At the same time, robotics tech and AI will cause the bottom to drop out of the economies of many small red state towns, and people will migrate to cities leaving ghost towns behind.  The GOP base will be assimilated into urban life, and it&#39;ll the end of the party.</p>

<p>So long as the GOP doesn&#39;t get a president in 2016, I think we&#39;re in for a giant swing to the left that is going to take people by surprise, and it&#39;s going to be peaceful.  The main hitch is whether we get a SHTF situation with the global economy and the government fundamentally changes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very thought provoking. I even entertain that a rigged vote may actually elect a GOP president just to keep the tides of polarization rolling (or the perspective of that at least). If the GOP were to die out do you think a new party will form with different contrasting points of view?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aside from the issues ViciousCycle mentioned, demographics aren&#39;t working in the GOP&#39;s favor either, here. The GOP has long been able to rely on a more consistently voting base, but it&#39;s also always been a relatively exclusive club compared to the democratic patchwork quilt. With the main GOP base shrinking and the younger generation &amp; fast-growing subdivisions of society tending towards being democrats, that basically sets up an inevitable tipping point.</p>

<p>Way I see it, the current system can only last until the GOP base, even with more active voters than democrats, can no longer attain a majority. That point may have already been reached somewhere around the last two elections, and it&#39;s not gotten any better since then. If it&#39;s not reached that point yet, it&#39;s not far off. If the GOP, as it currently is, cannot reach the required votes even while going as full-bore Right Wing as it has in recent elections (banking on the Tea Party people in particular) then they have to rethink things. They would have no choice. A party that cannot win might as well not exist, as third parties pretty much show.</p>

<p>A single party status quo won&#39;t last, of course. Sure, the democrats might take a slew of elections before the GOP manages to throw itself around and get voters back, but it will return, or some other party will fill the void. For the GOP to have a shot at grabbing the presidency again it would have to swing back to the center, returning to more classic republican tactics and risking losing the extremists - not a bad idea, really. Democrats would likely shift further left to distinguish themselves (I should hope) - they would go full-bore on single-payer healthcare and such ideas, I&#39;m sure. </p>

<p>Net result is a center/left America rather than the present center/right situation.</p>

<p>You could call this some kind of doomsaying about the Republican party, I suppose, but the trouble is that something like this <em>will</em> happen unless things turn around very sharply. I think it&#39;s better to prepare for such scenarios than to bank harder to the right and hope that you haven&#39;t picked up the last few extremist stragglers yet... The 2012 election should have signaled that much, at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d tend to agree fully with the sentiment that there has been an agenda of wealth concentration, seemingly reaching a peak in the last 10 years, underlined by many polarizing political events along the way to help promote policy supporting policy shifts.</p>

<p>To view their motives through the lens of common motives would, IMO, be pointless. I mean, how many more financial goals could a family worth several countries&#39; GDP combined really have?  I&#39;d imagine the &quot;main program&quot; finds it&#39;s goals at the same origin that the world&#39;s most powerful and financially elite find their personal motives. Spiritual, Political, Esoteric, Satanic, ... no way of knowing, but I&#39;d say right now an agenda is certainly &#39;cleaning up&#39; the footholds lost when the industrial revolution and modern production facilities took hold allowing for every breathing American to have guns, ammo, a platform to have their voice heard, and localized flows of information such as twitter, facebook, and email that don&#39;t filter through controlled entities like syndicated news outlets.</p>

<p>The way to be &quot;elite&quot; is by organizing people who are better (smarter, faster, stronger) than average and looking out for your own best interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely spot on.  People think that deprivation will force people to come together, but this is not the case.  Starving people have never rioted anywhere on earth.  The more you deprive people, the less likely they are to revolt.</p>

<p>Everyone bangs on about &#39;the elite&#39; but who are the real elite?  Nobody truly knows.  Sure they could string up the Rothschilds and the Queen of England, but then what?  Stringing up CEOs is just stringing up people who&#39;ve got a job.  By default they can&#39;t be &#39;the elite&#39; because they get out of bed in the morning to go to a place they&#39;d rather not be, attend meetings they don&#39;t want to attend etc.  Any real elite would make certain their names never appeared anywhere, ever!  So, it&#39;d be a blind battle.</p>

<p>A Jewish man once said to me that if you&#39;re looking for the one man who is in control of the entire planet you&#39;d be better off looking in the slums, and find the man with the lowest job, living on the lowest means, it&#39;ll be here where the true elite live, never in a palace.  I used to sell jewellery and the wholesaler I used to use, which turned over hundreds of millions per week, used to have this little old man sat near the back, sitting on a broken chair with one of those labelling guns, putting the prices and weights figures on all the items.  There were men and women in suits busying around the place looking important, and doing important stuff, but every time I went in, this little old man was always labelling stuff, I felt sorry for him having to do such a tedious job and being surrounded by go-getters.  Turns out he was the owner.  Stop looking up to find who runs it all...............</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Memetic transfer of ideas is at the core of conspiracy theories in general, and you can really tell that lately. False flags came in vogue, probably because of the 9/11 conspiracies, and suddenly everything the government ever does is a false flag operation. &#39;Distractions&#39; came in vogue, and now everything is a distraction from something else. Lately the idea of &#39;disinformation agents&#39; has become popular, so now flat-earthers and geocentrists and other fringe conspiracies are considered &#39;disinfo&#39; and trying to smear the subreddit, despite having been around for decades. </p>

<p>Sometimes it seems that for all claims of being enlightened, or awake, or more aware than others, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> can be incredibly gullible and easily led by the lure of confirmation bias.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. That is exactly what you are dealing with. As a society, common understandings hold us together and give strength to individuals. The plan is to destroy families and communities. Minorities are being exploited for that purpose. I am actually somewhat surprised that people have not made the connection between gay marriage and the NWO. Gays are being used to undermine a society based on traditional families. Most do not realize that is what is happening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no quarrel with treating gays humanely and respectfully and even extending the legal rights of marriage via a civil union contract.  The previous era was an abomination regarding treatment of gays.  Gay marriage however takes things a step beyond just getting past discrimination.  Gay marriage is insisting that there can be equality between a heterosexual relationship and a homosexual one and of course there cannot be.  I think that the intention is to destroy our concept of the traditional family.  Our collective unconscious is being deliberately altered and I think if many gays understood what was going on, they also would be concerned. Other minorities are being targetted in the same way.  All the trans stuff is intended to erase notions of male and female.  All of these things play into our sense of identity.  Once we are all homoginized we will be easy to manipulate. </p>

<p>Wow, this has to be the most backward thing I read today.  You say you want to treat gay people respectfully and then say something completely and blatantly insulting and disrespectful.</p>

<p>The reason this Supreme Court decision was so important is exactly because of people like you.  Good thing you&#39;re on the losing side at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things happen every month - sometimes a bunch at once, sometimes spread out. The very principle of random distribution entails that there will be clumps, especially if you get to artificially determine which data-points are relevant, and which are not. Events happening in temporal proximity don&#39;t have to be related - and unless there&#39;s some compelling reason to think that they are, we should be careful not to make spurious connections.</p>
