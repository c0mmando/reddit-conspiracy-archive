After Sandy Hook and all it&#39;s high strangeness, I no longer believe something happened because the news says it did, until I see enough evidence that it did. I&#39;ve been doing all the research I can on this event, and thus far have seen one pic of someone being wheeled out on a gurney. I&#39;ve seen an article about 28 million dollars of taxpayers money being fast-tracked to the church and victims. The donation pages. I&#39;ve seen a few videos of smiling, tearless family members talking about love and forgiveness (like Sandy Hook). I&#39;ve seen the video of Dylann Storm Roof&#39;s gentle arrest. I&#39;ve seen the real strange video of him standing there flanked by two guards, one black and white, on a TV screen in court, being spoken to by family members---at an arraignment---highly bizarre and surreal. Do they really do this in South Carolina? I&#39;ve seen some people saying Roof was some child actor, but who knows. This is all I&#39;ve seen and know. Can anyone add to the body of public &quot;evidence&quot;? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am happy to share this info <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act_for_Fiscal_Year_2013#Smith-Mundt_Modernization_Act_of_2012">right here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 was introduced by U.S. Congressman Mac Thornberry (Thanks, asshole!) on May 10, 2012 in the House of Representatives. The bill&#39;s purpose is &quot;to authorize the domestic dissemination of information and material about the United States intended primarily for foreign audiences.&quot; The act was added to the 2013 NDAA bill as section of 1078 to amend certain passages of Smith-Mundt Act of 1948 and Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1987. The Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 passed Congress as part of the NDAA 2013 on December 28, 2012. Amendments made to the Smith-Mundt Act of 1948 and Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1987 allow for materials produced by the State Department and the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) to be released within US borders.</strong></p>

<p>So the original Act was to disseminate propaganda to foriegn audiences, but it was ammended to now include domestic audiences.</p>

<p>Fuck these people.</p>

<p>Get a good tax man and bleed these motherfuckers dry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG.</p>

<p>I KNEW you were going to post Smith-Mundt , because apparently everybody has been mislead as to what actually happened.</p>

<p>Guess what buddy?</p>

<p>Does ANYTHING in the Smith-Mundt Act prohibit the entire federal government from disseminating domestic propaganda?</p>

<p>NO! Read the text of the resolution:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SEC. 208. CLARIFICATION ON DOMESTIC DISTRIBUTION OF PROGRAM MATERIAL.</p>

<p>(a) IN GENERAL. — No funds authorized to be appropriated to the Department of State or the Broadcasting Board of Governors shall be used to influence public opinion in the United States.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that right there clarifies and proves that the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012, as part of the NDAA 2013, does NOT allow for the Department of State to use funds appropriated to the Department of State or the Governing Board of Broadcasters to be used to influence public opinion.</p>

<p>This text proves that the Smith-Mundt act was established to ensure that foreign propaganda would not also be used as domestic propaganda, as it directly prohibits the two primary foreign propaganda agencies from engaging in disseminating it as propaganda domestically.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Amendments made to the Smith-Mundt Act of 1948 and Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1987 allow for materials produced by the State Department and the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) to be released within US borders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To those who request it for educational, research, or archival purposes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/1461-1a">https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/1461-1a</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_in_the_United_States">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_in_the_United_States</a></p>

<p>PLEASE read that wikipedia page.</p>

<p>Domestic propaganda always has been legal, is now, was then, still is, and always will be.</p>

<p>Does the &quot;Smith-Mundt Modernization Act&quot; have any legal authority over the &quot;National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign&quot; established through the &quot;Office of National Drug Control Policy&quot; established by the &quot;Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988&quot;?</p>

<p>NO! It only applies to the &quot;United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948&quot; (Smith-Mundt Act), which only has the legal authority to regulate the Department of State and Broadcasting Board of Governors.</p>

<p>Domestic propaganda is now and always has been legal in the United States of America, and the Smith-Mundt act has absolutely NOTHING to do with it.</p>

<p>You have been duped by a myriad of liar news organizations, many of which you should know you should not trust such as RUSSIAN TIMES.</p>

<p>Do you seriously expect Russian Times to bring you accurate reporting on United States legislation which you can read as our government gladly and openly hosts the legislation on the internet where you can easily read it and properly interpret it yourself?</p>

<p>Wake up and stop believing everything you read just because idiots sound like they know what they&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>I have clearly proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that you can not just trust &quot;news articles&quot; because they are &quot;news articles&quot;.</p>

<p>They say that the text of a bill says something, yet don&#39;t quote the relevant text from the bill? Yeah, they&#39;re liars, don&#39;t trust them.</p>

<p>So once again, I actually am right, and every &quot;professional&quot; writing articles about the Smith-Mundt act on the internet and television is literally wrong.</p>

<p>I am correct, and have proven them all to be liars.</p>

<p>Please learn to think critically.</p>

<p>Have a nice day.</p>

<p>No, you are saying that &quot;Smith-Mundt Modernization Act&quot; is what lead to domestic propaganda being made legal, as if it were ever illegal.</p>

<p>That is wrong.</p>

<p>Domestic propaganda was never illegal, it has always been legal.</p>

<p>You do not know how to read legislation, if you are coming to the conclusion that the &quot;Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012&quot; has anything to do with domestic propaganda.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/1708">https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/1708</a></p>

<p>That is a LEGAL domestic propaganda program enacted in 1989.</p>

<p>Man, that&#39;s funny, it&#39;s like domestic propaganda always has been legal, and that the &quot;Smith Mundt Act&quot; never has and never will have anything to do with it.</p>

<p>I know I need to work on my delivery.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still reeling from people still being incorrect about this because all of those articles that came out that day are still online and still being cited by people, even though they&#39;re wrong and the text of the legislation proves all those articles wrongs.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very frustrated with this situation, and vented too much about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This response comes up every time there is some type of shooting or event. This sub is made up of numerous people, some posting in good faith, others not. Each time, at least some people are going to doubt the official story and post what they see as evidence to that effect. Most of this evidence will be thin.</p>

<p>This does not mean the entire sub thinks the shooting is fake, or even that most of the people who thought SH or BMB were fake think this one is fake. What is usually consistent is that many of us doubt the official narrative because government and media have a proven track record of lying to us. Doubting the official narrative is at its root skepticism. The media has delivered a narrative, but we want strong evidence before we accept it.</p>

<p>Doubting a narrative because it is the &quot;official&quot; is in no way skeptical. Skeptics rely on evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The media has delivered a narrative, but we want strong evidence before we accept it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, and you should require strong evidence before you accept a narrative. The problem is, conspiracy theorists present their own narrative. A narrative involving lies and cover ups. A narrative for which they have no evidence at all. They then deny any evidence to the contrary. </p>

<p>What did I see at Sandy Hook that proved to me that it was real? Very little.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So because there was less video/photographic evidence you don&#39;t believe in the Sandy Hook shooting. Okay I get that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Columbine, I know was real, there is a ton of evidence made public, including pictures of the dead shooters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is more photographic evidence of Columbine, so you believe that one was real. Seems consistent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I truly believe it&#39;s possible for an event like this to be staged with just enough video to manufacture a perception that it did.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait, what? If you believe that, why do you believe that Columbine was real? Couldn&#39;t all those photos be fake? And if the photos can be faked, why weren&#39;t there more fake photos made of Sandy Hook, or Charleston? </p>

<p>EDIT:  I know you didn&#39;t say anything about fake photos, but I&#39;m assuming if you think they can fake video, then you think they can also fake photographs as well.</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t you find the arraignment to be kind of strange and like a big show?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a high profile and politically charged event. I didn&#39;t find it strange in that context. What specifically should have happened? Why?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A report of an eyewitness doesn&#39;t make it true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course it doesn&#39;t. That&#39;s why we as a society came up with a court system. This kid is going on trial and the evidence will be presented. You are already getting what you want.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why has 28 million dollars of tax payer&#39;s money been paid to the church and the victims families? What does a funeral cost?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It hasn&#39;t. Justice Dept set aside money to deal with managing the aftermath of the event. Of that 29 million, a portion of it may be spent on the families in some way. No one knows what that portion is. I don&#39;t know why you guys think they&#39;re handing multimillion dollar checks to families.</p>
