        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The scientific mantra of vaccines is that they are safe and effective based on their research.  Their research is flawed and is a double standard from any other drug product studied.  The Gold Standard in research design is the double blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).</p>

<p>This means that people are split into 2 groups randomly and participants are given either the real thing or the fake thing being tested.  Then progress is charted on who gets better, who gets worse, and the like.  In theory there should be no bias as to reporting because the researchers don’t know who is in the placebo or the real intervention group.</p>

<p>How many vaccines have ever been studied in this manner?  ZERO!  The reason?  The researchers will say they cannot perform an RCT because it would be unethical to NOT give a child a vaccine because if that child dies of something that could have been prevented, then they don’t want to be responsible.  But if someone dies in their trials from taking their anti-depressants, it must be OK.</p>

<p>Hey drug companies, I will volunteer my child to be in the placebo group and compare him to the health and well being of those that have gotten all the recommended vaccines.  I’m sure I can gather a few hundred thousand more to be in the placebo group to create a large sample.</p>

<p>Instead of research to see safety and effectiveness, they instead see if the person builds anti-bodies to the antigen (the foreign invader) that is in the vaccine.  If antibodies are built, then it’s ‘safe and effective,’ or so they lead us to believe.  These studies are rarely, if ever done on kids younger than 4 years old.  How can you say it’s safe or effective for a baby if it’s never studied on a baby?</p>

<p>The 2 populations that have limited production of anti-bodies are infants and geriatrics, the 2 most heavily vaccinated populations.  If they can’t produce anti-bodies, then the vaccine would be pointless.  The whole premise of the vaccine is that you get injected with a foreign invader and you produce anti-bodies against it.  If you can’t produce anti-bodies well then what’s the use of injecting something to try and stimulate that reaction?</p>

<p>With kids, they don’t produce any anybodies until after age 6 months.  So why give a vaccine to anyone under the age of 6 months if they can’t produce antibodies.  Even if the whole vaccine theory really worked, it would be absolutely pointless to inject a baby of 6 months or less with a vaccine .  With a child’s immune system being very immature until age 2, the overload of 36 vaccines by the age of 18 months seems about as logical as drinking from a fire hydrant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have read a lot about this case, and thought about it before I posted, but as it was a failure and not completed I do not think it qualifies.</p>

<p>On April 12th. 1955, the tenth anniversary of President Franklin Roosevelt’s death, that the Foundation for Infantile Paralysis told the world, using every possible means of publicity, that the vaccine devised by Dr. Jonas E. Salk was &quot;safe, potent, and efficient.&quot; For it was on this day that the eagerly awaited report on the 1954 tests of the vaccine was issued by Dr. Thomas Francis, of Michigan University. who had been entrusted with the task of evaluating the results. At a meeting of 500 doctors and scientists at Ann Arbor. Michigan, Dr. Salk and Dr. Francis made such sweeping claims for the vaccine that nearly every American newspaper declared that Dr. Salk had abolished poliomyelitis.</p>

<p>Already, in the past year, before any report as to the efficiency of the vaccine was available, six manufacturing firms had had orders from the Foundation for Infantile Paralysis to manufacture enough vaccine to inoculate 9 million children and pregnant women. Two hours after the announcement by Drs. Salk and Francis the Government Department responsible licensed the vaccine and released it for distribution to all the States that had agreed to employ it.</p>

<p>The British newspapers and more especially the scientific journals were somewhat more guarded in their statements and their cautionary advice was well justified by subsequent events, as was also the attitude first adopted by our own Ministry of Health.</p>

<p>THE SALK VACCINE DISASTER</p>

<p>Only thirteen days after the vaccine had been acclaimed by the whole of the American Press and Radio as one of the greatest medical discoveries of the century, and two days after the English Minister of Health had announced he would go right ahead with the manufacture of the vaccine, came the first news of disaster. Children inoculated with one brand of vaccine had developed poliomyelitis. In the following days more and more cases were reported, some of then after inoculation with other brands of the vaccine. Then came another, and wholly unlooked-for complication. The Denver Medical Officer, Dr. Florio announced the development of what he called ‘satellite’ polio, that is, cases of the disease in the parents or other close contacts of children who had been inoculated and. alter a few days’ illness in hospital, had returned home: they communicated the disease to others, although not suffering from it themselves.</p>

<p>On June 23rd, 1955 the American Public Health Service announced that there had been 149 confirmed cases of poliomyelitis among the vaccinated, with six deaths, and 149 cases among the contacts of children given the Salk vaccine, with six deaths. Nor is this the end of the story; how many vaccinated children will eventually be reported as developing the disease is as yet unknown, but it is at any rate limited by the fact that the distribution of further batches of vaccine was suspended on May 6th, the actual manufacture of Cutter vaccine, which had been responsible for most of the polio cases, having been stopped altogether, pending a full inquiry, by the National Institute of Health on April 28th.</p>

<p>But with regard to the &quot;satellite&quot; cases the situation is far worse. According to Dr. Florio, children when inoculated with a faulty vaccine may become carriers of the virus. He estimated (Daily Express. May 16. 1955) that all of the 1,500 vaccinated Denver children had become carriers. &quot;We have created a group of carriers&quot;, he said, &quot;and then there will be another group and so the cycle will go on. It is very distressing.&quot; Some of the contacts acquired the disease in its deadliest form.</p>

<p>The interval between inoculation and the first sign of paralysis ranged from 5 to 20 days and in a large proportion of cases it started in the limb in which the injection had been given. Another feature of the tragedy was that the numbers developing polio were far greater than would have been expected had no inoculations been carried out. In fact, in the state of Idaho. according to a statement by Dr. Curl Eklund, one of the Government’s chief virus authorities, polio struck only vaccinated children in areas where there had been no cases since the preceding autumn: in 9 out of 10 cases the paralysis occurred in the arms in which the vaccine had been injected. (News Chronicle. May 6, 1955).</p>

<p>This experience led to Mr. Peterson, the Health Director for the State of Idaho, calling a halt to the mass inoculation programme. According to the Daily Telegraph (June 19. I955) he stated: &quot; We have lost confidence in the Salk vaccine.&quot; The report continues: He said that he holds the vaccine, together with the instructions for its manufacture. directly responsible for the outbreak of polio in Idaho. This outbreak has resulted in 86 cases of the disease, including seven deaths, since the mass immunisation programme began in April. Mr. Peterson expressed disappointment that scientists and officials had not visited Idaho.&quot; He contended: &quot;This was the H.Q. of the biggest outbreak there was. This was the place where they could study the facts.&quot;</p>

<p>An article in Time (May 30. 1955 commented: ‘In retrospect, a good deal of the blame for the vaccine snafu also went to the National Foundation, which, with years of publicity, had built up the danger of polio out of all proportion to its actual incidence. and had rushed into vaccinations this year with patently insufficient preparation.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Immunization failed to reduce episodes of respiratory infections (1.8 episodes/study period among vaccinees vs. 2.0 among controls). Similarly the vaccine failed to affect the total number of days the vaccinees suffered from respiratory infections (13.5 days vs. 14.6 days, respectively). However, days of work lost because of respiratory infections (1.0 days vs. 1.4 days, respectively, P = 0.02) and especially total numbers of days the study persons felt themselves unable to work when either on or off duty (2.5 days vs. 3.5 days, P 0.02) were significantly decreased.</p>

<p>This study only says that people who received the vaccine took less sick days. It explicitly states that the immunization failed to reduce infections or shorten the duration of infections.   </p>

<p>Is the reason for immunization to decrease sick days or to decrease sickness?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the one linked here did not demonstrate the efficacy used as the premise in the vaccination argument. It showed some other outcome having to do with nurses returning to work. </p>

<p>Do you see my point?  I think we agree on the gold standard method.  I am only saying that just because gold standard methods were used, does not mean that the vaccines worked. If the study shows that the vaccine had no statistically significant difference in outcome, then the study proves that the vaccine was basically useless. I am all for avoiding useless medical treatments. </p>

<p>All this study says was that nurses can work sooner when they have it, not that they were sick less or for shorter a duration.  The medical journals admittedly publish erroneous shit like this, and we are wise to be very skeptical of their claims.  </p>

<p>These threads are not about winning arguments. Most of the people who post here are intelligent and have a lot to add. </p>

<p>In this case we need double blind RCT&#39;s that have a clear outcome. Then we need them repeated by non-affiliated qualified personnel, all published for peer review. </p>

<p>&quot;Conclusions and Relevance:   Attending physicians and APCs frequently work while sick despite recognizing that this choice puts patients at risk. The decision to work sick is shaped by systems-level and sociocultural factors. Multimodal interventions are needed to reduce the frequency of this behavior.&quot;</p>

<p>It would be interesting to see if the vaccination is actually putting people at risk by causing nurses to return to work earlier than the non-vaccinated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about. They do use the &quot;gold standard&quot; not like it is necessary to do so to get good results though. I was addressing the single one specific claim of the op. That is one specific thing. There are many many different vaccines. There&#39;s nothing erroneous about it. You should be praising it for the honesty when it shows less than favorable results instead of them hiding it and not publishing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have read a lot about this case, and thought about it before I posted, but as it was a failure and not completed I do not think it qualifies.</p>

<p>On April 12th. 1955, the tenth anniversary of President Franklin Roosevelt’s death, that the Foundation for Infantile Paralysis told the world, using every possible means of publicity, that the vaccine devised by Dr. Jonas E. Salk was &quot;safe, potent, and efficient.&quot; For it was on this day that the eagerly awaited report on the 1954 tests of the vaccine was issued by Dr. Thomas Francis, of Michigan University. who had been entrusted with the task of evaluating the results. At a meeting of 500 doctors and scientists at Ann Arbor. Michigan, Dr. Salk and Dr. Francis made such sweeping claims for the vaccine that nearly every American newspaper declared that Dr. Salk had abolished poliomyelitis.</p>

<p>Already, in the past year, before any report as to the efficiency of the vaccine was available, six manufacturing firms had had orders from the Foundation for Infantile Paralysis to manufacture enough vaccine to inoculate 9 million children and pregnant women. Two hours after the announcement by Drs. Salk and Francis the Government Department responsible licensed the vaccine and released it for distribution to all the States that had agreed to employ it.</p>

<p>The British newspapers and more especially the scientific journals were somewhat more guarded in their statements and their cautionary advice was well justified by subsequent events, as was also the attitude first adopted by our own Ministry of Health.</p>

<p>THE SALK VACCINE DISASTER</p>

<p>Only thirteen days after the vaccine had been acclaimed by the whole of the American Press and Radio as one of the greatest medical discoveries of the century, and two days after the English Minister of Health had announced he would go right ahead with the manufacture of the vaccine, came the first news of disaster. Children inoculated with one brand of vaccine had developed poliomyelitis. In the following days more and more cases were reported, some of then after inoculation with other brands of the vaccine. Then came another, and wholly unlooked-for complication. The Denver Medical Officer, Dr. Florio announced the development of what he called ‘satellite’ polio, that is, cases of the disease in the parents or other close contacts of children who had been inoculated and. alter a few days’ illness in hospital, had returned home: they communicated the disease to others, although not suffering from it themselves.</p>

<p>On June 23rd, 1955 the American Public Health Service announced that there had been 149 confirmed cases of poliomyelitis among the vaccinated, with six deaths, and 149 cases among the contacts of children given the Salk vaccine, with six deaths. Nor is this the end of the story; how many vaccinated children will eventually be reported as developing the disease is as yet unknown, but it is at any rate limited by the fact that the distribution of further batches of vaccine was suspended on May 6th, the actual manufacture of Cutter vaccine, which had been responsible for most of the polio cases, having been stopped altogether, pending a full inquiry, by the National Institute of Health on April 28th.</p>

<p>But with regard to the &quot;satellite&quot; cases the situation is far worse. According to Dr. Florio, children when inoculated with a faulty vaccine may become carriers of the virus. He estimated (Daily Express. May 16. 1955) that all of the 1,500 vaccinated Denver children had become carriers. &quot;We have created a group of carriers&quot;, he said, &quot;and then there will be another group and so the cycle will go on. It is very distressing.&quot; Some of the contacts acquired the disease in its deadliest form.</p>

<p>The interval between inoculation and the first sign of paralysis ranged from 5 to 20 days and in a large proportion of cases it started in the limb in which the injection had been given. Another feature of the tragedy was that the numbers developing polio were far greater than would have been expected had no inoculations been carried out. In fact, in the state of Idaho. according to a statement by Dr. Curl Eklund, one of the Government’s chief virus authorities, polio struck only vaccinated children in areas where there had been no cases since the preceding autumn: in 9 out of 10 cases the paralysis occurred in the arms in which the vaccine had been injected. (News Chronicle. May 6, 1955).</p>

<p>This experience led to Mr. Peterson, the Health Director for the State of Idaho, calling a halt to the mass inoculation programme. According to the Daily Telegraph (June 19. I955) he stated: &quot; We have lost confidence in the Salk vaccine.&quot; The report continues: He said that he holds the vaccine, together with the instructions for its manufacture. directly responsible for the outbreak of polio in Idaho. This outbreak has resulted in 86 cases of the disease, including seven deaths, since the mass immunisation programme began in April. Mr. Peterson expressed disappointment that scientists and officials had not visited Idaho.&quot; He contended: &quot;This was the H.Q. of the biggest outbreak there was. This was the place where they could study the facts.&quot;</p>

<p>An article in Time (May 30. 1955 commented: ‘In retrospect, a good deal of the blame for the vaccine snafu also went to the National Foundation, which, with years of publicity, had built up the danger of polio out of all proportion to its actual incidence. and had rushed into vaccinations this year with patently insufficient preparation.&quot;</p>
