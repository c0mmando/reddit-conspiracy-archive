        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The founding fathers knew there were two agendas that evil men wanted to achieve to rule this world:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Centralized banking, ie the Rothschild banking cartel</p></li>
<li><p>Globalization, ie mega corporations that operate on global scales, enslaving majority to cater to the rich minority </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Everything that&#39;s done under the sun, with currency from the Rothschilds, benefits the rich and extorts the people. America borrows money from the Rothschilds, then we the people pay the loan back. Before we went into Iraq and Vietnam, those countries weren&#39;t banking with the Rothschilds.</p>

<p>It started 1916, when the central bank was established. Since then, the industrial powerhouse America was becoming, would have its power and economic wellbeing siphoned by the rich.</p>

<p>When the central bank was established, it was game over already.</p>

<p>The gold standard was abolished, then Nixon made the value of the dollar based in petroleum, he rigged prices and wages, and started the globalization agenda.</p>

<p>Reagan passed the free trade agreement that put the made on China label on almost all we own, effectively putting American industry on the road to perdition. Roosevelt, Nixon, Carter, Reagan, Bush Sr, Clinton, Dub-ya, and Obama all worked in lockstep to further the agenda.</p>

<p>Now, we live in a world where huge corporations try to take on the task of exploiting every single opportunity for profit.  </p>

<p>Mega fishing companies are putting Canadian fishers out of business, with huge fishing vessels that are built to replace dozens of smaller fishing vessels.
Jobs in fishing companies, in our globalized world, will be in gigantic ships with a canning factory on board, where individuals can work 18 hour days, 7days a week.</p>

<p>Amazon warehouses are notorious for its 1984esque, human cattle like business  practice, in which people are made to work crazy hours, non stop, in extreme heat and cold temperatures. Ambulances were on standby to take away the hurt, in which the hurt would get fired and the next new employee on the roster was brought in.</p>

<p>Full-time jobs and labor unions in retail is almost unheard of, tales of employee owned companies and a decent living wage float around as rumors.</p>

<p>It is really getting to the point that developed countries are going to end up being nothing more than technology and commerce based, where undeveloped countries are going to be the source for all labor and industry. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see the people that burden American society moving to other countries, I see that there&#39;s the mega rich who dispense just enough jobs to keep the machine going in America, but are pushing the globalization agenda full force in order to exploit outsourcing and the global economy, eliminating industry in America, eliminating competition. </p>

<p>American economics is designed to be auto-cannibalistic, one company devouring another company, government policy being undermined and abused to cater to the one percent. Pension funds, social security, funding for public programs, PBS of all things, are slowly being devoured by the big mouth of mega corporations. The less the people have, the more the rich has. </p>

<p>If we don&#39;t push to shut down the federal reserve, to audit the entire government structure and to go for a society reset, there is no hope for this world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cannot agree more or upvote enough.  Everything you said is very correct.  I feel that a great deal of forward movement can be made if and when the citizenry puts aside all the indoctrinated prejudices and racism brainwashed into us and we start refusing to see each other as separate from one another and start helping each other as one united family <em>independent</em> of a controlling state above us.</p>

<p>I totally get, understand, and respect this.  However, the &quot;younger generation&quot; will have the same damn problems too.  It&#39;s just a cycle that will go over and over and over again if the older generation keeps putting it on the younger generation who will grow up to be EXACTLY LIKE <em>THEM</em> unless we <em>all</em> get up and work together.</p>

<p>Again, we ALL have to do it.  That&#39;s the only way.</p>

<p>I get it, and, again, I respect it.  However, we can&#39;t expect shit to get done if we pass the buck.  Simple as that.</p>

<p>I get that too.  And yes.  The elite <em>are</em> the ones to blame.  However, they REALLY don&#39;t give a fuck whether they get blamed or not.  So you know what that means then?  What that means is that if we the people want to do anything about it, then it&#39;s WE - again, <em>all of us</em> - that are going to have to come together as one and DO something about it.</p>

<p>Not the young, not the &quot;able bodied only&quot;, not &quot;those who aren&#39;t too tired from a long day of work&quot;.</p>

<p>Again, if we want to fix all this b.s., then <em>all</em> of us will simply have to come together and work to help one another.</p>

<p>Otherwise, we just need to STFU and keep taking that PTB stiffy up the poop shoot like we&#39;ve been doing.</p>

<p>I absolutely agree with you the load shouldn&#39;t be put on the backs of the young.  It&#39;s incorrect as well to blame the mess we&#39;re in on the previous generation.  It&#39;s been done over and over and shows a lack of effort put toward analysis of cause and effect.  You&#39;re naively optimistic to suggest &quot;all of us will simply have to come together and work to help one another,&quot; to solve our problems.  That&#39;s never going to happen.  So far the population has just as many goodies as they need to keep them pacified, and who knows what might be slipped into our brains and bodies to make so many of us apathetic.  IMO the shit&#39;s going to hit and an uninformed, ignorant population won&#39;t have a clue how to unite and fight.  The only consolation is (again IMO) the elite are going down with us.</p>

<p>No I’m not.  I didn’t say “We <em>can</em> do this” or “We’re doing it”.  I only said what we HAVE to do if things are to work.  That’s neither optimistic nor pessimistic.  It’s just a statement of fact.  Nothing else.</p>

<p>Not necessarily, so it might not be any consolation at all.  And even if they <em>did</em> go down w/us as well (which I don’t think they necessarily would), that’s <em>still</em> no consolation.</p>

<p>They are imbalanced, and a sharp divide between the upper and lower classes has been deliberately created.  You could see that start happening back when Reagan was president.  Not only were there changes in economic policy, but the media began to use both obvious and subliminal content to teach people to see some of us as better than others and those who are supposedly inferior are expendable.  The media taught us the poor and homeless are to blame for their own problems and compassion is to be scoffed at. It pisses me off so much to look back and see what was deliberately done to the US and the entire world, and it&#39;s frustrating so many people don&#39;t know it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>nice post, people dont like it when I say that we are owned by the rich.  We as in the common people.  Our sole-purpose to life is to spend all of it working and consuming, we get paid very little compared to those at the top, barely enough to pay bills and none to save, we spend our money on consuming products.  This whole cycle is trickle-up economics, the trickle-down is complete horseshit, it&#39;s only trickling up in this endless cycle.</p>

<p>People also hate it when I say that we are really setting up a poor future for the kids today, they are the ones who are going to turn 20 in the 2030&#39;s and imagine what it&#39;s going to be like then, just imagine.  You think jobs that can pay the bare minimum are scarce now?  It&#39;s going to be awful for them, worse than the 20-30 yr olds have it now, that&#39;s for sure.</p>

<p>We are basically under corporate rule, yes all through history it&#39;s been like that.  The wealthy has always ruled and probably always will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is partly banks, but they&#39;re really just a symptom of the root cause: Capitalism. Not &quot;crony&quot; capitalism, not &quot;globalism&quot;, just Capitalism, which includes all those negatives by default. </p>

<p>Seriously, what do you expect to happen when democracy is limited to choosing government officials? People get to vote for the favorites of those who have real power, the economic elite, all while being deprived of democratic self-determination in the most important place of their lives, the work-place. The American democracy was established by and for wealthy white landowning males, not &quot;the people&quot;. Is it no surprise that the system they established works exactly to the benefit of the wealthy?</p>

<p>As for globalization, it&#39;s an inevitable consequence of the drive to higher profits. You won&#39;t stop it with free markets, because in a free market globalization and the concentration of wealth are natural and inevitable things.</p>

<p>If you want to solve this problem, you need to get rid of the capitalist class. Get rid of the Waltons and place Walmart under the control of its employees. Get rid of Goldman Sachs&#39; owners and place the institution under the control of the employees. Give everybody from the lowest bank teller and shelf-stocker, to the highest seat of management a vote. One vote. Not a share that you can buy up and obtain authoritarian power with. A vote. Empower people in the workplace, the place they spend half their waking lives, and then things will change.</p>

<p>Democracy is false so long as it is denied in the workplace. </p>

Do you consider yourself American simply because your food, shelter, and security are ensured by doing so?

Don&#39;t be afraid, they can only kill you once, they can only torture you if you feel, they can&#39;t control your mind without your minds consent. </p>

<p>As for everyone else, be vigilant. I can tell you that almost every person I&#39;ve ever known in 28 years, family or friends, is a lost cause.
