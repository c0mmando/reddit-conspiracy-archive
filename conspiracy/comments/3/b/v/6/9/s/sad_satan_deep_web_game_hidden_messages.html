        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://kotaku.com/a-horror-game-hidden-in-the-darkest-corners-of-the-inte-1714980337">http://kotaku.com/a-horror-game-hidden-in-the-darkest-corners-of-the-inte-1714980337</a></p>

<p>Ok, so for anyone who hasn&#39;t heard of this game yet (I think it&#39;s been a fairly big topic for the last couple of days now), basically it appears to be a horror-style game in which, on the surface at least, not that much happens (the player walks along endless corridors and is confronted by ambiguous sights and sounds).</p>

<p>But there is a lot about this game that&#39;s making me want to dig a little deeper on it. Firstly, it was posted on the deep web. Secondly, one of the images it flashes to the player is of notorious UK paedophile Jimmy Saville. And a lot of the content seems to be about satanism and satanic ritual abuse.</p>

<p>Now, I have to admit that I have not actually played this game myself, and apparently the Tor link is no longer active to download it. But some posters on r/creepygaming have been doing a great job of deciphering some of the games content.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/creepygaming/comments/3bslab/uncovering_the_secrets_of_sad_satan/">https://np.reddit.com/r/creepygaming/comments/3bslab/uncovering_the_secrets_of_sad_satan/</a></p>

<p>So what do you all think? An elaborate but meaningless bedroom project or something much, much deeper? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly creepy and weird but there isn&#39;t much to make me think it is anything beyond some bored guy that wanted to make a strange game in his spare time.  Also, it being on the &#39;deep web&#39; doesn&#39;t mean anything to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you&#39;re right that it being on the deep web probably shouldn&#39;t be read into too much (especially since some people seem to think it was the creator of the game who linked the youtuber to the game in the first place). </p>

<p>But then if you&#39;ve looked at the thread I linked where the game is being deciphered, I dunno, they are uncovering a LOT of stuff in there, all (or mostly) connected to the subject of satanic and ritual child abuse.</p>

<p>So yeah, it might just have been some bored guy making a strange game. But if that&#39;s so then it&#39;s a very...interesting isn&#39;t the right word but...it&#39;s a curious choice of subject matter for sure. And the fact that this very subject is currently at the centre of what could end up being one of the biggest scandals ever to be uncovered here in the UK, well that makes me hesitant to just dismiss this right off the bat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s certainly possible there is more to it.  Im not all that interested in the occult or satanism as a conspiracy so it&#39;s just not my expertise.  I agree that if there is a lot to it then it should certainly be looked into.  For what it&#39;s worth, I have a relatively high standard of what I believe to be genuine conspiracies.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Creepy. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=x0HeucTQKIM">second video</a> is considerably more interesting, and creepier than the first. </p>

<p>The NSPCC is referenced more than once. The first time is with Jimmy Savile and Margaret Thatcher, the second time is the corridor with the weird dark circles (holes?) on the wall, if you consider the NSPCC&#39;s current <a href="http://www.thecrackedpot.co.uk/UserFiles/Image/NSPCCGreen%5B1%5D.jpg">logo</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good catch. And if those &#39;circles&#39; are meant to be an intentional reference to the NSPCC logo, then it&#39;s interesting that, further along in Part 2, the player enters that room again but this time it has many disturbed-looking children in there also.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t put to much thought into it since everything is coming from a handful of individuals who won&#39;t give access to the game to anyone else because it came from a tor download that no longer exists? And whats preventing it from being uploaded to every other mirror on the net? Nothing yet only a few have access to it. Fishy </p>

<p>Probably a clever marketing ploy for the next big thing in indie horror.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you could be right, although why anyone would want to use Jimmy Saville to market their product is beyond me!</p>

<p>But nothing would surprise me at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The original uploader of the video allegedly deleted the game from his computer, which is why it hasn&#39;t been uploaded. Whether that&#39;s true or not is beyond me, that&#39;s just what he claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i know nothing about this, but at first glance &quot;sad satan&quot; seems to be a reference to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGsUcPdPWBg">led zeppelins  &quot;stairway to heaven&quot;  played backwards</a>  </p>

<p>knowing this, it seems the most logical step would be to play the audio in this clip backwards to look for clues.  Im fairly confident something would be found (for that reason, and because the whole track sounds like something recorded and then reversed lol).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, you&#39;re right and if you look at the r/creepygaming thread I linked in the OP they&#39;ve already managed to identify most of the audio clips used in the game (Stairway is used a couple of times I believe) as well as make some tenuous connections to Jimmy Page.</p>

<p>Good catch though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By using or attempting to use the &quot;deep web&quot; do you immediately get raided and imprisoned?  There is a great podcsat by Joe Rogan with actor Alex Winter (Lost Boys, Bill &amp; Ted&#39;s) about it.  I&#39;m still not sure if by even trying to access it you get sent to rape camp.</p>
