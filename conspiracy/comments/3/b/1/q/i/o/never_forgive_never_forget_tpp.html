<p>There is clearly a conspiracy to prevent knowledge of the passing of this trade deal, and the contents of this trade deal. The stations are not reporting it, Reddit is censoring it.</p>

<p>Their cards are shown, this is their grand play. However, if this is what they want then let them forever live in infamy as the duplicitous traitors they have announced themselves to be.</p>

<p>We are many, and they are few. They may have won this round, but that doesn&#39;t mean the next round has to be theirs - and time shows us that all dictators are eventually usurped.</p>

<p>Learn who has passed this bill, learn who has not been reporting it, and even learn who has been censoring.</p>

<p>Never forgive them for betraying humanity, and never forget the boot that they wish to trample upon you, forever, for profit.</p>

<p>This is not a call to arms, or violence as that is what they want - however, it is a call to remember, it is a call to not forget as we have seemingly forgotten the transgressions that have lead us to this point.</p>

<p>Your death wouldn&#39;t even be presented as it happened, because propaganda is <strong>legal</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A pawn sacrificing itself for a more valuable chess piece is a pretty good trade usually. Regardless, the pacifist resistance nonsense has failed for a hundred years and it will fail for the next one hundred years. Pacifism was invented and promoted by the same elites in power now to prevent rebellion. Let&#39;s be clear, these monsters are guilty of mass murder and conspiracy to commit further mass murder. They are already at war with us, they have already collapsed the economy.</p>

<p>Government is about the monopolization and utilization of force and violence. We are the government, the right to violently oppose them is ours. We are Americans. If our founding fathers were pacifists there would be no America. It is our duty to violently oppose this wretched government not just to honor them, but to eliminate the current power structure completely. Violence can mean capture and arrest or if can mean assassination - I personally don&#39;t care which but I imagine it would have to be carried out by a popular military general as the civilian population has proven that it doesn&#39;t have what it takes to govern or lead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CIA runs anonymous now. Possibly it always has, as means to justify money spent on the cyber war machine. The nonviolent action approach works, as it did for MLK. However, it takes manpower and people willing to take arrest, beatings, even being hung. That is not going to happen in this day in age. Americans for the most part are consumer zombies that only care about themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The OP is more likely FBI as they enjoy spreading pacifist notions to insure the cattle stay in their place and don&#39;t resist. You can think and philosophize and criticize all you want, just don&#39;t do anything like forcefully remove them from their video game controllers and ground them in their room. When the revolution finally accepts their responsibility as the rightful government, they will need to organize raids to capture criminals. They will need in many situations to arrest them and for those most stubborn like the Bush family, the Rockefellers or Rothschilds, we may have to kill them before they can launch their WMD. These people are guilty of the murder of millions. Even now they conspire to wage war against a number of other nations and people.</p>

<p>The only people you should be preaching this pacifist nonsense to are those monsters like Soros and the military industrial complex. The American people on the other hand, need to grow some balls and stand up to them. If that involves an armed rally of patriots storming the capital and putting mass murdering politicians and banksters to death then so be it. If we have to tear down DC and rebuild it to prevent those mob bosses from spreading their corruption and ruining the legacy of our founders than so be it.
At the earliest opportunity, Americans should take their country back even if they have to get violent. </p>

<p>Fuck pacifism and fuck the FBI.</p>
