       At what point do we say "ENOUGH?!" How much further does this deadspin have to spiral out of control before we, the people, grab the controls and right the course?! America is ruined.  America has been poisoned and is lying breathless on the ground.  The only way to fix it is to plant a new seed. Tear out the roots and recultivate the soil. The work must be done by us common folk. No corporate involvement of any kind, for they work with the enemy. They are the enemy. "Let freedom ring!!" They tell us. Then they dismantle the bell. No more! We need to reerect the Bell of Liberty and strike her with the Hammer of Justice in the name of the common man. Just as they did in the beginning. Yet let us learn from the mistakes of our forefathers by not becoming blinded in our pursuit of a rightful, peaceful existence for every man. Let us strike down the beast that is monetary control and sever it's head, never to rise again. Andrew Jackson removed the United States from it's zionist overlords, and it was the only time in history that America was not enslaved in debt. That speaks volumes to the hearts of any man or woman who listens to it's meaning. Let us take the original book of our forefathers and edit into it's contents the pages of Andrew Jackson against Zionist control.  Let us take back our lives.  Down with Tyranny!  Let the words of the founding fathers resound so loudly as they did once before!  Let us shield them from the toxic grasp of fanatical corporatism!  We need to rise against this inward pressure.  We need to destroy the crumbling foundation and rebuild it better.  Death to corporate oppression!  I'd like to think there's enough of us with a burning passion and common sense to call for change in such a way that it actually garners attention, and opens the eyes of those blinded by the lies and vitriol of the filth that runs this planet.  Revolution has happened before.  Revolution is not impossible.  We can do this, on our
       <em>
        own damned terms
       </em>
       , and we can push back against the towers of oppression with the might of a caged, wounded animal, and we can
       <em>
        MAKE CHANGE OCCUR
       </em>
       .  We have the power to sever the restraints foisted upon us, and we have the power to reverse the flow of strife.  We have a powerful weapon on our sides: OUTRAGE.  Let us inject this into our defiant fury, let the ones that refer to themselves as elite feel the anger that they have stoked into our souls, burning everlasting in sickening rage.  We can do this.  We MUST do this.  Not for our entertainment. Not for our comfort.  But because it's the
       <em>
        right thing to do
       </em>
       .  Please, brothers and sisters, join me in saying "ENOUGH!!"  Please, spread the word.  Rally the troops.  Let's get something done!

       Haha no sir. This my one and only and first reddit account. I joined because the flat earth issue is too important for me to keep quiet about. Not to mention have now addressed several other topics if you had actually read my accounts posts.. I don't even necessarily believe either way. I am coming from a place of learning, not knowing. I would advise my fellow man to begin that journey of rediscovery as well. Take a walk in a park or something, get off the computer for a while.

       It is with baited breath that I've waited for someone with similar views to finally open their mouths and speak on behalf of our once loved freedoms. The corporate machine has long overstayed its welcome and it is now far beyond high time to act and shed the passive aggressive attitude we constantly exude. It is now definitely the time for action brother. The Fed has manipulated our wellbeing for its soon to be last time. I'm the words of Thomas Jefferson "THE TREE OF LIBERTY MUST BE REFRESHED FROM TIME TO TIME WITH THR BLOOD OF PATRIOTS AND TYRANTS" I'm not afraid of bleeding for our freedoms.

       The freedom from an oppressive manipulated monetary system based on the speculation of trade and big corporations. The freedom to speak and believe whatever is on your mind without fear of banning or censorship. The freedom to arm and protect yourself without harsh persecution by government puppets using the opportunity to take away your peace of mind. To have REAL freedom OF information while never worrying about what has been edited or redacted. Smaller government involvement in our individual businesses. To resurrect the American dream that died so long ago and to escape the Orwellian surveillance nation we live in now.

       It may sound hollow, but there is always that small sliver of hope that if we stand together as small groups or as an entire nation of people awake to the things that have been stolen from us by TPTB that we could make a difference. Remember that the smallest flea can be the biggest pest even on the backs of the biggest beasts.

       No we don't have much freedom left and they intend to squeeze in the style of a tube of toothpaste until there is no more will to stand. Our "real and true" freedoms are poorly represented by our talking heads because the real freedoms we once had are no almost gone. I seriously believe this, now, is a great time to act.

       This has been tried before...instead of looking at things so negatively, how about you look around, look at other countries and see that what we have here is a lot more than many places. We have it good here. Restarting would not pay off debts, only create more. Revolution like you are proposing would not cause change, only death.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "corporate machine" is not something so easily avoided, it is something that reaches world wide, and its presence affords us many of the luxurious and liberties that we have today, like the device you used to write this rant.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll agree that there are parts of the country that need to change. Gerrymandering in some states that gives less than 50% of the population 90% of the power in many states, spearheaded by a political party only after their own personal views rather than what is good for the country. Military spending in some states that keep a large, federally-funded force that serves no purpose other than being a tax write-off. Perhaps in staff of an uprising, maybe we should look at the people we put in places of power, see the corruption that has spread, and people who will do better for the nation, not themselves?

       The truth is that the United States was created as a social experiment. A "New Atlantis". Your forefathers were not who think they were. Until the people realize that, we won't be ready. All this other bullshit; the news, gay marriage, abortion, the wars, the deficit, yada yada. All just "bread and circuses to keep us amused", kinda like your saying. As is the notion of "proud, old America that we have to save from Obama, cause it was just SO great back in the day". Fool, we used to have slaves I mean what the fuck? Not trying to be a dick but c'mon. You should identify with humanity not a nationality. THAT is the problem here. And I know what people will say, "HES A GLOBALIST"! No. We, the people could do it the right way. The power structure is doing it another way. Agenda 21? Still coming guys.

       I speak of America simply because I'm American.  The best way to lead is by example.  The best example to set would be to topple the most money hungry corporate war fueled puppet country in the entire world.  The state of Earth right now begs for an entire, global reform.  Not a unified one world government, but soverign, independent governments that are not run by money crazed lunatics with no idea the value of human life.

       Now your making sense to me. I can see what you mean, don't get me wrong I'm not FOR a global government I just would love to see a world WITHOUT government. Period. I respect the sentiment of your post for the record, I just don't share your patriotism. PS if hell awaits us in 2015 I'll proudly jump in but there is no such thing in my mind. Only choices.

       Haha that's awesome! Yeah I mean my life is pretty great in reality but we're still slaves. Most people have it way worse then us in the states. I hope you can unite others like you were saying in your OP. I'm trying to do the same. Let me know if there's anything  I can ever do to help you. Good luck
