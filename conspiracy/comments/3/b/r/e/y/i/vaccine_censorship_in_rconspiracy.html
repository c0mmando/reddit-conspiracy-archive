       is something new.

       I noticed something was strange in one of my posts about vaccines

       This is a mass human tragedy and these are criminals who are committing crimes against humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Senator Pan stated:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Californians have spoken, the governor and the Legislature have spoken. No more preventable contagions, no more outbreaks, no more hospitalizations, no more deaths and
        <strong>
         no more fear
        </strong>
        . SB277 is now the law.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Californians did

        speak
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hundreds of people lined the Capitol halls ahead of the Wednesday morning committee hearing, with about
        <em>
         600 opponents outnumbering roughly 100 supporters
        </em>
        , a crowd far larger than normal for even the most contentious measures.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Senator Pan, who was responsible for pushing this, has received many donations and support from
       <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/049634_Richard_Pan_vaccine_exemptions_Big_Pharma.html">
        Big Pharma
       </a>
       . But if you listen to his statement above, there's not only going to be no more outbreaks but no more
       <strong>
        fear
       </strong>
       !
      </p>
      <p>
       But here's the quote from the other supporter of this bill, Senator Allen:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “I think it’s difficult for people who are outside the Capitol to know the pressure that was applied on members of the Legislature, the difficult conversations that were had,
        <strong>
         the fear
        </strong>
        ,” Allen said.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Fear is only part of the manipulation, however.
       <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-106hhrg73042/html/CHRG-106hhrg73042.htm">
        Members of the CDC and FDA responsible for licensing and recommending vaccines are permitted to have financial stakes in those vaccines
       </a>
       . "The CDC grants conflict of interest waivers to every member of their advisory committee a year at a time, and allows full participation in the discussions leading up to a vote by every member, whether they have a financial stake in the decision or not. So they're discussing it, influencing other members possibly, whether they have a financial stake or not."
       <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/nvpo/nvac/meetings/pastmeetings/shuchat_062912.pdf">
        Meanwhile, the cost to vaccinate one child with the full US schedule recommended by the CDC increased from $70 in 1990 to $1,712 in 2012 (p.16)
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So remember, fear and money will get your bill passed, regardless of the consequences to humanity's future.

       Vaccines are sound in theory, there is zero way to argue against that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just ask smallpox how effective a vaccine is. Now the flip side is that as soon as you begin to monetize a product there is incentive to sell sell sell regardless of outcomes.

       Ironically smallpox had all but died out on it's own way before vaccinations came along. There had been a massive 90% decline in cases and it looked to be on its way out. Vaccination didn't bring it under control, vaccination was merely brought into use when it was too late and barely changed any smallpox statistics.

       The first inoculations for smallpox were just after 1800, the first real modern attempts at eradication happened just around 1950.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was trending down because people understood more about disease. Simply the fact that inoculations work should be proof that vaccines are scientifically sound.

       Just check some graphs out showing the decline of smallpox and the introduction of vaccination, you will see there is clearly no correlation and smallpox had all but died out before vaccinations even started.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccination may have eradicated it and kept it at bay for all these years but that could have well been happening of its own accord anyway looking at stats.

       But at what cost, one must wonder.  Remember the doctor who was discredited, and thrown into an insane asylum to rot for pointing out that doctors should wash their hands?  There wasn't even money involved in that circumstance, yet he was viciously attacked for going against the current mindset of the medical community.  Here we have a situation where companies are making a killing on the administration of vaccines and vaccines are adamantly supported by the vast majority of the medical community.  So you can imagine the opposition to the very idea that vaccines could be unsafe will be hounded down.

       That isn't the problem a lot of people have with them. The problem is that there is a lack of trust in how they are regulated. Ok, so polio vaccines work, but does that mean they are effective against all diseases? Does that mean companies should be trusted to make new vaccines without telling us how they are tested?

       just because a certain 'vaccine' can hopefully induce an immune response semi-effectively after someone gets a disease/infection... this doesn't mean we need to preemptively give children an alphabet of 'vaccines' to save them from the sick monster ... AND from the mountains of evidence we have seen so far these 'vaccines' are doing more harm than good IPSOFACTO if the govt is requiring that children are given these innumerable, harmful, unhelpful 'vaccines' they are NOT doing any of this in the interest of the general public/health, but SIMPLY to LINE THE POCKETS of BIG PHARMA!!! PLAIN AND SIMPLE!!!! WE SHOULD ALL BE SOOO MAD ABOUT THIS!!!!

       Hi i checked into how vaccines were tested in Canada before being used on the public. The info i found was that safety data was being submitted by the manufacturer. I personally am not against vaccines but i firmly believe that people should have a choice. I wrote an article on it. if you are interested you can find it here:

       Any links to naturalnews get automatically spam filtered sitewide on reddit. The mods here have told AutoModerator to approve any such submissions, but I'm not sure if the same works for comments or not or if AutoModerator just screwed up and didn't save it from the dustbin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stuff going into the spam filter automatically (not put there by AutoModerator) would not show up in the mod log. For example, if you look on the mod log right now, your OP here had to be approved by AutoModerator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edited - there are 2 invisible replies in this topic. I saw one had been filtered by AutoModerator (posted by a new user,
       <a href="/u/moocanada">
        /u/moocanada
       </a>
       ). Not sure if the other one is a shadowbanned user or what's up, but I didn't see it in the mod log.

       I think this speaks to the success of making the mod logs public. Without transparency, then drama can be manufactured over legitimate site-wide issues (such as the banning of natural news).
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, well done on just checking the mod log, you're spot on.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're also absolutely correct about the new user (moocanada) being filtered by the automod (account is only a few hours old).

       4 out of 5 times when a comment is "missing" it's a new user or someone linking to infowars, natural news, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, sometimes it is in fact a shadowbanned user.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder why they hide the shadowbanned user's comment, but not the fact a comment is

       Most of the time its spam. A normal user figures out pretty quick (Usually) that they have been shadow banned.

       That and mods can see and approve those posts, if you are really curious you could pm one of them and see what it was.

       This looks like a false alarm, but I did have a vaccine post censored by Mr Dong a while back. It was about the 2014 or 2015 flu vaccine being the wrong strain. He stated that he was trying to clean up the sub or some such nonsense like that.

       While I believe that pharmaceutical companies have terrible practices in terms of testing the vaccines, the concept is valid and helped eradicate some of the most deadly diseases, esp. in early infants. Then again, I'm puzzled by the recent outbreak of autism, so there must be definitely something wrong with the vaccines these days (I have also read that it's possible that males becoming fathers in their late 30s, might be the cause, it might be that the sperm is more prone to produce less genetically healthy offspring). I will still, however, vaccinate my child, though I'll make sure to avoid certain manufacturers.
