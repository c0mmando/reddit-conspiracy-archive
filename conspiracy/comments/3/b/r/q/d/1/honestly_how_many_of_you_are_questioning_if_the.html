       In regards to the ISS, visit
       <a href="http://www.isstracker.com/">
        this website
       </a>
       and go have a look for yourself. You can confirm the existence of the ISS yourself with the naked eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have binoculars you can make out the 'H' shape of it as it passes overhead.
      </p>
      <p>
       To suggest the ISS is fake, is to deny a most basic of things. You can literally see the damn thing with the naked eye!

       People have barely photographed such a H shaped structure that you mention of. You cannot see it with the naked eye. Even whatever you see is simply a dot moving across the sky, and in no way is conclusive evidence of this thing travelling across the sky at a speed of 7.66 km/s.  When you see videos from ISS no rattling is seen, it appears perfectly calm. Something is definitely wrong. But here you are Rockran always defending NASA. If you are a conspiracy theorist, you would know the extent govt agencies would go to construct elaborate lies. NASA is part of the military, they use deceptive tactics all the time. Question their motives a little more and don't simply shoot down such discussions and disallow further inquiries. You are just another govt. shill.

       Why would the ISS rattle?  It is basically in a vacuum.  There is no wind resistance.  It is traveling that fast because there is no resistance.

       Seems that word has been misplaced. I don't know a better word for it, but something travelling at 7.66 km/s cannot be as calm as they show it in videos. Whatever, I really don't care.

       To be honest though, the rattling in his shots is caused by turbulence in the atmosphere, not because the ISS is traveling at "rattling speed"

       It takes a certain mindset to ever question NASA, even here, given all the
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3a6agc/education/">
        government indoctrination we receive
       </a>
       . For some reason, this military organization is the only US government agency above suspicion. Even to those who have seen NIST's fraudulent report of the obvious controlled demolition of the 3 buildings that were destroyed on 9/11/2001, NASA represents an ideal that could never lie to us.

       It is fear that you have to get past in order to find the truth. Fear that you are being deceived, because you don't trust yourself to make the right conclusions. Fear that the truth is being poisoned, because you don't trust anyone else to make the right conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those that would control you want you trapped by your fear, instead of transcending it. The truth fears no investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Start over with no assumptions and no conclusions. Gather up all the independently reproducible evidence that you can find, but I can save you the trouble: nothing NASA has ever done is independently reproducible. Their claims of Freemasons driving electric cars on the moon almost half a century ago have still never been replicated.

       While I do still think the ISS is real, you can watch videos online of people that are supposedly in the space station that are 100% in front of a green screen.

       Well the claim in that video isn't that she's in front of a greenscreen but rather that she's in a zero-G aircraft - I think that's completely unrealistic, but I'll get to that in a sec...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The fact that her hair continually points straight up and returns to that straight, upright position forcefully every time she moves makes it seem like she's hanging upside down in front of a green screen, in a zero G environment there would be nothing "pushing" her hair up, nothing making it return to that fully upright, pulled up position. Also the spitting water everywhere thing is pretty odd.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I have slightly bushy hair and I've never left the earth's gravity, yet even so it manages to stick out a bit, under it's own strength or something. So without gravity affecting it I have no trouble believing it would basically spread out like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But beyond that she'd definitely not hanging upside down or anything - the movement of her necklace is enough to make it totally clear she's in zero (or micro) gravity... So what of the video's claim that she's in a zero-G aircraft?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know the source of the video they're excerpting here, but it looks as if it's taken from one of the many astronaut Q&amp;A sessions they do with school classes and the like. These are usually 15-30 miinute live broadcasts. They are single camera with no edit points...
      </p>
      <p>
       This would not be possible in some sort of zero-G aircraft. Those flights work by flying repeatedly in extreme parabolic arcs. It is only at the very top of this arc, when transitioning from steep climb to sharp dive that the aircraft experiences zero G. And this transition usually only last 20-25 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is impossible to simulate zero G within the gravity of the earth for any more than 30 seconds or so. So it's impossible for these videos to exist showing obvious signs of no gravity for extended periods of time without edits unless they are actually filmed in a zero G environment. Namely
       <em>
        space
       </em>
       .

       For the record I think ISS is real as I stated above. Thanks for the info though. I deleted my comment because after seeing her necklace move I too determined that the video was most likely real, but hopefully your comment can enlighten someone else.

       It is clear as day, but only if you look.  Too many people identify with "space" and don't want that illusion broken.  We have a whole childhood of space movies and sci-fi fantasy that gets taken away from us if we look.

       I think most people are downvoting him because astronomy and the study of space in general have a lot of amateurs who do it as a hobby.  It is hard for the government to fake something when a whole mass of educated people can and will go "no that's not right."

       I can see the ISS, there is no evidence we ever went to the moon or EVER left low earth orbit, in fact, it is now a "known" known that the moon landings are complete bullshit, it is so fucking sad that my fellow countrymen argue this in 2015, it makes us all look idiotic.

       I consider myself an

       I have tried to get the classified (by president LBJ) documents, in regard the moon hoax and failed, the court upheld the 2026 decision, for fuck knows reasons i, my team at the time and the lawyers appointed , can understand.

      <p>
       If you want to believe in the fantasy, then that is fine by me, i wouldn't want to shatter a children's fantasy that santa claus or the tooth fairy don't exist either.

       Idiotic question, this is no different to me, asking you what evidence you would need that Santa Claus is real and climbs down chimneys.

       That is the state of play, the moon landing hoax can be considered in the same realm as any mythical figure or folkloric story.

       So I take it your answer to my question is a no. So there's nothing that will convince you otherwise.

      <p>
       Well i'd say that some fantastic evidence for santa claus would be what you just described. If someone can climb down my chimney i'll be absolutely stunned (It's quite narrow). Alternatively, a reindeer drawn flying sled, santas workshop - Those would also be acceptable evidence.

       , he seems to regurgitate popular  points (Moondust behaviour, exhaust plumes, waving flag, shadows, astronaut movement and so on)
      </p>
      <p>
       So i'm not particularly sure what's special about this guy. Although his views on 9/11 are... A bit strange. Mini nukes and no planes? :/

       No need to bring up other topics - this is about the moon and ISS.  Do you honestly think NASA is capable of getting to the moon but dumb enough to lose all of the records and telemetry data from the trip?  How do you explain the massive amount of photos taken, which amounts to something like a photo every 55 seconds, in an era before the digital camera?  You brought up the lack of moondust on lander, flag waving, shadows, and the astronauts moving at exactly half speed - these are all corroborating points too.

       First, you need to remove from your mind the hollywood image of a space craft touching down, smoke and debris billowing everywhere and a massive jet fire scorching the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is much more mundane. Check out

       - Those three prongs extending from the base of the legs are sensors. When the prongs touch the ground when they're landing, the astronauts turned off the engines before the pads made contact with the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the engine wasn't running when they landed. Plus, any dust that may have still gotten blown away would've been blown AWAY. Not onto the shuttle.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not wind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The flags aren't like your usual flag on Earth which is just a pole and the flag just kinda hangs there looking miserable, the flag on the moon had a horizontal beam protruding from the top to make the flag always appear visible.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the astronauts were setting it up, they were obviously moving it about to set it upright. This imparted motion onto the flag. The astronauts released the flag and it kept moving because it still had some 'wiggle' to it. The same things happens on Earth, just that it's a lot quicker. You touch a flag, it'll move.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        shadows
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Shadows change direction if the object they're on changes shape. Look at the shadows on a flight of stairs and you'll see the shadow going back and forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2nd part to the shadows argument is that anything in shadow on the moon should've been pitch black, so it's a good thing the moons surface, being a greyish kinda colour, can still reflect some light.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        astronauts moving at exactly half speed
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Changing the speed doesn't account for the behaviour of low gravity or a vacuum - That being: Jumping higher, objects falling at the same rate,  the parabolic arc of moon dust... Adjusting speed can't fix that.

       Their EVA was 2 1/2 hours. So at 1 photo every 55 seconds that's 164 photos - Am I correct so far?
      </p>
      <p>
       They could just spam the shutter and do a photo every second, but that's silly. If they walked around taking  1 photo every 20s,  that's about 55 minutes to take 164 photos. I do hope my math is correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if they dedicated 55 minutes to taking photos, they'd have the remaining time to walk around and do other stuff. HOWEVER!
      </p>
      <p>
       There were two of them, if they BOTH dedicated time to taking photos, they'd have to dedicate 27.5 minutes to photo taking at a rate of 1 every 20 seconds
       <em>
        EACH
       </em>
       (Which isn't
       <em>
        that

       unrealistic, they could take 5 in succession, then spend a minute moving around to take another)
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       tl;dr Two guys taking 164 photos during an EVA of 2 1/2 minutes isn't particularly unrealistic. Also realise that 55 photos a minute assumes one camera. If there's two it becomes 1 photo every 110 seconds for each person.

       NASA is a public front and is actively hiding information about alien life.  The real space technology is very advanced and hidden in very secret compartments of the military.  We did go to the moon the first time but later trips were faked as to not reveal that we are not welcome there.  Sources for these claims exist and I believe they are true but it doesn't mean they are.

       tl;dr Two guys taking 164 photos during an EVA of 2 1/2 minutes isn't particularly unrealistic. Also realise that 55 photos a minute assumes one camera. If there's two it becomes 1 photo every 110 seconds for each person.

       Plenty of time.

       First, you need to remove from your mind the hollywood image of a space craft touching down, smoke and debris billowing everywhere and a massive jet fire scorching the ground.

       The reality is much more mundane. Check out

       - Those three prongs extending from the base of the legs are sensors. When the prongs touch the ground when they're landing, the astronauts turned off the engines before the pads made contact with the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the engine wasn't running when they landed. Plus, any dust that may have still gotten blown away would've been blown AWAY. Not onto the shuttle.

       The flags aren't like your usual flag on Earth which is just a pole and the flag just kinda hangs there looking miserable, the flag on the moon had a horizontal beam protruding from the top to make the flag always appear visible.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the astronauts were setting it up, they were obviously moving it about to set it upright. This imparted motion onto the flag. The astronauts released the flag and it kept moving because it still had some 'wiggle' to it. The same things happens on Earth, just that it's a lot quicker. You touch a flag, it'll move.

        shadows

      <p>
       Shadows change direction if the object they're on changes shape. Look at the shadows on a flight of stairs and you'll see the shadow going back and forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2nd part to the shadows argument is that anything in shadow on the moon should've been pitch black, so it's a good thing the moons surface, being a greyish kinda colour, can still reflect some light.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Changing the speed doesn't account for the behaviour of low gravity or a vacuum - That being: Jumping higher, objects falling at the same rate,  the parabolic arc of moon dust... Adjusting speed can't fix that.
