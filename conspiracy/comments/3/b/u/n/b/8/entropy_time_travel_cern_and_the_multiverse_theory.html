       (Tldr; really thinking a lot about science right now, don't bother reading if your gonna judge open mindness or different ideas.) Murphy's Law; gravity is always pulling us down; the problem of evil. How do we escape these metaphysical obstacles to our transcendence? Is that what we're supposed to do? Transcend our current nature? I have seen enough evidence to know that time travel is relatively possible and has likely been done by the United States government and by non-state actors. This would certainly change the game. If time travel is possible then it is logical to deduce that you could also travel to parallel or alternate universes as well; hence the multi-verse theory. If you have ever seen the Buttefly Effect you know what I am talking about. You can feel it right now, every little decision you make causes ripples through time-space. Your thoughts too.. You guys should all make sure you understand CERN as best as possible. What they are doing right now in that backwoods, Swiss village is gonna change the fabric of reality. I love that they have a representation of Shiva outside their complex; it's so poetic. You see Shiva is destruction. The God of destruction, in Hinduism. Brahma (the creator) gives life to Vishnu (the physical universe) only to be destroyed by Shiva (destruction). The three great spirits continue this cycle for eternity. Their were 5 ages in each cycle; the first age was very long and very nice, a golden age; the second age was pretty long and introduced evil info the mix, creating conflict; the third and fourth ages get pretty nasty with evil slowly taking ahold of good; the fifth and final age is short, brutal, and magnificet. Everything goes up in a bang. You know it as the Apocolypse, Helter Skelter, Ragnarok, or maybe the day Hilary Clinton gets elected president. Entropy. I think that TPTB are trying to stop this cycle, or at least postpone it; possibly never informing us of its physical manifestations until the final moment. My feeling is, don't fight it; let go, let nature run its course. She will decide what is best. If we make it through this, we make it through, if we don't, we don't. Its better to have loved and lost then to have never loved at all. Alan Watts once said through an old guru, "there is good with a little g, and there is bad with a little b, and together they both make up Good with a capital g."

       Just time-travel existing would change the nature of reality. Causality no longer applies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe time-travel exists, FWIW -- mostly because I don't believe Time exists. You can't go back in time 10 minutes without rearranging the state of the universe back to what it was 10 minutes ago. Time-travel forward is kinda possible, but we'd call it cryogenics -- or, I suppose, AI pretty soon (dump your brain-state into a dormant neural network and wait a few thousand years before firing it up).

       Tis an interesting concept, time not existing. We dont see mammals running around worrying about what time it is. Time is very much so a man made thing. What would it be to live without the stress of time.

       The way I see it, time is just a benchmark of motion, of change. (Remove all motion and you could say "time has stopped".) It's really inconvenient to compare each motion to every other motion. Much easier to agree upon a benchmark, call it "time", and compare everything to that.

       Can you explain? That can mean... "Soon, there will be zero motion or change." or "Soon, everything will be so automated, we won't need to work at shitty jobs, so people won't care so much about time." or .... something else?

       OP should first be learning about science, instead of thinking about it and he is using science and open mindness together so I'm gonna judge it. Because if we don't protect science from open mindness it becomes a religion(open mindness is a great way to reach a scientific conclusion, but the last stap must be scientific)
      </p>
      <p>
       What is time? time is that we know the position of a particle in space(you can't say, there is a particle here but don't know when). but there is a catch, if you know the time then you
       <strong>
        can not
       </strong>
       know it's heading ak momentum
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">
        heisneberg's UP
       </a>
       . This means that on the smallest level you can not even predict the future. so imagine going backwards in time then again we can't predict what happens with the particles
      </p>
      <p>
       this could be multy verse but it doesn't have to, I personely don't support the multy verse theory, it has a big energy problem

       Live your life like there is no afterlife etc. It is the only time you get to do it and in doing so, will make everything more precious.And I'm not talking about shit you can buy, but about life and the life of others, the planet you live on.Have respect to otherlife forms because it's also their once in a lifetime, time to be alive

       traveling forwards is easy, just stand on a ladder ;), going backwards well your best bet is instantly transforming yourself into antimatter, hoping you survived that(very unlikely :)))) then hoping anti matter goes backwards in time, like Feynman told us relative to ours, hoping that you survive that (lol). So I'm saying its not possible(btw does gravity push antimatter away? something to thinkabout)

       I applaud your ability to dissect one's rant. Bravo, Mr. Scientsist. However, all I see here is sarcasm and a hypothetical degree in science? You didn't really explain much about anything.. And if you can't see how the things that I brought are connected then you should just move on. most of what I am saying is just opinion, and I am giving off that vibe. This is a place to learn and talk about ideas, not put others down because they aren't an expert. So, again thank you for you wisdom.

       when time goes up entropy will stay the same or go up. it never goes down. In other words entropy decides the direction of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is even a possability that if you could go backwards in time it is still going forwards because entropy must go up
      </p>
      <p>
       just an other example: if you put 20 black marbles and 20 white ones in a box, they start out all nice and orderly the backs together (sounds racist) and the whites together (must also sound racist then :?)  now you shake the box with a clockwise motion. and all the marbles are mixed, this mean that the entropy has gone up. If you would do the exact opposite to try to get the black and whites separate again you would not succeed they would stay mixed. entropy can not go down
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: very big side note if the universe is endless(time) and you would try it eternally you would one day have the marbles sorted again

       Ah ha! I like your description (visual leaner here). Your alluding to the multiverse theory; where each decision we make, each left turn as opposed to a right turn has a different outcome. Do you think that all outcomes, all possibilities are explored? Tell me more about entropy, I am very interested.

       well I have a problem with multi verse and that is that it is an ever dividing system, and that system doesn't run out of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       quantum mechanics(QM) tell us that energy is quantum , that means you can't divide it at a certain point. but the multi verse theory states that you can divide energy indefiantly , by dividing the universe every time something happens. this is how they "solve"the problem of the wave to particle jump in QM

       I tend to think that the holographic universe is more realistic and way more interesting

       entropy is like possibilities, the universe wants more possibilities to do things so it arranges the particles so that more options arise. Or time always flows towards more possibilities

       some more entropy, it is always seen on a big timescale and region, the forming of crystals is turning entropy backwards but on the large it goes up
      </p>
      <p>
       and it could be that at the end of time entropy turns backwards and everything starts over again and again and again , we don't know

       Sounds like we're all singing the same tune, at the end of the day. We'll all wind up in the same place, brother. I have to laugh at the simulation prospect though; I mean it's possible, but how crazy would that be? What part of me exists outside of this temporal physicality? Kinda like your saying, we'll have to wait to find out.

       I am bringing up a lot of things and questioning quite a few things if you were to check my profile or whatever, I just started doing this whole keyboard warrior thing; I'm new too it. I don't think we're coming from the same place; you clearly have a love and a knowledge base in science. I am interested but have many questions and have not honestly spent enough time really understanding the scope of our civilization's achievements. Maybe I'm small minded for believing it's possible many of them could have been faked or fabricated. I just don't think you should leave the spiritual side out of this conundrum; whether there is a reality to it or not, it has had a major effect on our psyche as a species.

       Also, excuse me for not being a particle physics major, but i do know that even the people working at CERN don't know what the consequences of what they are doing could yield. Major names that Im sure you'll recognize like Stephen Hawking and Neil DeGrasse Tyson have expressed genuine fear that CERN, and other LHCs now built and being built all over the place, could eventually lead to the destruction of Earth; hence Shiva. Oh wait though, that's a religous story so it has no significance even though the intelligent, free-will possessing scientists at CERN decided it was what they wanted on their doorstep.

       not those 2 and not Mayor names, a hand full where afraid for the possibility of black holes. But these blackholes are so tiny, much much smaller then the particles(quarks electrons) that the chance it would encounter a particle, would be like once every total time of the universe.

       I...think I agree. Murphy's Law isn't an established scientific theory though.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're all time travelers no matter what, but so far we only go in one direction at a fairly uniform rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know the CERN thing gets some peoples' hackles raised here but every time I look at some kind of panicky article over it all I see is nonsense. They're ostensibly smashing atoms to get a better glimpse into the nature of physical creation; Shiva is relevant even without some kind of end of the world story behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, my dad has a Shiva decoration in the basement. Is it because he has destructive and arcane plans for the world? No, it's because he's a fucking packrat and probably thought it looked cool. Sometimes a statue is just a statue.

       Interssting perspective. I know it's possible that there isn't anything nefarious to it on a human level; just like I know it's possible that there is. This discussion was intended to hash some things out and I feel better about things after getting to talk them out. I'm not a doom and gloom conspiracy theorist, I'm an objective person who looks at every possible angle. Thank you

       My thoughts instantly go to that photo from the 30's with a large crowd present. Within the crowd there is a man wearing modern clothes and very modern sunglasses. With all the alien tech our govt has been able to reverse engineer I have little to no doubt time travel is possible or almost so. Im going to look into CERN now. Great post OP.

       Edit: if anyone knows what photo im talking about please post it. Ive searched for about 20 mins now and cannot find it.
