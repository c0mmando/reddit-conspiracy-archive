    <div class="md"><p>I believe you would need a very large audience, have unfiltered content kept in hiding until released to the masses.  i.e. A journalist with a breaking story about gov something that puts folks in a very hot seat via whistleblower or insider. You would also need to be somewhat squeaky clean and not discreditable and your blower needs to be unknown for a while.  </p>

<p>This would piss a lot of people off.  Like a Hastings, Greenwald or Webb.  Or maybe even a Ruppert.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well.  That&#39;s a good question.  Part of me believes he was just coked out and drove into a tree.  But, there is always a but and after further education on Hastings here are my thoughts.  </p>

<p>Considering his comments on two Senators who almost broke the rules of classified info means there is something here, in this info that May shed some light as to where his info comes from that the admin didn&#39;t like and that probably put him in his grave, given a conspiracy was involved.  </p>

<p>When writing about leaked investigations where people are allowed to investigate themselves is damaging.  (Holder/AP Spying). Especially when he then turns and says that it&#39;s in regard to two democratic senators that the admin is probably investigating via the DOJ/FBI for a leak.  Then he states that ties between military defense industry and regular local or federal authorities is the hardest hit of journalistic investigations it shows where we are going next.  The only problem is he is gone.  </p>

<p>Can someone pickup where he left off?  I believe his whistleblower was actually a senator.  Maybe Mark Udall or Ron Wyden?  Or maybe a staffer because they&#39;ve played this game and wouldn&#39;t touch Hastings as it&#39;s too close, unless they had some encrypted drop.  I think person to person is probably the only way.  Look to Hastings personal travel records and if he went to Co or Or and you&#39;ll have answers.  </p>

<p>Then showing the HB Gary incident and Barrett Brown after Greenwald, giving him more credibility makes you wonder doesn&#39;t it.  A lot, and I mean a lot of people were pissed at this.  I think Hastings was probably involved in the Snowden thing possibly.  </p>

<p>For those who say it&#39;s impossible for a controlled drive and explosion I&#39;d ask them to read about the technologies currently given out (info) as deployed and then add 20-40 years in development to that thought.  </p>

<p>How many times have we heard the CIA/NSA are light years ahead of existing technologies even from them?  </p>

<p>Plenty of times.  </p>

<p>I mean, he was investigating the NSA and CIA two agencies that don&#39;t appreciate their secrets getting out.  Given his high status in journalism I think he probably had a whistleblower or two in his pocket (Senators above) His recent writings did hint that he did have more info which leads me to believe he was probably under surveillance which is normal if it&#39;s a state secret and classified.  He also become an enemy of the state at that point also and becomes a target for lots of people and for lots of different reasons.  </p>

<p>So, my guess was that he was probably known to be using and the powers that be took advantage of this knowledge in some way, shape or form.  The first thing you do when trying to cut something off is to look for a weakness to exploit.  They found it and exploited it.  Unfortunately, he was an easy target if that&#39;s what happened.  Considering all the other stuff that&#39;s come out before and after his death (secrets) I&#39;m going to go with the later of my opinions on this one. </p>

<p>If he was under FBI investigation like he told Wiki Leaks attorneys then he most likely was under surveillance, which means the FBI May have answers in their files about other nefarious things they may have observed when looking at him.  So FOIA on his case at the FBI?  Doubt they&#39;d even say they were doing so.  </p>

<p>Sorry it&#39;s jumbled.  Just my basic observations.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Crazy to think he was headed for Israeli consulate.  Keep looking at messages.  See images of dash cam location and location of daylight photos, etc.  That corner looks completely different.  Considering they come up with two spots for crash, death, etc. gets interesting even more.  The locations change quite a bit in day vs. night pics.  I guess they forgot about street signs, advertising, etc.  Like a layer went missing.  lol   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A buddy and I went to the Bahamas a few years back with our wives.  Prince Henry was there on the same small island.  My friend had an interesting conversation with one of the other passengers on the small plane we flew in on (Like 10-12 people).</p>

<p>One of the guys told him that he was doing security that weekend, but that he was not on the clock for a few days.  We went lobster diving with them, then conch, then drank into the wee hours with our wives and these guys with their girlfriends.</p>

<p>About 3am they were all passing out and throwing up (shots of Jack Daniels) my buddy comes into the front room with a backpack on and a huge handgun with silencer.  He&#39;s all drunk waving it around and joking and stuff.  About 30 seconds into his drunken idiotic dance once of the guys grabs him from behind in some ninja move and flips him on his back all while disarming him and has the gun in his face in like two seconds.  Pulls the slide back and has his hand on the trigger.  Some Jason Borne shit.    </p>

<p>A bunch of shit fell out of his backpack, but he gathered it up real fast like he was more interested in the belongings that the fact that my buddy had recovered a handgun with a silencer from their pile of stuff by the font door.  </p>

<p>Anyway, they sat us down and told us that they were there on a security assignment and because of my buddy&#39;s conversation (about guns of course) they had been redirected to hang with us and observe to make sure we weren&#39;t a threat (like assassins or something).  They flipped our rental house, took our passports and told us we could pick them up at the airport the day after the prince left.  </p>

<p>We cleaned up because the person renting the house to us had to come the next day to fix the water pump which wasn&#39;t working after a storm that night.  I saw the corner of a small piece of paper sticking out from under the couch and grabbed it.  It had a map of the island with several names, addresses and phone numbers and at the bottom said classified, etc.  Stapled to it were pics of all four of us.  Some scary shit.  </p>

<p>When the owner of the house showed up he asked if we had fun the night before.  We said yeah, but didn&#39;t tell him what happened.  When he got in his truck to leave he honked and said as he leaned out the window, stay away from Prince Henry and drove off.  </p>

<p>WTF.  I&#39;m not sure how many times I have left to play roulette.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  It seemed so.  Even the guy renting the place disappeared.  I can&#39;t even find the house online anymore, his name, nothing.  Our luggage ended up &quot;lost&quot;. All of ours on two different flights, but no one elses.  The other weird thing was a bunch if tridents all over the house.  Pics, statues, boats name, etc.  We also ate at a outdoor restaurant on a neighboring island.  When we sat down it was empty.  When we left we were surrounded by men, no women, 5.11 tactical pants, on every one of them.  Talk about subtle.  On the flight bak my buddy was moved to another seat like before, struck up convo with his seat buddy and wife who got in different vehicles when we left via the turnaround at at airport.  They had different drivers.  For a married couple it&#39;s weird.  That&#39;s all.   </p>
