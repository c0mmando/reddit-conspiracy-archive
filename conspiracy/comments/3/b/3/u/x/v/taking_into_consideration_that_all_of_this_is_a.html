<p>I see talk about what it would take to fight back. I see talk of a revolution of sorts. </p>

<p>However. </p>

<p>What about the possibility that people are purposely being manipulated and kicked around in order to be DRIVEN to either fight against each other or the government? That would mean it&#39;s &quot;all part of the plan&quot; and whoever is orchestrating it feels like they already know how it will turn out. </p>

<p>Is the point of all this to completely take advantage of the people because TPTB knows no one will or can do anything?</p>

<p>Or is the public purposely being coerced into doing something violent and stupid? </p>

<p>Or both?</p>

<p>Is this all part of the script? Or is this period of time genuine and happening completely organically and people are tired of it?</p>

<p>It gets confusing.</p>

<p>Not sure if that makes sense at all, but definitely on my mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I buy it too. If there&#39;s anything nefarious about Jade Helm, it could be this -- 1,000 troops (if it&#39;s really 1,000 troops) can&#39;t do that much damage, unless they&#39;re taking out a few targeted people or making them &quot;disappear,&quot; one by one. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m also hearing repeatedly that the rank &amp; file military may actually be our best bet for not having this happen. I&#39;ve spoken with numerous retired military and a couple enlisted guys who are well aware that 9/11 was a conspiracy of several nation&#39;s intelligence services, and there are apparently at least some &quot;white hat&quot; types pushing against the....whatever it is.  Though, again, they only need 1,000 true believers, I guess, for Jade Helm. </p>

<p>We shall see. There are exciting times and I would rather be awake and aware then drifting along like a zombie with a vague sense of unease at best and oblivious idiocy at worse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it is as simple as just one script that is followed to the letter.  They do things with intended consequences in mind, but likely plan for a range of responses.  They can &#39;call an audible&#39; at any time.  Weak false flags like the recent Dallas shooting are allowed to fade from memory.  Ones that are pulled off better and seem to be working to get the intended reaction can be focused on by the media.  </p>

<p>With the funding of things like the Baltimore riots it appears that they are attempting to incite violent reaction in order to justify a crackdown.  Agent provocateurs are a standard strategy and have been used for a long time. </p>

<p>Tough to know exactly what is going on.  I think it is important to inform as many people as possible as well as disconnecting from the system at large as much as possible.  If we are entirely reliant on them for survival then they have us in a bad spot.</p>

<p>But a lot of people see the misdirection with the SC shootings and TPP. Not that they think the shootings were staged, but that the Govt. took advantage of a tragedy to fuck us over. And that&#39;s not good for them either....chipping away, chipping away, at their credibility. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have really been ramping up efforts to squash discourse over all of their false flags. The last week and a half have shown propaganda at a new high.</p>

<p>Boston was clearly a drill gone live. The guy who lit off the firecracker was bald and he got a big red burn mark on the side of his head. I hope to run into him on the street one day. I love America and fucking hate treasonous traitors like him. </p>

<p>An agent from behind the finish line ran carrying a big white box to where the actors were and placed the PRE-blown-up backpack on the scene. Funny thing is the FBI photo shows a pristine-looking pre-blown-up backpack (no blood or filth) while in videos you can clearly see fake blood and filth all over the pre-blown-up backpack placed on the scene.</p>

<p>What, did the FBI send it to the dry cleaners before they photographed it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive thought alot about this too.  It could be that they are convincing the average person that these events are genuine, while the more skeptical person will question the events.  Thats what i think i still believe.  </p>

<p>I honestly dont know what to believe anymore.  I cant watch the news anymore because i question everything.  I tend to hold my judgement on anything that i cannot experience myself or have concrete evidence of.  </p>

<p>That being said ive thought about this.  They could be leaving a few bits and pieces for us to pick up on to question these events.  And once the truth comes out about something there will be mass unrest.  If you think about the truth coming out about &quot;magic day&quot;  or whatever you want to call any event including 911... there would be mass hysteria followed by a revolution.  </p>

<p>At the same time they could be inciting conspiracies by purposely giving out false information indicating a conspiracy.  Now that its illegal to question the gov in this country, anyone who questions is potentially a target.  But this would suggest that they have been doing this since JFk and beyond.  </p>

<p>I was talking with my GF yesterday about the recent shooting.  I was mentioning MKultra.  We started talking about how we could all be mind controlled already.  Everything we look at on the internet, and everything we are doing in our lives could be a product of manipulation thats been going on for years from every media source.  </p>

<p>Sorry if this doesnt make much sense either.  Just wanted to get some of this out of my head too and i thought it was relevant... </p>

The real simple way of dealing with this is to just start <a href="http://www.commonwealths.org/divestment">divesting</a> from the system little by little and <a href="http://www.commonwealths.org/global-divestment-day-divest-your-central-government">drawing peoples attention</a> to your actions toward that end.. When they see what you are doing it helps people feel empowered to make changes as well.</p>

<p>We have to act civilly about this, when the come in heavy its going to look really bad on their part around the world and they will be seen as the aggressors not us. We have to let them destroy themselves. as more and more people see what is going on in the world it will draw people together </p>

<p>Do I know what&#39;s going to happen, if anything? No.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats why you dont want to do that.
The real simple way of dealing with this is to just start <a href="http://www.commonwealths.org/divestment">divesting</a> from the system little by little and <a href="http://www.commonwealths.org/global-divestment-day-divest-your-central-government">drawing peoples attention</a> to your actions toward that end.. When they see what you are doing it helps people feel empowered to make changes as well.</p>

<p>We have to act civilly about this, when the come in heavy its going to look really bad on their part around the world and they will be seen as the aggressors not us. We have to let them destroy themselves. as more and more people see what is going on in the world it will draw people together </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Oh. Cool.&quot;</p>

<p>Let me clarify. I mentioned Jade Helm in the body of my post, because it&#39;s a hot topic. And something we should at least be keeping an eye on. Definitely interesting.</p>

<p>Do I know what&#39;s going to happen, if anything? No.</p>

<p>There wouldn&#39;t be the focus on drills as much if similar drills were not occurring on, oh I don&#39;t, know....events like 9/11, the London bombing, etc.</p>
