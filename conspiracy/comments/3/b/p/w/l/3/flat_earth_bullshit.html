       It's kind of suspicious that these flat earthers all popped out of nowhere and started bombarding every single conspiracy forum only recently. New cointel pro tactic? Maybe they are trying to decipher what exactly "convinces" a conspiracy minded individual to blindly believe in whatever theory. We all know that these types of forums are littered with disinfo to derail/confuse/distract people from real issues. Maybe they wan't to create the perfect concoction of pseudo-science bullshit and fabricated statistics to see who will blindly follow. They can then set up or use the same tactics to further lead the conspiracy community astray. Who else thinks this is a psy-op?
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I have only vaguely skimmed through the flat earth stuff so Im not some authority on debunking it... but holy shitttttt it sounds retarded. I imagine that alot of people who come to r/conspiracy are automatically turned off when they see dumb shit about flat fucking earth.

       So, you allow topmindsofreddit to decide what is true or what should be discussed?  I'm sure you can see the problem with that.  If we allow ridicule to limit the bounds of our discussion then we have lost.

       From your post history it appears that you are a person who has accepted the narrative that flat earth theory is only around to discredit "legitimate conspiracies", but have you actually looked for yourself?  Do you trust your own logic and reasoning enough to think through it?  It you dismiss it and deride it without considering it properly, what does that make you?

       Please show where I am deriding someone who has considered the evidence.  I'm merely trying to provide a counter point to the people who are saying it is silly and don't look.  Read what they are saying.  What is the substance of their arguments?  It is not debating points of evidence, it is just a theory that flat earth theory is here to discredit.  It's scaring people away from looking.  Do you think that is an approach that leads to the truth?

        <p>
         Why have a conspiracy to make people believe the earth is round?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         NASA does some questionable things, but to say every picture they release....of the Sun, distant planets, etc. is doctored and fake is ridiculous and unrealistic.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mars rover fake? Why isn't mars flat? Are those pictures fake? What about the thousands of scientists who designed and are maintaining it? And the comet Philae lander? All just fake?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Pictures taken from space that make the earth look round are not fish eye lenses. This is the stupidest supporting argument they make. It looks round
         <em>
          because it is fucking round
         </em>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Physics and mathematics (stuff you don't care about, because its probably fake or a conspiracy) absolutely refutes flat earth. Ask any professor or scientist if the earth is round.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Basic observation while on the ocean demonstrates the roundness of the earth. You can see things appear and disappear below the "horizon" as you move closer or farther.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Ancient scientists realized the earth was round, and they lived in the desert. They did a study in which a shadow cast by a stone pillar in one city was shorter than a shadow cast by another in a city over 200 miles away. (So imagine 2 upright sticks on a FLAT piece of paper and shining a light over it. Their shadows will look identical. Now BEND the paper and voila, one stick has a longer shadow because the angle from the light source has changed. This is unbelievably basic observation folks.)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       If you aren't a disinfo agent and legitimately mindfucked by flat earth theory, just stop. People get aggressive and angry with you not because you have a point. You are literally just wrong, ridiculously wrong. Like saying 3+3 actually equals 9, not 6.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are definitely theories worth believing, and I'm not saying this one isn't worth researching. It's just after you do you realize every flat earther is just an ignorant moron.

       I'm curious what you will say about the actual arguments that flatearthers make. It's much more interesting to see your response to these than to see you make up strawmen and then smack them down... anyone can do that and it.

         Nobody said it has to be a huge conspiracy to make people believe it. The conspiracy is in the scientific community that has an issue with things that could be different than the idea they've held for an extremely long time.

         to be fake, the claim is about earth, not the other planets. Earth is a special frame of reference. You'd be surprised how many 'pictures' are actually renders as well. Even if this isn't totally on board.  Some of the conspiracy world somehow thinks that there are hundreds and thousands of people who are 'in on' 9/11 and Sandy hook. That is much less believable that all of them are keeping quiet and not blowing the whole cover.

         Nobody with any sense says they are all fish eye lens. It's about perspective, circular (not fish eye) all lense are circular. I'm not going to get extremely indepth because I don't have an hour to write on this 1 point, but the way vision works the way the horizon always ends in a singlar point, things above you on the horizon always look like they are going down into the horizon, below goes up... left right right left etc... It's a bit complex but rest assured it's not your strawman theory of "fish eyed lens lelelele"

         This is only true if you use the math involved with the distances and orientations of the common held beliefs. If you shrink the sun by a huge magnitude and you move it much closer to the earth, and you understand the 'plane' of earth is also moving... all the math works out perfectly fine.  For example, use gravity as an example... the math of gravity seems to work with 9.8m/s
         <sup>
          <sup>
           2.
          </sup>
         </sup>
         That's great, but the math also works
         <em>
          perfectly
         </em>
         if gravity on earth didn't exist, and the earth was moving upward at 9.8m/s. That is 2 situations, the math works with both.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This is just wrong actually, If you look at "gravity" as you will, or you look at the movement, it's not hard to understand that on vast distances, the movement or 'gravity' of the earth would cause this to happen since the earth ends up moving into the path of the light, which means the bottom most parts of a very distant object, the light from those parts never makes it to your eye, it is blocked by the earth moving upward, the long the distance, the more time the earth moving can block out the bottom light reflected. Furthermore, when you aren't talking about vast distances, if you want to talk about distances of say, 1 mile where the earth isn't moving fast enough to block the light.

       This has been shown a number of times by a number of different people. The first investigation was carried out by Samuel Birley Rowbotham (1816-1884), the president of the Flat Earth Society, in the summer of 1838. He waded into the river and used a telescope held eight inches above the water to watch a boat with a five-foot mast row slowly away from him. He reported that the vessel remained constantly in his view for the full six miles to Welney bridge, whereas, had the water surface been curved with the accepted circumference of a spherical earth, the top of the mast should have been some eleven feet below his line of sight.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to round earth, 1 mile away the earth should drop 8 inches, and this will be exponential, so at 2 miles it should be 32, 3 6 feet, 4 10 feet, 5 16 feet, and 6 24 feet. As you can see, the experiment would be impossible without the flat earth math.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly #7... This is easy, and explained entirely if you shrink the sun to a smaller size and move it closer to earth, all the math works out perfectly fine and all the shadows work as well.

       I fully realize that you are a troll of some sort and I am wasting my time, but what the hell. According to what you wrote, the curvature of the earth is 8 inches per mile at a distance of one mile (which is accurate), and 16 inches per mile at a distance of 2 miles (which is not).

       So you are saying you don't understand how to figure out the curvature of a sphere... but you somehow think the math.... that you don't know.... is wrong. I'll give you a hint... it's not wrong :)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to assume that you honestly don't understand this, although it's a pretty easy concept. Your problem seems to be you don't understand curvature or exponential.
      </p>
      <p>
       You accept the obvious that at a distance of 1 mile the curvature of a 25,000 mile sphere drops by 8 inches. Yet you then think that you can alter it by the second mile by claiming a "per mile" state, which you cannot do. That makes no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       It still works like this ...from point A to mile 1 is still 8 inch drop, from mile 1 to mile 2 is 24 inches, which means from point A to mile 2 is 32 inches. etc etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       If you still can't understand that, then you probably should just forget about it and understand that since you accept 8 inches for the first mile, all you need to do for the rest is
      </p>
      <p>
       mile = m
      </p>
      <p>
       m
       <sup>
        <sup>
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
        </sup>
       </sup>
       x 8 / 12 = curvature in feet
      </p>
      <p>
       So... example..
      </p>
      <p>
       10 miles
      </p>
      <p>
       10
       <sup>
        <sup>
         2
        </sup>
       </sup>
       x 8 / 12 = 66 feet
      </p>
      <p>
       here we'll even do the one you seem to think is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       2
       <sup>
        <sup>
         2
        </sup>
       </sup>
       x 8 = 32 inches we do not do the  division by 12 here because we dont want to convert to feet, we leave it in inches.

       It's not 'my math' dummy. It's the math that everyone uses. I showed the proper math, math doesn't lie, so please correctly show the drop curvature cause I think at this point you are talking straight out your ass and simply linking stuff you don't understand.

       You've actually proven it perfectly, by linking an article that is flat out wrong.

       The curvature of a sphere cannot be anything even close to "X per 1 Mile" that is physically impossible. Do you not understand how stupid that is? Just think about it... honestly just give it even a slight thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       If what you are claiming were true. At 1000 miles, the curvature of the earth would only drop around 600 feet. 1000 miles.... 600 feet.... You getting how silly that is?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a physical impossibility for it to be anything other than exponentially greater per 1 mile you gain. I honestly... I can't even believe I have to explain this extraordinarily basic geometry to you..

       People like you have been polluting this sub with this shit for a few weeks now. All you say is "Show me this, show me that!" And when we do you scream "It's fake!" or "That's a lie!" It's been proven for a VERY along time that the earth is not flat. The burden of proof to prove it isn't is on you. If you cant fucking put the time in to research it yourself and come up with a knowledgable reply on the topic then don't fucking comment on it. You're wasting everyone's time. It's really easy to just say everything is fake. Come up with something concrete when it comes to your flat earth theory, then we can talk.

       There is no motive.  There is no proof.  The theory is useless.  It provides no revelations or understanding about science, the new world order or anything else.  It's just a pointless exercise in stupid.  The only thing it does is discredit conspiracies and truth seekers in general.  That is it's only purpose.  If that is not your goal you will spend your time in more productive ways.  If you continue to champion the cause of flat earth we'll know you are a disinfo agent and/or a troll.

       Niburu and Nancy Leider are CIA/NASA disinfo, likely intended to prep us for a fake alien invasion.  I urge you not to group flat earth with that without properly investigating it.  If you actually look, rather than starting with the conclusion and ignoring it, then you will be exposed to some problems with the spherical model.

       Oh yeah? Because this is what you have to say about your own beloved flat earth theory, in this very same thread:

         From your post history it appears that you are a person who has accepted the narrative that flat earth theory is only around to discredit "legitimate conspiracies", but have you actually looked for yourself? Do you trust your own logic and reasoning enough to think through it? It you dismiss it and deride it without considering it properly, what does that make you?

        A real objective look at the subject exposes the fact that dinosaurs never existed. Not the big fantastical kinds anyway. There are no real skeletons available for you to look at, everything on display is just imitation casts. They will tell you that themselves. Next time you are in a museum with a dinosaur exhibit, see if you can find any actual skeletons of animals that aren't similar to things we have now, or very small.

        This has nothing to do with religious belief. It is a very interesting subject to explore.

       Please explain what you are trying to say.  I called out Nancy Leider because she is disinfo.  I don't want it grouped with flat earth because they are entirely different topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have read quite a bit of Nancy Leider.  I fell down the whole aliens rabbithole for a couple of months.  Some fascinating stories, a mammoth effort goes into producing all that material.  But after spending enough time there I came to the conclusion that it was all bs.  Rockefeller money is behind the disclosure project.  There is technology that the public does not have access to, but it is not from aliens from outer space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat earth is different.  If you spend less than 10 hours on the topic you do yourself a disservice.  If you actually look, but find the arguments lacking, that is one thing.  But if you never look, and strongly promote the conclusion that it is bs, don't you think that is a problem?

       Except the type of evidence for the two is completely different.  The convincing case for aliens is the enormous bulk of material over the years.  Newspaper stories from 100 years ago, convincing stories from many people.  The reason to believe it is the size of the conspiracy required to fake it.  If you have thought about aliens enough, in order to reject it, you must concede that there is a large, long term conspiracy in existence to produce the material.  Only people who reject aliens after looking through the evidence understand that.  Do you see the difference between that and the people refused to ever consider the topic of aliens?
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider this in another way.  The people you know who believe the official story for 9/11, have they considered the evidence and found it lacking?  Or have they found ways to avoid looking at the evidence.  They know the conclusion is that their government is not benevolent so their brain does not allow them to see what is right in front of their faces: the official story cannot be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually look at the evidence for flat earth.  You don't have to trust documents or someone's word on it.  You can perform experiments yourself if you want.  The spherical model falls apart pretty quickly when you actually look.  Proving another model 100% correct is entirely another matter.  But realize that the important part is that the current model does not work.  It's similar with 9/11: it isn't as important to prove another version 100% correct as it is to show that the official version is a lie and demand answers.

       Ok, and do you reject that because you have considered the photos, or because it just cannot possibly be true?

      <p>
       If you believe that NASA is legitimate, you should not start with flat earth.  Clearly for flat earth to be true NASA must be lying.  Start there first.  There is lots of material to examine in that area if you have never looked.

       Are you sure?  I have been in a plane many times, I've never really thought to look for curvature in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next time you are on a plane, take a look.  Before you take off, make sure your windows are flat by observing straight edges such as buildings through the window.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, note that the fact that the horizon rises to the level of your eyes no matter how high you go up in a plane is just as important as the flatness of the horizon.  That is a property of a flat plane.  On a sphere, the horizon should drop below eye level as you ascend.

       Start with NASA, there is lots to look at.  Have you ever examined "photos" of earth from space?  There are a lot of problems with them.  Listen to this freemason high priest of science tell you the shape of the earth:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoCKapivHGM">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoCKapivHGM

       Now google "photo of earth".  There is a contradiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just the beginning.  NASA puts out a lot of material.  Much of it is very sloppy.  Take a look.

       One technique to hide it is to ridicule it so hard that people are afraid to even look because they might be labelled as crazy.  If you don't believe NASA is legitimate you are most of the way there.  If the images of the earth are faked, aren't you interested in seeing real images?  Don't you think they should be demanded?

       Yes.  The point that I disagree with is the responsibility of a person with your outlook to want to find out for themselves.  If you realize that those lies exist, don't you feel compelled to look further?  Photos of earth are not the only evidence.  It is an enormous topic and deserving of a real look before you reject it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My own opinion is that the official spinning globe model we are given does not work.  I have not fully accepted an alternate model.  But to call it crazy at the outset, without looking, is problematic.  Especially when you have reached that point where you realize NASA is bs.

       I actually have looked into it, since I'm an evidence based researcher and I was bored. I think the premise is compelling, but I have not seen anything that couldn't be explained another way.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, I need an uninterrupted flight from ground level to atmosphere exit with a planet facing camera before I can assume that the earth is flat. Also, the flat earth model proposed does not account for existing shots where not all landmasses are visible. If the earth was indeed flat, you would reach a point where every landmass was visible. That's not the case, so far as I've seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we've known the globe model is inaccurate for decades, but that doesn't automatically indicate that the planet is flat in any sense.

       This is absolutely true.  Proving the globe model incorrect does not directly prove that the earth is flat.  However flat is the best alternative model I have found so far.

       What tool do we have other than an amateur rocket or a balloon?  You can see videos of those on youtube.  They show that the horizon does not go below the camera level as you ascend.  That is a property of a flat plane.  I don't think one of these has gone high enough to show all landmasses.  That is something I would certainly like to see.

       What if this is not possible?  Ie, what if there is no reaching the end of the atmosphere?  We don't really know the nature of the sky and space.  We have to take the words of officials for it.

       I don't get involved in arguments. You can't paint any picture you want. The truth is our structure down below is changing. There is something big on the horizon. That means there's something working above as well. Nibiru, planet x, the real sun... the real sun who died on the cross... who never died. But ascended to the heavens to come back one day to reveal the truth to the people.

       Even if it was a dwarf star, even if it was in some spectrum the human eye cannot see, we have radio, infra red and every other spectrum you'd care to name telescopes to see - in fact we have a telescope in space that looks directly at the Sun and sees it in all it's glorious hues that you and I could have never imagined.

       This is true.  The shape of the earth does not change anyone's life in and of itself.  The reason I think it is important is that it functions as the ultimate wake up tool.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is something you can prove with experiments yourself.  The evidence is first order, you don't have to rely on documents, or someone's word.  The type of person who trusts their own reasoning, and isn't super brainwashed out of their ability to actually think can be opened up.  Once you convince someone that it is true, they are faced with questions that they cannot escape easily: the how and why of the coverup required to pull this off.  When you show them the "global" power structure at that point, they are much more receptive.

       Are you sure?  Have you ever looked into how the big pharma and big food industries work?  Money for research comes with interests behind it.  Scientists who pursue certain lines of investigation are discredited and destroyed.  Don't give up your own opportunity to reason to blindly trust the word of authorities.

       Yes, I have dipped into the holocaust too.  My conclusion is that there are huge problems with the official story, but that the consequences of informing people on that topic are a step further than this one.  You talk about flat earth, people just think you are crazy.  You get labelled anit-semetic and it really impacts your life.  It is entirely possible to describe the larger conspiracy without pushing the "holocaust denial" button and getting the vehement, programmed reaction.  Call me a pussy, but I don't want that kind of stigma in spite of the truth there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I encourage you to do your own research on flat earth.  No one else has to know.  The only risk you run is that you might be convinced by the arguments and then you would be forced to accept it.  You will likely be able to apply your experiences as a pilot in considering the arguments.

       This is a really interesting and highly organized campaign.  It's not just on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have cited the "flat earth" wikipedia page several times over the years to point out that the phrase "it's like a meeting of the flat earth society" has a lot more interesting historical context than it's given credit for.  In the past few months, the SEO rankings and wiki pages have changed to show results which don't make it clear this was originally satire.
      </p>
      <p>
       "flat earther" has been a derogatory phrase for "anti-science"/ "conspiracy" folks for a long time.  Before there was "tin foil hat", there was "flat earth".
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 18th century, the "Flat Earth Society" was a satirical group aimed at mocking religious and fanatic groups.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The myth that people in the Middle Ages thought the earth is flat appears to date from the 17th century as part of the campaign by Protestants against Catholic teaching. But it gained currency in the 19th century, thanks to inaccurate histories such as John William Draper's History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science (1874) and Andrew Dickson White's A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom (1896).
        <em>
         Atheists and agnostics championed the conflict thesis for their own purposes
        </em>
        , but historical research gradually demonstrated that Draper and White had propagated more fantasy than fact in their efforts to prove that science and religion are locked in eternal conflict

       There is a more modern movement which has received some significant digital marketing of late, which is likely a parody similar to Robert Anton Wilsons Church of the Subgenius](

       This article about he current head of this "group" is somewhat telling in their attempt to use the concept as subversion.

        In fact, Shenton turns out to have resolutely mainstream views on most issues. The 33-year-old American, ­originally from Virginia but now living and working in London, is happy with the work of Charles Darwin. He thinks the evidence for man-made global warming is strong, and he dismisses suggestions that his own government was involved with the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

       Conspiracy theorists in general aren't taken seriously for whatever reason, in other words they have no credibility. It is simple as that.

       At some point you have to realize you are working against whatever agenda you have.  If you have something useful, then share it.  But, by telling people not to look at something, well they are going to start to wonder why there is only one photo ever of the Earth.  Your dribble just makes people wonder.

       I said I vaguely looked at the Flat earth theory and wasn't an authority on debunking it. Im still open minded and (when I have time) will look into it more. I just think that it's a little suspicious how it just sprang up out of nowhere. If I was tasked with marginalizing conspiracy theorists, I would most likely do it with a blitzkrieg of disinformation dispersed throughout places where truth seekers congregate ... like here for example. Im not on some anti flat earth crusade, Im just (by nature) skeptical and think that its plausible that it could be a psy-op.

       I don't buy it.  If you are interested, then research.  If you are not interested, then don't.  But, to come some place and ridicule an idea that you haven't researched is suspect.  That attitude won't ever lead to any knowledge.

       You have a point. My personal explanation why there are few
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       images of our Earth from distant space, is because we didnt reach that far for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we have is some satellites going in circles in low Earth orbit and if I had to stretch my imagination, a telescope somewhere lost in space. (Hoomble)
      </p>
      <p>
       Internet can function just fine even without satellites, we already use wireless towers and large cables across the Atlantic ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Google earth is funded by alphabet soup &amp; images can be made by military planes photographing the Earth with that millionpixel camera technology I forgot the name of ***.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because we haven't breached outer space and human-maned misions are largely avoided, doesn't mean the Earth isn't a spheroid.

       You are in a fairly unique position with this outlook, I think.  Almost no one attempts to address the lack of pictures of earth from space the way you have done without taking the next step.  The next step is properly investigating flat earth for yourself.  For some reason, the prerequisite step of realizing that NASA lies is harder for most people than the next one.

       You've got to admit the flat earth thing can be amusing for an hour. However, the lack of other images of earth is about the most surprising thing in the theory but they do exist. I think some of those nasa videos where they state we haven't gotten far into space and where they show the female astronauts perms are exacerbating this though. Yes from what I can see it does appear nasa needs to clear up some stuff and explain why some of their vids appear quite fake, but is this important to the current state of things? No. The whole horizon thing is interesting only from the far viewing standpoint if the curvature of the earth actually eclipses items in that way,(which other than one video I cant much else) but if memory serves doesn't light curve with the earth and its gravity? The fact the horizon doesn't change is simple perspective and if you've ever drawn you know it doesn't mean squat as far as pointing to the shape of the earth though I can see how people would take something so simple and for granted and second guess themselves on what it means. I also find it interesting though that this whole thing has arisen in the conspiracy communities as such a critical time but whether its trolls or not let's focus on the more important issues like the impending TPP, Jade Helm, all the financial fuckery , and wars, and ignore this trivial matter. I never questioned the moon landing growing up and though now I have certainly seen plenty to make me doubt it I still file it under "there is far more important stuff to worry about" and that's where it will stay, piled high above but along with the flat earth theory.

       Of course it sounds outlandish when you first hear it.  But you yourself just stated you "vaguely looked" at it.  You came to the conclusion that it was bullshit without actually investigating it.  The theory that it is intended to discredit conspiracy theorists is plausible, but is it actually the case?  It certainly does appear to be the majority opinion in this thread, but that also doesn't make it correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       I urge you to actually look into it properly.  There are some disturbing questions about the spherical model we are given that cannot be explained away, except by techniques like this thread which encourage you to dismiss without looking.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may not be the most important issue, but it does serve a purpose.  I have introduced it to some of my relatives, people not into conspiracy theory at all.  I presented them with the physical proof.  At the end they are left asking about the how and why of the coverup required for this.  They are instantly opened up to listening to important, pressing issues such as the "global" conspiracy required to pull it off.

       Says the guy who is touting the value of Alex Jones!  That is hilarious.  Alex Jones is the most clear disinformation case there is.  He is the honeypot that people commonly fall into when they first get into conspiracies.  How long do people waste on his bs before they realize what he is?  And you are championing him and calling me a "disinfo troll".

       All I'm doing is asking people to consider evidence before dismissing, rather than accepting someone else's conclusion without ever looking for themselves.

       You are repeating the same accusations that every disinfo agent says about Alex Jones.  There is a campaign to discredit him and you have either been fooled by them or are part of the campaign.  At least Jones is smart enough not to waste time on flat earth bull.

       If you honestly believe that Alex Jones is not controlled opposition, well, I guess that is where you are.  He exists to trap people in a state of fear and disempowerment.  People realize that the mainstream news is lying and he is right there to tell them like it is, paralyze them and keep them from looking further.
      </p>
      <p>
       No campaign is required to discredit Alex Jones, he does it to himself.  Have you heard the clip of him crying on 9/11, then cutting to commercial?

       I admit he's an easy target, that is why you shifted the topic to him.  In the video he's crying about 9/11.  Not sure how this proves Jones is an agent.  A lot of people cried.  I've listened to him for years and that's who he is.  He's not perfect and he's excitable but he is genuine.   The man has probably woken up more people than anybody.  He deserves the credit.  Any other disinfo talking points you'd like to toss into the mix?

       Would you like me to continue with Alex Jones and why he is a disinfo agent, or to defend myself against your accusation that I am a disinfo agent?  You provided no evidence, only the statement, so there isn't much for me to rebut there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Continuing with Alex Jones is not difficult, but it is offtopic to this thread.  I just thought it was funny that you called me out as disinfo while supporting the most obvious example of disinfo.

       Scare tactics and fear-mongering to sell his shitty products. I'll agree he does a good job of somewhat waking people up, but if you can break way from his spell and branch off on your own, you'll wake yourself up.

       It is being used as a distraction but we as critical thinkers can't deny the possibility of it. My opinion is, who cares, don't try to get to the edge, we can't. Let's focus on practical change but I'm talkin fast. We need to get people fired up; there's a lot goin on. We can use issues to our advantage. For instance, the gay marriage issue is another distraction and a surprisingly advantageous one at that. Half the states in America are pissed off right now. I Personally support it but the way it happened clearly showed everyone that we no longer live in a democracy. It was a statement. Just like pot legalization will be. And just like an announcement of "others" will be. Just like Jade Helm will be. I digress, we won't be able to realistically KNOW the nature of the universe until we pull together, and pull the elites down to our level. Get them bloody, let them keep making mistakes. 3 things never stay gone forever; the sun, the moon, and the truth.

       I can see what your getting at but I'm not in control. Everything I do and say is as reaction to my surroundings. It IS weird that this flat earth stuff is gathering so much steam. It's either true, or a distraction. Same as everything else. We gotta work through it.

       You're right. And how good is the theory if you need so many alts to back it up? To give it 'credibility'? I've never seen those people explain winter/summer temperature changes, day length changes etc. the theory has nothing to stand on and they usually ask
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       for burden of proof! Pure craziness.

       To my mind, the Flat Earth theory is a fascinating phenomenon. As far as I know, it stands alone as a theory which uses most if not all evidence to the contrary to actually support its conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       A massive coverup on the part of NASA and the scientific community as a whole, as well as all air traffic control infrastructure and international governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, that's what creates the cognitive dissonance, and would stand as the most convincing factor to their agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last week, I decided that I needed to know more about these theories. So I sat down and watched several hours of interviews and, well
       <em>
        monologues
       </em>
       I guess on YouTube.
      </p>
      <p>
       The overarching consensus, is that The Earth is the ONLY physical thing in the Universe. Everything else 'revolves' around it. The Sun and Moon are the same size and only about 3,000 miles away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Observationally, from our terrestrial perspective this is difficult to disprove, provided you take into account absolutely NONE of the past thousand years' scientific revelations.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the kicker for me, is that these proselytizers of the Flat Earth are VERY quick to label anyone who might not agree with them as 'in on it': pessimist narcissists, atheists and dupes..
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, do I think that official narratives are 100% truthful? Obviously not. Do I think gravity works in exactly the way we think it does? No. Do I think that some space exploration footage is fake? Yes. Is space as a thing what we think it is? We honestly don't know enough to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       But do I think all these things are so because The Earth is flat? ABSOLUTELY NOT!
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's how they're gaining traction in communities like these--They're exploiting holes in our collective experience and awareness.

       The tides. How do you Flat Earth people explain the tides? And no, I'm not going to go look it up for myself. In proper logical debate the burden of proof rests on the person making the claim. If you do not supply proof you are arguing the arbitrary and the argument is discarded by default. So please tell me, how are the tides generated on a Flat Earth?

       It used to be lizard people, now it's flat earthers. I don't believe that 99% of them actually believe that nonsense, but there will always be a few fools to run along with it. I'm not sure what entity is behind this, but I'm convinced it's a deliberate campaign to discredit this sub and other critical thinking subs/sites. So I'm with you on the psy-op bit.

       they have perfected bullshitting looong time ago. They've been mixing truth and lies for the exact purpose of discrediting conspiracies. The word Conspiracy itself is a concocted word to make it look like it's bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you don't know if the earth is flat. You don't REALLY know until you see it yourself, and you can't see it with your naked eye, unless you can go up like 30-40k feet. Commercial planes go up to 35k feet and you might see some curvature, however look at the windows. They are all fisheye glass and therefore bend the corners.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think we live on a flat earth, but to rebuke the idea after "vaguely skimming through" is just silly and inappropriate.

       I have posted this response in another topic but it also fits in here very well:
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this all goes a bit deeper. To be honest right from the beginning, I am a round earth believer and I know that not all flat earth believers are stupid (not everyone is parrotting nonsense s/he heard from a friend which read something on the internet what a friend saw on youtube). I think this all is just part of a huge controlled disinformation campaign in order to make people resistant for the upcoming disclosure and the massive information dump which is to come linked to this. Because if one gets the masses to disbelief in science and get them to not being able to distinguish honest and true science from fakes, then the masses also won’t believe in disclosure and other true informations coming out. Lots of us are looking for informations, and at some point you will come across the illuminati &amp; cabal groups, and if you are up to date you’ll probably know about the sphere alliance and the SSP’s. It is obvious (at least to me and many others) that the cabal groups have infiltrated the conspiracy theorists and it seems this is all well prepared. People around the globe are slowly waking up and are realizing that somethings not right here. People know that NASA, our politicians, the media, schools and what have you weren’t always truthful and honest. So I believe that this huge disinformation effort is to discredit science with the weaopns of the conspiracy theorists. It is basically their last stand because they know if that doesn’t work they, the cabal group, will be history. But no matter what, this time they’ll lose anyway. I have read a lot about flat earth theory and in every forum, and on youtube etc. at some point the flat earthers are fighting fiercly with the round earthers about their beliefs. This tactic is old, very old and it seems to work on us almost every time unless someone notices it. Not only on this topic but also on many others. Get the people to fight each other so they don’t care about the one initiating all of this. I think what we should focus on is prevent this useless namecalling, fighting, insulting and so on because aggression does not get you anywhere in this discussion. No one knows everything and the one who claims to know everything is a liar. Only full disclosure is real disclosure and anything other than that will be orchestrated by the cabal groups. Its as easy as that. Technically we could be much further than we are at the moment and if the real full disclosure occurs we have to be able to distinguish the fake from the real thing.

       I'm not going to start to explain details of this because I wouldn't be able to do this as good as the ones who are doing this for years. But I can provide some links so you can research for yourself.

       It's an attempt to contain knowledge and science from the majority of people in hopes of maintaining the old religious power control.  The world is flat, don't head over to the Americas...  The world is flat...  you can't goto the moon, Ceres, or Pluto.  The world is flat, there are no friendly aliens, there is only our religion and we will kill you to ensure you won't influence others about the truth that we have worked so hard to cover up.

       I'm going to but in here. You started off well in this sub, but I'm starting to find your attitude a little disappointing.
       <strong>
        The default position on this subreddit is that conspiracies exist, and it is not your job to stifle discussion of such theories and shame their proponents.
       </strong>
       People discuss lots of different conspiracy theories in this sub and if you don't like a particularly conspiracy theory, you can add to the discussion by calmly and politely setting out evidence to the contrary.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will just have to accept that some people believe (or appear to espouse) conspiracies that you think are completely off the wall. Imputing nefarious motives to everyone who believes those theories is not helpful.

       Yes, but there's a bunch of users who keep pushing Flat Earth agenda and are very deffensive of it in the comments, use ad hominem attacks, and are obviously here to spread disinfo. It's ok to believe in conspiracies, but some of them were designed to paint conspiracy theorists as utter nutcases (like the case with Hollow/Flat/Abnormal Earth).

       Agreed, but it is very hard to know if flat earthers are genuine believers or trolls, because some people believe really weird conspiracies. For instance, I despair of anyone  who believes in one of those ludicrous supernatural entities called "gods", but I don't accuse faithists of pretending to believe that shit to make
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       "look bad" (even though I think it does).
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of trolls come to this subreddit to denigrate regular users. We really don't need regular users doing the same, because internal divisions are more dangerous to this sub than outsiders' opinions.

       Add: My personal philosophy I try to adhere to (not that anybody cares, but I think it's a good one) is not to criticise anybody personally, unless that person has

       attacked me, other users or (what I perceive to be) the ethos of this sub.

       The most simple question i would ask all the flat earth "believers" is that if the earth would be flat, (which it isn't) then what is at the edge? Do you think it's a edge, that you fall into space? And if you think it's a edge, why haven't anyone noticed it? Also our oceans, dont you think they would poor out if it were an edge?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just need to add that if you jump onto your motorcycle and drive in a as straight line you could, you will end up where you started, is that a scenario that would work on your flat earth?

       the only true flat-earth is the virtual reality machine earth, where each of us is a in a fixed point and as we move about the entire 'planet' revolves around us.

       Careful, like any other important topic, flat earth is filled with controlled opposition.  You just told people to check out the "Flat Earth Society".  The only reason for the existence of that place is to discredit.  It was started by freemasons to convince people that the idea is silly and dead end them on it.

       Yes.  Controlled opposition is a standard tactic in any arena.  If you can infiltrate the place where people go when they disagree with the official story then you get to control the narrative on the alternative and get an easy list of who is against you.  "Cointelpro" is a good topic to research if you never have.  It is a sort of admitted false flag so a description is found on wikipedia:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO

      <p>
       Combine that with the more current information about official security service operations online, in social media:

       It's so disappointing to watch this sub circle jerk itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       You people aren't skeptics. You're just the next iteration of groupthinking tribalists.
      </p>

       I promise you. No one gives a good fuck what people think about this sub or conspiracy theory in general.

       You'll entertain Retillians and UFO's on flimsy evidence but you won't take a hard look at the very real and troubling round earth dilemmas?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pathetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask why you can see for miles past the supposed curvature of this round earth? Oh it's atmospheric refraction reflecting thousands of feet of landscape perfectly into view. Right...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying I know anything for sure, but if you just dismiss that evidence out of hand because science handed you a magical explanation, you're not a skeptic, you just have a belief system you believe is rooted in fact. It's a new type of faith, call it what you want. But that's what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who clings to a belief without seriously evaluating the evidence and denounces dissenting opinion is a religious bigot.

       That's all I have to say.

       I think it's just a way of muddying the waters. It's actually more difficult to prove the Earth is a sphere than you would think. Especially because the flat Earth proponents have a very strong case from debates that happened hundreds of years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best way to show people the flat Earth concept is false is to show images which can be easily attained by inexpensive cameras and telescopes anyone can acquire. You can see that the moon is a sphere by the craters and how they change shape close to the curve of the moon. The flat Earthers claim the moon is not an actual spherical body and that meteorites aren't real.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also suspect these flat earthers are scammers or disinfo because they should have figured that out at least by now.

       Its not really bullshit. I've seen many vets in this sub converting over to the flat earth theory. I honestly don't know which side to believe and I won't until there is hard proof of one or the other.

       In this society you have to question everything. Cmon man, don't shoot down other peoples views just because you can't agree with them.

       Having taken an interest in the past years on Heliocentrism vs. Geocentrism ( another fascinating subject ), I can assure you, NASA is NOT an organisation you can trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not know what shape earth has, but obviously we are missing a big piece of the puzzle and kept in a state of ignorance.  All the photos of earth from space are (bad) photoshops, earth for one is NOT a perfect sphere, and ... the fact that Antarctica, a HUGE continent is  totally off limits,  and unexploited by mining and energy corporations only adds to the mystery.
      </p>
      <p>

        this guy's expeditions
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Also look into geocentrism vs heliocentrism, and use common sense many, many people have failed to prove earth is moving around the sun except these failed experiments ( that show earth is nearly motionless ) are not taught in mainstream academia.

       They don't.  Antarctica / South Pole is off limits. The go on the edge of Antarctica, look into operation Highjump led by Admiral Byrd and you will see for yourself many weird things that happened when they led those expeditions.

       I said I vaguely looked at the Flat earth theory and wasn't an authority on debunking it. Im still open minded and (when I have time) will look into it more. I just think that it's a little suspicious how it just sprang up out of nowhere. If I was tasked with marginalizing conspiracy theorists, I would most likely do it with a blitzkrieg of disinformation dispersed throughout places where truth seekers congregate ... like here for example. Im not on some anti flat earth crusade, Im just (by nature) skeptical and think that its plausible that it could be a psy-op.

       Would you like me to continue with Alex Jones and why he is a disinfo agent, or to defend myself against your accusation that I am a disinfo agent?  You provided no evidence, only the statement, so there isn't much for me to rebut there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Continuing with Alex Jones is not difficult, but it is offtopic to this thread.  I just thought it was funny that you called me out as disinfo while supporting the most obvious example of disinfo.

       Well then our views aren't that far apart.  I am not defaulting to the flat earth model.  I just think it is the most plausible of those I have seen.  Do you have another alternate model that you think is more plausible than the standard flat earth model?
