<p>You can talk about the ability of people to speak about Italian mafias, but Jewish mafias are off limits (or never spoken of). You can talk about the over-representation in finance, law, politics, Hollywood, etc. </p>

<p>Maybe just use an analogy. Just change &quot;Jew&quot; to &quot;Italian&quot; and talk about a world where Italy completely controlled our country using a powerful Italian Lobby. Just put some time in and maybe change some minds. That&#39;s why we are here, isn&#39;t it? Kindness is key. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the biggest reasons I&#39;m not voting for Hillary. Perhaps you misunderstood something in my post? </p>

<p>We also need to keep an eye on individuals who are pretending to be antisemites in order to derail the threads. There is a history of that here, so keeping the conversation logical, evidence-based, and kind should eliminate that problem. </p>

<p>If you really want to pretend that I am pro-Israel or something, go right ahead. That&#39;s pretty weird, to be honest. I thought I was very clear...You can&#39;t just go around pointing out who is Jewish. For one, not all Jews are pro-Israel, but I think it would be fair to say that being Jewish makes it more likely that a person would support that criminal state. So, you have a point, but it&#39;s worded poorly. Two, you would be lucky to convince even 1 person of your convictions by doing that, so it&#39;s a waste of time as I stated earlier. </p>

<p>Response to your edit: Why are you assuming I don&#39;t know this? You should actually read my replies and stop making assumptions. Also, you are doing an extremely good job of derailing the thread and this conversation. I don&#39;t expect you to admit that this was your goal, obviously. But I am throwing that out there so others can decide for themselves about your true intentions. </p>

<p>Where did I do this? </p>

<p>This is what I actually said: &quot;Just put yourself in their shoes and kindly explain your position. Otherwise, you&#39;re going to seem racist...&quot;</p>

<p>All I wanted was for you to provide a sentence or two explaining your position with your audience in mind. Maybe a few citations would help. Going around pointing out who is Jewish is a terrible way to convince anybody, unless you explain your argument. Saying somebody is Jewish is not an argument. Is there some history of Newhouse supporting Israel? There must be more reason to why you are convinced that Newhouse is using Reddit as support for Israel. And you probably need to bust a myth or two to be taken seriously by your audience. Hopefully, you are able to look at this from your audience&#39;s perspective and form an argument based on that. </p>

<p>They are a genetically distinct population of human beings. Many Jews disagree with you. There have been genetic studies of their IQ and theories created to explain the cultural mechanism that alters their genetics. Also, this is extremely irrelevant. Many people will look at your words and think &quot;racist.&quot; What I am doing is trying to keep you and others like you from what seems to be deliberately ruining this subreddit by constantly talking about Jews. Every day it&#39;s Jews. And almost all of you appear to not have any idea how to word an argument or spend any time whatsoever to debunk the assumptions people will inevitably have. </p>

<p>You&#39;re going to seem racist when your only argument is that Newhouse is Jewish, therefore he supports Israel. Find something else other than his race/religion to support your argument. That should be extremely easy and way more convincing, correct? </p>

<p>You&#39;re also calling people delusional and telling me I have my head in the sand when I agree with your position on Hillary. And telling me I should look into the history of things which I am already aware. This is the weirdest convo I&#39;ve had all week. </p>

<p>Have you ever ventured outside of this sub? Tons of people think all this sub does it talk about Jews. Why? Because of people like you. You come off as abrasive and pretend you&#39;re more intelligent and aware than those around you. The way you word things has a massive impact on how convincing you are. If your goal was to convince literally nobody, then good job.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll spend my time elsewhere because this is a waste.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not reality, that&#39;s the conspiratorial bubble that you and everyone else on this sub lives in. Where you guys are filled with paranoia about flat earth, 911, GMOs, chemtrails, the CIA tapping you, the government working for Ellen Pao, false flag attacks, Dylan roof with an Obama sticker, WTC 7, jade helm (whatever happened with that, I thought they were invading Texas) and the list goes on and on. You claim to think you know so much about how the world operates, but you are usually flat out wrong. Oh I forgot on that list. The jewzzzzzzzz who are always behind everything. My sink won&#39;t turn on; must be the Jews.</p>

<p>It&#39;s campaign season, go work for a campaign and see for yourself...or just keep pretending you know what&#39;s going on...it&#39;s cute. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How many campaigns have you worked on? Please present your evidence where a candidate was denied the ability to run Bcz they were anti Israel.</p>

<p>It&#39;s cute that you present assertions without evidence and expect people to take them as fact </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reddit is the place for you...whole lot of cute tweens who know EVERYTHING...&#39;cause daddy told them so...so cute..and extremely delusional. Painfully so.</p>

<p>Wow, you have presented so much <strong>evidence</strong> for your assertions from <strong>CREDIBLE SOURCES</strong>, you have changed my mind </p>

<p>Oh wait: you just state things </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not fair nor constructive to consider yourself smart and &quot;them&quot; stupid. Intelligence has little to do with it, exposure to information is key in the context of conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>With the grasp power groups have on information vectors (news, social media, TV, ...), it is easy for them to twist the picture and keep the majority in the dark and make sure they don&#39;t go questioning things and that dissenting parties are being silenced and pushed out of the mainstream chain of information.</p>

<p>As such the people calling you, I and others crazy, do it because that&#39;s what they have been told we are, and from sources they have been accustomed to trust, sources we&#39;ve learned not to trust. </p>

<p>I feel that part of my duties as a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; are to not aggravate these people, be non confrontational, and always keep in mind that it is human nature to be particularly permeable to opposing ideas of those you hold (regardless of how these ideas/values have become your own, through self reflection or propaganda). </p>

<p>Present the facts, review your arguments, are they sound, well written? Never present yourself as more enlighten/intelligent than them (you are not, you have simply a different experience of the world due to the knowledge you have exposed yourself to), never stoop down to personal attacks or foul language usage, never present your ideas as THE truth, present them as observations based on facts, and when hypothesizing make sure you say so and why you think this is a valid thought.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant, but I feel a lot of &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; have a confrontational approach to debate sceptics, while I understand the frustration one can have, escalating the tone of conversation is the surest way to look crazy.</p>

Dismantle or gag reddit just long enough to make sure the &quot;correct&quot; candidates get nominated, and then the &quot;correct&quot; one gets elected.  It also correlates with voat.co DDOS, PayPal suspending them, and their ISP booting them.</p>

Reddit is a consensus machine, it molds and manipulates the general attitude towards certain topics and I think that they have just gone too far when it comes to protecting advertisers and influential users.  </p>

<p>I think think that the goal was to utilize reddit for it&#39;s massive user traffic to mold public opinion, but I think this move is actually organic. The fact that this protest is being accepted by people who have nothing to do with the overarching movement towards censorship leads me to believe that this is purely a stance against admins from mods. I could be wrong but I don&#39;t think this fall out was planned</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% this. People usually don&#39;t care too much about website politics unless it is all over the front page and unless thousands of other people are talking about it. I feel like it would have been easy to start the Pao-hate, subreddit deletion drama and other meta issues by manipulating a few posts about it to the front page, starting a circlejerk, and letting it spiral from there. This in turn lead people to resent the Reddit experience more and want to migrate away from it. You&#39;d think Reddit would want to protect its image by suppressing these negative discussions about its website, but they let them flourish. Imagine if they had let posts about the TPP flourish - even one high profile anti-TPP post on the front page could have lead people to be as up in arms about it as these Reddit issues...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering the mere existence of an inescapable 500 billion dollar advertising industry,  is it any small wonder that a gathering as large as Reddit (~170 million which is larger than many countries) is considered not only one of the most coveted viral advertising targets but something to actually fight for to control, to infiltrate, and to influence? It&#39;s easy understand how that many people thinking in the same direction could be a very powerful (if not worrisome) political and/or social force.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a theory.</p>

<p><a href="/r/investing">/r/investing</a> has also gone private. I think this is the keystone in the arch. Over the last few days, the place had been lousy with &quot;BUY BUY BUY&quot; sock-puppets attempting to inject a last desperate bit of faith into western stock traders, before finally shutting down as said faith didn&#39;t materialize.</p>

<p>Greece&#39;s economy is collapsing. China&#39;s is crashing, with 30% of market value wiped out - trillions gone. Italy, Puerto Rico and others are in dire straits. Our own stock markets are vastly, dangerously overinflated, and far overdue for a correction rivaling China&#39;s.</p>

<p>I suspect this Reddit clampdown is related.</p>

<p>one admin at Letsroll one is now fully behind MH17 as being a real event !!!!! another that Noah Pozner was a real child on 12/14/12 !!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Insanemedia seems to have been frozen in time, their specialty was Sandy Hoax and its unraveling.</p>

<p>the false flags and fake events got really really silly and stupidly obvious these last three years, rather than defending the indefensible, its obvious that taking down the discussion is their game plan.</p>

There are a vocal <em>Minority</em> that are upset with the direction Reddit is going, but until the actual hit rate of the pages go down due to mismanagement, then the trend to propagandise and tame Reddit will continue, as that will bring in even more money later and/or promote the views of the owners.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This reads to me like an actual fuck-up and failure at damage control. Too many mods are upset for them to actively suppress discussion of the controversy without further alienating the community. Reddit is a highly profitable venture for a very powerful publishing conglomerate. I don&#39;t see Conde Nast throwing that away for someone else&#39;s propaganda objectives(though they have shown themselves to be willing to risk it for some poorly-concealed censorship and shilling). It looks like a mistake to me.</p>

<p>On the other hand there are some facts that might support the hypothesis that reddit&#39;s politically engaged userbase is being pushed out in order to protect the brain dead <a href="/r/aww">/r/aww</a> surfers from contamination. Like hijacking those subs to keep them up and running. Maybe they figure they have enough mainstream traffic to survive and the political users don&#39;t click on ads anyway?</p>
