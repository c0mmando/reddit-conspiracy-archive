       This decent into madness appears so intentional and orchestrated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, it might be useful to speculate:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        If reddit is being purposefully sabotaged, why and, by who?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Who are the cast of characters that have been involved with the operation of reddit during this period?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        What more is in store for reddit?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       And [8]:
       <em>
        Is the U.S. government involved?

       The timing of this is very suspect. Major subs going down the weekend before a holiday, Independence Day, when we have "ISIS" supposedly planning attacks on American cities. Im not holding my breath but this is extremely suspect, all of this.

       I 100% agree. Let's be honest, the government has had reddit on their radar for a long time, seeing as how we've shown we're one of the most powerful communities on the internet for promoting ideas and causes, and the majority of our opinions are at odds with the powers that be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been under the impression these past few weeks that the elite are ramping up their game in terms of spreading disinformation and pushing through legislation to drastically curb the average person's freedoms. Why now? IMO it's because the percentage of people realizing the extent of corruption worldwide is reaching a critical mass where it will be impossible to contain and mass arrests will begin to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got into all this conspiracy shit circa 2011, and back then I knew of only one or two other people who believed in some of the stuff we talk about here. Now, it seems like everyone has a suspicion, if not a strong conviction, that the government is royally screwing its people, in amongst the most despicable ways imaginable.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if the .01% don't gain control of the situation ASAP they lose everything they have, which is why so much crazy shit is happening in the world regardless of where you look (except Iceland ofc). And that just means it's even more important for each and every one of us continue to fight the good fight--against the lies and corruption that is causing untold suffering to people everywhere.

       I get the feeling that Bernie got astroturfed here, sadly. His run so far reminds me of McCain in '08, only this time it's the Democrats going "stick with us! We have someone who's different than the last guy!"

       What's happening is that the Venture Capitalists and the Corporations who each own a slice of Reddit are now trying to monetize it so they could make a return on their investment.  They're all saying right now is the right time to do this since the income potential is so huge with so many Reddit subscribers.

       I noticed an ad for Seinfeld on Hulu on the front page the other day.  This is the first phase.  We'll start seeing what the next phases are in the coming months.

       Yeah I dont know about that..
      </p>
      <p>
       By saying the government is behind this, you are making 2 assumptions:
      </p>
      <p>
       -Reddit is invulnerable to corruption from the top-brass
      </p>
      <p>
       -The community and mods lacks the ability to voice discontent
      </p>
      <p>
       What we see happening on Reddit is the work of the community. And I wouldn't call it sabotaging. More like purging the bad elements by voicing discontent. And if these bad elements cannot be purged(i'm looking at you Pao), the site will implode on itself. As people pack up their bags and leave, in search for an alternative that does not censor and manipulate newsfeed for some zionist-progressive agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what i'm saying is that Reddit is not beacon of justice and truth that fights the evil government. That's a naive thought. As of right now, it's corrupted to the core already, and it cooperates with certain think tanks and shady jew-run organisations to make sure the new generation is indoctrinated in their way. Think about the posts you've been seeing in TIL, it's indoctrination by repetition.
