       So I live in Texas. "Crazy rainfall round these parts wouldn't y'all say?" Posting this because I'm laying in bed right now and have been hearing constant helicopter activity for over an hour now. I have been hearing and seeing quite a bit about these bases springing up everwhere. I don't pay a lot of attention to military movements but the informations made its way into my circles without my asking for it. I have a buttload of theories but no evidence. I think Texas is a threat to whatever the governments cooking and something major is gonna happen in the future; possibly the near future. They want us locked down before it does. I am the type of critical thinker who leans towards this just being a drill, but a drills a drill. Why you runnin such extensive drills on people's property? Why are we seeing trains filled with tanks and UN vehicles and what not? What's up with Walmart? I personally believe the whole World War III/Cold War II bit is a ploy to let the governments of the world finally get their hands around our throats again. As if they aren't already, metaphoricly. Ain't nobody got time for a nuclear war! They know that! Something ain't right with these moves the governments of the world are making.

       One thing I give to Texas, you do not give into the shit. You are labeled hostile and the confederate flag is being censored. The flag is about rebellion, not slaves. Keep your head up (we are with you). I'm a yankee, but my spirit resonates with yours.

       Unfortunately Texans are growing further apart these days, with social media serving to fuel arguments among everyone. Maybe it's just among my generation, who likes to consider themselves progressives even as their rights and freedoms are stripped away. I used to consider myself fairly liberal until I started thinking  about the broader implications of a growing federal government.

       There was a post here recently that showed a conversation between a customer and an Amazon employee concerning why they stopped selling any merchandise with a Confederate Cross on it. The Amazon employee stated that they stopped selling Confederate flags, bandanas, etc. "to comply with new federal mandates" or something to that effect. That scares me, because there has not been any news of a real or potential "federal mandate" pressuring companies to stop selling Confederate merchandise or outright banning it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of your feelings towards Confederate symbology, the fact that the government can strong-arm big businesses into refusing to sell something because Uncle Sam doesn't like it is terrifying. It's the first step down the slope. Next, as we just saw in Oklahoma, comes the Ten Commandments. They. Will. Not. Stop.

       If the only evidence of this "federal mandate" is the second-hand testimony of an Amazon wage-earner, and not some sort of law or executive order, I question the veracity of the claim...  If the government's strong-arming businesses, you're right.  Is there more evidence to support that claim?

       I'll bet anything that chat transcript was falsified. And even if it wasn't, it was just an ignorant Amazon employee making an ignorant comment. But it's MUCH more likely this was fabricated by some Confederate apologists trying to get people all worked up.

       Has the government stopped flag distribution somehow?  Seriously, all I've heard about is what private retailers have decided about their wares, and what state governments have decided about decorating state property.  If there's more to the story that I've been ignorant to, please share.

      <p>
       To me, agreeing would imply that some entity wants to censor the flag, that entity wants to make it illegal, and that entity is somehow responsible for "stopping distribution."  However, all I've seen about "stopping distribution" has been private retailers making decisions about what products they carry, and state governments making decisions about how they decorate state property.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did not intend to insert a strawman; the way I read your question, agreeing with you would imply a singular entity is engaged in "stopping distribution" with the end goal of censoring and outlawing the flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will answer your question directly:  Yes.  If an entity doesn't want the flag anywhere, it would make sense for that entity to take whatever steps they can, including ending retail distribution, censoring free speech, or legally banning free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I do not know of a singular entity in existence which has the power to make this happen, and further, I've seen no evidence that such an entity is actively engaged in this issue today.
      </p>
      <p>
       I look forward to you reading into this to find out how I'm attacking you and must be wrong; please feel free to share whatever insights or insults occur to you.

      <p>
       And that's not censorship. If state legislatures choose to remove the flag, they are exercising freedom. That's their job: they control the capitol grounds and they are in charge of deciding what's on the flag. They are simply exercising their legal and legitimate prerogatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you're right: there is no censorship of private flags. People can fly all the flags they want on their own property; they can get a Confederate Flag tattooed on their face if they want.

       All Yankees are Northerners, but not all Northerners are Yankees, and you prove this fact well. We Southrons need more folks like you north of the Mason-Dixon Line, folks who understand our past and know that we're not a bunch of racist hillbillies.

       Everything I know about Jade Helm, besides the thousands of military vehicles and upgraded police cars I have witnessed personally, has been from the Internet. So, I wouldn't refer to that as "proof" or "evidence". No need to be a dick.

       I found it quite interesting coming from a different angle and it does seem to make some sense regarding the areas marked as hostile and the reasoning as to why. At the end of the day the USA and Israel have been gunning for Iran for years and threatening them if they develop their nuclear programs. I just have a feeling that this is what Jade Helm is all about, but I must admit that all the martial law theories going around could certainly still happen at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It must also be said that Iran is one of only three countries left without a Rothschild centralised bank, and as you can see from the following, countries that do not have a centralised bank haven't fared too well in the past....
      </p>
      <p>
       In the year of 2000 there were seven countries without a Rothschild owned Central Bank:
      </p>
      <p>
       Afghanistan
Iraq
Sudan
Libya
Cuba
North Korea
Iran
      </p>
      <p>
       The only countries left in 2003 without a Central Bank owned by the Rothschild Family were:
      </p>
      <p>
       Sudan
Libya
Cuba
North Korea
Iran
      </p>
      <p>
       The Attacks of September 11th helped to invade Afghanistan and Iraq to then establish a Central Bank in those countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only countries left in 2011 without a Central Bank owned by the Rothschild Family are:
      </p>
      <p>
       Cuba
North Korea
Iran
      </p>
      <p>
       After the instigated protests and riots in the Arab countries the Rothschild finally paved their way into establishing Central Banks, and getting rid of many leaders, which put them into more power.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can see that many of the countries listed who didn't have a centralised bank found themselves at war and eventually under new control having one installed. It is my opinion that the powers that be want to war with Iran so they can take over and install a sock puppet leader who will do as they want and then eventually set up a Rothschild centralised bank.

       I see this information passed around in memes and comments on blogs, but there isn't any proof for it, is there? Is it just something "we know" but don't have evidence for? What's the single strongest bit of evidence that the Rothschilds own all the central banks in all the countries in the world except 3?
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't that kind of an amazing claim? Doesn't it seem that if it were true, there would be abundant evidence of it? How could they keep something like that secret?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if we limit the discussion to the US Federal Reserve: What's the single best piece of evidence that the Rothschilds own the Federal Reserve?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or if I may ask the question another way. Since there isn't any evidence, even a tiny bit, that the Rothschilds own every central bank on earth except 3, what was the single most significant thing that made you believe it?

       website lists all the central banks alledegedly owned by a Rothshild. Problem is, Iran is listed on there... I think people don't really know what they are saying about any of this. Some hard proof would be nice.

       well as you are right in saying that there is no evidence, and I don't normally refer to them as Rothchilds centralised banks, it was just a quick cut and paste job from a site displaying the few countries without centralised banks over the last decade or so and I just kind of left it in without thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       But regardless of who is behind them, and even if it is just one person or group behind them all, I think it is safe to say they are inherently evil and not good for nations. the people behind them earn billions for loaning to governments, and they are not even loaning true wealth, it's just fiat monopoly money they lend that is not backed by gold. Countries just stuck in a never ending cycle of debt and people enslaved to the bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they do say that the Rothchilds fortune is half of the worlds wealth, again no evidence for that but it's believable given the families achievements and background in banking. If you're looking at that kind of wealth then it is difficult not to see the potential power you could hold over governments and get them to install a central bank.

       Well that's fair play I guess, and I doubt we will ever know who is behind them as they won't want anyone to know. It's more than  likely a consortium of wealthy people, but as one of the richest people on the planet, if not the richest, and with a banking incredible successful background in the Rothschilds family history I would be surprised if he is not in the mix somewhere.

       The military exercise is exstensive because of what it is training. Its mainly special forces and its evasion tactics. Overseas, our troops have found themselves in situations where they need to eacape an area quietly and quickly. This exercise is to do just that. States are labeled "hostile" because the soldier/s are to pretend theyre in a hostile state and have to make it to a safe zone through any means nwcessary. All the equipment is to give the soldiers a realistic training of war. Tanks, helicopters, bases, etc are all things you can encounter when trying to escape a country.

       Sounds like you were either A in the military or B want to be in the military so your opinion is a little suspect. I don't care, personally, what they SAY they are doing. The military is complelty compartmentalized and all they do is follow orders. Good people in the military; misguided I would say. So you trust this government? I sure don't.

       I still look at the fact that soldiers are people, not robots. Although throughout history we see examples of people acting as robots but thats because they had motivation driving them to follow theyre leader such as food and shelter in a country that doesnt have those things. Our soldiers are still people who volunteer to fight for our country to protect us, i cannot physically see every single soldier willingly following orders like that. I for one would fight and i know many ithers would too. Actually most marines dont approve of the obama administration. Now knowing this, would the government risk this? Its asking for a revolution that they will lose. Theres to much at stake for something like this to happen in my opinion. But, i always keep an open mind and my gun at my side just incase something were to happen. I dont trust the government so im not dropping my guard completely.

       Your right about people being capable of compassion and logic; not going through with this insanity. But I would caution you, not everyone is so gentle. Haha. Not to mention, brother, the speciial forces of every branch, private military contractors, and police will be the ones executing Jade Helm, not average joe-just got outta high school, kill me some towel heads guy.. No. These are trained killers. Based on what your saying in your text you have about the same amount of knowledge I do about this subject (very little). I would suggest you research it more.

       Jade Helm is a joke. Its the new "FEMA Camps OMG!!" The only problem is the Youtubers who are making money off you watching their videos can't use "FEMA Camp 2015" in their titles and descriptions because its played out. As I told my brother last year when he was trying to convince me that FEMA was coming for us and told me to google "FEMA Camps 2014," I said, "Dude, google FEMA Camps 2012 and 2013. Its the same bullshit every year."

Ask yourself though, what is it they are dis-informing you ABOUT? Just because something hasn't happened yet doesnt mean it will never happen. No more fear mongering it's time for action.

       Personally, I think there's a lot more research you need to do on Jade Helm if that's what you believe. You're believing what the government is telling you its for at face value, which is an out right lie.

       It's the gov't/military staging resources in every city and state across nation in preparation for implementing countrywide martial law because they know our currency is on the verge of collapse which will result in immediate economic collapse of our whole country that is going to be FAR worse than what's happening in Greece right now. Greece's current state of insolvency and economic collapse is the first domino that is going to spread through the financial markets and trigger the collapse of our currency which will result in the collapse of many other countries as well.

       I don't know about that. I recall when a similar exercise happened in the 90's called Operation Urban Warrior. They did a mock invasion of San Francisco bay, used 6,000+ troops, attack helicopters, tanks, APC's and set up internment camps where they processed dissidents.

       People like Alex Jones were calling it prep for Martial Law in America back then, and yet nothing happened as a result. It was just a training exercise.

      <p>
       So no, I don't think Jade Helm is prep for martial law.

       Dude they are everywhere.. But I'm not trying to persuade you on the WHY it's happening. Could be anything. Just that it IS happening, is what's important. I think your claim about WWIII/Cold War II could be accurate. I also think our government coul be working with those countries' governments against the citizens of the world. Both are equally possible and equally terrifying prospects.

       Anyone that goes against the narrative will soon be labeled a domestic terrorist. I saw a comment in a
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       article about people protesting the whole confederate flag thing and the comment was calling for them to all be killed for treason. There was also this story,
       <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/us/tally-of-attacks-in-us-challenges-perceptions-of-top-terror-threat.html?referrer=">
        http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/us/tally-of-attacks-in-us-challenges-perceptions-of-top-terror-threat.html?referrer=
       </a>
       , that was on the front page of
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       the other day that talks about how homegrown extremists are more responsible for the deaths of US citizens than any outside terroristic threats. Which then sets the table for the crackdown of any citizen who exercises their right to free speech against the government as being a dangerous extremist , even more dangerous than the big bad Muslim terrorist bogeymen. All you have to do is pay attention to what stories and narratives are trying to be pushed on sites like this to get a picture of what lays in store for the future. This site is used to push narratives, those narratives are pushed for a reason. Things are going to start getting even more interesting, perhaps sooner than we realize.

       Agreed. We have to have to be fearless and vigilant. That's why I have started speaking out; because not enough people are. I don't mind death or torture I've come to grips with it. All of us have to sometime, and if our days are numbered anyway we have little to lose. They will not take my freedom from me. Keep fighting my friend.

       You guys have got to stop dividing us into different social groups in your minds. That's how they continue to do what they do. We are all in this boat together. It's funny, I would have not mentioned that I was from Texas, but I wanted this to be a genuine conversation. Yet, the majority of you reacted based on where I was from and not by what I sas saying. It's all good. Everybody on Texas wears a cowboy hat and hates gay people right? That's just stupid. Also, I couldn't give one shit about the confederate flag or gay marriage, it's whats these decisions REPRESENT that effects my mind. Same thing with Jade Helm. All you muhfuckers trying to act like this shit happens all the time get the fuck out! This shit is real. We're living it.

Words that, objectively, are not lacking in logic. In my opinion, you assume things. There, now both of our opinions have been expressed. We both feel better.

       I'm basing my approach off of Socrates. People often thought he disliked them because he would question them, when in reality he just wanted them to know the truth. He supported them by strengthening their minds.

       I think that you would benefit from reading The Apology and book 6 of The Republic, which are available translated online and free. Trust me, they will give you a better understanding of the world and help you in your endeavor for truth.

       My father educated me on Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle's teachings as a boy. I'm a bit rusty but I am of the same mindset. Logic and objectivity govern my words. Pursuing every angle. The Buddhists call it "beginners mind". Looking at things as they ARE not as I THINK they are.

       I do think that they are two sides of the same coin; east and west. I mean where did Jesus go for those 18 missing years? Came back a spiritual leader promoting the unity of mankind? That is if he actually existed. These kinds of discussions need to be had.
