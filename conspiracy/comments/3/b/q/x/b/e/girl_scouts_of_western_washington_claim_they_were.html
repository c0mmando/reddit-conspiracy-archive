<p>What&#39;s next? An &quot;anonymous&quot; donor offers Chucky Cheese a million dollars as long as he gets to diddle the kids? I can&#39;t believe people actually bought the story and donated their own money!</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe this is a fake story, hopefully you can see how easily this can be faked. It&#39;s almost guaranteed to happen again because this is proof of concept. </p>

<p>That is why this entire thing is so hard to believe. Some multi-millionaire out there thought the Girl Scouts would accept this offer when they have a history of supporting transgender girls? They tripled the offer in 2 days. </p>

<p>Just check out their video asking for money: <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/girl-scouts-is-foreverygirl#/story">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/girl-scouts-is-foreverygirl#/story</a></p>

<p>Brings a tear to your eye, doesn&#39;t it? I&#39;m all about acceptance, but this just doesn&#39;t seem real. And how would they even get caught? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If somebody has 100 grand to throw around, chances are they aren&#39;t mentally retarded. An obvious result of the offer would be a media-shitstorm that would go against their interests. The Girl Scouts of WW know where their money comes from. They&#39;d get more money supporting trans girls than excluding them. <a href="http://www.hrc.org/blog/entry/survey-shows-striking-increase-in-americans-who-know-and-support-transgende">66 percent of people who know a trangender person have favorable feelings towards them, compared to 13 percent who did not.</a> And a 2011 poll showed <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2011/06/02/9716/polls-show-huge-public-support-for-gay-and-transgender-workplace-protections/">73 percent support protecting gay and transgender people from workplace discrimination.</a> Anyone who has even done light reading on the subject knows that this organization would never accept that offer in a million years. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to fool anyone here. Obviously, I&#39;m not claiming I have proof, but then again, how would you even get the proof? It was an anonymous donor. All I&#39;m saying is it wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all, given the <a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/charitywatch-articles/charitywatch-hall-of-shame/63">history of charity abuse</a>. I just want people to think of these types of things before they open their wallets. Sometimes, the world is a dark place and some people really do have no conscience. I can see how this could be easily rationalized as well. The ends justify the means. As long as we are promoting the acceptance of trans people, anything goes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not really what I was going for. The point of mentioning that was to establish that because an organization calls itself philanthropic or charitable doesn&#39;t make it any more likely that it is moral or impossible for corruption to be present. </p>

<p>Historical context is always a good option when having conversations about plausibility of this or that. Without any similar examples, my argument would be much less convincing. Imagine a world where pedophilia in churches was unheard of and somebody accused a priest of molesting children. The only reason those accusations have any credibility is because of the amount of similar accusations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct that the refused donation could be falsified. However evidence suggests not. Donations, large donations especially, often come with stipulations. Given the recent attack on Girl Scouts for their acceptance of transgenders and their frequent partnerships with churches it is highly possible. Additionally, even if were a money grab, the funds collected in this campaign are detailed to be for their underserved girl program. This is a stipulation they set themselves and have to abide by. Money raised will still benefit the cause they claim. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. When you donate and specify a certain area, it will go to that area. This wasn&#39;t marketed to be a general donation. I should note that the vast majority of GS staff have a lesser salary for their position than elsewhere in their community.</p>

<p>And heads of charities, especially massive popular charities, have a long history of fraud, abuse, and even molesting multiple children.
