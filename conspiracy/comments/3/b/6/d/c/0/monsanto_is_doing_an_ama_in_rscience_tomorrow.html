       Who wants to bet this guy tries to confuse selective breeding with transgenic manipulation?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also expect him to talk about how great golden rice is and not take any questions regarding the social/biodiversity impact of BT cotton.
      </p>
      <p>
       I, for one, hope that he makes the argument that people who are "scared of GMO" are similar to "anti-vaxxers" and "climate deniers".
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  WOW- I just noticed that they put the AMA up 5 hours before he's scheduled to answer the questions.  This really allows them to push the "important" questions to the top.  I notice that the gangs all there.  I have 3 existing "GMO Shill" tags on the top ten comments.

       Joke is on you cause he answered those questions well. Haha I respect your hesitant take on Monsanto given their Rep but the more I look into Monsanto the more I have respect for their organization. I hope you check it out; IMHO the real conspiracy is the hate this company receives, theoretically this technology they use could save billions of people in the coming generations.-probably lots of billionaires that would like to see that not happen.

       I bet he doesn't, but henchmen/henchwomen will. If you notice in debates against big moneyed corporations, you'll find a bunch of useful non-regulars popping in with quick homilies and false "talking points" in the hope of pushing the public hive mind one way or the other, it doesn't matter if they need to lie to do it. When you confront them, they try to redefine/reframe their initial false talking points and will eventually disappear into a puff of smoke.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen this from big Agers (examples: gene splicing vs. breeding conflation, "organic pesticides are more dangerous than glyphosate!," "there are no studies showing glyphosate danger to people/environment!"), bigPharmers ("we haven't used mercury in vaccines since the 90s!"), and bigAspartamers ("there are zero studies about aspartame causing harm!") and I've too often seen people take what they say as gospel and argue with them as if what they were saying is the truth when those spouting the lies are fully aware that they're lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Newsflash, y'all: anonymous Internet astroturfers lie if they can get away with it. If you have the time, take that time to research their claims and confront them when they're lying, if only to help others who might get snowed.

       Honestly, it's an
       <a href="/r/science">
        /r/science
       </a>
       AMA, so it's not like they'd have to get very far to have relevant questions from people who know what they're talking about. Don't have to buy anything if you can just get a whole lot of questions and then weed out the bad ones, and round up the good ones. (Heh.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, so far all the example questions that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       would have preferred are basically just super-simplistic or blatantly calling Monsanto malevolent, which they wouldn't answer even if true. (and AMAs in general don't tend to approve of those.)

       I had dinner with my folks just after moving back from China. They had a guest who kept asking me questions about Chinese perception of food, GMOs, shopping habits. After he left, I found out he and his wife work for Monsanto. I wish I had known that in time to ask relevant questions.

       Not sure what you'd expect there to be different. I mean, unless you're arguing that actually eating them is some kind of danger - as far as I am aware, the argument is mainly about their potential deleterious effect in nature, competing with existing crop...

       I mean, logically speaking I'm not sure what the dangers would be. Maybe contamination from pesticides, but I'd think that was already a  well-monitored thing considering normal food has that too. The only other thing would be the extra bit of gene, but we already digest the rest of its genome anyway, and the extra bit is also a plant gene so it wouldn't even act any differently...

       Unrelated, but one of their partners trialed a genetically modified wheat recently - they modified it such that the wheat gave off aphid "distress pheremones." It didn't work, as the aphids very quickly learned to ignore the signals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which makes you wonder - they're going to start ignoring each others' distress signals, what's it going to do to the aphids who are an important part of the ecosystem? I'm sorry you folks don't care or care to understand the part, but that's an important part of science - understanding what you are disrupting before you attempt to disrupt.

       This kind of short-sighted experimentation without careful consideration of long-term effect is honestly terrifying and the public has very little control or input.

       You cannot possibly plan 50 years or a century ahead with basically anything at all, ever. Demanding that some company demonstrate something which they cannot reasonably determine (and which is based not on data, but on fear) is irrational. You can do reasonable tests in reasonable timescales and determine all the most plausible issues, as has been done with all previous farming developments. Fear should not be a factor, unless that fear is grounded in fact.

       AMAs are complete jokes. Even Aziz Ansari did an AMA, coincidentally when he was promoting the book he was writing, and all the questions he answered were about the book.

       I just opened up that AMA and saw over 30 questions from people I've tagged in the past as likely Monsanto reps. It was hilarious honestly. Yesterday the sub begged everyone to be polite, literally begged, and then said " Monsanto does not attempt to control public discussion as far as we know" yet there these folks are, their comment histories are all nothing but defending Monsanto, and all of their questions are the top / upvoted questions in the AMA, as if they were just regular members of
       <a href="/r/science">

      <blockquote>

        <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3b6mr4/science_ama_series_im_fred_perlak_a_long_time/csjbz21">
         In May 2013 Monsanto opened a seed bank in Ukraine at the expense on $140M. GM crops were illegal in Ukraine at the time so this seemed to make no sense at all. Then after the Ukrainian coup, the former investment banker and US State Department economist Natalie Jaresko was made Ukraine's Minister of Finance. Shortly after this she changed the Ukrainian law, under the instruction of the IMF, to allow GM crops to the be grown in Ukraine.

       Not if you sort by "new" instead of "top." It's actually kind of cheering, though who knows how long until mods delete the good questions. Also, read what people are asking, I've seen several "I'm pro GMO" posts that ask really good questions about harm caused and lack of long-term research.

       Inherently, there are very few things, if any, wrong with GMOs.  There might be problems with specific cases, e.g. monarch butterflies; externalities, e.g. the use of more glyphosate; or with the actions of companies that develop them, e.g. Monsanto.  In the end, they are just a tool to put genes into other organisms.
      </p>
      <p>
       With GMOs, you could theoretically induce the organism, like a plant, to make more of a specific vitamin.  Or, you could also make the plant (or any other organism) to express something like an anthrax toxin.  For the last point, I wouldn't be surprised if military biologists were trying to do that right now.

       The science and innovation being done by Monsanto and bioengineering is extremely impressive to say the least. That being said, does Monsanto have any guidelines that separate the "could we?" and "should we?" Like they say on the original Jurassic Park.

       Perlak is a registered lobbyist for Monsanto and the intimation that he's still engaged in scientific research may be erroneous. The comment made by
       <a href="/u/SixBiscuit">
        /u/SixBiscuit
       </a>
       pointing this out was deleted from the thread. You can check it out by viewing 6B's comment history. They did edit the post title to hedge a bit and look less pwned.
      </p>
      <p>
       No surprise from
       <a href="/r/science">
        /r/science
       </a>
       , but 6B's points should definitely comprise their own thread here because they need to be discussed.

       How do you propose a genetically modified plant would cause such a cancer or disease? Is there any research into such a thing? It's all well and good to claim that, but methinks that companies like these invest a thousand times more into safety and study of effects than critics ever do in showing their claims to be valid.
