        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This morning, CR-7 ISS resupply mission tragically exploded 2 minutes into flight. Prior to this, SpaceX had not lost a Falcon 9 rocket (18/18).</p>

<p>About 1 month ago, SpaceX was granted permission to launch Department of Defense (DoD) payloads. For the past 10 years, only ULA (joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing) have been allowed to launch for DoD, and have been charging $200-$500 Million each flight. SpaceX has stated they will do it for $90 million, and would be able to win every open bid again them. </p>

<p>ULA fought against this as hard as they could, paying some very powerful congressmen against this. ULA&#39;s only argument, and hope to continue their monopoly and win bids was to make a case that SpaceX was not safe enough. The only problem is that the Falcon 9 has the best track record yet.</p>

<p><strong>I believe ULA directly caused todays Falcon 9 rocket failure.</strong> I believe they did this using Lockheed Martin&#39;s new anti-rocket laser.</p>

<p>Stabilized GIF of Falcon 9 at destruction: <a href="http://gfycat.com/HealthyConcernedLamb">http://gfycat.com/HealthyConcernedLamb</a></p>

<p>Destruction plus diagram: <a href="http://gfycat.com/CreepyDiscreteBichonfrise">http://gfycat.com/CreepyDiscreteBichonfrise</a></p>

<p>Here is a demonstration video of Lockheed Martin&#39;s (ULA&#39;s) new anti-rocket laser:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL9_Tldmrhs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL9_Tldmrhs</a></p>

<p>If you watch the Falcon 9 rocket at the moments before it is destroyed, you will see smoke/vapor coming out of the 2nd stage. Compare this to the demonstration video of the laser. They look remarkably similar.</p>

<p>ULA&#39;s only chance to maintain their monopoly (and possibly survive as a company) is for SpaceX to have rocket failures. ULA had both the motivation, and capability for today&#39;s failure. I find the evidence and circumstances behind this overwhelming. </p>

<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phjAL164k6U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phjAL164k6U</a>
A new stabilized video has been uploaded to Youtube. In this video, it looks like a bright light is momentarily on the 2nd stage rocket right before it explodes... </p>

<p>Edit 2: I am very happy that Vice was able to read my post, and felt that it was worth passing on (whether my post is true of not). It is my hope that my post catches the attention of those who are qualified, and in a position to confirm or deny this &quot;conspiracy&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt any laser was involved.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s not forget, there was a Boeing-made part (the IDA) mounted directly above the point of failure.</p>

<p>EDIT: someone mentioned the ULA being a product of industrial espionage - indeed, it was Boeing spying on LM.</p>

<p>So, a device, with an active onboard radio connection (NASA confirmed during the press conference that there is a radio transceiver on the IDA, and that it is active during launch), built by a competitor of SpaceX that has previously been caught using shady tactics against another competitor (the espionage case), mounted right on top of the LOX tank... and (apparently) the tank fails exactly at the point closest to the IDA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess they knew the blueprints perfectly, and the IDA looked like an external and functional match for the blueprint - but who knows if Boeing maybe added some &quot;extra parts&quot;.</p>

<p>Remember, SpaceX had to delay this launch because of &quot;clearance issues between the IDA and 2nd stage&quot; (translation: the IDA was bigger than expected, and didn&#39;t fit in the trunk) when mating the Falcon to the Dragon, requiring modification to the mechanism holding the IDA in the trunk. Such a modification is itself a risk if done shoddily (no conspiracy needed there), but the fact that the IDA was reportedly oversized is suspicious.</p>

<p>I have been worried about this launch for weeks. I watched the deposition of ULA and SpaceX, and something just seemed very dangerous about the mean who were talking for ULA... I mean, they do get most of their work from the Department of Defense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw that post, or a very similar one. It was in r/space. Basically went like once is an accident, twice could be coincidence, three times is sabotage.</p>

<p>Most of the replies were coming from the position that this is rocket science, launches are always risky and SpaceX is still a new company. One or two comments were from people that were quite suspicious. But there were a ton of comments about conspiracy theories and &quot;let&#39;s not get all crazy&quot; etc.</p>

<p>Well, AFAIK SpaceX <em>is</em> a new company. But one that has hired some pretty decent talent and expertise from NASA and private aerospace companies. Their rockets are based, in large part, on proven technology. Let&#39;s say there&#39;s a 10% chance of failure on any given launch for one of these rockets. </p>

<p>That means one out of ten chance of failure for one failure. Two failures in a row would be a hundred to one. Three in a row would be a thousand to one odds against. Now throw in ULA as a party who stands to lose a lot of money if SpaceX succeeds.</p>

<p>Hmmm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably ISS resupply missions that failed. This was the third one.</p>

<p>The previous ones were the Russian rocket that spinned out of control and the one before that was a rocket from orbital sciences corp which had a launch accident.</p>

<p>Now, usually I like the &quot;one time accident, two times coincidence, thee times on purpose&quot; argument. </p>

<p>But in this case there are 3 very different targets, so there would seem very little to no motives if the targets where the companies that did the delivery.</p>

<p>Thus, according to that logic, the target in this case was not SpaceX, it was NASA or the ISS (or some company involved with the ISS) who, for whatever reason, were not allowed to receive the shipment.</p>

<p>If there is something to this, the next launch for the ISS resupply should tell us more. It is only carrying basic provisions as far as I know, whereas the previous ones carried much more. So if it&#39;s something somebody is not supposed to get, this next launch should not be a target. If somebody wants the ISS to fail, they will have to keep the resupply missions down until the ISS runs out in Octobor and NASA will have to bail them out.</p>

<p>Or, you know, rocket science is hard and sometimes things go wrong?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that is what happened here based upon comparison of physical / visual evidence.</p>

<p>If you watch the video of the laser system (and Boeing&#39;s other laser system called Airborne Laser), you see a different pattern of damage than what happened to the Falcon 9. In a laser destruction, you see the following pattern:</p>

<ul>
<li>White hot spot where the laser is beamed on the target, visual to regular cameras, not just infrared</li>
<li>Slow disintegration / progressive collapse around the target area</li>
<li>Slow(ish) progressive explosion and disintegration of the target rocket as a whole</li>
</ul>

<p>With the Falcon 9 explosion, it was an immediate explosion and disintegration without the other signs.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s more plausible to think that either a part was installed incorrectly, or a part was made incorrectly, or some combination of both.</p>

<p>Also, space travel is inherently unpredictable and dangerous. Even though we have come far in technological innovations compared to the Apollo missions or the space shuttle, they also had their fair share of explosions. Sending a rocket through our turbulent atmosphere at nearly 20,000 kmh is a highly extreme exercise of physics. Everything must be 100% perfect to survive. Bad thing is - 100% perfection is impossible to attain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there wasn&#39;t enough heat to make a visible line on an infrared heat image, then there definitely wasn&#39;t enough heat to destroy a rocket.</p>

<p>Look at videos of Airborne Laser on YouTube. It is a similar system mounted inside of a 747 plane. Even at higher altitudes, you can see in the infrared videos a very large and white-hot line of energy used to destroy rocket targets.</p>

<p>If they&#39;re heating up the air in the laser path, they&#39;re not heating up the target. If you want a laser to cut through atmosphere, you use a wavelength that is invisible to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At first glance, I thought that a laser shooting down a rocket was ridiculous. Given that I&#39;ve read everything I can find on the subject, I might as well read the conspiracy theory. Maybe it could provide insight on what caused it even if it&#39;s argument gets destroyed immediately. I thought that I could shoot holes through the argument like they think that a laser did to the rocket. The problem is I can&#39;t.</p>

<p>The laser expended as I would expect for a distance of probably 50-75 KM that it probably take to be sourced from.</p>

<p>The laser technology exists to do similar task at shorter range on a smaller missile. That is quite a feat in precision tracking for a laser to consistently hit a given point on a missile flying through the air. It potentially has the capability do so at a much much longer distance on a much larger target.</p>

<p>The point of question and point of failure are what appears to be in an orientation consistent with the direction that a laser could come from.</p>

<p>The release of LOX started at the point in question.</p>

<p>The release of LOX is consistent to what I would expect if a laser was used on the rocket.</p>

<p>While the IR video doesn&#39;t show a heat registration on the laser. It might not need to in order to cause a failure. LOX at standard pressure boils at -183C or  -301F. The IR camera has some threshold where it starts showing. Possibly standard temperature, possibly much higher depending on it&#39;s calibration. Suppose that the threshold is at 38C or 100F. That is up to 221C or 401F difference in temperature. It would actually be a bit less because of the pressure of the LOX tank would slightly increase the boiling point of LOX.  If the LOX and outside air are separated by a thin piece of sheet metal, heating it rapidly in a localized area could cause large stresses on the sheet metal. It would do this because of the expansion of the metal. The heated, expanding area would put compression stress in a ring outside of it. The sheet metal is probably some kind of aluminum alloy and is probably holding a fair amount of pressures Since the margins built in for rockets is small, it could cause a failure in the metal which would rip the tank apart, without showing a heat registration on the IR camera.</p>

<p>The laser power at such an extended range would be reduced significantly as it spreads. On the other hand, it wouldn&#39;t take nearly as much to rupture an LOX tank than to pierce a rocket&#39;s thick skin to make it to the warhead.</p>

<p>The pressure telemetry data would be counter-intuitive to that which would be expected.</p>

<p>ULA would know best where it would be able to put a laser to avoid detection. They could quietly slip away after their mission either failed or succeeded.</p>

<p>ULA would also know that the event would be recorded with IR cameras and would know what would need to be done to evade it. They could have done testing for a significant amount of time in order ensure that it would be difficult to detect.</p>

<p>Tin foil hat aside, I am sure the data, which I don&#39;t have access to, would immediately refute the possibility that as laser caused the failure. It is quite unlikely that ULA would attempts such a risky maneuver. Even with the data in hand, I probably would be back to the same answer of the SpaceX engineers of &quot;I don&#39;t know, hopefully the pieces sheds a light on the cause.&quot; </p>

<p>As an avid follower of SpaceX and other space ventures, I am quite disappointed by the rocket failure. I am an engineer and I know that I don&#39;t know what actually caused the failure. Heck, I&#39;m sure there are things that I don&#39;t know that I don&#39;t know as well. I do know that it probably wasn&#39;t a laser that caused it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the input. Your thought process was almost the exact same as mine... I&#39;m also an engineer (structural).</p>

<p>I almost didn&#39;t post this, but went ahead with it anyway. With any luck, it might grab the attention of someone smarter and more informed that I am. You wouldn&#39;t believe the amount of flak I&#39;ve received for posting this. I have HUNDREDS of negative private messages for this, some of them vague threats. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had a few other thoughts about this since the day that I originally posted. The day following the rocket explosion, an object was witness by many people breaking up over North Carolina. I&#39;m pretty sure this was somewhat expected, and was an old satellite, but I got to thinking... &lt;tinfoil hat&gt; What if it was an anti-ballistic missile satellite? In order to get an ideal track on the Falcon 9 rocket, it lowered it&#39;s periapsis over the launch site (very near NC). After a few orbits, the atmosphere caused it to reenter the atmosphere a day later? I&#39;m 99% sure this isn&#39;t the case, but thought I&#39;d mention it. I haven&#39;t researched it much, and I&#39;m pretty sure theres another valid reason for the debris.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sabotage can&#39;t be ruled out but it seems a long shot, I think something less glamorous is more likely. I like the idea that the heavy docking ring in the unpressurized cargo area detuned the resonant frequency of the rocket (face it, a rocket is just a pipe like found on any pipe organ and it has a resonant frequency that changes as the fuel load and cargo load changes) enough that it started ringing and vibrated itself to collapse.

    <div class="md"><p>ULA is currently poised at a point where SpaceX&#39;s failures now hinder ULA&#39;s security. With the discontinuation of the Atlas and Delta product lines, and with an extreme shortage of RD180 engines preventing ULA from re-flying failed missions, ULA (and those needing launch vehicles) need competitors&#39; successes. ULA simply does not have the resources to pick up another competitor&#39;s slack, and likely won&#39;t until the completion of its new Vulcan rocket.</p>

<p>These failures make ULA&#39;s record look good, but the timing for this &quot;sabotage&quot; is too inconvenient.</p>

<p>I really think it was just an accident in a spate of three recent failures.</p>

<p>EDIT (because the laser keeps coming up).</p>

<p>Lockheed&#39;s &quot;new&quot; laser, ADAM, is only effective up to 2km, due to optical dispersion effects incurred by the used wavelength. Any more power, or distance, would cause the dispersion to balloon (power especially, because of the power of 2 on the dispersion equation for energy fields) and thus be ineffective. Even the Navy&#39;s 30kW LaWS has an effective range of 1.6 miles. The atmosphere just is not conducive to targeted energy weapons.</p>

<p>To think that any existing laser weapon system could cause such quick damage at a distance of (40km up, 15 km downrange) 42.72km (minus some due to curvature) shows you think currently impossible technology exists, and is in use for only mildly-nefarious uses.</p>

<p>Yes, a handheld laser can reach the moon. Why? It&#39;s visible light and penetrates the atmosphere pretty well. Good luck doing that with an infrared laser.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Let&#39;s fuck up the US&#39; position in space so we can artificially inflate our already high success rate.&quot; Yeah... makes sense. Nobody is doubting ULA&#39;s superb success rate, something SpaceX lacks. Prices being lower means squat when your launch has a significant chance to fail, and when a $100 million difference in launch costs pails in comparison to the price tag of a multi-billion dollar satellite blowing up, suppliers are going to take the ensured option. Screwing over your domestic security in the face of competition makes zero sense.  All competitors right now have to work together because nobody has a secure supply of launch vehicles until this RD180 fiasco is solved because nobody can pick up the other&#39;s slack.</p>

<p>And nobody but SpaceX knows how much a SpaceX vehicle costs. We do know they are and will be <em>charging</em> suppliers near $100 million, but it&#39;s speculated that the launches are costing almost double that and are being subsidized by Musk. Musk himself has said that the $100 million price mark is only met by the success of their reusability platform.</p>

<p>ULA has DoD dominance until 2019 due to current contracts. The &quot;most convenient time possible&quot; would be at the start of a new contract period when SpaceX has valuable launches at stake for a &quot;I told you so...&quot; moment. When the Vulcan systems are completely ready for any launch in 7-10 years, ULA should easily be price competitive anyway.</p>

<p>$61m for Falcon, almost exactly 1/4th the cost of the low-end Atlas V. Now, Elon has stated that DoD Falcon 9 rockets would be exactly $90m (non-reusable) since it would have to take out insurance themselves for the launch. At this price, they are 2/5ths the cost.</p>

<p>I think you are a little less informed than you think you are about this subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Until now, The Falcon 9 has been perfect. The only argument against SpaceX could be reliablility, which until yesterday was 100% (18/18).</p>

<p>Musk said that the non-reusable Falcon 9 would be sold to the government for $90 million, $30 million higher than usual. This is because the military and DoD doesn&#39;t purchase insurance, and so SpaceX must fund it themselves.</p>

<p>Musk stated that he If their most recent launch had been bought from SpaceX instead of ULA, that they could have had their satellite effectively free. This is how much cheaper SpaceX is.</p>

I also recalled a youtube video of the Navy testing out a laser where a drone exploded in the same way.
I saw this video before the Falcon 9 accident.</p>

<p>I wonder if there is a way to change the video color to some how show the laser beam?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to ZetaTalk, benign aliens are responsible for the rocket failure. In fact, SpaceX has been failing at their attempts to re-land their rocket on the barge. (This is a way for them to launch the elite quickly into space, but being disguised as a means to save money). According to ZetaTalk, space exploration is an avenue for the elite to escape the pole shift... <a href="http://poleshift.ning.com/profiles/blogs/nasa-exploding-launch-the-council-of-worlds-at-war-over-the-annou">(These rocket failures started back in late October, 2014)</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The message now is that the elite should not expect to get into space AT ALL. No escape. The message here is to take all hope away from such plans among the elite. They are to remain on Earth with the common man, and to the degree that they block the common man from preparing for survival with strong survival camps, they damage their own changes of survival. They can chose starving, rioting survivors or allow Obama to make his announcement and help the common man establish on safe grounds. We expect the battle to shift from attempts to block the announcement, or deny its meaning, to attempts to enslave the common man in some way. That is another fight, on another day. </p>
