       I've read the code too, it's in aspx, lulz. They cannot scale and the whole idea of free speech is kinda a funny because they are paying a corp for license fees. lol, should've wrote it in php or shit, even scala. I'm still making an app for it, will sell it for .99c but, they are going the same way as reddit. I'll cash out, and hopefully fund a new alt which is truly free.

       Ok, Windows cost money, Linux doesn't. Not a huge issue with shared hosting. But whatever, a one time, upfront fee.
      </p>
      <p>
       But why do you keep saying php/scala/etc are free as if C#/.NET isn't? Also, ASPNext (v5), which will be released the end of next month, fully supports running on Linux. There are already plugins that turn Sublime into an ASPNext IDE. But hey, you still have Mono, which has been out for years. So there you have it, NO DIFFERENCE. NO FEES.

       I guess I will say it again, as clear as I can. Open your OSX machine, download either MonoDevelop/Sublime/ASP vNext, install either Mono or that latest Microsoft linux bits, and BOOM! No Windows. Full .NET/ASP.NET debugging, IDE experience. Not a single dime spent. You can deploy this code also onto OSX/Linux for production use.

       What you would said would make sense, but for the fact it was merely a joke, and I was by absolutely no means making it a point that the person you are forking over money to is white, and not black.

       I'll make an iOS app for 99C. If people buy it, Win.... What is your point? I'm being honest. Voat, will not scale, but I'm an entrepeneur who can code in in objective-C and swift. I'll take their api (already invited) and

       I was merely discussing the fact that you think .NET/ASP costs money, when it absolutely does not. It was a dumb remark for you to make, and even dumber for you to not admin it, but instead keep digging yourself a deeper hole.

       Well then it is a good think you don't have to host .NET on Windows. Host it on Linux/OSX.

       It fucking does! Are you sucking Bill Gate's dick? It cost more to run a MS server than a linux server. Linux is free, MS has royalties. Why I'm even discussing this, is beyond me. Who the fuck are you supporting? The open source freee community or Windows (Bill Gates)? Fuck off, seriously, you are killing my buzz. You have no idea what the fuck you are talking about. If you are defending voat, cool, I do too. I'm developing an iPhone app for them. I want people to migrate, wtf are you supporting?

       so 3 seconds to do a get?
I mean, how do you know it's the code? Maybe they don't have proper CDN, or the need more back-end nodes for the VIPs, or maybe they just have a shitty network with shitty switches with 10/100 uplinks?

       I guess I should have said that I have also looked at/ran the code (on GitHub).

       Sure, for static resources, but this was the initial GET HTTP request.

      <p>
       Sure. That could help. But they really need more than that, because they are eventually going to run into the next bottleneck, which is the database. They need caching of some kind, maybe second level caching. The also need to query something other than the SQL Server for high-performant reads that have pre-computed values for filtering/sorting. They need to query something that is meant for reads (Solr/ElasticSearch), and keep that in-sync with the persistent store. Designing a distributed system that manages this efficiently needs to be thought about before hand. The entire application is written as if it were a hobby application, which it was/is.

       No.... Maybe you could be a little more specific on what you mean when you say "It is simple crud application, no caching layer"

       Since you prefer to just bash people when they ask a simple question.
