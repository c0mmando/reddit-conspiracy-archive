        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have been researching the NWO, illuminati, rothschilds, rockefellers, 9/11, MK ULTRA, holocaust, etc you name it, for about 6 months now.</p>

<p>I have no fucking idea what to believe anymore, I&#39;m completely lost. I can&#39;t even spend time with my friends anymore because they believe everything that the mainstream media tells us, and I get so angry because of itit. I constantly think about when the next war is going to begin, when someone gets assassinated, and everything that has something to do with the NWO.</p>

<p>I wish I never clicked that &quot;9/11 conspiracy&quot; video on youtube. Truth hurts, even tho I don&#39;t know what the truth is.</p>

<p>Could you explain me a few things.</p>

<p>Are Rothschilds/Jews really responsible for the 9/11, WW1, WW2, multiculturalism, assassination of JFK? And do they really own nearly every central bank in the world?</p>

<p>Are Rothschilds really worth $500 trillion?</p>

<p>Why is no-one doing anything about this? It would be so fucking easy to expose this whole thing, why hasn&#39;t anyone done it?</p>

<p>How do you manage to live &quot;normal&quot; lives? Isn&#39;t it hard because you know that you are just a chess pawn in a game?</p>

<p>Did the holocaust happen?</p>

<p>And the last question: What should I do?</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">9</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/high-priest-of-slack.html">high-priest-of-slack</a> 2015-06-25</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Breathe. Relax. Grab a towel if there&#39;s anything else bothering you right now.</p>

<p>It&#39;s far more complex than just one group of people responsible for everything, and there&#39;s far more to expose than you can imagine. There are many hoaxes that have been engineered to control the population, and the idea that you are just a &#39;chess pawn&#39; is one of them. We can all be so much more than that if we try.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t take it all so seriously; the wisest sages throughout history have told us that it&#39;s all just a game, a ride, it isn&#39;t real. Don&#39;t worry. Go play. Find something fun and engage with the world around you. Play opens up our creative energies and attracts others to join in. Follow what your heart knows to be true; channel some creativity and suddenly problems will seem like opportunities for growth. Remember there are 7 billion other people here too. You can&#39;t mess this up too much, so don&#39;t try so hard that you stress out or isolate yourself. Have faith and try to work some magic in your own life. Remember that you are not alone, we are all together, and your actions can ripple outward.</p>

<p>The answers you seek are out there, but there is much deception in the way; others can guide but you need to keep searching for yourself.</p>

<p>There is a coordinated system of mass trauma based mind control enacted on most of humanity right now, and as you already know, it&#39;s painful to even begin to acknowledge it. This is a spiritual conflict that we must grow to transcend. The truth will set us free, when we decide that we want to live truthfully.</p>

<p>As to what you can do, if you really want to antagonize the matrix, do it with love. You can&#39;t unplug while you are still dependent on it, so start growing your own food and plant anywhere you can. Green is an emotionally positive color that signals love and nurture, and nature surrounds us with it in abundance to let us know that we are loved. Spread the love! Planting a seed is a powerful form of slack magic. It&#39;s a small amount of effort that produces exponential rewards; try it for yourself and see just how magical life can be.</p>

<p>The system is designed to be self-perpetuating. Continuing to engage in your own disenfranchisement only signals to your controllers that you are right where they want you. Cultivate an attitude of non-compliance; become a link in the chain that resists.</p>

<p>Knowledge will light the way. Spread content to other sub-reddits, to other social media, to everyone you know and care about. If you see something you like here, from any user, plagiarize it! Don&#39;t try to remake the wheel, slack and use the abundance the universe provides us with. Copy and paste the golden hits from here to the rest of the internet; the truth will resonate if we raise our voices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I do, the thing is, dude, no one has to look at it because it&#39;s ridiculous on its face. The world cannot be flat. It doesn&#39;t stand up to even one millisecond of rational thought. If it is flat, there is an edge. Where is the edge? Where is the &quot;end of the earth&quot;? Why are ALL the other planetoids round, but the one we are on? Shipping routes, flight paths, Wiley Post, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Z7M4bPfHk">Red Bull Stratos,</a> I could go ON AND ON but you know what, pretty soon you&#39;ll be able to hop on a Virgin Intergalactic flight and see for yourself. </p>

<p>If you are not a shill, (and I believe you are one because I can&#39;t believe anyone could be this dumb and I&#39;m sorry for the insult but it&#39;s just facts) then you really need to reexamine the chain of logic that led you to the absolutely retarded conclusion that you live on a flat earth. </p>

<p>False.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where is the edge? Where is the &quot;end of the earth&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you had once looked at <em>any</em> Flat Earth claims, you would know the answer to this question! Please read my <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/393icm/whats_all_this_flat_earth_stuff_about_anyway/">Flat Earth Primer</a> made to help you get started. I invite, challenge, and dare you to disprove Flat Earth claims: but you can&#39;t disprove that which you don&#39;t even have the briefest familiarity with. Please understand that I didn&#39;t start out a Flat Earther, but became one when I took it seriously in an attempt to disprove it. I am ashamed it took me this long to really look at the world around me, and to trust my own observations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are ALL the other planetoids round, but the one we are on? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What planetoids? There is the sun, the moon, and the stars. If you looked at the night sky more often, you&#39;d see that the constellations <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVXa9jbSR7U">rotate slowly around Polaris</a>, and this is more proof of a stationary Flat Earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shipping routes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sailors navigate at sea via <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/35c86b/airplane_pilots_and_sea_navigators_fly_and_sail/">plane sailing</a>, calculating trajectories based on a <em>plane</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>flight paths</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Flight paths are more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNVgzk3tbl0">proof of a Flat Earth</a>, if you would only take the time to actually look into this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Red Bull Stratos</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Red Bull publicity stunt was also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8u0p2w_Lvo">hoax</a>, and if examined in detail will help you understand why so many are questioning the shape of the Earth now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>then you really need to reexamine the chain of logic that led you to the absolutely retarded conclusion that you live on a flat earth. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="/u/escapefromdigg">/u/escapefromdigg</a>, I can tell from your posts at this point that you haven&#39;t examined <em>any</em> of the &#39;chain of logic&#39; you think I am following. Will your next post be from a place of ignorance?</p>

You may not be able to change many things that are out of your control. But the things within your reach are totally in your control. You can strive to live a life that is pleasing to you and the people you love. Take up a new hobby, get really good at it, help a family member learn something/achieve something they have always wanted to, do some volunteering, try to get a boost in your career goals etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do I feel like this is some neo-nazi t-ball well poisoning post on par with the shitposting that goes on on the chans.</p>

<p>Jews aren&#39;t responsible for all the ills in the world it&#39;s far more nuanced than that.  Think in the terms of a mafia or a gang of psychopaths from all different backgrounds.  That&#39;s a more apt description of the NWO.</p>

<p>Now is this group responsible for all those things and agendas? yes, they are.  Are the Rothschilds leaders of this group of individuals?  Yes they are.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the big lie, as shitler called it, getting people to realize they&#39;ve been lied to in such a large fashion is nearly impossible, in fact most of the time they will violently defend the lie.</p>

<p>You get over the fact that you can&#39;t control the whole situation but fight it one battle at a time</p>

<p>The holocaust happened, but the numbers were likely exacerbated for political effectiveness.</p>

<p>Get as informed as you can, wake as many people up as you can.  Research Agorism and the counter economy as a means to personally help destroy this system.</p>

Learn how to differentiate between disinformation and legitimate info.  Try to nudge people into awakening as you have.  The truth needs numbers before anything can be done.

    <div class="md"><p>Now you get to decide how you <em>really</em> want to live your life.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a hard process but its best when you understand you&#39;re really free to do it your way.  No one owns you, and if they ever come to say they do, you tell them to fuck off and die.  We all get to decide how we participate......if at all.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t conform.  Don&#39;t believe their shit.  Speak up when you feel you have to and do it like you mean it.  If its worthwhile, its worth going 100%.  Participate in your world at the local level.  Get involved, even if its just sending annoying amounts of emails to your MP or Rep or whoever.  </p>

<p>They mean to have everyone be the same little consumer/worker/slave type they can produce.  They mean to have you say nothing at all in response to their actions.  So far, we&#39;re complying.  We need to change it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holocaust deniers always argue the numbers were inflated, the camps were for labor and not death. I don&#39;t know about any of that, but look into it. &quot;The mark of an educated mind is able to entertain two opposing thoughts without acceptance.&quot; Paraphrasing Aristotle but there you go.</p>

<p>Rothschilds we don&#39;t have alot of info on. And admittedly, if I were them and this &quot;eat the rich&quot; reaction to capitalism by the left continues I wouldn&#39;t begin to enter the public discourse.</p>

<p>JFK isn&#39;t as open and shut as anyone will have you believe. What&#39;s the deal with Oswald? Who wanted JFK dead anyways? Rabbit hole is deeper on that one.</p>

<p>What should you do? Live your life. Save money, buy things you like, make a positive difference on the world. One of the assets we have as simple plebians(if were going by that hierarchy) is that we can grow at the grassroots. Non-violence is just as important as getting your hands dirty by other means. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Give me control over a nations currency, and I care not who makes it&#39;s laws.&quot; - Baron M A Rothschild. Money calls the shots. End of story. They have managed to put a central bank in almost every country. What was the first thing that happened after we took over Iraq Afghanistan? Central Bank. Opium fields taken over. Why does the west hate Syria so much? They don&#39;t have and don&#39;t want a Rothschild central bank. They know what the deal is. And they are also sitting on a massive oil pipeline that we can&#39;t touch. Money, drugs, and natural resources are what the elite have always been about. And they can and will do anything to take control over it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humanity lost its moral compass a long time ago. You might as well just go back to sleep and pretend it was all just a bad dream, because there really isn&#39;t anything we can do to stop this speeding kamikaze train we&#39;re on collectively. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t alienate your friends and don&#39;t try to convince them of anything, because all you&#39;ll get is more resistance. People are hooked on the system and they will fight you to defend it, to safeguard their illusions and vain hopes or dreams. Let them hit the wall by themselves. If they ask for advice or help just do or say what feels right to you and nothing more. Don&#39;t go out of your way to do anything unless you really want to. If you were in fact right, good folks will appreciate you for it, bad ones &#39;ll hate it. Don&#39;t tell &#39;em: &quot;See I was right, wasn&#39;t I?&quot; They&#39;ll never admit to it, because that exposes them and induces feelings of shame or doubt from which we all flee. 
Be your own best friend to be a better friend to them. When all is said and done, you&#39;re the only one who has to live with the choices you made, the only one you owe anything. </p>

<p>The rest is all horseshit. It&#39;s all irrelevant. </p>
