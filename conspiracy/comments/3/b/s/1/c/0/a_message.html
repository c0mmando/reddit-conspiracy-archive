        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Messages are important. I don&#39;t know if you guys can feel all the nervous, rushing energy flowing all around us right now but I am beginning to. I&#39;m new to reddit and I won&#39;t be here long. I just am trying anyway I can to spread the word, spread the wildfire. It&#39;s growing and will continue to grow exponentially. I would encourage all of you to keep your wits about you. Let&#39;s have intelligent, pleasant conversation with each other and arrive at a middle ground. That&#39;s what the power structure has spent all its resources trying to prevent; us simply working together. All these &quot;shills&quot; are argumenative by nature. If you refuse to argue, rather enlighten and educate, you can win any fight by not fighting. You better believe that they are going to amp things up in the coming months. More and more secrets are spilling out; more and more distractions and calamities need to emerge. &quot;It was the best of times it was the worst of times&quot;, they&#39;ll say. They are trying desperately to keep us at each other&#39;s throats. Stay together and put yourself in other people&#39;s shoes. I would like to start a daily &quot;refresher&quot; thread, where people can come and talk about practical things they are doing to better society. I&#39;ll start; I am working for a new electirc company that functions as a broker that actually try&#39;s its best to find the absolute best price for its customers. I am also a bartender and I have as of the last few months made a conscious decision to not THINK bad thoughts about customers. I can sense the vibe more every day. If I send someone a loving thought or a friendly glance.. If I listen to one of their bullshit stories and contribute rather than just brush it off.. These kinds of things change people. They fill them with hope. Little things. Picking up the trash in your apartment parking lot, offering to help before your asked, just being kind to others. Buy a homeless guy a burger. Do something. If you can&#39;t take down the Pentagon&#39;s worldwide black ops program tomorrow by yourself don&#39;t feel defeated, you still have a part to play. When the mask comes off we&#39;ll all be in the same place. I love you. </p>

I have no fear of anything. I accept humanity for what it is; a mixed bag. I brought souls up because I DO believe in a higher power.. How could anyone not? Everything we see around us is a miracle. I don&#39;t support organized religion because it&#39;s first and most defeating assumption is that man COULD EVER understand the workings of God. God doesn&#39;t care what you think.

    <div class="md"><p>Haha.. Uhm your probably smart but that didn&#39;t sound super reassuring. Tell me about the parts where they genocide entire cities to make room for the Jews? What about the laws about not wearing two different garments in Leviticus? That&#39;s punishable by death. Idunno man.. Jesus&#39; message was a lot different; all about &quot;loving thy neighbor&quot; doing &quot;what you know is right&quot; &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; etc. The point is the bible is open to interpretation and has been translated, adjusted, warped, lost, and found again throughout time. It&#39;s not the center of my universe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope this is real. At the same time, just helping out people around you only makes you a good person. The ones that think that a handful of good people can fix this mess most of us were born into aren&#39;t entirely wrong, we&#39;re literally just powerless in comparison with what we&#39;re up against. It&#39;s not even about changing the world, that&#39;s what tyrants do. It&#39;s about changing each person individually. You&#39;ve already broken free, that&#39;s why you&#39;re here. Always treat others the way you want to be treated. Treat yourself the way you treat others. Then just watch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wise words. I used to want to be the big hero and save the world. Now I realize that we are all heroes. It&#39;s just so much more practical living life one day at a time, making a difference in your community, then trying to put the weight of the world on your shoulders. If you think about it at least 5-10 % of humanity is where we are at. Ready for change, ready for brotherhood and equality. That&#39;s like 500 million people. It&#39;s a start. </p>
