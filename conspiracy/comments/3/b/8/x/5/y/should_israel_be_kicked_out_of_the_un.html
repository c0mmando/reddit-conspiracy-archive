      <p>
       Here is a summary of the evidence for why I personally believe it should be:-
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Israel has violated in excess of one hundred UN resolutions. To put that into perspective, Iraq was invaded for breaking its second. For a full list please see:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       To further put it into perspective:-
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        In fact Israel has broken more UN resolutions that any other in UN history
       </strong>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Israel has violated dozens of international laws, hence undermining the very same organisation (the UN) it uses to legitimise itself. For a list of the international laws Israel has violated, please see:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Israel has committed dozens of war crimes which have been documented by human rights organisations and the UN itself. Some examples of documented Israeli war crimes are:-
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The King David Hotel bombing was a terrorist attack carried out on Monday July 22, 1946 by the militant Zionist underground organization, the Irgun, on the British military and administrative headquarters for Palestine, which was housed in the southern wing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem. 91 people of various nationalities were killed and 46 were injured

        The Lavon Affair refers to a failed Israeli covert operation, code named Operation Susannah, conducted in Egypt in the Summer of 1954. As part of the false flag operation, a group of Egyptian Jews were recruited by Israeli military intelligence to plant bombs inside Egyptian, American and British-owned civilian targets, cinemas, libraries and American educational centers.

        Doctors in Gaza described today how they had struggled to treat dozens of patients with terrible and unusually deadly burns consistent with white phosphorus weapons, during Israel's three-week war in Gaza.

       <strong>
        Nafiz Abu Shabaan, head of the burns unit at Shifa hospital and the most senior burns surgeon in Gaza, said 60 to 70 patients had died in his unit during the war from severe burns that were unlike any injury he had previously seen.

        A United Nations panel of human rights experts has accused Israel of war crimes through willful killing, unnecessary brutality and torture in its "clearly unlawful" assault on a ship attempting to break the blockade of Gaza in May in which nine Turkish activists died.

       <strong>
        Israeli air strikes during the summer’s Gaza war with Hamas repeatedly inflicted harm and death on civilians that could have been avoided, Amnesty International has charged in a new report.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The report, Families Under the Rubble, examines eight cases of targeted Israeli air strikes that killed at least 111 people, 104 of whom were civilians, according to Amnesty. Amnesty said it had “significant doubt” in some of the cases about whether a military objective was present, something that could make the strike a war crime. “In all the cases documented in this report, there was a failure to take necessary precautions to avoid excessive harm to civilians and civilian property as required by international humanitarian law,” the report said.

       <strong>
        (Reuters) - Human Rights Watch accused Israel of committing war crimes by attacking three U.N.-run schools in the Gaza Strip in fighting in July and August, killing Palestinian civilians who had sheltered there.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The New York-based group issued a report on Thursday that it described as the first in-depth documentation of the incidents, which took place during a 50-day conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants that ended in a ceasefire on Aug. 26.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "Three Israeli attacks that damaged Gaza schools housing displaced people caused numerous civilian casualties in violation of the laws of war," it said in the report, based on interviews with witnesses and field research in the Hamas Islamist-dominated enclave.

       4) Israel wilfully violated a legal conditionality of its own UN membership.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Israel was accepted into the United Nations on condition that it accept the Right of Return of the Palestinian refugees. Admission of Israel to membership in the United Nations (General Assembly Resolution 273 of May 11, 1949 ) requires Israel to comply with General Assembly Resolution 194 of December 11, 1948 and Israel stated it agreed to comply with this resolution.

       My solution to the Israel question is to simply eradicate it's ability to govern itself.  The problem isn't the Jewish people.  The problem is the Zionist Zealots that govern the Jewish state.  Why can't we call for an overthrow of Israel like they did in Iraq, Libya, and are attempting to do in Syria?  I'm all for the idea.

       I can agree with that statement.  Israel though is the leader of the pack when it comes to scumbaggery.  For many reasons.  If I thought it could be successful I would avidly advocate global revolution though.  Scrap the world and start over from scratch.

       I think you're right to an extent, but the problem with ideology is that the entire country gets behind it. These guys don't appear on the 6 o'clock news and admit to being evil, genocidal motherfuckers. They claim to be saving lives, countering terrorism, fighting for freedom etc... Countries with extremist ideologies like Israel tend to isolate themselves from foreign media. They form little geographical bubbles of madness.

       Yes, I hear you on that, but the thing about the Israelis is that they're artists at deception and they also have very ruthless lawyers and a lot of political sway in the US. The UN has genuinely tried to bring legal cases against Israel before, but they've been able to shut them down.

       This isn't a thread about "bad" or "good". It's a thread about UN membership, and those two countries are UN member nations.

       If you want to talk about countries that need to be kicked out of the UN for their civil rights record, start with the biggest offenders and work your way down. Otherwise people might think you're operating under some kind of bias.

       You used the word conspiracy, champ, not me. I used the word impartial. For someone who harps on reading comprehension you have some work to do. If you think all injustice is a result of conspiracies rather than bias, incompetence or short-sighted self-interest, you give people way more credit than they deserve.

       You'll find that extremist groups such as the Israelis find it extremely easy to accumulate power, for the simply reason that it is their fundamental goal. Most ordinary people don't have aspirations about manipulating the entire world, and so they never become politically organised.

       This isn't a thread about "bad" or "good". It's a thread about UN membership, and those two countries are UN member nations.

       If you want to talk about countries that need to be kicked out of the UN for their civil rights record, start with the biggest offenders and work your way down. Otherwise people might think you're operating under some kind of bias.
