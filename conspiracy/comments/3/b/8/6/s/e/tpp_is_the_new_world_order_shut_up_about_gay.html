<p>We shouldn&#39;t get the police involved because they aren&#39;t on our side anymore. They don&#39;t protect the people from the government, they protect the government from the people. The only way we can have success is if we peacefully and legally make an annoying ruckus. Emphasis on the peacefully and legally because we&#39;re already labeled crazy in the eyes of the general public so the smallest of slipups gives the msm free reign to discredit our entire operation.</p>

<p>the legitimate protesters will outnumber the provocateurs.  As in other recent protests, it will be easy to recognize them by their behavior. Everyone has a high-quality video/still camera on them at all times. Call the provocateurs out, surround them, force them to break character/reveal themselves and take video/photos.</p>

<p>There have been leaks of potions of the proposed TPP by Wikileaks. No politician has denied the truthfulness of the leaked documents. They merely downplay the severity, trying to portray it in a positive light. There will be no positive outcomes, unless you are part of the .00001% and a majority owner of a giant multinational corporation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reid v. Covert tested an executive agreement.  Not a treaty.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Article VI of the US Constitution</a> however, says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; <strong>and all treaties made,</strong> or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, <strong>shall be the supreme law of the land;</strong> <strong><em>and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.</em></strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Reid v. Covert, SCOTUS said: &quot;This Court has regularly and uniformly recognized the supremacy of the Constitution over a treaty.&quot;</p>

<p><em>That</em> is very clear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve completely misunderstood that section of the Constitution. Thankfully, SCOTUS has repeatedly made it clear that the Constitution comes first. Reread that paragraph. It doesn&#39;t even slightly imply that treaties supersede the Constitution. It simply says that we must abide by treaties <em>also</em>. However, the Constitution IS the US. Without it, there is no treaty. Any treaty is by necessity secondary to the Constitution.</p>

<p>News is news. 
But really, so many events lately that consume the daily news coverage right after the passage of fast track? Since the timing of the making and release of judgements by the Supreme Court is discretionary, it makes you wonder. Obamacare and gay marriage, both long standing issues, decided now. Who&#39;s coaching these guys?</p>

<p>However In the us the fast tracking means that it will be debated a maximum of 3 months and there will only be a yay or a nay (no changes are allowed at that point). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An example of this (that was probably the inspiration for the agreement) was a lawsuit between a cigarette company and I believe either Australia or New Zealand. In summary, the government wanted to dissuade it&#39;s people from buying cigarettes so they made a law that packages had to be labeled in gruesome pictures of lung cancer and rotten teeth to make sure that the consumer was well educated about the effects of smoking before they made the purchase. I believe there was also a heavy tax on cigarettes too but I&#39;m not sure, this is all from memory. </p>

<p>Basically the cigarette companies sued the government because they were costing them sales with their laws. I don&#39;t think they won but that&#39;s the type of power this agreement is trying to give to corporations. The ability to manipulate the laws of it&#39;s cooperating countries at will for their own monetary gain. I personally do not believe that power over so many countries should be given to a group that blatantly shows no concern for anyone but themselves.</p>

<p>Did you <em>really</em> just say that? You have the balls to post a thread screaming in all caps and you don&#39;t know the first thing about it?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a hint for you: It&#39;s the PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. What do you suppose that world PACIFIC indicates?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you the countries that are participating in this treaty and see if you can&#39;t figure it out.</p>

<ul>
<li>Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States, and Vietnam.</li>

<p>Note: That&#39;s TWELVE countries. Not &quot;all the countries in the world.&quot; See anything those twelve have in common? Just ask me and I&#39;ll tell you; I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t be able to figure it out on your own.</p>

<p>Corporations are not signatories to this treaty. It is not a treaty &quot;between&quot; corporations and countries.</p>

<p>You really should be ashamed of yourself. You make this sub and people legitimately opposed to TPP -- like me -- look like shit. </p>

Not all countries in the world are apart of it and some countries that are not negotiating it (therefore not mentioned in the document explicitly) will be under it&#39;s laws. The agreement is with the entire EU so if the UK stays in, they will be held to it&#39;s regulations regardless of whether or not they have anything to do with it&#39;s passing.

From what has been leaked so far, albeit only a few of the sections, it is clear to me that this trade agreement has the potential of seriously affecting the citizens of the U.S. In a negative way such as never seen before. What has passed so far is a &quot;fast track&quot; provision that will allow the bill to pass on an up or down vote. That means the Senate will need only 51 votes for passage as opposed the 60 that is normally required according to Senate rules. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t you find it more than curious that this is one of the rare cases that the GOP is 100% in support of the President while all but 13 Dems were opposed to fast tracking. As it stands, the TPP is almost guaranteed ratification with very little in put from the citizens of this country. Ratification can only fail if senators are heavily pressured by their constituencies.  </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_Trade_and_Investment_Partnership">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_Trade_and_Investment_Partnership</a></p>

<p>This is the Atlantic version of the TPP. This is a trade agreement of the same breadth of the TPP, but with Europe and the United states. This leaves Africa (no one really gives a shit), South America(there is ongoing discussion of one with them) the middle east, Russia, China (trade relations are normalized however,) and small satellite countries out of the equation. Really everybody else is in on it. This is an unprecedented amount of countries being apart of a &quot;free trade&quot; agreement. If this fails horribly, those countries fail horribly, the world fails horribly.</p>

<p>The fact is that major corporations lobby groups are being given an unprecedented amount of control over what is in the agreement. This is basically collusion.</p>

At least thats what my limited understanding of it is.  I would LOVE to know more but you see this bill that could have huge implications is classified from the people who would be affected and that fact that some of it was leaked is a crime.  That, in the very least, is a huge red flag even if you&#39;re not one to buy into hoaky conspiracy theories.  The fact that this government is supposedly by and for the people yet we the people have NO say and don&#39;t even get to read this. </p>

<p>If you write letters to the editor laced with stupid mistakes like that, then yes, you will be dismissed as a kook.</p>

<p>OP is probably a disinfo agent working FOR the people pushing TPP, and his job is to discredit the movement with his hysteria and his lies.</p>

There&#39;s really not a lot of direct action to take, action that would need to be completed by a lot of people on a large scale over time. years. this would need a popular movement where people actually did something like show up to Caucus and elect themselves and othe r people to office. not protest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gave you an upvote, but I&#39;m curious if anyone could tell me how does TPP eliminate the market for generic pharmaceutical products? Without getting grossly into the nuance of it all (orphan drug designation, ANDA freezes through litigation, Hatch-Waxman extensions, variations in R&amp;D duration, etc.) the way it works currently is that generally the effective life of a patent on a pharmaceutical product is 10-15 years after which (again without getting into the nuance of challenges to those patents, authorized generics, international variation of patent law, or the 180 exclusivity of first to file generics, etc.) generic manufacturers release generic versions, the branded original loses massive profit margin and as more generics come to market the generics begin to lose margin as well. </p>

<p>First, I&#39;m trying to imagine what could be in the TPP that would alter this process to the degree that one could say &quot;goodbye generics&quot;? Pulling these out of my ass as examples but, are we talking like 40 year patent terms, alterations to the acceptability of bioequivalence in the generic approval process? I seem to remember reading there were potential changes with regards to generic labeling in the works that would create future potential liability issues, some issues with using authorized generic rights in place of cash settlements on litigation, but nothing overly extreme. Second, my mind is racing even trying to grasp all the repercussions of a market devoid of potential generic and/or biosimilar competition. Like, it feels like electric is zapping my brain even trying to picture that. </p>

<p>I have a pretty good understanding of what TPP encompasses in a general way, but it feels like a new heinous detail comes out of it every time I turn around. I guess that&#39;s what happens when you fucking hide a major piece of legislation from the public as if it&#39;s a plot to murder everyone.</p>

<p>The reason people are misled (not &quot;mislead&quot;) is because you are spreading misinformation. Your posts are filled with errors, or lies. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re just ignorant, or if you are actively trying to sabotage opposite to TPP. In either case, YOU are the reason people aren&#39;t getting the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TV isn&#39;t the most powerful form of media anymore because people have Netflix and Hulu and can get all of their news online now. I do think getting on TV would be very beneficial which is why I suggested petitioning the news stations to show the content on air. However, this isn&#39;t doomed to fail without televised coverage because online media is just as prevalent these days. If you have a suggestion of how to get on TV other that the steps I provided, though, I would love to add them to my post.</p>

<p>Equality? That&#39;s what you call it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Um... yeah. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nobody is saying that gays don&#39;t have right to be married</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure they are, including 4 Supreme Court justices, Free Republic and Red State. And Fred Phelps&#39; grave probably exploded.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s up to the states to decide based on a vote</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, the Supreme Court of the United States of America (and lots of lower courts) said no, it&#39;s not. Civil rights of a minority are not to up to vote by the majority. States can&#39;t violate the Constitution. It&#39;s also in the Consitution that licenses in one state should be valid in all states. That&#39;s why you don&#39;t need 50 drivers&#39; licenses or marriage licenses. It wasn&#39;t until 1967 that Loving vs. West Virginia struck down laws against interracial marriage and during that time on a drive down South you could be married in one state, not married the next, then married again when you crossed the border. That&#39;s not a tenable situation if we&#39;re really one country.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>not some 9 unelected, unaccountable supreme court justices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, that IS the role of the Supreme Court. They&#39;re the final interpreter of the Constitution and they interpreted based on the reasons outlined above as well as the equal protection clause (laws apply to all or none). </p>

<p>By your &quot;thinking&quot;, your freedom of speech is up to popular vote and 9 unelected, unaccountable supreme court justices shouldn&#39;t be able to say whether you can or can&#39;t be thrown in prison for speaking your mind or whether this or that NSA policy is an invasion of privacy or whether you can be thrown in Guantanamo indefinitely.</p>

<p>Boy, you people here blow your gasket about free speech and Ellen Pao and trade deals and the NSA, but suddenly when the Supreme Court makes a proper, rational ruling it&#39;s &quot;who are they and this pesky Constitution I keep hearing about&quot;? </p>

<p>No way does the Tpp and Gay marriage have equally consequences.</p>

<p>Well. Except for all 21 Republican presidential candidates, and nearly all GOP rank and file. Conservatives from coast to coast are saying that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s up to the states to decide </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you ever get some spare time, familiarize yourself with the 14th Amendment. You should read the whole Constitution, but until you have time for that, just check out the 14th. It will explain why you&#39;re wrong about how this is a state issue.</p>

<p>Oh heck, I&#39;ll post it right here for you: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incidentally, this is the same language that keeps states from infringing the 2nd amendment, or violating the 1st amendment.</p>

<p>True, but does buying a used chair a a yard sale boost the profits of any corporation whatsoever? Maybe oil companies because of the gasoline, but you were gonna spend that gas anyway going to Home Depot for a new chair! &quot;Involvement&quot; and profits are two completely separate things. If this idea caught on, the corporations would be forced to significantly increase planned obsolescence to the point of it being very obvious to everyone, which should decrease the number of consumers because they would be outraged.</p>

<p>You&#39;re saying that all corrupt corporations would receive the exact same profits in world A where everyone buys as many used items as possible and world B where everyone buys everything new? </p>

<p>How am I a hypocrite? I never said that I buy 0 percent new items because that&#39;s nearly impossible, and how would you even know if I bought this computer used from a garage sale or not? Why would you even have a problem with somebody trying to cut down on landfill waste and corporate profits? What the fuck?</p>

<p>I do really well buying things on craigslist, garage sales, salvation army, etc. None of that money goes to the profits of any corporation. And it&#39;s cheaper. </p>

<p>I also ride my bike to any locations nearby that I normally use a vehicle for as long as weather permits it. I could seriously go on all day about how easy it is to have a great life without supporting mega corporations. Most people are simply too lazy to take 5 minutes and creatively meditate on how they will proceed with protesting. I protest all day every day. How about you?</p>

<p>I think the major problem here is that 99 percent of the people in this sub and elsewhere who cry about corruption can&#39;t separate themselves from their consumerist addiction. They are addicts who give money to people that they then cry about. It&#39;s pretty funny, actually. </p>

If we all did that, we would run out of stuff really fast. That&#39;s like saying one vegan will stop the slaughter of animals for food. If that&#39;s what you believe and want to do, it&#39;s fine but the major corporations probably don&#39;t notice or care. </p>

<p>Business isn&#39;t a problem. Corrupt government giving power to corrupt business is. If we were to take the salaries of the billionaire CEOs and give that money to the employees, everybody would have jobs and be able to only work a few hours a day and everyone would be happy. It&#39;s the fact that the CEOs want to line their pockets with even more money and become even more greedy that we have this issue. </p>

<p>I am 100 percent anti-vegan, but I&#39;ll use your argument anyway.</p>

<p>If 95 percent of people became vegans, then the slaughtering of animals would slow down to a trickle. Using this same argument, if 95 percent of people educated themselves on which corporations use slave labor, pollute the environment, etc, then these corporations would be forced to produce goods that they can market as &quot;slavery free&quot; or &quot;pollution-free.&quot; If 95 percent of people educated themselves on planned obsolescence, then corporations would be forced to produce &quot;PO-free&quot; goods. We already see this with &quot;fair trade&quot; and &quot;humanely raised.&quot; Whether or not these terms are used correctly by the corporations, or whether they paid government officials for the regulations to be lax, is another story. It would then come down to the consumers again to educate themselves about the lax regulations, or corporations simply lying, etc. </p>

<p>The alternative is to &quot;call your local representative,&quot; which will do literally nothing unless you pay the government official more than the corporation in bribes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m American so I&#39;m not as informed on European government as I should be therefore I didn&#39;t want to make any assumptions. The American government is already on it&#39;s way down since our dollar isn&#39;t worth anything, unemployment and welfare rates are slowly going up, and half the country is using Obamacare which the next president could vote out causing people that can&#39;t afford it to switch to private insurance which if timed out with a stock market crash (even if it&#39;s just a minor one) could cripple the American economy to a near unrecoverable state. That&#39;s why I feel that taking action on this issue is so urgent. We are that close to losing the American dollar and if we&#39;re already making world government laws, it would be an easy step to make a one world currency that everyone would be supporting. One world government, one world currency, one world leader. There are people in this very thread calling me crazy but it really could happen that fast.</p>

<p>His response was along the lines of &quot;Good, we can&#39;t keep bailing them out when they lose money.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s sad but you have to fight fire with fire. That&#39;s the reason I made this post in all caps with a subtle level of almost fear mongering. That&#39;s how the msm gets the attention of the masses so that&#39;s what they respond to. People are raised with an egoic viewpoint where they don&#39;t care about anything that doesn&#39;t affect them directly. So you have to overcome this with the same scare tactics that the msm uses but with the truth about the TPP. I&#39;ve listed off the main points of the IP chapter of the TPP in the OP so go through those and find which ones you think would get the attention of the people and start with that. Look at the tumblr feminism movements and the obesity and LGBTQ acceptance movements. People have no problem protesting and standing up for something as long as they feel they will be getting something out of it.</p>

<p>That post is essentially me digging deep and channeling that inner great leader in me to get people&#39;s attention the best way possible.

<p>That is melodramatic.</p>

<p>Regardless, Gay marriage has been an ongoing issue for decades. It is a serious issue about human rights instead of a distraction from TPP. Activists like me have been fighting for Gay marriage in Texas for many years. </p>

<p>Despite my activism for Gay marriage, I still contacted my state legislators about TPP, signed petitions, etc. Just because some cannot follow more than one issue at a time does not mean the rest of cannot do that. </p>

<p>Also, the majority of Americans support TPP regardless of the valid viewpoints against it on this subreddit.  So every timeline and Twitter feed probably will not cover the TPP as you think it should.  </p>

<p>What, someone paid the Supreme Court justices and all of the parties involved to have a decision right now just to distract attention that didn&#39;t exist for a trade agreement that also doesn&#39;t exist yet?</p>

<p>This is absolute, complete hubris and delusions of grandeur. My cause is so important that everything from historic Supreme Court decisions to the weather are being engineered to distract from it! It&#39;s just not possible that I could be wrong!</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a trade agreement; we know what it is. We&#39;ve been through this before but you&#39;re probably too young to remember or possibly even been born yet (NAFTA). People right now are just inventing imaginary things about TPP and getting themselves worked up over nothing. An historic moment in the civil rights history of the United States occurs that we should all remember where we were when we heard and it bizarrely gets dismissed as a &quot;distraction&quot; from your own obsession. That&#39;s a shame. I&#39;m old enough to remember when gays couldn&#39;t serve in the military and were actively hunted out, when professions like teachers kept quiet about their sexuality for fear of dismissal (it being legal to be fired for being gay in almost every state at that time, and it&#39;s still legal in several today), when landlords wouldn&#39;t rent to gay people, when &quot;f*g&quot; was dropped in casual conversation (and even movies!) and when being in the closet was the norm. Gay people got as much love from mainstream politicians, religious or corporations as ISIS gets in America today. Hell, I remember when two Sims being allowed to &quot;move in together&quot; in The SIms 1 generated significant controversy! </p>

<p>What happened today was an incredible, historic event for this country that, as Obama said, makes us all a little more free. It&#39;s not some road bump in your ideological obsession. A couple got a marriage license in Texas today that they&#39;ve been waiting for for FIFTY-FIVE YEARS. I started getting teary-eyed as I typed that. Who the heck are you to write &quot; If you can multi-task, that&#39;s awesome...&quot;? That&#39;s effing AWESOME, period. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No. No, you&#39;re not. You look at the entire world through a set of ideological blinders in which every action, no matter how benign, is to be interpreted as invisible machinations of powerful unseen hands that you,and only you, are enlightened enough to realize (and I&#39;m a former conspiracy addict so don&#39;t try to BS me that it&#39;s not). Your Alex Jones and Infowars and Rense.com and Coast To Coast web pages run articles from anonymous sources that paint some sort of wild-eyed story about a trade agreement THAT&#39;S NOT FINISHED and NO ONE OUTSIDE THE NEGOTIATORS HAS SEEN YET. It fits your worldview so you buy into it hook, line and sinker. You then get so worked up that you compare youself to the freedom fighters of Tianemen Square (something I&#39;m also old enough to remember first hand, as well as the collapse of Commmunisn across Eastern Europe). I knew people who risked death escaping East Germany in a false trunk of car. Sorry, you folks are not at their level nor is your cause even remotely comparable.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>B<em>lls</em>*t. Wikipedia source for that? Of course not. That&#39;s just your extremist ideology talking, the same way Richard Stallman told me not being able to make a copy of a DVD for a friend was &quot;immoral&quot; or conservatives claiming marriage equality is the death of democracy in America. It&#39;s overblown hystrionics, paranoia and simply making up facts to suit your worldview/narrative. </p>

<p>Again, I knew people who lived in REAL Communist dictatorships. How dare you dimish their experiences by spewing this kind of nonsense. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If it wasn&#39;t something ridiculous that you just made up, they wouldn&#39;t support it for a second. </p>

<p>Seriously - take a deep breath and a step back and gain some perspective here. You&#39;re allowing yourself to become hysterical over something that, even if it were true, you couldn&#39;t do anything about and woudln&#39;t affect your life anyway. Here&#39;s what works for me: ask yourself (sometimes out loud helps), &quot;Is this the MOST likely explanation or the LEAST likely explanation?&quot; I find this helps put things in perspective and realize when a claim is improbable and thus needs Sagan&#39;s &quot;extraordinary evidence&quot;. Then you often find it doesn&#39;t even have regular evidence, but without that perspective you wouldn&#39;t have gone looking for any evidence at all because it told you what you wanted to/already believed. </p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>The only complaint you have is about my melodramatic tone but that&#39;s just your opinion and you&#39;re trying to pass it off as a way to discredit what I&#39;m saying.</p>

<p>What?  That&#39;s all in your head, man. lol.  Trying to &quot;discredit&quot; what you&#39;re saying?  Where am I trying to do that?  I&#39;m literally TELLING you that you have valid points.  Wow, man.  Come on.  You&#39;re beginning to sound like a paranoid type.  I&#39;m telling you you have valid points, but you discredit YOURSELF with how you present them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I did go a little heavy on the Braveheart style speech but I felt it was necessary to get people&#39;s attention and really start a movement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Na, man.  You will NEVER start <em>any</em> movement just by anything that you type out in a computer on <em>reddit</em>.  I mean COME ON.  If what you <em>really</em> want to do is start a movement, then you have to do a LOOOOT more than that.</p>

<p>Wanting to do the right thing and inform people is a GOOD thing, and I&#39;m not trying to dissuade you from that, but there are better ways of doing it than what you did is what I&#39;m saying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It doesn&#39;t matter whether or not you like how I talk</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  It really doesn&#39;t in the bigger scheme of things.  You&#39;re right.  I&#39;m often guilty of having my message get lost in how I deliver it too though, so I&#39;m also aware that <em>sometimes</em> it&#39;s not a horrible idea to try to say things in a manner that people will more likely take seriously instead of roll their eyes at.  Just saying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>all that matters is the information</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On a certain level, yes.  This isn&#39;t incorrect.  However, there is indeed some information whose meaning is effected by how the info is presented.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(which you yourself said wasn&#39;t horrible)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it isn&#39;t.  I still stand behind that.  Data&#39;s data in and of itself.  The TPP issue <em>is a MAJOR</em> issue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and that this gets people&#39;s attention and they do something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah but, like I said in previous posts, a lot of people might look at your OP and go &quot;Dude, stfu w/this.  GTFO.&quot; just because you&#39;re going so over the top in how you&#39;re saying certain things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s got 13 upvotes as I&#39;m typing this so I&#39;d say it&#39;s going according to plan.</p>

<p>Okay.  Fair enough.  I&#39;d imagine it would have gotten less downvotes, however, without the hyperbolic presentation, but okay.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apparently this community is full of great people, they just aren&#39;t usually the ones that leave comments.</p>

<p>What?  That seems like a just...not a very good, intelligent comment on your part.  Generalizations like that are <em>not</em> a good thing.  But, again, okay...</p>

Like long conversations where I explain what&#39;s going on and the implications for them since they don&#39;t know the internet much beyond Google and Facebook. They get the point and understand usually with a &quot;that&#39;s total bullshit&quot;. And that&#39;s the end of it. </p>

<p>Today as people were hooting about the confederate flag and gay marriage, I said &quot;convenient timing for TPP&quot;. They were interested so I explained it a bit then showed a few articles on TPP. After initially being pissed off about it, the conversation switched back to &quot;the civil war wasn&#39;t about slavery&quot; after I said the crap on the news is distracting everyone. All I said after that was &quot;See? It&#39;s working perfectly&quot;</p>

But every time I&#39;ve talked about anything which we here or the Internet finds important, most people get pissed for a moment then go back to bitching about whatever it is that pisses them off more as soon as possible. I guess it&#39;s just human nature, but it&#39;s predictable and being exploited. It&#39;s a numbers game, fewer people care about the &quot;big&quot; issues compared to emotion based socially dividing &quot;issues&quot;. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not fun to talk about for most people since it&#39;s basically like history or social science classes in high school. Being &quot;free&quot; adults they get to choose what they want to talk and think about and &quot;drama&quot; like gay marriage and confederate flags is going to win out every single time. For the next few days you will be able to derail any conversation by mentioning it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s always been game over. We lost before any of us were even born. It&#39;s our collective nature that doomed us. Best we can hope for is to be wrong and worst is to say &quot;told you so&quot;. Not that anyone will really care then either. </p>

<p>I said &quot;convenient timing for TPP&quot;. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s when rational people stopped listening to you because you were implicitly positing an completely unbelievable and unworkable conspiracy in which mass murder and Supreme Court decisions were somehow engineered to distract people from an agreement that doesn&#39;t exist yet and hence doesn&#39;t do anything yet that anyone knows about beyond conjecture.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and &quot;drama&quot; like gay marriage and confederate flags</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People&#39;s human rights aren&#39;t &quot;drama&quot;. The Confederate flag is a symptom, not a problem. Maybe silly, pointless, undisclosed trade agreements that will never affect anyone in the real world aren&#39;t as important as whether you can visit your spouse in the ICU in a hospital or whether you can go to church without needing to bring a sidearm? </p>

<p>These rants always seem to consider only two possibilities: you agree with me, or you&#39;re too biased/blind/dumb/ignorant to agree with me. Maybe, just maybe, you&#39;re the one getting worked up over &quot;drama&quot; and ignoring the real, immediate serious problems of discrimination, be it sexuality or race?</p>

<p>I&#39;d normally agree with you, if it were the basis of the conversation. The news was covering it so I used that as an intro to make people aware of TPP. They never heard of it so the rest of the conversation was about TPP until it switched to confederate talk after they voiced their very real displeasure to its details. Maybe it&#39;s just poor timing, but any timing is poor to talk about tech or TPP type topics since so few people have any background on it to draw from, and therefor have no opinion to get emotional with. Hence the point of my rant. Who the hell really wants to spend their free time talking about, or rather, being educated on patent laws, trade agreements, or internet traffic after they spent all week/day working? Almost no one. Everyone has an opinion on gay marriage/race which makes it easy and &quot;fun&quot; to talk about. </p>

<p>Being that you&#39;re trying to derail the conversation by switching topics with some emotion-bait, I&#39;ll wrap up quick. You&#39;re in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, for trying to downplay TPP or just about <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> fodder by using a logical fallacy, I award you no points. </p>

How will it be easier when they are controlling our methods of communication so that we can&#39;t rally together on social media and on forums like this? They put a &quot;You can&#39;t screw Israel&quot; clause in it, why wouldn&#39;t they put an &quot;it&#39;s illegal to rebel against the TPP&quot; clause in it too? </p>

<p>People are saying that they are too powerful now so it&#39;s not worth it but that&#39;s a lie, an illusion, that they are spreading to cover their asses. The truth is they will only be too powerful if TPP goes through and that&#39;s only going to happen if we let it.</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t passing these laws without us. We are just as much apart of the decision making process as they are. It&#39;s just that they make their vote publicly and you&#39;re making your vote right now in silence when you choose whether or not to join us in the fight.</p>

The agreement is with the entire EU so if the UK stays in, they will be held to it&#39;s regulations regardless of whether or not they have anything to do with it&#39;s passing.

    <div class="md"><p>The use of &quot;all caps&quot; is absolutely justified in this instance is absolutely justified. From what has been leaked so far, albeit only a few of the sections, it is clear to me that this trade agreement has the potential of seriously affecting the citizens of the U.S. In a negative way such as never seen before. What has passed so far is a &quot;fast track&quot; provision that will allow the bill to pass on an up or down vote. That means the Senate will need only 51 votes for passage as opposed the 60 that is normally required according to Senate rules. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t you find it more than curious that this is one of the rare cases that the GOP is 100% in support of the President while all but 13 Dems were opposed to fast tracking. As it stands, the TPP is almost guaranteed ratification with very little in put from the citizens of this country. Ratification can only fail if senators are heavily pressured by their constituencies.  </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_Trade_and_Investment_Partnership">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_Trade_and_Investment_Partnership</a></p>

<p>This is the Atlantic version of the TPP. This is a trade agreement of the same breadth of the TPP, but with Europe and the United states. This leaves Africa (no one really gives a shit), South America(there is ongoing discussion of one with them) the middle east, Russia, China (trade relations are normalized however,) and small satellite countries out of the equation. Really everybody else is in on it. This is an unprecedented amount of countries being apart of a &quot;free trade&quot; agreement. If this fails horribly, those countries fail horribly, the world fails horribly.</p>

<p>The fact is that major corporations lobby groups are being given an unprecedented amount of control over what is in the agreement. This is basically collusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you buy, whether it comes from a yard sale,  or farmer&#39;s market, or fucking Oxfam has involvement with a corrupt corporation. Whether it be the the vehicle they use, the clothes they wear, the metal used in the container that holds the organic beeswax they buy. Has cooperation from a corporation. Because no one is Amish anymore. Sorry, but I derive real pleasure from exposing the hypocrisy of sanctimonious, self righteous, and myopic &#39;revolutionaries&#39; 
Or perhaps they forget the slave labor that went into constructing their favorite Internet access  device.</p>
