      <p>
       Just so you know where I'm coming from, I'm not a great fan of her, and would rather see Sanders than a lapdog of the Israeli lobby in the WH, but this grasping at straws campaign shouldn't be necessary, and frankly doesn't seem to be in the spirit of his bid.

       How did I admit my own ignorance without having posted anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't get it.  Do you mean that she didn't write the title of her own op-ed that is in the first person?  Is that your point?  Because that seems unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       What it looks like to me is OP pointed out that you said she didn't say what she picked as the title of her op-ed and that you then diverted the discussion to something pointless avoid addressing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just so you know where I'm coming from, I think the Shillary thing is stupid too.  It's juvenile and not even clever.  Still the only error in what OP quoted was that it should have had how or ellipses at the beginning.  The ellipses he used did not distort or conceal the intent of the op-ed title.

       I meant OP and the name calling, but I guess you're right. Hillary absolutely states in the article title that she has unbreakable ties to Netanyahu. The only error was that he should have put the ellipsis like so: "[...]". Hillary just loves the occupation, the settlements, the human rights violations, the apartheid and all the rest, and above all she adores very much Netanyahu. M'kay?

       I just thought it was sarcasm because your initial statement seems to imply that all the other candidates

       No he doesn’t.  Forgive my incredulity, but my feeling is that A) he’s only saying that to try to get in office, upon which we will do exactly
       <em>
        jack shit
       </em>
       (fuck Sanders and all others presidents that lie and say “I’m going to do ‘A’ when I get in office!” and then do the exact opposite.  Fuck them.), and B) if he gets in and

       do what he says - or even
       <em>

      <p>
       $6 Trillion saved and 10,000's of dead children averted is a safe line, I'd say.

        I gotta say, your thinking that things have been "so different" with Obama as president rather than any of the other puppet candidates indicates that you're pretty irreconcilably lost.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       i'm open... how would you define "so different" ?

       You really think a different candidate is what would stop the war train from moving forward?  You really think that the tax dollars that have been spent on the war machine
       <em>
        wouldn’t
       </em>
       be spent on the war machine if “this” verses “that” candidate would be elected?  Really?

       The candidates, ultimately AREN'T different.  That's the actual point.

       And "Come on, man" is my answer because that's all I could come up with to you (or anybody at this point) thinking what you're thinking:  That any current candidate or president is anything other than a puppet to the corporate bankers.

       I consistently see people on this sub talk about how Sanders is "just another Jew." Which makes no sense, because as you pointed out, he is working his ass off to break up the banks. If he was a puppet of the banks, why would he be trying to break them up?
