       It seems Alex finally was given his script for '16 elections.  He was basically worshipping trump in a Wednesday interview an claims 90% of his listeners are trump supporters.  So much for the last 3 years of Alex supporting Rand.  If it's not obvious enough that jones is a shill by now I don't know what else to tell you.

       Well Alex Jones isn't dumb, he's smart enough to know who butters his bread and play the conductor in his echo chamber. His listeners like Trump, so he's just going along.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surprised he doesn't support Bernie Sanders but then again he's in Texas and a right winger and Bernie is an Independent on the Democratic platform.
      </p>
      <p>
       AJ and his listeners hate the Clinton's, so it's strange they don't defeat Hillary from even getting the nomination by backing Bernie. And if Bernie isn't nominated then obviously back Trump. He won't support Ben Carson though, because some extreme Jews don't think black people are human.

       Show me another candidate running that will tell the Israeli lobby, and every other lobby that their not interested in their money, and one that refuses to accept donations from anyone, and I will gladly support them.

      <p>
       Donald Trump, the leading presidential candidate would not go on the Alex Jones show if he didn't believe what AJ is saying is not the truth. Same with Matt Drudge.
      </p>
      <p>
       This country is in big, big trouble and it's time we started supporting the people like AJ who have been ringing the alarm bells now for years, decades even.

       Have you done your research?  Trump is a big fan of israel and zionists.  Go look it up.  In the interview with Jones he even lied and said its China getting all the oil from ISIS, when its actually israel.  Trump didnt mention israel once.

       Again, please show me another candidate that is willing to tell the Jewish lobby that he's not interested in their money, and one who is not willing to accept any donations from any lobby, and I'll gladly support them.  Trump has taken the lobbyists and special interests completely out of the equation in his campaign.  This is unprecedented, and nobody else running can say this.

       At the end of the day we do not elect the president, they are selected for us. I do not buy into the lesser of evils bullshit. Trump is no different than any other candidate. I'm not for anyone and frankly not voting or participating in this corrupt piece of shit system. I suggest all do the same.

       Except he is.  He's not accepting donations from anyone.  He has taken the lobbyists and special interests out of the equation.  If you feel that the elections are completely rigged, that is your right, and I would never hold that against you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that by Donald Trump appearing on the Alex Jones show, that there is actually hope in what he would do if he got elected.  If enough people rally around him and support him, which they already are (if you believe these polls that are coming out) then there's no way that they can steal that away.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is a breath of fresh air IMO.  He's not a politician, he's a business man, a very successful businessman at that.  He knows how to make this country great again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't a supporter of his until he appeared on the Alex Jones show actually.  Now, I'm all in.

       FFS, you are not understanding what I am saying. Even if he is "different" (which I don't think he is), it doesn't FUCKING matter. He wont get in, and if he does and shakes the boat up too much, they'll give him the JFK treatment. The intelligence agencies run the government. The politicians are puppets and only there to give the populous the illusion of democracy. Damn, are you new to this?

       I'm not sure what is bothering you so much, but if you look through our discussion, I have been completely rational and objective, while avoiding to even downvote you, despite you downvoting me every time I comment.

       Because your lack of understanding of what/who Alex Jones is, is tiring. Alex Jones is a Zionist shill/gatekeeper. He's a snake oil sales man, and so is Trump. You say because Trump went on his show, Trump is legit. There is no rationality in that. Trump is a billionaire. He is a part of the establishment, yet you think he isn't because he is using his own money. That is a child like understanding of things. I'm not mad at you, I just feel like I'm talking to a wall. No when to reach out, no when to end the conversation. It's going nowhere and you clearly haven't done your research. So, as I said, gnite sir/madam.

       I am not mad at you either sir/madam.  I am not one who is completely set in my ways and can't be persuaded into believing other points of view either.  That's why I comment and post here actually, I hope for other people to challenge me on my views, and explain, in a non-aggressive, cordial way how I'm wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just seems that you have taken it to this angry, combative level that I was not expecting (hence you downvoting me on every comment I've made here).
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not even arguing with you that Alex Jones may be a gatekeeper of some sort, but still you shouldn't argue that he is spitting more truth on a daily basis then just about anyone else.  Of course he is not able to go deep into reality as most of the people here believe, they would Kennedy his ass.  He is the one who woke me up in the first place, and I will always respect him for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was a bleeding heart liberal up until the Boston Marathon Bombings, he is singularly the one that woke me up out of my stupor, and blindness.  Yes, he didn't go as far as he should have, but he set meow on the right path, and I found the truth for myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is a patriot I feel.  Much more then CNN, or any other Mainstream media outlet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I think Trump is completely legitimate?  No. But he certainly has taken lobbyists, and special interests out of the equation like no other political candidate has ever done.  That is not even up for debate, he has returned donations to people that have given him money.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still believe that this country is the land of opportunity, and those who have enough ambition and drive can make it, and make it big in this country.  He is an example of this, and it should resonate with everyone in this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to start a fight with you by any means, I was just a little put off by your aggressiveness and instant down votes, that's all.

       Trump is working for the same faction of Financial Zionists that Netanyahu works for. That's why he and Bibi are butt buddies.

       Bernie Sanders may be Jew but most of his policies are country first. Clinton supports Bibi, Bernie's doesn't. Sanders is the candidate Ron Paul supporters need to support, not Rand since he's not high up enough in polls.
