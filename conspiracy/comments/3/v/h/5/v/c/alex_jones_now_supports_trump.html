    <div class="md"><p>Well Alex Jones isn&#39;t dumb, he&#39;s smart enough to know who butters his bread and play the conductor in his echo chamber. His listeners like Trump, so he&#39;s just going along. </p>

<p>Surprised he doesn&#39;t support Bernie Sanders but then again he&#39;s in Texas and a right winger and Bernie is an Independent on the Democratic platform. </p>

<p>AJ and his listeners hate the Clinton&#39;s, so it&#39;s strange they don&#39;t defeat Hillary from even getting the nomination by backing Bernie. And if Bernie isn&#39;t nominated then obviously back Trump. He won&#39;t support Ben Carson though, because some extreme Jews don&#39;t think black people are human. </p>

<p>Except he is.  He&#39;s not accepting donations from anyone.  He has taken the lobbyists and special interests out of the equation.  If you feel that the elections are completely rigged, that is your right, and I would never hold that against you.</p>

<p>I think that by Donald Trump appearing on the Alex Jones show, that there is actually hope in what he would do if he got elected.  If enough people rally around him and support him, which they already are (if you believe these polls that are coming out) then there&#39;s no way that they can steal that away.</p>

<p>He is a breath of fresh air IMO.  He&#39;s not a politician, he&#39;s a business man, a very successful businessman at that.  He knows how to make this country great again.  </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t a supporter of his until he appeared on the Alex Jones show actually.  Now, I&#39;m all in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because your lack of understanding of what/who Alex Jones is, is tiring. Alex Jones is a Zionist shill/gatekeeper. He&#39;s a snake oil sales man, and so is Trump. You say because Trump went on his show, Trump is legit. There is no rationality in that. Trump is a billionaire. He is a part of the establishment, yet you think he isn&#39;t because he is using his own money. That is a child like understanding of things. I&#39;m not mad at you, I just feel like I&#39;m talking to a wall. No when to reach out, no when to end the conversation. It&#39;s going nowhere and you clearly haven&#39;t done your research.

    <div class="md"><p>I am not mad at you either sir/madam.  I am not one who is completely set in my ways and can&#39;t be persuaded into believing other points of view either.  That&#39;s why I comment and post here actually, I hope for other people to challenge me on my views, and explain, in a non-aggressive, cordial way how I&#39;m wrong.</p>

<p>It just seems that you have taken it to this angry, combative level that I was not expecting (hence you downvoting me on every comment I&#39;ve made here).</p>

<p>I am not even arguing with you that Alex Jones may be a gatekeeper of some sort, but still you shouldn&#39;t argue that he is spitting more truth on a daily basis then just about anyone else.  Of course he is not able to go deep into reality as most of the people here believe, they would Kennedy his ass.  He is the one who woke me up in the first place, and I will always respect him for that.</p>

<p>I was a bleeding heart liberal up until the Boston Marathon Bombings, he is singularly the one that woke me up out of my stupor, and blindness.  Yes, he didn&#39;t go as far as he should have, but he set meow on the right path, and I found the truth for myself.</p>

<p>He is a patriot I feel.  Much more then CNN, or any other Mainstream media outlet.   </p>

<p>Do I think Trump is completely legitimate?  No. But he certainly has taken lobbyists, and special interests out of the equation like no other political candidate has ever done.  That is not even up for debate, he has returned donations to people that have given him money.  </p>

<p>I still believe that this country is the land of opportunity, and those who have enough ambition and drive can make it, and make it big in this country.  He is an example of this, and it should resonate with everyone in this country.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to start a fight with you by any means, I was just a little put off by your aggressiveness and instant down votes, that&#39;s all.</p>
