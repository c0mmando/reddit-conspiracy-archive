<p>It seems that this attack has both elements of terrorism and workplace violence. even if you chaulk it up to workplace violence and a gun control play, these guys were still armed to the teeth, with pipe bombs etc. Its not as simply as workplace violence. </p>

<p>What if what really happened here is that they were targets of for one of FBIs operations where they set up the couple with a plan, the weapons, etc and had been working them for months with the goal of &quot;stopping the attack&quot; right before it happens just like they have been doing the last few years. That is FBIs M.O.</p>

<p>But it went horribly wrong. FBI <em>did</em> radicalize these folks, except they decided themselves to act early. They got angry and decided to just go ahead and start early. Who cares? They plan on dying anyways. Why wait for a specific plan or date when they are angry and ready <em>right now</em>.</p>

<p>I cant make sense of this. Especially with what the FBI did today, allowing the apartment to be opened to the public. Did they do it so they could muddy the investigation? So they could later say have deniability? I dunno. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they did it at all. They were most likely involved in some FBI setup and stopped cooperating and then were taken out.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen any pix of dead bodies or blood at the crime scene. The government, the cops and the media have too long a history of lying for anyone to take their word without physical proof.</p>

<p>No where do I see those words posted in this thread till now, and thats from you! Being that I&#39;m in SoCal, myself and everybody here have asked the same thing, with all the helicopters flying overhead during the chase, wheres the footage? It was just a &quot;here ya go&quot; vehicle, body on the ground, than the narrative. 
O&#39; by the way, you will never find the words &quot;false flag&quot; in any comment I&#39;ve made, EVER!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is that rhetorical?  Sure, feel free to discuss whether or not it MIGHT be but no one does that.  It&#39;s immediately assumed it is, which is pretty ridiculous.  And seriously hypocritical to shit on people who don&#39;t think it is when neither side has any evidence (actually evidence leans towards it not being but everyone calls that evidence &#39;shady&#39;).  Just because it&#39;s a conspiracy sub doesn&#39;t mean that everything is a conspiracy.  This subreddit has become a joke in a lot of ways and this is most definitely one of them.  EVERY mass shooting is deemed a hoax or a false flag.  It&#39;s ridiculous.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see it that way.  I see that the sub is called conspiracy and that it is no surprise at all that every event is questioned and discussed as a false flag.  Some people may jump to conclusions, that&#39;s fine, why does it bother you so much?  I&#39;m not sure why you have to get so emotional about it, just state your opinion and your reasons rationally, not insulting anyone, not engaging in arguments, and THAT would make this sub better.  You are acting like the sub isn&#39;t made up of thousands of different people with different opinions but acts in unison.  Now if you think so I don&#39;t know why you are here except to call the sub ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, if I&#39;m taking a stab in the dark (and I am from the little we know), I would guess this was originally done by a foreign intelligence service to draw attention away from Russia&#39;s announcement on Turkey. Then these people were pinned in a cover up and used for everyone&#39;s own agenda in the end. Their story just doesn&#39;t add up, and without this, the focus would be on the very real issues going on abroad. Issues that are starting to make us, and many other countries, look pretty bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like this theory, but...  </p>

<p>Why go to such lengths to cover up such a weak peace of evidence.  </p>

<p>I think the real conspiracy there could actually be the fabrication of Russia&#39;s Turkey/ISIS evidence (pictures of random trucks). </p>

<p>It&#39;s awfully convenient Putin just happened to run across this evidence so soon after the airspace incident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t possibly see how anyone could accept a new mother as a terrorist. There&#39;s no narrative to say the suspects did it. Maybe someone else did it and then the FBI blamed it on muslims? Or maybe it never happened.</p>
