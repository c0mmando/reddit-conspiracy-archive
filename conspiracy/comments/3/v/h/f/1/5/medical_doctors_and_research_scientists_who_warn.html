       It's a real shame about the naturopaths, but I don't think it has a thing to do with vaccines. I tend to lean more toward an anti-competitive slant by the pharmaceutical companies.

       Of course, this is hardly even the tip of the iceberg, not many go public on their opinions.  There are doctors around where I live who don't vaccinate there own children, but they only tell me because I'm a friend, nobody else knows, they don't want to lose their jobs.

       With that out of the way, here's my two cents. Even if vaccines caused autism (which I'm 99% sure that they do not based on my own biased interpretation of things I've read from many sources), the handful of folks who developed autism would be a drop in the bucket compared to the children saved from the terrible illnesses that vaccines protect against. Say all you want about the potential harmful effects of vaccines, you have every right. Hell, I can't prove that vaccines have no harmful side effects, but there's an awful lot of proof out there in regards to the positive benefits of vaccinations.

       The scientific mantra of vaccines is that they are safe and effective based on their research. Their research is flawed and is a double standard from any other drug product studied. The Gold Standard in research design is the double blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).
      </p>
      <p>
       How many vaccines have ever been studied in this manner? Zero.

       Actually, the control group should be something as similar as possible to the thing being tested, but without the bit we think makes it work. So in this case, using another vaccine as the control is perfect.

       Because when a vaccine is used against another vaccine we only know it's safety and effectiveness against another vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first stage should always be to show that it is safe and effective on its own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does it protect against the disease it is designed to protect against vs an inactive placebo?
      </p>
      <p>
       Only though using an inactive placebo can we find what the real side effects are. In this study the only side effects that are recorded are the ones that did not occur vs the other version of the vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course there are instances that need to be done versus other vaccines, but initially in order to prove safety and effectiveness we need to use the gold standard.

       For safety, sure. Best to compare against saline or something. For effectiveness, another vaccine works perfectly fine. Unless you want to rule out that all vaccines prevent all diseases, but I think you'll agree that's absurd.

       Every vaccine should be shown to be safe and effective against an inactive placebo first and foremost.

       From my research no vaccine currently in the CDC's recommended schedule has been tested against an inactive placebo.

       I've read it. I think you're misunderstanding what a control is in the context of a scientific experiment, so I'll ask you:

      <p>
       What would be a good placebo for testing the effectiveness of vaccines?

       Safe and effective are separate things. For proving safety, saline would be best. For proving efficacy, another nonspecific vaccine would be fine. This excludes any protective effect the other ingredients in the vaccine might have.

       H1N1 might not be on it, but the seasonal flu vaccine certainly is. I found double blind controlled studies for all of them, and it only took me 15 minutes.

       Let me know how it goes - I only gave them a cursory look. And remember, it's easy to find more of them, so if you don't like something they did in one study, don't give up there. You can go find another!

       No worries. Note, some of the studies are on safety, but most of them are on effectiveness, iirc. I imagine this is because a proper safety trial might take years, but you can get solid results on effectiveness more quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       That, and safety trials don't need to be done as often since dead virus is pretty widely accepted to be safe and there a re a limited number of adjuvants and preservatives used.

       With your argument, it would stand if the science had been performed to show that vaccines were safe and effective, but unfortunately it hasn't, it's all based on belief and assumption.  When you go to examine the studies it's unbelievable as they do not backup the corporate narrative we hear in the news headlines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Autism is only one serious problem which vaccines can cause, there are long lists of other problems too e.g. Epilepsy, Crib Death, Asthma, Motor Neurone Disease etc etc

       As for Polio, you say to see the symptoms, most people never have any symptoms and never realize they had Polio, it's a long story and doesn't fit in with the mainstream propaganda we here which relies on misinformation.  This doctor explains in detail the real story of Polio

       Thanks for an even-keeled response, but to develop vaccines in the first place, there was most certainly data to show that they were effective, even taking harm out of the equation. As to the harmfulness, the preponderance of information people are exposed to indicates that any harm going on is minimal if existent at all. That being said, I'll toss in again that I don't personally have a reliable way to disprove any harmful effects, and I know better than to tow the mainstream line on things. Just make sure you aren't on a bandwagon yourself.

       The effectiveness studies are simply ones looking for antibodies which have been induced by the vaccine, that doesn't always count as immunity though, antibodies are just one tool of the immune system.  Sadly it turned out that Merck was faking their MMR effectiveness tests by adding animal antibodies, the scientists involved blew the whistle.  The other problem is that they don't track how long these antibodies stick around, sometimes it's only a few years, whereas if you had caught the virus you'd have been left immune for life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today's generation is a sick one, autoimmune diseases and Cancer rates higher than ever.  Pharma refuse to study the vaccines properly, most so-called anti-vaxxers are just people demanding real science, but it always gets refused.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm certainly not on a bandwagon myself, I'm trying to lead one based on my years of extensive research into the topic.

       Interesting stuff, but what's the alternative? It's not like we have the equivalent of antibiotics for viruses. It's really cool that you're so committed to this and even have links to back it up. Props for being a critical thinker. That isn't always common among advocates for controversial topics like this. I'm sorry to say I'm still not convinced personally, but keep it up. Even if your message is potentially wrong, I'll always have an appreciation for modern people who actually use their brains.

       Happens all around Reddit everyday, I know because I've posted studies which have then been removed all around Reddit, they are perfectly good studies that show a danger of vaccines.  The vaccine debate is not one where freedom of speech is allowed, a Trillion Dollar industry has far to much invested in them to allow that.

       Did you have a problem when the truth came out about Thalidomide?  At the time people like yourself would have said to keep the information private.  Now it's the same going on with vaccines, Thalidomide victims won't be at all pleased to hear of the suppression of the dangers of medical products, which according to people like you can only be discussed in private.  If we all followed your philosophy Thalidomide would still be on the market as a Morning Sickness pill.

       You only support science which comes from the corporations, you reject independent science and research, you reject the possibility that corporations would lie.  You really should spend a lot more time researching this topic in depth before drawing such strong conclusions, I can tell you those corporations do not care about looking after you health, on the contrary, they make more money when you get sick, that's what vaccines are for.

       Fortunately, we don't have to rely on scattered anecdotes of medical practitioners. We can look at well controlled studies and draw our conclusions. The studies are consistent and convincing enough that a robust consensus has formed in favor of vaccines.

       Unfortunately the necessary studies are not being performed, vaccines are all about assumption.  They avoid using real placebos in their safety tests, they avoid mid/long term studies, they do not study the unvaccinated, there is very little independent science, if a study showing the dangers of vaccines is produced it will almost certainly end up in the bin or under lock and key.  Vaccine studies are to promote vaccines, they are rarely based on good science.

       I would strongly recommend you spend some time on the links above and also on the incredibly informative presentations given at the
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/VaccineSafetyConf">
        Vaccine Safety Conference
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no consensus, it's more that if anyone dares to speak out against the madness they get kicked out and have to find a new career. Big Pharma want you to think there is consensus, that is all part of the marketing, but as we can see with the long list above there is no consensus among the experts, if anything, the ones pushing vaccines the hardest are the ones who stand to make the most money from them e.g. vaccine multimillionaire Paul Offit

       Is there any evidence they are bad? For something that could save your life there is going to have to be some pretty severe side effects for me to not get a child vaccinated. I cant imagine watching your own child get sick and die knowing it was preventable. I understand you dont think there is enough evidence and history showing they are ok but is there any evidence showing they arent?

       There are large amounts of evidence showing vaccines to be harmful, whereas the evidence that they are 'good' is simply correlation = causation, which as you'll know is not good science.

       It's a real shame about the naturopaths, but I don't think it has a thing to do with vaccines. I tend to lean more toward an anti-competitive slant by the pharmaceutical companies.
