<p>Caffeine is a nootropic.  Certain B vitamins can be nootropics.  </p>

<p>I can assure you that no one is getting &quot;high&quot; or &quot;tripping&quot; from these enhancements.  What people who work in this field of study are attempting to do is to help their brain function better, help them be more productive, and overcome their inherent functionality shortcomings.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are other subs &amp; topics worthy of outrage or a witch hunt rather than people trying to make their brains work better, yes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, just because you don&#39;t understand a topic doesn&#39;t make it a fucking conspiracy.  Instead of posting something in this sub that&#39;s not at all relevant, post your question in the nootropics, alternative health or supplements subs.</p>

<p>There you might find someone who can help you understand it more.  It wouldn&#39;t kill you to inform yourself about sh*t you don&#39;t know about, rather than dismissing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I don&#39;t like the idea of a subreddit where people are giving themselves a bunch of chemicals, which in some cases are extremely dangerous, without the guidance of a medical doctor. </p>

<p>Saw an individual on there talking about using Lithium. Lithium has an extremely narrow therapeutic index, meaning it can cause irreversible damage to your body if blood concentrations of the drug exceed very narrow limits (0.6-1.2 mEq/L is therapeutic range, over 2mEq/L is toxic). The only way to determine that is through blood tests. </p>

<p>In many cases they have no fucking idea what they&#39;re doing thats my problem. </p>

<p>edit: and for a subreddit that shits all over modern psychiatry and pharmaceuticals I can&#39;t believe you guys think it&#39;s okay to use substances that are even less regulated and controlled, and to use them without professional guidance. Who knows what the fuck you&#39;re actually doing to your brain. </p>

I&#39;m not talking about censoring anyone, I&#39;m saying it&#39;s bad for people to take drugs without a good enough reason that outweighs the potential risks.

<p>ok now that you have stated that for about the 5th time. What are you trying to accomplish and how does it relate to r/conspiracy? </p>

<p>There are tons of forums dedicated to bug chasers, Coke addicts looking to score and dedicated forums posting where people can buy ketamine. </p>

<p>There are thousands of people per year gating addicted to opium due to prescription medication being filled by doctors all over the world, the US being one of the largest. Why target this one group of people&#39;s minding their own business. Since you have refused to answer my question multiple times I&#39;m just going to assume you are looking for an argument. Good luck with your vendetta. </p>
