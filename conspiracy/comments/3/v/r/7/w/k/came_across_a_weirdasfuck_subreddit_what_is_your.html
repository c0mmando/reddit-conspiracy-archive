       Anyone else have any experience with this subreddit called "nootropics"? It honestly comes off as a bunch of people blasting their fucking brain cells with whatever "cognitive enhancer" they can find.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know most of us are skeptical of big pharma, but what about these people who take it one step further and use all of these different supplements and unregulated products?

       Nootropics is the study of supplementation for the brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Caffeine is a nootropic.  Certain B vitamins can be nootropics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can assure you that no one is getting "high" or "tripping" from these enhancements.  What people who work in this field of study are attempting to do is to help their brain function better, help them be more productive, and overcome their inherent functionality shortcomings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there are other subs &amp; topics worthy of outrage or a witch hunt rather than people trying to make their brains work better, yes?

       Dude, just because you don't understand a topic doesn't make it a fucking conspiracy.  Instead of posting something in this sub that's not at all relevant, post your question in the nootropics, alternative health or supplements subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       There you might find someone who can help you understand it more.  It wouldn't kill you to inform yourself about sh*t you don't know about, rather than dismissing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if you took my tone as douche-like, but nootropics aren't a conspiracy.

       so big pharmaceutical companies = conspiracy. But big pharmaceutical companies making "cognitive enhancers" somehow isn't. Companies spending millions of dollars to produce and market these chemicals that are 90% of the time snake-oil, isn't a conspiracy?

       It's almost like there are people on here with different opinions, we shouldn't resort to calling them names. We need to try and keep this place civil. While I don't agree with the submitters opinion we should try to be as civil as possible and use facts to argue our points.

       I guess I don't like the idea of a subreddit where people are giving themselves a bunch of chemicals, which in some cases are extremely dangerous, without the guidance of a medical doctor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saw an individual on there talking about using Lithium. Lithium has an extremely narrow therapeutic index, meaning it can cause irreversible damage to your body if blood concentrations of the drug exceed very narrow limits (0.6-1.2 mEq/L is therapeutic range, over 2mEq/L is toxic). The only way to determine that is through blood tests.
      </p>
      <p>
       In many cases they have no fucking idea what they're doing thats my problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: and for a subreddit that shits all over modern psychiatry and pharmaceuticals I can't believe you guys think it's okay to use substances that are even less regulated and controlled, and to use them without professional guidance. Who knows what the fuck you're actually doing to your brain.

       So you are advocating censoring the entire internet. It's dangerous to change the brakes on your car but we don't stop YouTube tutorials on how to do so.
      </p>

       There are huge amounts of food thrown away every day yet people die of starvation all the time. Maybe your time would be better spent advocating for the worlds hunger problems than a group of people willingly subjecting themselves to mind altering drugs.

       Lol nice straw man. I'm not talking about censoring anyone, I'm saying it's bad for people to take drugs without a good enough reason that outweighs the potential risks. And people abusing drugs is a massive public health concern, just like hunger. What's with your snotty tone dude?

       Not a snotty tone, just trying to figure out why you care. Most of the drugs nootropics advocates are schedule 4 in a lot of countries. I assume those have to pass clinical trials. Abuse of those drugs are a separate issue and nothing you can do anything about. So yet again, I ask, why do you care?

       Cause you posted it to a public forum, obviously you wanted other people to know you personally found an issue with it. If you don't like that, then maybe keep it to yourself. Not sure why you invite these questions, then get defensive when asked why you care....

       dude I already explained to you that people abusing drugs is a public health concern. How else do I need to say that? 
edit: I saw a person on there talking about taking lithium and ordering shit like that through the mail.  Also saw a post talking about using SSRIs for reasons other than they were prescribed. Basically using a subreddit as a psychiatrist.

       ok now that you have stated that for about the 5th time. What are you trying to accomplish and how does it relate to r/conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are tons of forums dedicated to bug chasers, Coke addicts looking to score and dedicated forums posting where people can buy ketamine.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are thousands of people per year gating addicted to opium due to prescription medication being filled by doctors all over the world, the US being one of the largest. Why target this one group of people's minding their own business. Since you have refused to answer my question multiple times I'm just going to assume you are looking for an argument. Good luck with your vendetta.

       Sure, makes sure and tell them that unless they are willing to take an active role in our government and drug approvals, that bitching on the internet doesn't change a fucking thing. So sure send them my way I will definitely tell them the same thing I told you.... While pointing to you speaking of your constant  "unbiased" point of view when clearly you are biased, is quite silly. Please send the silly peons my way!

       Speaking first hand, I have never used the sub nootropics, but I have indeed used actual nootropics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of them are bogus. But there are a few legitimate ones that I absolutely notice cognitive enhancement, and have given to friends and family who also notice improvements in aspects of their daily lives and function.

       I bioassayed at least 20 different kinds. Only three or four stuck with me as worthwhile.

       In my exp most people on there seem rational about it -- the vast majority don't work or fade over time. Just give people headaches. Very difficult to verify you're actually getting what you order, and hard to know what's placebo with a study sample of one.

       I'm not sure its much of a conspiracy, stuff as benign as Ginkgo Biloba is a nootropic, people use it as a blanket term for legal psychedelics and stimulants. Also I hope my name inspired your search.

       Dude, just because you don't understand a topic doesn't make it a fucking conspiracy.  Instead of posting something in this sub that's not at all relevant, post your question in the nootropics, alternative health or supplements subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       There you might find someone who can help you understand it more.  It wouldn't kill you to inform yourself about sh*t you don't know about, rather than dismissing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if you took my tone as douche-like, but nootropics aren't a conspiracy.

       Why do you care? They have secluded themselves to a sub that doesn't bother anyone else. Why try to draw attention to a group who aren't bothering anyone?
