        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>RIVERSIDE, Calif. (KABC) -- Eyewitness News obtained a photo of San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook&#39;s former neighbor, Enrique Marquez, who allegedly bought two of the four weapons used in Wednesday&#39;s massacre.</p>

<p>Marquez allegedly purchased the two &quot;assault-style&quot; rifles over three years ago. Authorities haven&#39;t been able to talk to him because he checked himself into a mental hospital after the attack, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press.</p>

<p>Authorities with guns drawn raided Marquez&#39;s home in Riverside early Saturday, breaking windows and using a cutting torch to get into the garage, neighbors said.</p>

<p>FBI Director James Comey said the gun purchaser was &quot;not a suspect, at least at this point.&quot;</p>

<p>Neighbors say Marquez lives in the Riverside home with his mother, stepdad and other siblings and that he mostly kept to himself.</p>

<p>Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik used the two rifles, along with two handguns that the couple purchased, to kill 14 people at the Inland Regional Center during a holiday party.</p>

<p>The two were later killed in a gun battle between police about a mile away from the center.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Does anyone have more info on this guys situation? was he hearing &quot;voices&quot; <em>in</em> his head?</p>

<p>So, our government is openly saying that they can, and clearly will,  raid a citizen&#39;s home when they aren&#39;t even a fucking suspect? What? Hundred bucks says this poor fucker is never heard from again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couldn&#39;t agree more. They&#39;re locking entire cities down with increasing frequency, raiding homes without warrants and shitting all over the rights of the people under the guise of safety. The worst part is the fact that it is working. People just don&#39;t care about their rights until they&#39;ve lost them completely. </p>

<p>As far as the neighbor goes, I too hope more info is released regarding this situation. I&#39;m not too optimistic that we&#39;ll hear another peep about him after a few days though. I hope I&#39;m wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look up probable cause. If they have a reasonable suspicion of a crime being committed, or having been comitted, which in light of the circumstances i think we can agree they did have a <strong>reasonable</strong> suspicion, a search warrant was likely quickly and expeditiously handed down from a judge to the FBI. </p>

<p>Now, i think the most relevant question here is, where&#39;s the warrant? Who signed it? etc</p>

<p>Sounds like bullshit to me.  They could question someone in a mental institution if they had a warrant or permission from the administration.</p>
