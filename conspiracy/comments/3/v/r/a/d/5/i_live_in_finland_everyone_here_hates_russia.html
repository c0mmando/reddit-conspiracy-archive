<p>Edit. In the early 90&#39;s we were a small country suffering from depression, but we had our own currency and we had a president and a government which did not bow in any direction at the expense of common people. Of course there were corrupt ones and same shit every country has, but we were completely independent. </p>

<p>Then came European Union, Emu (monetary union, euro) and Nato is knocking at our door right now. Our glorious leaders do their best to please EU and big corporations. Hell, our prime minister is THE lobby man for corporations. </p>

<p>I just miss the old times, times what my grandfather told me about. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why I feel Russia is more Finland today than Finland itself. I don&#39;t say Putin is the one and only man to follow, but I&#39;d take him any day before our current prime minister and his government. </p>

<p>I want to clarify that our president is just a pr face, he does not have any actual power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We had few clashes with Soviet Union in ww2 Era and that has spawned a collective hate towards Russia in general. Everything coming from the east is bad, corrupt and BAD. Putin/Yeltsin/Medvedev is the unholy alliance of Satan himself.
But the more I watch what our government does the more I have sympathy for East. They bend down before EU and big corporations and take it up the ass. And it mirrors down to us, common peope. We get to pay the bill. </p>

<p>Finland as I want to see it died that day we joined European Union. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for for the insight, from what you say it certainly seems like the current state of affairs is an overreaction to a small conflict many decades ago. You&#39;d think that resentment would have waned with the deaths of those involved and the end of the Soviet state. I guess some people need something to irrationally fear and hate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finland has been at war with the Russians many, many times before the Winter War and the Continuation War. Not to mention how the country was treated after the wars, like using civilian airliners as target practice, threatening with war and espionage.</p>

<p>I mean, I realize what you&#39;re saying, kid of. I used to relate to Sweden as if they were our brothers. But the path they have taken is pushing them far away from being a Nordic country. Today, Estonia feels closer. You have to remember that Ryssä on Ryssä vaikka voissa paistaisi. They broke that trust a long time ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;ryssä on ryssä vaikka voissa paistaisi&quot;  is a phrase used by people who live in the ww2 Era. Do you understand that Russia=/=USSR? Collective hate against Russia is from conflicts from 1910-1940. I have no desire to live in Russia nor do I envy the poor people living there. All I&#39;m saying is I&#39;d rather have Putin as prime minister rather than Sipilä. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because Russia has changed? Become the &#39;good guy&#39;? Gives two shits about its smaller neighbors? Look at how they&#39;re treating <em>their own citizens</em>. Most recently, Russia made their own national &#39;human rights&#39; law that trumps the UN one. All independent media is systematically removed. Demonstrations are put down violently, homosexuals beaten and arrested, and so on.</p>

<p>Russia isn&#39;t a utopia, mate. It never will be. Finland will never become so bad that Russia is better, unless they occupy us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get you. Putin appears to be an energetic, decisive leader, pushing his country back to the superpower status, while not giving shit about anybody else and not playing the dirty underhanded politics that the whole rest of the world seems to be doing... It&#39;s a normal human thing - we want to be led by a strong leader who strokes our nationalistic pride.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget, however, that Putin created powerful Putinist oligarchs, allows corruption, rules by calibrated political repression (and occasional executions), tightly controls the media, etc... Russian economy is not doing that well and they have bunch of other internal issues.</p>

<p>You cannot take good sides of Putin without taking the bad. And the first thing to go would be the Finnish concept of equality. Despite your PhD, hard work, etc. you and your children would, statistically more likely, end up dirt poor, while one of your stupid lazy acquaintances would end up throwing money around because he is &quot;connected&quot;</p>

<p>Besides, if the strong, no-shit-given leader is what&#39;s attracting you to Putin, you should consider Kim Jong-un</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a load of misunderstanding and misrepresentation here. Those oligarchs rose to power as a result of the collapse of the USSR and with the help of the US. What do you want Putin to do, imprison them, forcibly seize their assets, execute them?</p>

<p>Allows corruption? Putin&#39;s been forced into a position where he has to tolerate it to an extent, but he certainly doesn&#39;t condone it. In fact, oligarchs in Russia are held far more accountable more often than in the US.</p>

<p>And as far as the Russian economy is concerned, minus the sanctions and the artificially depressed price of oil, Russia&#39;s economy would be thriving. Not to mention they have one of the lowest debt to GDP of any developed nation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m russian and from my perspective you don&#39;t know what you are talking about. I&#39;m not trying to offend you. I think that a government should care about its own people. This is its primal goal. In the media it may sound cool when one man stands against the whole world but in the reality there are people in Russia who simply have nothing to eat and the goverment doesn&#39;t care. In Russia it is possible to loose your buisnes, family and life because somebody in the government want to take it from you. And you can do nothing with it. It will be 100% &quot;legal&quot;. Putin didn&#39;t change anything, he is just a part of this system. As for actual power, I think that in the XX centuary people should stop hating each other and stop living in the past. I don&#39;t hate Finland or any other country and it sounds silly to me to antagonize another country or its people because of politics.</p>
