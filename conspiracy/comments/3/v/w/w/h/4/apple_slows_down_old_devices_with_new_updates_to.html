    <div class="md"><p>It definitely sucks, but you have to understand that engineers release patches and updates for a reason. If you aren&#39;t willing to run the latest software that could correct your problems, the engineers aren&#39;t going to give you the time of day, because you&#39;re not upholding <em>your end</em>. 
What this means ultimately, is yes, you will have to upgrade hardware a little more than you would like in order to run the latest software. 
OR....buy other products.
Apple wants to provide the best user experience -- which initially meant software and hardware were conceived and created simultaneously. Running all these older devices means that you expect engineers to support all the older devices, while constantly working on releasing new devices for their business. </p>

<p>As someone who used to work in IT, I had to support IE8 for certain websites to work. The company was too cheap to update software and god damn did I wish Microsoft stopped supporting all those legacy browsers. At some point you need to move on and just upgrade your shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I understand that very well. My issue was with an iPad bought brand new. I updated to the highest 7.x I could then months into using it the app store stopped letting me update apps. At the time 8.x was a nightmare and they are well known for making their products obsolete with updates. Eventually I caved and updated it. A 1.5 year old iPad is now more buggy and slow than it was on 7.x. How can the ends justify the means? There were plenty of people still on 7.x, so many so that there are forums pages long about people having the same issue. </p>

<p>I&#39;m done with apple products. For comparison, my phone at the time was an s4. That thing is still running great after every update that has been pushed to it. I also still have an s3 that was handed down to a sibling, also still works fine. It&#39;s not impossible to make new software that is supported on 1.5 year old hardware. Apple is just a shit company.</p>

<p>I had the galaxy s3, and each time a new android system came out they forced me to update (i pressed ignore for 4 months before it just installed without asking me, twice).  after the second OS update, the phone was way too slow and glitchy.</p>

<p>FF to last year.  Note 4 working great... until the  Mandatory android update. now its noticeably slower.  They will roll out another OS update in maybe 8-9 months, and that next one will make it even slower.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Especially true for banking apps that require signing in. I had a perfectly functional iPhone 3GS and could conveniently check my balance anywhere. Then one day Apple released a new iOS that is not supported on it. That would have been fine, I was happy with the older iOS version since it was snappy and all my apps still worked. Then, my banking app decided to require an update that requires the latest iOS just to sign in. <em>POOF</em>, entire smartphone is now obsolete; it is now an iPod which I paid hand over fist for. Apple has no meaning or reason for &quot;legacy&quot;, they think you should buy the newest iPhone every 6 months instead like a good little consumer.

<p>Sure, &quot;Linux&quot; will run on low end software, but what are you doing with the system? You can configure most software based on available resources but configuring it to run a low end hardware is serverly throttling it and its not like you&#39;re running resource intensive apps like what you run on a daily basis on a phone. Even chromium on Linux wouldn&#39;t run very well with low end hardware even running a lightweight display manager like openbox.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Openbox is even more lightweight than LXDE and the last time I tried running a GUI such as Openbox on low-end hardware (P4 with 512MB of RAM), the system itself ran but doing anything more than opening a terminal was dogshit slow due to pretty much all programs instantly swapping. I recall if I opened anything more than one Chromium tab, Chromium immediately swapped and all loading of new pages was slow as hell and was very unproductive. I found a really hard time doing simple tasks such as checking emails and even reading articles on this setup. I could&#39;ve played with swapiness and it would have likely of resulted in actually being able to perform tasks but when talking about 128MB of RAM, there&#39;s no playing around with things that&#39;ll result in efficient performance from such low end hardware. Setting up a headless system to perform tasks such as being a MX or something such as that, sure but a GUI to perform things like checking email, IDK man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe <em>what</em> it does stayed the same (it&#39;s a desktop operating system, designed to let you run programs, after all) - but <em>how</em> it does things changed over time. Think about the Aero gloss effect on windows, which even requires special drivers and shit.</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t use Windows for everyday tasks, I only installed it on my MacBook Pro (via Bootcamp) to be able to run games. But I have gone through like 4 major Mac OSX updates since I bought it, and it still runs relatively smoothly, even with all these fancy visuals and cloud and whatnot features they added over the years.</p>

<p>I am not denying that Apple <em>might</em> want you to buy new devices, but I can explain how old devices get less reliable with new software without a conspiracy - because they get old.</p>

<p>Mine lasted five years until it physically broke, and that was with me dropping it down the stairs, backpacking with it, and playing video games that used tons of resources. The OS worked great up until the end, almost just as fast as day 1. </p>

<p>It&#39;s one of the only luxury goods where I think the price is justified, I feel like if I had one that just sat on a desk it would have lasted forever.</p>

<p>Compare that to my boyfriend&#39;s laptop with windows that never leaves the house, is the same age, but takes 10+ minutes to boot into a usable state. It&#39;s clear when using it that the OS is just clogging up the system uselessly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously, the &quot;older&quot; hardware is well capable of supporting nearly all of the new features if the software was anywhere near decently optimized. Even Siri could work on the original iPhone since the audio input is transmitted to an apple central processing server and then text/audio returned to the device. That&#39;s an incredibly small burden processing on the phone side.</p>

<p>I&#39;m under the impression they explicitly write the new software for the older devices to do things in the most inefficient manner so that, in essence, it bricks the device, while they&#39;re still able to say &quot;that hardware is old and wasn&#39;t meant to run that software&quot;. If that&#39;s true, why the fuck are you releasing software for it that results in a less functional device? Because it results in reduced competition &amp; more profit. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why businesses exist. Profit. Businesses are not there to supply you with a product - that&#39;s merely the middle-work of getting you to get them a profit. </p>

<p>Now, if there was real competition in the market, then we might see better products from Apple, but Apple is the only one offering a comprehensively tailored mobile computing experience. The only competition Apple has is old Apple devices. </p>

<p>At some point Netflix stopped working... so I updated the iPad Mini to iOS8.  And at that point the device was essentially bricked.  It ran as well as a decade old PC with spyware.  Literally tap the safari bar, count to ten, keyboard comes up, start typing, count to three between each letter.</p>

<p>I assumed I would be able to roll it back in case it didn&#39;t work out, but-- surprise!-- they didn&#39;t allow rollbacks from iOS8.  So I bricked a $400 machine that was working absolutely perfectly until I downloaded a software update.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It stopped at iOS 7. Apple capped it there. After that, it was incompatible. It still works solid though. I think the only reason you don&#39;t think it passes &quot;smell test&quot; is because you have an anti-apple bias. My apps still all worked. They too eventually could not be updated anymore because of incompatibility with the iOS. But no functionality was affected. Comparatively, it was a little slower than newer phones. </p>

<p>The only person I really have to compare with an Andriod device is my roommate. But he&#39;s gotten about 4 brand new phones within the past 2 years because he keeps breaking the screen, so I can&#39;t even ask if the software upgrades slow everything down. He has a whatever Motorola makes.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just it doesn&#39;t run to the same speed as newer devices doesn&#39;t mean some people don&#39;t want the new apps. Also, you don&#39;t have to hit update , you can hit cancel.  Additionally, I still have an iPhone 5, released in 2012, and it still works fine on 9.1. If you run your iPhone for years and never reset it and just update I can see it getting slower but so will your PC. Simple fix is just reset it and install your shit again... Honestly would prefer it this way vs the android way and updating only 1 device back if that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it&#39;s a nasty conspiracy given that when looked after these well made tech items can and should last for 10 years at least. (Ita not like they&#39;re fundamentally incompatible like going from analogue to digital, and I doubt phones today can&#39;t be used on same or newer comms network tech in 2025.) </p>

<p>The e-waste is horrendous. Companies are contributing to it by conditioning consumers to upgrade. They plan to make models obsolete every few years or so. </p>

<p>People that upgraded their old phones to latest OS must not have been too bright anyways though. It&#39;s like Forcing your WinXP to run Win8 or Win10, the hardware hasn&#39;t changed so don&#39;t expect it to run the latest software well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just going to respond to by saying I am in means an Apple fan-boy. I don&#39;t wait in line to get the next product. I don&#39;t care what new &quot;innovation&quot; they have. </p>

<p>I personally just hate Apple hate for the sake of Apple hate. &quot;The OS is terrible.&quot; So is Windows, and that&#39;s much more vulnerable. &quot;Overpriced.&quot; Easy argument, which I agree with. So don&#39;t buy it and stop complaining. &quot;Apple does stuff like the content of this post.&quot; So do other tech companies, but it makes you seem techy if you find ways to bash apple. &quot;You can&#39;t do as much with Apple devices as you can with others.&quot; You can, there are a lot of ways to do so, but you need the know how, something a lot of people don&#39;t take the time to figure out how. Just like a lot of people don&#39;t take the time to figure out how to on other products, unless you are really savvy. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like the price, stop complaining, move on and get something cheaper. If you don&#39;t like the UI or the OS, move on and don&#39;t use. If you don&#39;t like their business practices, use a different company, but you better do your research on that company because those same practices might be used by the other one.</p>

<p>My only real problem is that people complain about Apple for the most inane things. I get looked down on by people becuase they think I&#39;m &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;unintelligent&quot; for using apple. I have a good knowledge of other devices and systems also. This is my preference. I know how to use it to get the most out of it. Don&#39;t act superior to me just because I use something you don&#39;t care for.</p>

<p>And by far my most favourite complaint is that Apple users are elitist about their products. Well guess what, so are all other users. I actually hear more hate about apple from non-apple users, than I do about non-apple products from apple users. </p>

<p>In a chain of comments complimenting apple, all the sudden you go full MUST DEFEND APPLE. You&#39;re obviously upset some people dislike the product and talk shit about it. But that&#39;s how it is with everything. Don&#39;t worry so much. </p>

<p>So yea, you went full on fanboy. Which has a negative connotation, I&#39;ll admit. But there&#39;s nothing wrong with it in this situation in the sense that you make clear arguments. You just have the annoying fanboy bit where you&#39;re too emotionally involved. </p>

<p>Ok I get that. I just really hate the apple circle jerk hate. It pisses me off to no avail because its constant. I didn&#39;t know how the comment to which I was replying was supposed mean. </p>

<p>It was more of a rant than anything. And it comes from anti-fanboys. By anti-fan boys, I mean people that really just have an affinity for all things apple hate. Those people that feed the circle jerk because its cool or it makes them sound smart. Its an annoyance for me because I see it everywhere. Apple could cure cancer-aids and they would be like, Micorsoft and Google have been doing that for years and theirs is overpriced and don&#39;t allow for this and that. Pretty much demonizing every move the company makes. </p>

<p>This issue of anti-fanboys is obviously not going anywhere. I think you need to realize that these stupid people are getting exactly what they want out of you, an emotional response. That&#39;s all they care about, it makes them feel good about their shitty selves. </p>

<p>What don&#39;t any of you understand that I don&#39;t care about if you like or hate apple? I feel as though with the amount of good content here, this particular thing irked me because it seemed like Apple hatred for the sake of apple hatred. It contributes nothing to the community and it just got to me that this would even take place because IMO its a circle jerk topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I imagine it becomes really just a hardware limiting experience.  When updates contain new features then the older models become obsolete as their processors become bogged down running more features than they needed to prior.  Why do you think each new generation iphone has a new and faster processor chip?  Because the old ones aren&#39;t good enough anymore.  So you&#39;re correct, if you update your old device then you will likely experience issue as well.  This isn&#39;t some grand conspiracy, this is a side effect of newer and faster technology.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Anecdotal, but I&#39;ll bite anyway. I assume when you say &quot;updates&quot; you mean system/kernel updates? I assume you update third party software regularly. If this is the case, what I said before about hardware/software applies to third-party software and system software. Third-party software will typically run faster on the latest OS version, including latest drivers, API&#39;s etc..</p>

<p>So when you use the latest Firefox, chrome, pidgin, Adobe whatever, it will typically run best on the latest OS kernel and system components. Have you tried writing software for multiple versions of an API or library? It becomes convoluted and a pain. Remember, there are a lot of moving parts to a piece of software like Firefox that are not developed by Firefox, let alone Apple or Microsoft.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I haven&#39;t done any benchmarks, but when my Mac Book slowed down I asked a fellow Mac Book user why and he told me to update because they slow it down. When I updated everything was much much faster. I also helped out someone myself who had the same problem, but to a much more extreme degree. For him it was so slow it took like a minute to just open System Preferences. After the update it was really quick. I know this is all anecdotal. I haven&#39;t done a peer reviewed study into this. I only have the evidence of my senses and the senses of other people who are looking at the same machines. There&#39;s a noticeable difference between System Preferences taking half a minute to open, and a few milliseconds.</p>

<p>edit: Also, I happen to work in software development. It&#39;s 100% believable to me that they would slow it down.</p>

<p>I assume you&#39;ve read my wall of text above. But I will add there are plenty of other variables that can make your system run slower where an update seems to &quot;fix&quot; it. Doesn&#39;t mean someone is secretly sending updates to your computer. I mean, one can easily monitor their own network traffic for such abuse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro it&#39;s not a conspiracy.... It&#39;s simply a tactic that companies use to retain their competitive advantage. This concept has been around for decades so most people are simply privy to the fact that consumerism is driven by money, not morals. A conspiracy is not simply a shitty fact; it also includes duping or tricking people into believing something. It&#39;s not like Apple is saying their products are everlasting</p>

<p>For it to not to be a conspiracy, it needs to not be PLANNED obsolescence. The planning of the obsolescence makes it a conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So: Apple builds a faster device. Then Apple writes new version of the operating system, taking advantage of the increased power of the new device. They also fix security holes, fix bugs, and add new features.</p>

<p>Apple tests it on older devices, but only so much.  And their decision about what devices have enough power to run the new OS are made with a lower bar for speed and snappiness than you might apply to your own personal device - their engineers aren&#39;t using a four-year-old phone as their daily driver, they&#39;re just fooling around with it for an hour or two. Maybe a couple days at most.</p>

<p>Every device still running an old OS is a potential time sink for Apple. If they know theres a huge base of people still running OS8, and some super-serious exploit comes out, they have to burn twice the midnight oil to make both a 9.x update and an 8.x update. Which is why when I got a new 6S a few weeks ago, it started pestering me to update to the latest OS every day until I finally let it update.</p>

<p>(I would have updated it the day I got it and plugged it into my computer, but I was sort of thinking of jailbreaking it. Ultimately the IOS9 jailbreak proved fiddlier than I was willing to deal with, and I said &#39;yes&#39; so it would stop pleading.)</p>

<p>Sure, &quot;Linux&quot; will run on low end software, but what are you doing with the system? You can configure most software based on available resources but configuring it to run a low end hardware is serverly throttling it and its not like you&#39;re running resource intensive apps like what you run on a daily basis on a phone. Even chromium on Linux wouldn&#39;t run very well with low end hardware even running a lightweight display manager like openbox.</p>
