    <div class="md"><p>All governments are based on stealing and enslaving their populations, how can that possibly lead to anything good? They are based on a small group of people claiming to have more rights than everybody else. They are about taking rights away from people, and giving them to tiny groups of people (like the police). They are about making wrong-doings into rights (like the war on drugs). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s entirely true. I mean, yeah, that&#39;s what most governments are and what most governments lead to, but we still need a way to be organized and connected. I think you&#39;re focused too much on a very centralized government. </p>

<p>For example, the way the Iroquois government was set up, was a small circle of leaders that were heavily influenced by the people of their tribe. These tribes were like states, fairly small. The leaders of those states were, for various reasons, very moral and focused on helping their people. The leaders of each state would cooperate together, not to set laws and rules that cover the entirety of the tribes, but only for trade and peace and things like that. It worked well. The problem with our current gov&#39;t is having the Federal level at all. There&#39;s no reason for it. People should be able to stay close to where the decisions of their land are being made. The only relationships the states should have with each other are trade, treaty, and immigration. The less centralized the better. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any group of people actively violating natural law can never help society as a whole. These people have to be forcefully stopped if they will not back down. Taxation is a euphemism for stealing, which is the primary expression of a natural law violation. Representation is a myth, because not everybody consents to it; nobody gets to present my views except for me, because they belong to me and I said so. Voting never changes the difference between right and wrong, neither do political rituals or laws written on paper. Nobody has a monopoly on justice or enforcement of natural law. Nobody gets to change natural law into whatever they see fit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are misunderstanding natural law. All of us are sovereign already under natural law. Sovereign means &quot;above rulership&quot;. The universe has given all of us free will to choose any action we want to take, as you have demonstrated; this is the chaotic aspect of the universe. However, there will always be consequences for our actions, and we do not get to choose or change the consequences, this is the deterministic aspect of the universe. 
Certain actions are not rights under natural law, if a person chooses to engage in these behaviors, the result is always suffering and harm for somebody. If a society as a whole, an aggregate of individuals, chooses to allow or engage in these behaviors, that society can never be free, will always suffer, will be enslaved and ultimately extinction is where it leads. </p>

<p>The basic violation of natural law is stealing, whether you are stealing life, property, sexual freedom, or security and peace of mind. All natural law violations harm innocent living beings. </p>

<p>The non-aggression  feminine principle states that you should not engage in violence or aggression against innocent people. The self-defense masculine principle states that if someone starts a violent encounter, you already have the right to end it with as much force as is necessary to put down that threat. The key question is, who started it?</p>

<p>These basic principles will either lead to slavery if they are ignored, or freedom if they are followed. But violating natural law never leads to freedom for an individual or for a collection of individuals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your opinion, but what is the basis for your assertions? These are not ideas that are self-evident from observing nature, but rather they were formulated to serve as a moral system, likely to aid in the development of a stable cooperative society where the interests of the many are raised above the interests of the individual. They are no different from any other moral system and there is nothing you can point to outside yourself that defines good and bad/right and wrong.</p>

<p>Natural only has meaning as a contrast to man-made. If you don&#39;t specifically excluded man from nature, then literally everything is natural.</p>

<p>There is no ought to, should, or must in nature. In fact, the very opposite of what you are saying is true. The only place you find this kind of moralizing and judgment is from humans. It is a very recent concept that, though you can take what you want, you ought not because someone else won&#39;t like it. </p>

<p>If a lion kills and eats a gazelle, is that wrong? Is that against natural law? Why makes you cosmically special?</p>

<p>And my point is that no one is above being ruled. You&#39;re actually proposing that everyone should be ruled by everyone else and that competing interests somehow won&#39;t exist. Your premise is fundamentally flawed, so everything you build upon it will share that flaw. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These ideas are self-evident in nature, that is what the writers of the declaration of independence meant when they said, we hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created with equal rights. I am proposing that no one has the right to rule anyone else, because rulership is based on theft, violence, and slavery. I am proposing that if somebody violates another person&#39;s rights, everyone else already has the right to stop that person, no government/police/court required.
Lions eating gazelles is also a wrong-doing, but unfortunately those animals have not evolved to the point where they are able to make that distinction and overcome that tendency. They are running on instinct and inertia. Humans, on the other hand, have evolved to the point where they can recognize the morality of their actions, and overcome their animal instincts. </p>

<p>Why is it a fundamentally flawed idea for people to not coerce, steal from, and hurt each other for no reason?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your foundation is flawed. There is nothing in nature (that is, everything that is not man-made) that points to this. In fact, you don&#39;t even think it applies to literally everything but mankind. These ideas do not apply and cannot work for frogs or for trees or for comets or for photons. You have put human beings in a special place in the universe. </p>

<p>The lion must eat a gazelle to survive and it is frankly a perverse idea that the creature is wrong for what it is.</p>

<p>The thing is: you don&#39;t need to treat humans as special and the idea doesn&#39;t need to be derived from nature. You should do these things because it&#39;s how you maximize enjoyment, and because people agree that they want to. The authority comes from the consent of the parties to the agreement. Once I say to you that I will limit myself from negatively affecting you if you do the same, it creates an obligation and an enforceable agreement. That is what society is at a fundamental level and this is what is beautiful about it - you gave up your sovereignty to the group. I happen to agree that, for example, denying me the right to pick up and eat a mushroom from my own yard is wrong, but it is wrong because it is a violation of the basic agreement of society, not a violation of nature.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s expand your paraphrase to a quote: &quot;...that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights...&quot;</p>

<p>Relying on the declaration of Independence is a mistake - the document is based on the idea that men were created with these rights. The rights are granted by a universal sovereign in one way or another. If you do not have that sovereign, then you simply have a incorrect statement: as you can clearly see, men are not equal in any way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cannot withdraw consent while living in society - that&#39;s the whole point. You can try to go where there is no sovereign and hope that you are not captured and subjugated, though. You never had sovereignty. You were born into this and you are an unnatural product of this society. The fact that you actually believe that a lion eating its prey is a wrong-doing is astonishing (might be the dumbest thing I&#39;ve seen posted on Reddit), and it reveals your thinking to be childish. You lack understanding on such a fundamental level that you&#39;re likely doomed to a dark and confusing life.

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s like saying all of Hitler&#39;s soldiers were terrorists. You have to think of the reasons why someone would join the military in the first place. Recruiters purposely go to &quot;down and out&quot; areas and coax them into it with &quot;free education / work training / placement&quot;, etc. When you have nothing, you&#39;re more likely to go in a direction that will give you something.  Soldiers are merely pawns that have &quot;God bless America&quot; drilled into their minds.  They&#39;re following orders. The one&#39;s giving said orders are where the terror stems from. Soldiers aren&#39;t entirely innocent, but they&#39;re not entirely to blame.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The USA is terrorist nation #1 in the world today.</p>

<p>The level of willful ignorance and shameless apathy is mind-boggling.</p>

<p>i&#39;ve done a lot of the hard work for you already.</p>

<p>All you have to do is Look, Listen and Learn.</p>

<p>There is so much misinformation and disinformation put out by the corporate media.</p>

<p>Let us speak to the facts.</p>

<p>If you have evidence to the contrary, then bring it forward for all to see so that we can learn together.</p>

<p>Sometimes people hold a core belief that is very strong.
When they are presented with evidence that works against that belief, the new evidence cannot be accepted.
It would create a feeling that is extremely uncomfortable, called cognitive dissonance.
And because it is so important to protect the core belief, they will rationalize, ignore and even deny anything that doesn&#39;t fit in with the core belief.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are misunderstanding natural law. All of us are sovereign already under natural law. Sovereign means &quot;above rulership&quot;. The universe has given all of us free will to choose any action we want to take, as you have demonstrated; this is the chaotic aspect of the universe. However, there will always be consequences for our actions, and we do not get to choose or change the consequences, this is the deterministic aspect of the universe. 
Certain actions are not rights under natural law, if a person chooses to engage in these behaviors, the result is always suffering and harm for somebody. If a society as a whole, an aggregate of individuals, chooses to allow or engage in these behaviors, that society can never be free, will always suffer, will be enslaved and ultimately extinction is where it leads. </p>

<p>The basic violation of natural law is stealing, whether you are stealing life, property, sexual freedom, or security and peace of mind. All natural law violations harm innocent living beings. </p>

<p>The non-aggression  feminine principle states that you should not engage in violence or aggression against innocent people. The self-defense masculine principle states that if someone starts a violent encounter, you already have the right to end it with as much force as is necessary to put down that threat. The key question is, who started it?</p>

<p>These basic principles will either lead to slavery if they are ignored, or freedom if they are followed. But violating natural law never leads to freedom for an individual or for a collection of individuals.</p>
