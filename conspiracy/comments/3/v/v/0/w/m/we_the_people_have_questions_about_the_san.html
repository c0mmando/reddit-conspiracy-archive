<li><p>Since the windows of the couple’s SUV were found rolled up and blown out, how could the couple have initiated a gun battle with police through rolled-up windows? Nobody is going to fire assault weapons through rolled-up vehicle windows. The logical inference is that the police executed these people in cold blood. There was no “shootout.”</p></li>
<li><p>Both victims were found dead in handcuffs. Are we supposed to believe that they initiated a gun battle with police while wearing handcuffs and shooting through rolled-up windows?! It seems that the two patsies were handcuffed, set in place for execution according to a scripted plan, and summarily shot dead. </p></li>
<li><p>If the alleged shooters really “<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3346500/Pictured-handcuffed-body-San-Bernardino-terrorist-Pakistani-wife-pledged-allegiance-ISIS-Facebook-slaughter-14.html#ixzz3tYLMYyI5">had contact with Syrian al Qaeda-affiliated group AND al Shabaab in Somalia</a>” why wouldn’t the authorities make every effort to capture them alive so they could be interrogated, and their alleged terror network dismantled? This same question comes up every time the authorities summarily execute terror suspects and/or witnesses – Bin Laden, Mohamed Merah, the Charlie Hebdo patsies, Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and key witness Ibragim Todashev…</p></li>
<li><p>If the couple was really part of a terrorist network, would the FBI let the media ransack the crime scene?</p></li>
<li><p>If this supposed radical Muslim Bonnie-and-Clyde acted alone, <a href="http://www.daveandchad.com/2015/12/san-bernardino-drills-3rd-shooter-and-other-weird-stuff/">who was the third gunman reported by multiple eyewitnesses</a>?</p></li>
<li><p>Could the five foot tall, under-125-pound woman really have handled: <a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2015/12/04/san-bernardino-media-hoax-cnn-media-and-victims-families-ransack-suspects-family-home-crime-scene/">A tactic vest • Body armor • Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P .223 Caliber Assault rifle • Magazine re-loading clips • Hand gun • Spare pipe bomb, detonator</a> … and then tweet her allegiance to Islamic State exactly one minute after the shooting began? “<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/04/us/san-bernardino-shooting/">She posted a pledge of allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Facebook while the shooting was happening, three U.S. officials familiar with the investigation told CNN.</a>”</p></li>
<li><p>Why would Inland Regional Center conduct active shooter drills “every month or so” <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-san-bernardino-shooting-dramatic-video-shows-police-storming-inland-regional-center-20151202-story.html">as reported by the Los Angeles Times</a>?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it just a coincidence that the only center for disabled people in the world that conducts active shooter drills every month (I challenge readers to find another one) happened to be the place where either (a) a huge mass shooting just happened to erupt, or (b) a drill went live?</p></li>
<li><p>And if it’s just a coincidence, were the <a href="http://tarpley.net/2011/08/24/the-last-secret-of-911-truth/">46 drills of 9/11</a> also a coincidence, <a href="http://tarpley.net/2011/08/24/the-last-secret-of-911-truth/">Peter Power’s terror drills on 7/7/2005</a> yet another coincidence, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaWCumjviWg">Boston Marathon bomb drills</a> one more coincidence, <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/media-manipulation-and-the-paris-terror-attack-alleged-suspects-a-recovered-syrian-passport/5489222">the multiple-location active shooter exercises in Paris on 11/13</a> just another coincidence…and to accept all this “coincidence,” do you have to be a batshit-crazy coincidence theorist?</p></li>
<li><p>If this were really “radical Islamic terrorism,” why would the perpetrators kill a bunch of disabled people, rather than targeting high-level individuals who are responsible for the murder of more than a million Muslims since the 9/11/2001 neocon propaganda stunt?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>How about this....Why would someone go about attacking his place of employment knowing full well that they drill for an active shooter scenario constantly??? </p>

<p>Why would he think he could do major damage and escape?</p>

<p>So Sayed and his wife take the chance and shoot up the place killing 14 wounded 20+ more. Authorities should have this in the bag right?? I mean they constantly drill at this particular building. The response and operation should be swift and flawless, yet the perps are able to escape. </p>

<p>So upon escaping Sayed and his wife must not know what to do with themselves, So they drive around in the area for hours until they are spotted and eventually chased down and terminated.</p>

<p>Upon escaping the scene why not get the hell out of dodge? Why not drive anywhere other than the area of attack and do some damage somewhere else. </p>

<p>If they wanted to make a substantial point and do major carnage why not attack anywhere else? </p>

<p>There is a huge shopping center nearby seems like a great place for maximum casualties.</p>

<p>Why not hit the highway and start blasting cars? I mean this attack was meant to draw attention to radical Islamic ideals. Their potential for destruction was there. They had the fire power and they had the time! </p>

<p>This story makes zero sense.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t shoot up his place of employment FYI. Farood woked at the 
San Bernadino Environmental Health Services Department
385 N Arrowhead Ave, San Bernardino, CA 92415</p>

<p>The shooting took place at the Inland Regional Center

    <div class="md"><p>Why would he think he can do damage and escape?  They were all in the same room for a Christmas party.  They were sitting ducks at that point.  I imagine any other work day and the shooters have to go room to room to try to kill which would take significantly longer.   I assume that&#39;s why he waited for the party.  Scope out the place and come back.  Think about it, a large group of people in the same conference room for the party.  They show up, shoot for a few minutes and leave.  And I really think they thought they could get away with it and move onto the next location if they were quick enough. </p>

<p>Also I don&#39;t care how much you drill, no response will be fast enough to catch them right away if they&#39;re in and out in less than 5 minutes.  Unless the police see the shooter immediately, before they can really react they have to secure the scene and get an idea from the witnesses as to who they&#39;re after.  And the drills are for the people inside so they know what to do to stay safe.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like what exactly?  Any event where there are large number of people will have a protocol for an active shooter as well as security on site.  I think he chose his work because it was such an easy target.  They haven&#39;t said how many people were there but considering 14 were killed and another 21 injured and assuming others escaped unharmed, it&#39;s not like a room with at least 40+ people isn&#39;t a small gathering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. But really, under what scenario would they attempt to escape like this? If their intent was to kill police officers, they could have attempted an ambush. If their intent was to escape, then why stay in the neighborhood while the cops look for you?</p>

<p>It&#39;s strange enough that shooters apparently pick remote spots in which drills regularly occur, or while one is occurring. What happened afterwards is just as strange, and keeping the chase and subsequent shootout in the neighborhood is consistent with a training exercise. I simply can&#39;t recall a time in which criminals are driving around, not making any attempt to drive far away or run on foot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly!!! Great point. &quot;THEY ESCAPED&quot; so why not leave,get away,screw,take off...LITERALLY GET AWAY!! Do not drive around the area of attack, do not drive around your house. There is no conceivable reason to act this way. </p>

<p>As I stated earlier, if you were intent on causing so much damage in the name of Allah and knowing you were going to die, why not start shooting up some other place. Shopping centers right nearby. Small airport nearby. Ambush the first responders. </p>

<p>The only thing that makes some type of sense is that maybe, just maybe it was a setup for what Sayed thought was him participating in a drill and whatever agency was in charge had that drill go live. </p>

<p>Sayed, upon realizing this is not a drill, just gets the hell out of there and is confused and doesn&#39;t know what to do. So he drives around for hours trying to understand what the hell just happened. Confused, probably scared, thinks about going home. When an aynonomous tip comes in saying the SUV has been spotted and we know the rest.</p>

<p>This is all pure speculation, but it makes a smidge of sense. It would make for a story. Again, something isn&#39;t right with this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you said seems more likely than what was reported. But it would be poor practice to have a guy participate under the pretense of it being a drill, only to frame him as the suspect of a real shooting, while failing to keep him contained and let him get away at all.</p>

<p>I wrote a longer post about this somewhere else detailing how the SUV being chased in the videos we saw at white Ford Bronco speed was nothing other than a government vehicle. We all know these feds love their black SUV&#39;s - plus, why were the SUV&#39;s hazard lights on? Seems consistent with a drill as well. We never see video of the chase coming to an end - we just suddenly stumble upon the scene in the aftermath of the shootout. Who&#39;s to say they didn&#39;t just stop the SUV, pump it full of rounds (real/blanks/whatever), while they tossed a body on the ground nearby? Helicopter pilots in SoCal know how to capture good live shots - the fact that we never got such footage is absurd.</p>

He also says in the video that there were two muslim guys driving it, which seemed strange to me considering his view of it and how darkly tinted the windows were (as well as rolled up.)  Was the one you&#39;re referring to the one where the SUV slows down to 25 then speeds up to 40, puts it&#39;s flashers on, then supposedly starts firing?  That&#39;s the one I saw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll try:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I thought one male DOA was downed outside the SUV. According to scanner traffic the female was in the back seat, with an AR strapped across her chest &quot;still breathing&quot; early on, and was dragged out into the street later. And yes you can shoot through vehicle safety glass.</p></li>
<li><p>Its common to cuff a downed suspect. Until declared officially dead, an inert body may awake and pose a further threat. Its happened before. </p></li>
<li><p>Good point, but if they were engaging in a gun battle, as claimed, not a viable option at the time. Scene safety comes first, intel comes later. </p></li>
<li><p>FBI had cleared the scene and had no claim on it anymore. Not to say SBSD may not have wanted it still sealed, and its pretty clear that the landlord had no legal right to let the media in.</p></li>
<li><p>In the chaos of an active shooter scene, this is common. They even detained some people. They stated at a press conference that they had a third suspect &quot;not under arrest at this time.&quot; Since its an active investigation, there are many reasons for keeping this from the public.</p></li>
<li><p>Your sexism is showing. And since when is CNN a reliable source of news?</p></li>
<li><p>Because the center could be a target (and they were). Think of all the active shooter drills at places that havent been hit. These days everyone should have a drill, and every person should have an exit plan wherever he goes in public. </p></li>
<li><p>See #7.</p></li>
<li><p>wont toucht this one.</p></li>
<li><p>The people killed were co-workers in public health with Farook. They were not &quot;a bunch of disabled people.&quot; They had gathered for a training presentation, followed by a xmas party. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Why were they a target? That answer died with the shooter. Perhaps he knew the layout and that they were vulnerable and for whatever reason he felt he had to act quickly. Maybe he thought he had been discovered. He left a lot of plumbing and ammo back at his crib. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That literally proves the point about how men tend to biologically be stronger than women, which I pointed out in my first comment. </p>

<p>This study doesn&#39;t even mention whether or not those women were body builders, athletes or anything more than a female who lives a &quot;normal&quot; life. Of course, you take an average female and an average male, the male will be physically stronger, as per your link. </p>

<p>But your missing the point completely, women can become body builders, athletes, Olympians, soldiers and fighters, okay? That&#39;s the point. </p>

<p>Thus, there is nothing unusual with the idea that a female might be able to operate a gun whilst wearing a vest, or doing an endless list of other physically demanding activities. That&#39;s obviously within the realms of possibility. </p>

Firstly, they weren&#39;t in a war zone, second, they weren&#39;t firing on armed combatants, and thirdly, they were executing unarmed civilians, I suspect at close range as well.

    <div class="md"><p>Rather than answer these questions I&#39;d like to add some additional interesting points.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Examining the available video and photos of the SUV, one can see that the rear door windows are still intact. The one on the passenger side appears to have no damage. The driver side has bullet holes. Interestingly one can make out the this window was rolled down during the inspection of the car (all the little triangle markers are placed). It is very hard to tell if the back window was blown out or not. Some pictures look like it is intact with perhaps two bullet holes. But post inspection pictures clearly show the window missing. What type of SUV is this and can the back window be rolled down? Also, video shows that the front window had no bullet holes prior to final shootout.</p></li>
<li><p>It may be standard practice for police to handcuff dead suspects, but the picture of the male is particularly odd in that his wrist look rubbed raw with deep red striations, as if he were struggling to break free of them.</p></li>
<li><p>While I understand no one wants to risk getting shot, you would think a certain amount of value would be placed to apprehending perpetrators alive, for numerous reasons. Least of which is to understand their motives. Of course, dead men tell no tales.</p></li>
<li><p>That the press was let back into the house only after a couple days is mind boggling. But I am glad they did, as it showed some interesting tidbits that largely went over looked. Did anyone else notice that the treadmill still had the tag on it? Who buys a treadmill shortly before they plan to martyr themselves? Worried about those extra pounds showing up on pics of your dead carcass? It seems much more likely that she was worried about taking off the fat from giving birth. Which means she wasn&#39;t planning on dying. This is further backed up by the fact that a box of clothes ordered from Sears was on route for delivery after the couples death.</p></li>
<li><p>I have only heard testimony from one eye whiteness. And she said she was certain she saw three shooters. Now one can understand getting the race wrong, but getting the number wrong seems quite a bit harder.</p></li>
<li><p>She may have been able to handle the weapon. But it is odd that she would be sending out a Facebook post less than fifteen minutes after the shooting began and under a false name/alter ego account. That means she would have had to do it with a cellphone just a few minutes after leaving the scene of the crime. I wonder if the police found that phone.</p></li>
<li><p>Who knows. Monthly does seem like a lot, though.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>And how could you kill people you worked with for five years? And at least one of the victims was a Muslim too! They also recently threw a baby shower for the mother. Can you imagine attending a baby shower and pretending all was well while secretly plotting to murder all the people there? They had to be some of the greatest actors of all time!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And to throw in one last extra point. Having ammo and practicing shooting is very common in The U.S. So owning ammo does not necessarily indicate a plan for mass murder. And now they are saying the pipe bombs were just pipes that &quot;could have been&quot; made into bombs.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Very easily, if you&#39;re mentally disturbed and you don&#39;t like your job.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s important to ask questions, and I&#39;m not trying to take away from anything you just said, but one thing I usually see left out of the &#39;analysis&#39; is the idea that there ARE mentally disturbed/psychotic people out there who commit senseless acts of violence. I see people acting like that could never happen....like senseless violence, or wonton death and destruction isn&#39;t a real thing that happens in the world. Like there aren&#39;t people out there who are batshit crazy: there absolutely are. Wondering, &#39;oh, if they wanted to do mass damage, they could have done this, so why didn&#39;t they?&#39;.....you have to assume if someone is crazy enough to want to go shoot a bunch of people, it stands to reason they&#39;re not thinking things through rationally and practically. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you imagine attending a baby shower and pretending all was well while secretly plotting to murder all the people there?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I cannot. But then again, I also don&#39;t have any desire to shoot a bunch of people. Who knows what it must be like to be a person like that? The whole thing about being crazy is that you&#39;re not thinking the same way a normal person would.</p>

<p>Again, all that being said, there&#39;s legit questions that should be answered (why&#39;d they let the press in, how&#39;d they become &#39;radicalized&#39;, what groups were they in touch with, where&#39;d they get the money for all their shit, etc.)....but trying to argue they weren&#39;t &#39;acting rationally&#39; as evidence that there&#39;s something else going on....someone that would shoot a bunch of people wouldn&#39;t &#39;act rationally&#39; under any circumstances, as shooting people isn&#39;t rational.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before I take a stab at answering some of these questions, I just wanna say, I truly believe that false flag events are a real thing. I just don&#39;t happen to believe that this (or the PP attack in Colorado) is one of them. As a reference, OP&#39;s questions came nearly verbatim from <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2015/12/06/holes/">this</a> veteranstoday.com article. Sooooo, here we go.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since the windows of the couple’s SUV were found rolled up and blown out, how could the couple have initiated a gun battle with police through rolled-up windows? Nobody is going to fire assault weapons through rolled-up vehicle windows. The logical inference is that the police executed these people in cold blood. There was no “shootout.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shooting through a window may make your first round miss, but it probably wouldn&#39;t do too much to change the trajectory. Shooting through glass is like a hot knife through butter. The glass will most likely shatter, which gives a clear shot. I have no idea who shot first in this shootout. But it only takes one round to shatter the glass and give a clear shot/view for all parties involved. This is absolutely a weak argument for those who are trying to make the false-flag point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both victims were found dead in handcuffs. Are we supposed to believe that they initiated a gun battle with police while wearing handcuffs and shooting through rolled-up windows?! It seems that the two patsies were handcuffed, set in place for execution according to a scripted plan, and summarily shot dead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you look at <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/handcuffs-480x640.jpg">this</a> photo that was used by veteranstoday.com to show that the patsies were handcuffed then shot, you can tell that the body had been face up, bled a shit-ton, then turned to be face down. This is standard procedure for police. Dead, dying, or alive, suspects in this type of situation are always placed in handcuffs. Notice the feet are crossed. You always cross a suspects feet in that manner to prevent them from standing. This point doesn&#39;t pan out. The original position of the body is easily determined from blood pooling and the handcuffs are the first thing applied to a shooter, which explains the bracelets on the body and the fact that it was obviously turned over.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the alleged shooters really “had contact with Syrian al Qaeda-affiliated group AND al Shabaab in Somalia[1] ” why wouldn’t the authorities make every effort to capture them alive so they could be interrogated, and their alleged terror network dismantled? This same question comes up every time the authorities summarily execute terror suspects and/or witnesses – Bin Laden, Mohamed Merah, the Charlie Hebdo patsies, Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and key witness Ibragim Todashev…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not going to fight this point all that much. Patsies die. That&#39;s why they&#39;re patsies. Whether these two people were or weren&#39;t patsies, I don&#39;t know. Most patsies of what I believe are true false flags have been unarmed when they&#39;re killed or are said to have killed themselves. These ones seemed to have been armed and fighting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the couple was really part of a terrorist network, would the FBI let the media ransack the crime scene?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. There is no way. There would be police on the crime scene for many days, processing EVERYTHING. What the press raided wasn&#39;t a crime scene. Could it have been the perpetrators residence? Maybe. I doubt it, but it&#39;s possible. The real crime scene was somewhere else. I guarantee it. I don&#39;t really have an answer to this, but no, CNN et. al. did not get full access to the crime scene of a terrorist attack. That did not happen. Could the FBI have been manipulating media at this point in there investigation to try to attempt to control spin? I wouldn&#39;t doubt it. But I would highly doubt that what we saw the press trample through was anything close to anything related to the attacks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If this supposed radical Muslim Bonnie-and-Clyde acted alone, who was the third gunman reported by multiple eyewitnesses[2] ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is one of the reasons I have my doubts about the crime scene being a media free-for-all. There were multiple live accounts from witnesses claiming three male shooters. I think suspect #3 is probably still on the run. I&#39;m willing to bet the Feds know where all of the planning and preparation took place and are waiting for shithead #3 to eventually show up. Swarming it with police is a bad idea, because you know that Southland (LA, SD) media are still scouring San Bernadino by foot and by air for a large gathering of black Crown Vic&#39;s and will report the situation LIVE immediately.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Could the five foot tall, under-125-pound woman really have handled: A tactic vest • Body armor • Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P .223 Caliber Assault rifle • Magazine re-loading clips • Hand gun • Spare pipe bomb, detonator[3] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup. I&#39;ve seen smaller females ruck more than that many times. Those things MIGHT weigh 60 lbs, but I doubt it. My PG at basic carried all of her shit, PLUS all of the gear of another female who fell out of a ruck march. For 6 miles. Never underestimate a woman just because she doesn&#39;t have a dick. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>… and then tweet her allegiance to Islamic State exactly one minute after the shooting began? “She posted a pledge of allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Facebook while the shooting was happening, three U.S. officials familiar with the investigation told CNN.[4] ”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To classify something as a terrorist act, there has to be an agenda. Posting to social media is just as important as pulling a trigger, in this case. And if you don&#39;t buy that it happened live, there are a number of ways to pre-schedule a tweet/FB post/Snapchat. Social media managers don&#39;t usually work on weekends. Hootsuite and the like are common as hell. Not that one of those services was used, but it&#39;s a viable option that can&#39;t be discounted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would Inland Regional Center conduct active shooter drills “every month or so” as reported by the Los Angeles Times[5] ?
Is it just a coincidence that the only center for disabled people in the world that conducts active shooter drills every month (I challenge readers to find another one) happened to be the place where either (a) a huge mass shooting just happened to erupt, or (b) a drill went live?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that drills are often held the day of (or a few days prior to) a false flag attack is absolutely valid. 9/11, Sandyhook, etc. But the fact that a government owned facility is used for both police training one day and a government holiday party the next is FAR from damning evidence. There are a number of parking lots near me that are built to park school busses. During the busy season/mornings when all of the busses are out picking up crotch-fruits, they are used by local SWAT teams to practice bus extractions and hostage situations. The fact that these lots are empty during the day is what draws car auctions, highway paint testing, and the local police academy&#39;s EVOC training course to help fill the school district&#39;s meager coffers. </p>

<p>And if it’s just a coincidence, were the 46 drills of 9/11[6] also a coincidence, Peter Power’s terror drills on 7/7/2005[7] yet another coincidence, the Boston Marathon bomb drills [8] one more coincidence, the multiple-location active shooter exercises in Paris on 11/13[9] just another coincidence…and to accept all this “coincidence,” do you have to be a batshit-crazy coincidence theorist?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t argue that false-flag &quot;terrorist attacks&quot; are being perpetrated on this country. I just don&#39;t think this was one of them. I&#39;ll talk a bit more about why I think that far below.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If this were really “radical Islamic terrorism,” why would the perpetrators kill a bunch of disabled people</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They didn&#39;t. They targeted a holiday party held by the county. The male suspect worked for the county department of Environmental Health and Safety. He knew that his department was having a party with other county departments. It&#39;s a perfect target if your goal is to cause government casualties. The facility where the party was being held also happened to house a training facility for the disabled. The attorney who drew up these bullshit talking points is an idiot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>rather than targeting high-level individuals who are responsible for the murder of more than a million Muslims since the 9/11/2001 neocon propaganda stunt?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You know who gets a shit ton of security at their parties? High-level individuals. The G-8 isn&#39;t a very good target compared to a bunch of relatively low-level county employees. Why? Because the G-8 has the protection of the protective services of at least 8 nations. The local bumfuck CA county bureaucrats won&#39;t even bother to have their 9$/hour rent-a-cops share their Costco cake, much less provide protection. </p>

<p>So here&#39;s why I think this was an actual attack:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It&#39;s not hard to buy semi-auto assault weapons in SanBernCo. Hit up your local gun store/show, show proper ID, don&#39;t have a felony or a violent misdemeanor, and 10 days later, you&#39;ve got yourself a high-powered rifle and as much ammo as your little heart desires. It&#39;s easy.</p></li>
<li><p>Too many fucking news choppers in LA. It&#39;s a super quick hop for the dozens of news helicopters from LA to jump over to San Bernadino. If you want a good false flag, you need to be able to control the scene(s). This simply didn&#39;t happen. I watched the entire thing live thanks to all of the news choppers that took a quick flight into the desert. I saw all of this shit go down maybe 20 minutes after it started. Live.</p></li>
<li><p>The perpetrators (or at least two of the perpetrators) were seen. False flags have this canned, planned-way-in-advance feel. The perps are rarely seen outside of official photos, if ever. I saw the bodies in the street live from a Fox helicopter. A FF attack would have had them kill themselves (or be killed by police) FAR from any cameras. </p></li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>[PART 2]</p>

<p>#4 The scene of the crime wasn&#39;t isolated enough for a FF attack. There were witnesses to the shooting who beelined for reporters (as is the case in almost every southland news story). There were witnesses to the manhunt. There were witnesses to the conclusion. It&#39;s too messy to be a False Flag. </p>

<p>I think this sub is grasping at straws here. Are the Feds trying there best to spin this in a way that fits their narrative? They absolutely are. But they are doing a piss poor job because they are used to having total control over the story and it&#39;s outcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I certainly can&#39;t call this a hoax with any confidence, but with the drills that were constantly being conducted in the area (even if not in the same building, which you said it wasn&#39;t) are far too suspicious for me to think nothing was covered up. How many active shooter drills are really going on in this country, and how likely is it that the scene of a mass shooting would, again, be at one of those locations?</p>

<p>As far as the crime scene itself. It&#39;s very odd. Per the police scanner feed released by CNN, the dispatcher makes reference to &quot;this frequency&quot;, indicating that, as in other previous drills gone live, there was one frequency being used for federal authorities and a different one for locals. The context was an officer asking what the description of the suspect was, and the dispatcher clearly said &quot;a dark-skinned male...that&#39;s all I have on this frequency.&quot; Why would it be significant what frequency the suspect&#39;s description was reported on?</p>

<p>While there are plenty of witnesses to the shootout...none of them actually capture the scene. People who were in position to maybe capture this shootout were being screamed at by officers passing by to get inside. While that in itself is not suspicious, there was clearly an effort to keep people who would see it from the side of the street.</p>

<p>As a former resident of the L.A. area, and a former viewer of shows such as &quot;Most Dangerous Police Chases&quot;, I&#39;ve seen plenty of these chases from helicopter. Per the witness footage we DO have, it was absolutely no secret where this vehicle was, as there were probably like 50 or more cars driving behind it. The helicopters would have NO problem identifying the location of the chase, and thus, would be following it the entire time, capturing the shootout live. Perhaps they were following a decoy vehicle instead? This would explain why they arrived on the scene AFTER the shootout.</p>

<p>One more thing I&#39;m trying to understand...the male suspect who was dead on the road was a good 20 feet from the vehicle. If the police really lit up that SUV while he was in it, there would be some sort of trail of blood as he stumbled to the side. Or did he get out, start running, and then get lit up? If so, he must have fell exactly where he got shot, which is quite plausible. Although if Alison Parker can get shot point-blank and still run away, how come this guy simply dies on the spot? LOL.</p>

<p>Given that there were multiple frequencies being used for this response, my best hypothesis is that the responding officers who weren&#39;t certain this was a drill were mislead, possibly following a separate black SUV which was just another agents&#39; vehicle. Meanwhile, the federal agents followed the actual SUV, waited for it to stop (in the middle of the road?!), then lit the vehicle up. They either waited for the driver to get out, or the car was driver-less or being driven remotely. The body on the road could have been dumped off by anybody. Again, there&#39;s no footage, so any of this is possible.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m doing is detailing a scenario which COULD have allowed this setup to work. Who knows if people really were killed, but given that they were government employees, it makes you wonder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Coincidence theory is deragatory to the actual nature of these questions. These aren&#39;t coincidences being called out, they&#39;re clear cases of either extrodinaraly sloppy police work and reportong or deliberate blurring of the truth. BOTH of these possibilities are worthy of addressing so the questions are valid ones that deserve answers.
Also the nature of the coincidences mentioned goes against people&#39;s natural ideas of how events go down in the real world. If we can&#39;t trust our natural inclinations enough to at least demand the answer as to why they&#39;re flawed then we&#39;re giving our own power to dictate reality directly the government and media. That&#39;s not something that sits well with me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the legal system, there&#39;s a very long and complex process to ensure that the eyewitness actual remembers what they saw and isn&#39;t subconsciously inventing facts. One example is the well-known police lineup. If the victim can pick out the perpetrator from a group of similar looking people, that&#39;s grounds for a good eyewitness testimony. Many cases that rely <em>exclusively</em> on what someone said they saw get thrown out of court due to lack of evidence. </p>

<p>As Yserbius is a mod at r/israel, wouldn&#39;t his/her talking point be that Islamic Terrorists attacked the Pentagon on 9/11? I just responded to one of his/her comments that </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no video or photographic proof that Islamic terrorists ever attacked the Pentagon</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which there isn&#39;t. (S)he is not wrong. But wouldn&#39;t a Zionist shill want to propagate the belief that an Islamist Extremist under the direction of Al Qaeda flew a commercial jet into the side of the Pentagon?</p>

<p>I guess I just assumed that a mod of <a href="/r/israel">/r/israel</a> would side with the official explanation as opposed to denying any evidence of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, the smoking gun is the apartment and the media bum rush. This seems like a desperate attempt to cover the all the loose ends they ended up leaving. It was meant to be the thing that cast away all doubt...if you didn&#39;t use your brain. </p>

<p>We are supposed to believe that the police had concluded their investigation of the residence, which, as reported, is why police officers at the scene did not stop the media bum rush into the apt. 
So they want us to believe that they were done with the investigation and somehow didn&#39;t find the various ID&#39;s, weapons, ammunition, IED&#39;s, etc, useful as evidence? </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but if this were an actual suspected terror plot, they would have emptied 100% of that apartment, especially anything weapon related, into an evidence van. Even the paint would have been stripped from the walls to analyze for chemical agents (exaggeration probably). There is absolutely no way that all that stuff would have been left at the home after a real investigation took place, period. </p>

<p>Maybe I have missed an update to the &quot;official story&quot; that says the police weren&#39;t actually done investigating and only said that to cover their asses for letting the press in. </p>

<li><p>good point letting crime scene be ransacked is pure proof of a coverup . . . now they can later say crime scene was contaminated. This is crime scene 101 not some innocent mistake.</p></li>

<li><p>Could she have handled those weapons? Not sure tho it is fishy. As for her being on facebook during attack, that could be a problem with time on facebook, that was an explanation for twitter comments that happened before sandy hook before.</p></li>
<li><p>now this, with active shooter drills once a month . . . I can see why they would do this, the inland regional center deals with people with mental problems . .  . of course it looks bad that one of their own employees is one who went nuts. </p></li>

Well not all but I bet many are, we have morons in this country that believe all propaganda, they have them in every country I can imagine. Why would they kill innocent disabled people? That explanation could fit with MSM&#39;s official explanation, that they are radical islamists wghich means they are insane morons. Easily controlled.

<p>#9      And if it’s just a coincidence, were the 46 drills of 9/11 also a coincidence, Peter Power’s terror drills on 7/7/2005 yet another coincidence, the Boston Marathon bomb drills one more coincidence, the multiple-location active shooter exercises in Paris on 11/13 just another coincidence…and to accept all this “coincidence,” do you have to be a batshit-crazy coincidence theorist?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Google &quot; hold active shooter drill&quot; and see how many are listed each time you search. Track them and then come back and tell us how many became &quot;false flag&quot; actual shooting incidents, and how many never amounted to an incident.</p>

<p>Anyone care to guess which number is higher? Way higher.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And what about the chance of a live event going down in a short distance from a drill.  If you factor in the size of the country, I bet it is a more interesting figure.  Then factor in there was a drill near every single live event... the chance of that happening should be close to zero, but it happens every single time.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding items 8 and 9 - it occurs to me that the purpose of those location drills is to create a managed and consistent response. That way, if one were to intimately know the details of the response, the shooters/operators would be able to easily avoid and navigate through the preprogrammed response.</p>

<p>It&#39;s dress rehearsal but not for the victims. It&#39;s for the benefit of the planned shooters and their team.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>4) 
I have just received some correspondence from the BBC about my complaint.....</p>

<p>&quot;Dear *******
Thanks for contacting us about BBC News’ coverage of the recent shootings in San Bernadino, California.</p>

<p>We spoke to senior editorial staff at BBC News about your complaint, and to the BBC journalists who reported from the apartment of Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik. </p>

<p>They explained that unlike the attacks in Paris, the shootings in San Bernadino were carried out by an unlikely and seemingly ordinary married couple who were parents of a young baby. They did not fit any of the expected profiles of jihadi mass murderers and we thought this could be illustrated by seeing close at hand how they had lived ordinary lives in an ordinary home, deceiving friends, relatives and neighbours. </p>

<p>The FBI stated on the day that journalists were allowed into their home, as it was no longer part of its investigation. The local police force was present when journalists went into the premises.</p>

<p>This story raises many issues, including the US’s difficult relationships with gun ownership, home-grown terrorism and Islam. The coverage from inside the apartment was a brief part of our overall reporting of these wider subjects. In this context we felt it was an appropriate and relevant part of understanding who the killers were and the changing nature of Islamist terror their domestic arrangements may reflect.</p>

<p>We know you feel we didn’t get the balance quite right here and very much appreciate your concerns and feedback on our coverage. </p>

<p>Kind Regards</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t have a bunch of answers but to number 1. the police in pursuit said they were firing out of the back window of the vehicle.  Listening to the police scanners you could hear incoming and outgoing gun fire.</p>

<p>One of the new stations actually showed Farook exit the vehicle run fire his rifle and then get killed in a volley of fire by police.  I personally did not see this but it was posted on reddit as I followed the story.  The police scanner seconds after this happened on TV reported that one person was down one person was still in the vehicle and were confused if one person had run from the scene.  When Malik was pulled from the vehicle she was not hand cuffed I saw that on TV.</p>

<p>The other thing I would point out that Inland Regional where the original shooting took place was not where Farook worked.  The county Department of Public Health rented the space from the center to host a training and holiday party.  Farook likely had no idea they had active shooter training at the facility nor were anybody that was disabled that used the facility wounded or killed in the attack.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>An alienated couple go bat-shit crazy and for reasons I don&#39;t know (there are reasons i don&#39;t know) decide to leave the kid with grandma and go out in a blaze of glory. The story is collected piecemeal from the usual conflicting accounts. OR...</p></li>
<li><p>Police, stunned by not predicting the attack(or secretly plotting it), quickly gather the comprehensive dossiers on these two (which they never had) use it to frame them for exactly what they were doing. All the while, mind you, conducting the entire operation during a gun battle and on live TV, resulting in the deaths of their patsies.</p></li>
