       Every time there is a mass shooting, some people come to the fore front claiming it was "staged" or a "false flag" event, making bold statements. . .with no bold evidence to follow suit. Everytime a mass shooting tragedy unfolds, trash threads like this:

       That post links to an article from a no-name website, by a no-name author who derives the bulk of his conspiracy nutjob reasoning from uncredible witness sources in order to infer some sort of conspiracy. The author is clearly speculating, but it doesn't stop masses people from gobbling it up like it was gold.

       posting an uncredible article from an uncredible author making uncredible claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       You then have people responding to that user posted article saying stuff like this
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Excellent read. That was a real page turner. I figured something smell fishy about this from the gate. Nice to see it all presented this way. Thanks for sharing."

       Like why are these people so easily persuaded by uncredible evidence just because it rubs well with their " Anti-New World Order" worldview? Because stuff like that isn't persuasive to people like me who have more than two braincells to rub together.

       Weaponized anthrax has a signature saying the facility it came from. Their aren't many and there aren't many at them allowed to access it.

       You are trying to tell me that it would take 10 years to find out who was responsible? That the guy in charge at the FBI said it wasn't him and he is conveniently dead so there is no need for any evidence.

        Avidly interested in science, Ivins was an active participant in extracurricular activities in high school, including National Honor Society, science fairs, the current events club, and the scholarship team all four years. He ran on the track and cross-country teams, worked on the yearbook and school newspaper, and was in the school choir and junior and senior class plays.[23]
       </p>
       <p>
        In December 1975, Ivans married nursing student Mary Diane Betsch (known as Diane), to whom he remained married until his death.[1][24] The couple had two children.[1][23][25] Diane Ivins was a homemaker and full time parent who also ran a daycare center out of the family's home.[26] His wife, children, and brothers were all still alive at the time of his death; his parents were deceased.[1]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What do the specialists say?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Those who argue for Ivins' innocence claim that the anthrax used in the attacks was too sophisticated to be produced by a lone researcher without relevant training. "In my opinion, there are maybe four or five people in the whole country who might be able to make this stuff, and I'm one of them," said Richard O. Spertzel, former deputy commander of USAMRIID.[62] "And even with a good lab and staff to help run it, it might take me a year to come up with a product as good."[62] The spores in the Daschle letter were 1.5 to 3 micrometres across, many times smaller than the finest known grade of anthrax produced by either the U.S. or Soviet bioweapons programs.[62] An electron microscope, which costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, would be needed to verify that the target spore size had been consistently achieved.[62] The presence of the anti-clumping additive silicon in the anthrax samples also suggests a high degree of sophistication as specialists working at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory were unable to duplicate this property despite 56 attempts.[63]
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr. Henry S. Heine, a microbiologist who was Ivins' fellow researcher at the Army Medical Research Institute, told a National Academy of Sciences panel on April 22, 2010 that he considered it impossible that Ivins could have produced the anthrax used in the attacks without detection.[14]
       </p>
       <p>
        Heine told the 16-member National Academy of Sciences panel that producing the quantity of spores in the letters would have taken at least a year of intensive work using the equipment at the U.S. Army laboratory. Such an effort would not have escaped colleagues’ notice, and laboratory technicians who worked closely with Dr. Ivins have told him they saw no such work.[14]
       </p>
       <p>
        Heine also disputed the notion that biological containment measures where Dr. Ivins worked were inadequate to prevent the spores from floating out of the laboratory into animal cages and offices. He told the panel that if the containment was inadequate, "You’d have had dead animals or dead people".[14]
       </p>
       <p>
        Heine said he did not dispute that there was a genetic link between the spores in the letters and the anthrax in Ivins’ flask, which led the FBI to conclude that Ivins had grown the spores from a sample taken from the flask. Heine pointed out that samples from the flask were widely shared. Accusing Ivins of the attacks, he said, was like tracing a murder to the clerk at the sporting goods shop who sold the bullets.[14]
       </p>
       <p>
        Asked by reporters after his testimony whether he believed there was any chance that Ivins had carried out the attacks, Heine replied, “Absolutely not.” At the Army’s biodefense laboratory, he said, “among the senior scientists, no one believes it.”[14]
       </p>
       <p>
        The FBI asked the National Academy of Sciences to review the FBI's scientific work on the case. A panel was created, chaired by Alice P. Gast, president of Lehigh University.[14] On May 15, 2011 the panel released its findings, which "conclude[d] that the bureau overstated the strength of genetic analysis linking the mailed anthrax to a supply kept by Bruce E. Ivins."[6]
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the release of a National Academy of Sciences report in February 2011, Congressman Rush D. Holt, Jr. (D-NJ), a physicist from whose district the anthrax letters were mailed, re-introduced legislation "to create a 9/11-style Commission, complete with subpoena power, with a mandate to review the entire matter."[6] Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa told The Washington Post: "There are no more excuses for avoiding an independent review."[6] Journalist Glenn Greenwald, who has been vocal in his criticism of the anthrax investigation,[78][85][86][87][88] argued that "[o]ther than a desire to avoid finding out who the culprit was (or to avoid having the FBI's case against Ivins subjected to scrutiny), there's no rational reason to oppose an independent investigation into this matter."[6]

       it was actually his co-worker that made the anthrax, but they were investigating the guy that committed suicide in order to catch the real perp.  they didnt expect he would commit suicide. they thought he would give up everything he knew, inadvertently incriminating his co-worker in the process.  meanwhile, his co-worker (the real perp) thinks hes off the hook as far as investigation goes because they are watching the other guy so closely and openly.  its a shitty investigation tactic that went horribly wrong.  naturally, nobody was held accountable.

       If the government ever actually put out any "bold evidence" for their "bold claims" you wouldn't find so many doubters.

      <p>
       Why should we believe the government's story when they offer no proof?

       Exactly.

        It's up to the people making the claim to show proof, not us to disprove.

       The only "proof" we've been shown is a bag of what may be pipe bombs, which may or may not have been taken from the alleged terrorists' home.

       I would argue that Occam's Razor plays a part in this. The evidence is on those making the extraordinary claim to prove their claim's basis in fact. The Claim that it was organised and committed by the government with no one knowing or coming forward is by far more extraordinary than the claim that it was the work of two lone wolf terrorists, and the investigation was handled badly.

       We were shown a video of what we are told is one of the shooters, lying in the street after the "shoot-out".  We were shown pix of supposed dead bodies in the theater in Paris.  We see pix of supposed dead bodies on the news any time it's convenient.  When it's not convenient, we're told that the pictures are "too gruesome"---even though we can see pictures of corpses right here on reddit.  People die all the time.  Everybody dies.  I'm going to die.  You're going to die too.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we haven't even been shown videos or pictures of the
       <em>
        live
       </em>
       couple on the premises, or entering the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely a video exists, if this event really occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only so-called "proof" is a picture of what could be pipe-bombs---a picture which could've just as easily been taken in Bloomington, Okinawa, or Timbuktu.

       It's not really a no-name website, and the author sources his information, most of which has been posted here before in other links and shown to be valid, i.e., what was said was actually said, on camera and/or with audio – even from the "uncreidble article" posted in the top comment.

       Why do you pay attention to the voting?  The quantity and speed of votes that propel posts to the top is completely out of whack with the commenting population here.  Vote manipulation is a simple matter.  It is also a simple matter to come here and post garbage to make the place look bad.  There is no filter for motivation of posters.

       You are not using the sub properly.  Sort by /new and evaluate the content of each post yourself.  If you feel you can contribute to a specific post, go ahead and comment.  It is a place to share ideas.  It is NOT a unified voice or community.  As soon as we allow that definition we are guilty by association to whatever garbage someone with an agenda decides to post.
