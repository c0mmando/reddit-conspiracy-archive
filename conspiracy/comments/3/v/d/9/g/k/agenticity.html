        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With a single word everything becomes clear.</p>

<p>I was studying the JTRIG slides leaked by Edward Snowden</p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/">https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/</a></p>

<p>And one thing became clear to me immediately, These slides obviously were intended to be nothing more than visual aides for a presentation like training session.  Yes the boring kind of shit you encounter while slagging your soul away for some corporate monstrosity which just adopted a new system for managing their dangleberries.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what the system is, or what company its for... They always come along with some asshole who is never going to have to use the system, a power point presentation and an overly rehearsed speech that is supposed to pump up your morale and keep you engaged in the learning process.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t make these presentations for the highly skilled workers out there,  presentations like these are intended to bridge the gap between those who design the &quot;systems&quot; and the poor unfortunate  sods who will be slaving away behind a computer screen using the system until the system is replaced or they die from drinking too much coffee, eating too many donuts and never having time to exercise properly during the free hours of their monotonous lives.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/sPswk8U">http://imgur.com/sPswk8U</a> This slide here, which I stole from <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2014/02/24/art-deception-training-new-generation-online-covert-operations/">https://theintercept.com/document/2014/02/24/art-deception-training-new-generation-online-covert-operations/</a> Shows that this training course is completed over the time span of a month or so.  Under each cell it lists a time the section will take to cover.</p>

<p>So anyways AGENTICITY!  I was looking at the slides and trying to reverse engineer what the presentation might have been like...</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/EM8Xr">http://imgur.com/a/EM8Xr</a></p>

<p>These three slides clearly build upon one another while some coffee drinking asshole with a laser pointer tries to be excited about teaching people how to be sociopathic cunts on the internet.  Then his little red dot starts circling the word &quot;AGENTICITY&quot;.</p>

<p>Agenticity pretty clearly covers the scope of how these JTRIG assholes exploit the unsuspecting minds around us, including your own.  (my own, yeah whatever)</p>

<p>Agenticity is the general concept that our psychology is wired to see patterns in events and one can only assume this helps us quickly learn to survive in unfamiliar environments as cavemen or whatever.  But as we evolved as beings and societies this basic wiring stuck around and SURPRISE! we still see patterns in shit.</p>

<p>Sometimes those patterns are useful and sometimes they result in us doing superstitious stuff that doesn&#39;t actually accomplish anything.  But in the context of JTRIG I think they are exploiting this function to kind of hijack your agenticity reflex by pointing out the incorrect pattern associations, thus appealing to your hardwiring while distracting you from the correct pattern associations such as identifying the herds of JTRIG agents actually disrupting the ability of your community or social movement to be effective at whatever you&#39;re doing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.michaelshermer.com/2009/06/agenticity/">http://www.michaelshermer.com/2009/06/agenticity/</a> (read the comments about type I errors versus type II errors)</p>

<p>Here is a better explanation of agenticity.</p>

<p>TO BE CONTINUED...</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/4oLkx">http://imgur.com/a/4oLkx</a> </p>

<p>These two slides were artificially separated in the original leak, but you can see that they make a lot more sense when they are side by side.</p>

<p>These people are quite literally here to 
<a href="http://imgur.com/y1uh7x1">http://imgur.com/y1uh7x1</a></p>

<p>Deny, Disrupt, Degrade and Deceive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh yeah Flytape you guys are so important that the government is going to have special agents tasked with following you around on the internet! HA HA  HA HA HA the toppest of minds!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well you don&#39;t have to invent an engine that runs on nothing but water to cause a problem for the government.  Simply having a group of reasonably intelligent people (no need to be Einstein) who aren&#39;t automatically convinced by every little propaganda piece published by your CIA operated new outlets is enough to warrant Disruption, Degradation, and Deception.  You didn&#39;t train over 150 people to do just that in 2013 alone to never use them.</p>

<p>So what do they do here?  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t be 100% sure but based on these slides they;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Submit mountains of shit that is off topic but appeals emotionally to people.</p></li>
<li><p>Attack people&#39;s character</p></li>
<li><p>Attempt to blend in with us by adopting our terminologies and behaviors so they can earn TRUST and later exploit that TRUST to Deceive.</p></li>
<li><p>Destroy the reputation of any emerging leaders they identify. </p></li>
<li><p>Disrupt creativity</p></li>
</ol>

<p>many many things.  The sum effect of all these actions over the long term create an extremely fractured and disfunctional community.</p>

<p>&quot; I don&#39;t need you to tell me how fucking good my coffee is, okay? I&#39;m the one who buys it. I know how good it is. When Bonnie goes shopping she buys SHIT. I buy the gourmet expensive stuff because when I drink it I want to taste it.&quot;</p>

<p>You and I could have some coffee together and talk about shit, but most of us aren&#39;t very social.  I get good coffee man.</p>

<p>Sorry seriously not trying to derail.  Just wanted to drop that quote.</p>

<p>I have no doubt there&#39;s people here trying to move our thoughts from the truths.</p>

<p>Teenagers are fun to start face to face conversations with.

Who needs to actually hire people to harass someone when you can just plant an idea in their minds and let it grow?

    <div class="md"><p>Well in cases where they really want to discredit or shut someone up - maybe. In fact I think that might be what happened to me. They would only have to fuck with someone a bit to make them really paranoid about everything. </p>

<p>edit: On the other hand, I wondered if I was maybe a bit mad beforehand. It just seems like at some point, when I started looking at conspiracy theories, some people decided to play on my natural tendency to be paranoid. It seems like tricks were played on me. I honestly don&#39;t know what the truth is.</p>
