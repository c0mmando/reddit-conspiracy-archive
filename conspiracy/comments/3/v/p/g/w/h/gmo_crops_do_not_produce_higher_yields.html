        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>GM crops are often claimed to give higher yields than naturally bred varieties. But the data do not support this claim. At best, GM crops have performed no better than their non-GM counterparts, with GM soybeans giving consistently lower yields.</strong></p>

<p>--Controlled field trials comparing GM and non-GM soy production suggested that 50% of the drop in yield is due to the disruption in genes caused by the GM transformation process. Similarly, field tests of Bt maize hybrids showed that they took longer to reach maturity and produced up to 12% lower yields than their non-GM counterparts.</p>

<p>--A US Department of Agriculture report confirmed the poor yield performance of GM crops, saying, <strong>“GE [genetically engineered] crops available for commercial use do not increase the yield potential of a variety. In fact, yield may even decrease.... Perhaps the biggest issue raised by these results is how to explain the rapid adoption of GE crops when farm financial impacts appear to be mixed or even negative.”</strong></p>

<p>--The definitive study to date on GM crops and yield is Failure to Yield, by Dr Doug Gurian-Sherman, senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists and former biotech adviser to the US Environmental Protection Agency. The study, which is based on peer-reviewed research and official US Department of Agriculture (USDA) data, was the first to tease out the contribution of genetic engineering to yield performance from the gains made through conventional breeding. It is important to bear in mind when evaluating the yield performance of GM crops that biotech companies insert their proprietary GM genes into the best-performing conventionally bred varieties.</p>

<p>--The study also differentiated between intrinsic and operational yield. Intrinsic or potential yield, the highest that can be achieved, is obtained when crops are grown under ideal conditions. In contrast, operational yield is obtained under field conditions, when environmental factors such as pests and stress result in yields that are considerably less than ideal. Genes that improve operational yield reduce losses from such factors.</p>

<p>--The study found that <strong>GM technology has not raised the intrinsic yield of any crop. The intrinsic yields of corn and soybeans did rise during the twentieth century, but this was not as a result of GM traits, but due to improvements brought about through traditional breeding.</strong></p>

<p>--The study found that GM soybeans did not increase operational yields, either. GM maize increased operational yields only slightly, mostly in cases of heavy infestation with European corn borer. Bt maize offered little or no advantage when infestation with European corn borer was low to moderate, even when compared with conventional maize that was not treated with insecticides.</p>

<p>--The study concluded, <strong>“Commercial GE crops have made no inroads so far into raising the intrinsic or potential yield of any crop. By contrast, traditional breeding has been spectacularly successful in this regard; it can be solely credited with the intrinsic yield increases in the United States and other parts of the world that characterized the agriculture of the twentieth century.”</strong></p>

<p>--In 2009, in an apparent attempt to counter criticisms of low yields from its GM soy, GM seed producer Monsanto released its new generation of supposedly high-yielding GM soybeans, RR2 Yield. But a study carried out in five US states involving 20 farm managers who planted RR2 soybeans in 2009 concluded that the new varieties “didn’t meet their [yield] expectations”.7 In June 2010 the state of West Virginia launched an investigation of Monsanto for false advertising claims that RR2 soybeans gave higher yields. “Commercial GE crops have made no inroads so far into raising the intrinsic or potential yield of any crop. By contrast, traditional breeding has been spectacularly successful in this regard; it can be solely credited with the intrinsic yield increases in the United States and other parts of the world that characterized the agriculture of the twentieth century.”</p>

<p>Doug Gurian-Sherman, former biotech advisor to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, DC2, stated:</p>

<p>--If GM cannot increase yields even in the United States, where high-input, irrigated, heavily subsidised commodity farming is the norm, it is irresponsible to assume that it would improve yields in the Global South, where farmers may literally bet their farms and livelihoods on a crop. <strong>We agree with the conclusion of Failure to Yield that the funding and research that are currently poured into trying to produce high-yield GM crops should be redirected toward approaches that are proven effective in improving crop yields, including conventional plant breeding as well as use of agroecological practices. These are by far the most efficient, affordable, and widely practised methods of improving yield.</strong></p>

At the very least, the current biotech crops are preventing yield losses to pests. In the end, it is not just about yield- it is about the ability to practice no-till farming (thus saving fossil fuels and preventing soil erosion); it is about the ability to use less insecticides, it is about the ability to make farming easier and more profitable and sustainable. So even if there were no yield advantage, there are plenty of other reasons to use biotech crops.&quot;</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The funny thing is that  there  actually  IS a working  method  which  increases  crop  yield. And it  has  nothing  to  do  with  genetically  manipulating  the  crops  but  putting  them  into a static  electric  field  (6k-10k V, depending  on  the  experiment).  The  pharmacy  giant  ciba  geigy  (now  Novartis)  did  experiments on  that  subject  with  astonishing  results. So astonishing  that they  stopped  these (would  have  made  many  ciba  geigy  products  obsolete) and only  now  a small  group  of  people  retries these  experiments  and publishes  them  for example  on YouTube.  I  don&#39;t  know  how many  videos and info  you are going  to  get  in English, but I assume  a couple, since  the topic  is very  interesting and  important(main  sources and my references  are  all German).  If  you  are  interested  in the  general  topic  of  crops  and  boosting  them,  look  into  it! Especially  since  it&#39;s  easy  to  DIY. ;) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>GMOs are created for 4 main reasons:</p>

<p><strong>1)  To more effectively use arable land.</strong>  Some GMOs require less area to grow, and allow for more crops to be planted per hectare.  The increase in production of corn and cotton in the world are in part due to this.</p>

<p><strong>2)  To increase crop yields.</strong>  Some GMOs are bred to yield more crop from plants, and are more resistant to disease and drought. </p>

<p><strong>3)  To allow usage of previously non-arable land.</strong>  Some GMOs are made to be grown in salty/dry/poor soil environments.  This effectively means that small farmers in parts Africa, India and elsewhere can now grow crops, when they were previously unable to.  It also means that they will become increasingly necessary due to the effects of global warming in the next 50 years.</p>

<p><strong>4)  To reduce the need for insecticide/spraying.</strong>  Some GMOs are bred to be more resistant to disease and insects, eliminating the need for farmers to spray their crops with oftentimes harmful chemicals to ensure their survival. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so &#39;crop yields&#39; means crop per plant not crop per acre? Because in that case, the study doesn&#39;t make much sense, obviously GMOs might not bear more fruit per plant because they are bearing more per acre.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Crop yield is sort of a term of art, and it means slightly different things in context.  </p>

<p><strong>Crop Yield</strong>: <em>A measurement of the amount of a crop that was harvested per unit of land area. Crop yield can also refer to the actual seed generation from the plant. It is also referred to as &quot;agricultural output.&quot;</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if you misunderstood what I was saying.  Some GMOs produce more per plant and as a result more per acre.  Some GMOs produce more per acre, but not more per plant because they are more resistant to disease/insects/etc.</p>

<p>In essence, many GMOs just yield more crop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I disagree with OP.  His/her research is honestly pretty flawed.  If you do some digging in scientific journals, you&#39;ll see there has been a great deal of research done in the last 20 years into whether or not GMOs produce higher yields.  Almost all research is conclusive that GMOs produce higher yields, because that&#39;s literally one of their primary purposes.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve actually debated this topic quite extensively in academic debate, and understand the pros and cons of GMOs very well.  Feel free to ask.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These four things greatly benefit first the corporations who sell seeds / pesticides, and second the farmers who use them. They don&#39;t benefit consumers much, especially when organic / free range / etc. costs what, only 10%-20% more than standard shit now? And pest / pesticide resistant traits don&#39;t benefit consumers eating them. There isn&#39;t much proof that eating these things are safe for every human, despite the industry push and constant denial. See StarLink corn recall, Aspartame sell-off, rBGH sell-off, etc. Animal feeding records do not a human safety study make.</p>

<p>High yields primarily come from hearty hybrid strains which are back-crossed with a GMO to make the final GMO crop viable. One genetic modification to a shitty crop which takes well to modification, bred with a good hybrid, grants a patent on the resultant &quot;GMO&quot; crop...even though most of its good traits come from the hybrid.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is it necessary to take the time and effort to do backcrossing? Backcrossing is necessary because the lines that lend themselves well to tissue culture and transformation are typically older, low yielding lines. Plant breeders use backcrossing to transfer the transgene from these older lines into elite, high yielding lines. </p>

<p>It takes the breeder at least two or three years to derive a backcross line that is the genetic equivalent of the elite line plus the event.</p>

<p>The effect of the transgenes on the overall metabolism of the plant will probably be the major limitation to how many genes and what combinations of genes we can stack into a crop plant. <a href="http://agbiosafety.unl.edu/education/backcross.htm">Link</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>GMOs actually greatly benefit consumers, for three reasons:</p>

<p><strong>1)  <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-truth-about-genetically-modified-food/">Cheaper food in agriculturally stable nations</a></strong>
<em>&quot;The use of GM crops “has lowered the price of food,” Zilberman says. “It has increased farmer safety by allowing them to use less pesticide. It has raised the output of corn, cotton and soy by 20 to 30 percent&quot;</em></p>

<p><strong>2)  <a href="http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/biotech/biotech_en.pdf">More access to food in developing nations</a></strong>
<em>&quot;the Bt cotton farmers in China reduced pesticide spraying for the Asian bollworm by 70%, producing a kilogram of cotton at 28% less cost than the non-Bt farmers. These benefits have had a significant impact on the agronomic, environmental, health and economic situations of approximately 5 million resource-poor farmers.&quot;</em></p>

<p><strong>3)  <a href="http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/44/executivesummary/pdf/Brief%2044%20-%20Executive%20Summary%20-%20English.pdf">More food can be grown in arable land and non-arable land</a></strong>
<em>&quot;Biotech crops are a land-saving technology, capable of higher productivity on the current 1.5 billion hectares of arable land, and thereby can help preclude deforestation and protect biodiversity.  13 million hectares of biodiversity are lost in developing countries annually. If the 328 million tons of additional food/feed/fiber produced by biotech crops during 1996 to 2011 had not been produced, an additional 108.7 million hectares of conventional crops would have been required to produce the same tonnage.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Furthermore, <strong><a href="http://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS_GM_statement.pdf">GMOs are safe</a>:</strong>
<em>&quot;The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs, are not per se more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> You are going to see the increased adoption of GMOs as the effects of climate change take hold in the next 100 years.  The decline in available arable land will necessitate the use of drought-resistant, salt-resistance and pest-resistant seeds and crops.</p>
