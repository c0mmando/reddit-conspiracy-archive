       When we were attacked on Sept 11, 2001, Bush called for a state of emergency.  He instituted the continuity of operations plan in 2002 which enabled the intelligence community to take over the responsibility of governing our country.  Everything that's happened since then has been political theater.  Yes, laws passed, yes supreme court cases ruled.  But any laws applicable to the intelligence community have been overruled, overlooked, unenforced and otherwise ignored by our intelligence community, as they are acting as a shadow government and have been since 9/11.  In fact, some posit (me, particularly) that this was their goal.  WTC was a distraction to hit the penta-
       <em>
        gone
       </em>
       , which would then enable the Continuity of Government plan to be placed into effect.  Because they wanted to reserve the right to not talk about the clandestine office of the cia in wtc 7 where likely records of international transgressions--including possibly (who knows?) the cia's involvement in the murder of JFK--were destroyed on 9/11.  Well played, CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama continuing the state of emergency is first mentioned is the first wikipedia snapshot on archive org from Feb, 2012.  Makes sense.  Here's the quote:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In September 2010, President Barack Obama informed Congress that the State of Emergency in effect since September 14, 2001, will be extended another year.

        </sup>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The updated wikipedia page does list COGCON levels but makes no mention of Obama continuing COG in 2010 or later.  Someone reading this might get the impression it's just 'military details', and might miss the fact the implict in this is that we are still in COG&gt;&gt;&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, I believe I read somewhere Obama renewed it a second time either in 2012 or 2013.  Not sure but I cannot find this information anymore through google / ddg / sp.  If wikipedia doesn't have it, clearly I am wrong.  Well played, O man / wikipedia moderator statesnatched.

       Not sure if you have this in you're links, but Bush updated the COG un 2007, and even the homeland security committee wasn't allowed to see what it said.

       Good post. The endgame began on 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Adam and Eve came to the planet and found it full of dinosaurs. They broke orders and opened the knowledge of high tech weaponry and esoteric magick in order to wipe them out for population of humanity. They were supposed to keep that knowledge hidden away until they had created a global cohesive society which could join the Galactic Alliance as a fully functioning member but instead alerted other space-faring species to Earth's existence. Bad Eve, Bad!
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks to George Bush we will soon re-unite as a species and join our ancestors in the stars.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least they gave the Dinosaurs enough warning that they were able to build megaliths recording the knowledge of their civilization.

       It's pretty close to the truth, still allowing the idea to float a bit and see what sticks.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is based on the premise that the Megaliths (pyramids, Gobekli Tepe) are about 12-13,000 years old and yet there is evidence of mass extinction about 10,000 years ago.  Dinosaurs are a good candidate for building Pyramids, not so hard to drag giant stones anymore, is it?  Or domesticated dinosaurs helped our ancestors build them, then they went inside the earth or up in space to avoid the mass extinction.
