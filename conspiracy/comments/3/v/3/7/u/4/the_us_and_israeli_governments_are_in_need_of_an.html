        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The atrocities against the Palestinians need to come to an end.  They are suffering the same fate as the Native Americans.</p>

<p>Which by the way, the American government did a much better job in eradicating a larger percentage of their population than Hitler could have ever dreamed of doing to the Jews.</p>

<p>Now Israel is trying to out do both. </p>

<p>The world knows, Israel doesn&#39;t care. </p>

<p>They say &quot;they are attacking us&quot; as evident by the <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=75c_1449001183">&quot;knife attack&quot; today.</a></p>

<p>Even though our governments would just have a drone kill us, we must lead by example and show them how it should be done.</p>

<p>And the people of the US are not going to do it unless it becomes a reality TV show with some sort of cash or prize incentive.</p>

<p>We need to send out go pro cams to everyone and let the general population hunt down and capture (NOT KILL) the people hell bent on bringing destruction to this planet.  </p>

<p>That would include- </p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>All elected officials in DC and Tel Aviv</p></li>
<li><p>The Federal Reserve and the international banking cartels. The ones ultimately responsible for all this.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Lets put the real criminals on trial.   </p>

<p>The US TV audience loves the sick twisted shit that would come out in their trials and would get higher ratings than Dancing with the Stars or the OJ trial.</p>

<p>The higher up they politician and more corrupt they are, they more they are worth.  </p>

<p>Start with the feds, then go to the state government and clean the criminals out of there and the police forces next.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure some corporation would sponsor that.  I know Russia, Iran, or China would throw a few billion at the bounty pool.  </p>

<p>Why should the Arab mercenaries be the only ones getting paid?  Shouldn&#39;t the American people get a piece of the bounty pie?  </p>

<p>And do something positive for the world for once?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they are the people who most easily can understand that money is the root of this problem and are already using bitcoin as a way to circumvent capital controls, inflation and in some cases, outright asset confiscation. Bitcoin takes the power of the creation of money, their crown jewel, out of the hands of TPTB and puts it firmly into the people&#39;s hands again. This is how we as a civilisation will be able to have a peaceful revolution; by rejecting their money and thus rejecting their power.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m wondering if Bitcoin is fiat. The unlocked boxes could be considered a tangible entity like gold, but then we&#39;re classifying digital data as a resource. So to me, Bitcoin is also fiat currency. Where there is nothing tangible to back up the value. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually Bitcoin IS money.</p>

<p>You have no idea what you are talking about.</p>

<p>Money is a store of value. Example: gold, silver, oil, Bitcoin.</p>

<p>The thing you think is money (paper fiat currency) is a representation of money (gold reserves oil reserves) that do not even exist and are therefore fraudulent. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t argue with someone when you don&#39;t even know the definition of the word money, what you are referring to is currency, and there is a huge difference, and apparently also a large gap in your knowledge about the matter.</p>

<p>Because genocide is based on your intent, not on how many the other side claims you have killed. </p>

<p>Last year, during Operation &quot;Protective Edge&quot;, around 80 percent of the people Israel killed were civilians and not soldiers.</p>

<p><strong>UN: 80 per cent of Palestinians killed in Israeli offensive are civilians</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/10967279/UN-80-per-cent-of-Palestinians-killed-in-Israeli-offensive-are-civilians.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/10967279/UN-80-per-cent-of-Palestinians-killed-in-Israeli-offensive-are-civilians.html</a></p>

<p>You absolutely can&#39;t kill that many civilians without doing it on purpose. They attacked Palestinians as a people and Palestinians as a culture. Israel&#39;s <em>own Holocaust survivors</em> are accusing them of genocide.</p>

<p><strong>Holocaust survivors and their descendants accuse Israel of ‘genocide’</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/holocaust-survivors-and-their-descendants-accuse-israel-of-genocide-9687994.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/holocaust-survivors-and-their-descendants-accuse-israel-of-genocide-9687994.html</a></p>

<p>Let&#39;s be absolutely honest here. Pretty much the only people who don&#39;t think this is genocide, are the same people who are being accused of genocide!</p>

<p>Well, you are wrong. The concept of genocide is complex. The UN defines it as such:-</p>

<p><strong>The international legal definition of the crime of genocide is found in Articles II and III of the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Article II describes two elements of the crime of genocide:</strong> </p>

<p><strong>1) the mental element, meaning the &quot;intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such&quot;, and</strong></p>

<p><strong>2) the physical element which includes five acts described in sections a, b, c, d and e. A crime must include both elements to be called &quot;genocide.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Article II:  In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:</strong> </p>

<p><strong>(a) Killing members of the group;</strong></p>

<p><strong>(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;</strong></p>

<p><strong>(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;</strong></p>

<p><strong>(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;</strong> (for example stopping Palestinian women in labour from getting through Israeli blockades to hospital). </p>

<p><strong>(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.</strong></p>

<p>You are perhaps slightly more liberal than most, but when it gets right down to it you&#39;re still Israeli, and you would still rather change the definition of genocide than face the definition of Israeli action in Gaza.</p>

<p>You are accusing my (i.e. the proper legal) definition as implicating the Palestinians in genocide. It is a false dichotomy which assumes the fallacy that either the legal definition is wrong or I am wrong to single out Israel.  I am not wrong and the Palestinians are not guilty of genocide. Some of them are almost certainly guilty of minor war crimes, but the Palestinians aren&#39;t shelling civilian communities with chemical weapons.</p>

<p>Your army is targeting civilian populations to catch one or two militants who might be hiding among them. That is genocide.</p>

<p>Israel doesn&#39;t &quot;routinely&quot; use chemical weapons. I&#39;ve only heard of two cases, last year in Gaza and 2006 in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Palestinians shell civilian communities with conventional weapons all the time. Prior to the last Gaza war, and during it, thousands of rockets were being aimed at civilian cities. They were always trying to hit whatever they can get. You had periods, before they built the wall between the West Bank and Israel, when multiple civilian buses would blow up every week.</p>

<p>There is more than one side who&#39;s guilty in the eyes of the international law.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So you don&#39;t claim anymore that all Palestinians are civilians?</p>

<p>First of all, it&#39;s not genocide. Genocide is e.g when you massacre all the men in a community.</p>

<p>Wars suck. They really suck. Reeeally. Collateral damage sucks. Having to choose between protecting your citizens and committing war crimes sucks big time.</p>

<p>You know what else sucks? Taking a complex situation and presenting it as if one side is good, one side is bad, boo hoo, the Jews control the media. </p>

<p>The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is probably the most complicated currently in the world. It&#39;s been going on for 100 years. No side is blameless in this story.</p>

<p>These are not &quot;shellings&quot;. These are individual personnel attacks with Soviet RPGs. Shells are fired by tanks and Navy craft.

<p>Yes. Israel is very good at protecting its citizens. Therefore:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remind me again how many civilians the Gazans killed during your &quot;war&quot; last year</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Few! I&#39;ll tell you why. It&#39;s because they&#39;re surrounded by fences from all sides, blockaded at the sea, surrounded by a dead-zone perimeter, with heavily guarded checkpoints for supply trucks. All those things you don&#39;t like. On the Israeli side, there were sirens day in and day out when a rocket made its way to a civilian city.</p>

<p>Do you actually think that Israel is fine with being shot rockets at because there&#39;s an experimental defense system in place? Please. I can&#39;t think of anything more casus belli than rockets on Tel Aviv. These aren&#39;t RPGs, by the way. An RPG is shoulder-fired. Look up some launching videos.</p>

<p>Now, if Israel were less effective at protecting its citizens and therefore suffered more casualties, you&#39;d have less problem with it. Think about it.</p>

<p>The international legal definition of genocide says nothing about &quot;the cold-blooded murder of all the men in the community&quot; so I would greatly appreciate it if you would stop making your own definitions of genocide up.

<p>&quot;butcher&quot; is the wrong word. Butchery would have been much more bloody. What&#39;s your theory, Israel killed 20% and then added 80% for the fun of it?</p>

<p>Once we agree that Israel had a motive to start the Gaza war other than &quot;urgh we like to kill Palestinians&quot;, we can discuss how many Palestinian casualties is reasonable.</p>

<p>I have never claimed that, seriously or otherwise. Where facts fail you, you resort to fallacy and straw man arguments. It is a question of means, not of intent. The Palestinians have pocket knives and fertilizer bombs. The Israelis are a nuclear superpower with a professional army.</p>

<p><strong>The Court concludes that the acts committed at Srebrenica falling within Article II (a) and (b) of the Convention were committed with the specific intent to destroy IN PART the group of the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina as such; and accordingly that these were acts of genocide, committed by members of the VRS in and around Srebrenica from about 13 July 1995</strong></p>

<p>We&#39;re talking 8000 deaths in about a week, yes? The total number of casualties in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is about 22000. The bosnian case is a planned cold-blooded murder of all the men in a community. Not even close. </p>

<p>I won&#39;t give you the &quot;Israel supplies the Palestinians with food and electricity&quot; - even though it&#39;s true - because I usually disagree with people who say it.

<p>No, as you can see for yourself, the article specifically says it was only <em>part</em> of the community. Perhaps, instead of making one-sided appeals to emotion, you would be better served to view some of your own country&#39;s cold-blooded murders. For example:-</p>

<p><strong>UN: 80 per cent of Palestinians killed in Israeli offensive are civilians</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/10967279/UN-80-per-cent-of-Palestinians-killed-in-Israeli-offensive-are-civilians.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/10967279/UN-80-per-cent-of-Palestinians-killed-in-Israeli-offensive-are-civilians.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Doctors in Gaza described today how they had struggled to treat dozens of patients with terrible and unusually deadly burns consistent with white phosphorus weapons, during Israel&#39;s three-week war in Gaza.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Nafiz Abu Shabaan, head of the burns unit at Shifa hospital and the most senior burns surgeon in Gaza, said 60 to 70 patients had died in his unit during the war from severe burns that were unlike any injury he had previously seen.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/21/gaza-phosphorus-israel">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/21/gaza-phosphorus-israel</a></p>

<p>As I&#39;m sure you will be aware, the use of white phosphorous as a weapon is a war crime in and of itself, especially when you use it to butcher women and children in cold blood (you see, I can charge my language too).</p>

<p><strong>A United Nations panel of human rights experts has accused Israel of war crimes through willful killing, unnecessary brutality and torture in its &quot;clearly unlawful&quot; assault on a ship attempting to break the blockade of Gaza in May in which nine Turkish activists died</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/23/un-panel-israel-war-crimes">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/23/un-panel-israel-war-crimes</a></p>

<p>So, we are just three stories deep and already we have genocide, illegal use of chemical weapons and torture. Should we continue?</p>

I could discuss the rest of it with you - torture, war crimes, etc - but it&#39;s extremely futile if you believe in the first place that Israel is deliberately committing a genocide, and it all stems from there.

<p><strong>More than 2,300 Palestinians killed and more than 17,000 injured, according to annual report by UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</strong></p>

<p>There is no war. How can you say it is a war when only one side has an army? Only one side has tanks and planes and nuclear bombs? That is no war. It is a genocide.</p>

<p>For the millionth time, no one is wiping anyone out. It&#39;s you who used false dichotomy. I was pointing it out. Look here:</p>

<p>Either they have tanks and plans - or it&#39;s genocide. Tada! False dichotomy 101.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The neighbouring people are civilians</p>

<p>No! I&#39;ve already answered to that before too. There are Palestinian combatants. You should know it. I refuse to believe you don&#39;t know it. Hamas, Fatah up until a few years ago, the al-Aqsa Martyrs&#39; Brigades, the Islamic Jihad - these are all Palestinian groups.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Does it surprise you that Israel would care more about protecting its own citizens than about protecting Gazans? Anyway, I don&#39;t want to discuss tactics and moral trade offs; All I&#39;m trying to claim now is that there is no Genocide happening.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are just offering exaggerated and/or false excuses up for inexcusable aggression against innocent people</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a sentence with no meaning. You are trying to take a complex situation, and portray a bastardized version of it with one side casted as literally Hitler and the other side being &quot;just civilians&quot;. What I&#39;m trying to do is to add some depth; ask you what you&#39;d have done, which you haven&#39;t answered to yet; maybe make you see that for Israel to lower the aggression, while it would make very many people extremely happy, is an incredibly complex move. Israel&#39;s top priority is the well being of its own citizens, as it rightly should be; Lifting a siege, enabling construction and free trade and free movement, without taking the risk of going back to the bloody days of the second Intifada.</p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing that you can look at a complex international conflict, decide that one side is just innately bad, and that&#39;s it.</p>
