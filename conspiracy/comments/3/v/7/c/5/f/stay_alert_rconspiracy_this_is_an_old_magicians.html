        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is game is getting easy to spot, if you know the signs. See the clues.</p>

<p>Russia connects Turkey to buying of ISIS oil today. THIS IS HUGE!! Like game changing huge. Like tear apart the Middle East War for oil huge. This could mark a huge turn in the War on Terror (slash war for oil) and America is losing a gigantic asset in the region. Russia will make sanctions on Turkey pretty fast and make it known in the region things are about to change. Now, this will get buried or be a small segment in the nightly news instead of a huge segment in the nightly news, or heck, even no coverage at all!!!</p>

<p>So, how do the magicians react, turn a massive terror drill into an actual event! All you need to do is get some of your cronies (masked gun men) to hurry and shoot up a place, and leave without a trace. Notice no suspects were found, nobody saw anything, yet 1 mile down the street there was a MASSIVE terror drill being conducted. Look at the video, MASSIVE amounts of police, fire, ambulance, homeland security, every single San Bernadino law enforcement is there, aGigantic Response, and it looks great for TV.</p>

<p>This is an old magician trick. Lull the American public back to sleep, or change the topic being talked about on TV. Oldest easiest trick in the book to pull off. </p>

<p>EDIT: Holly Cow, think about this! This target makes zero sense. The entire attack aspect of this situation makes zero sense. Think about it, if you are going to go out and cause terrorism (a shooting spree in this instance) this is not a place you want to cause terror, it is a soft target (center to help people with developmental disabilities). If you are a team of 3 highly trained individuals, why go after a soft target like this? It makes zero sense. It does not seem this was a personal vendetta attack either, if you are training and planning and prepping to undertake this event (team of three coordinated attackers), why hit a soft target like this, this building was used as a place for disabled families to meet and get advice on getting through their problems. This soft target, with 3 skilled attackers, has zero attack value to cause terrorism. None what so ever. This makes this scenario much more crazy and should also set off alarm bells to all people questioning this motive and event that happened today. Makes zero sense what so ever. 3 skilled, trained, armed, planned, strategy to hit up a soft target like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would, but you are probably not a terrorist or a mass killer. To fit the description of a mass killer or a terrorist you would probably want to hit a more open to public space. This was a facility for developing disabled people and care givers and specialist doctors. Were not talking about hard to hit targets here. Thus, why this is highly questionable given all other factors involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What strikes me as odd is normally the term &quot;assault weapon&quot; is usually brought up by domestic and foreign news outlets when a shooting happens. The term &quot;long rifle&quot; has been used by both CNN and the BBC, which leads me to believe the point of this massacre isn&#39;t about gun control.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t looked into the details as to what weapons were allegedly used, but my main point is that the media manipulates the terms in any tragedy to conform to whatever agenda they are pushing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bataclan was a soft target also. My understanding of soft target is anything that doesn&#39;t have defense force ready to repel an attack.So schools,mental health facilities, planned parenthood, and theaters are soft.

    <div class="md"><p>The Bataclan was not a soft target, you are talking about upwardly mobile people who can think and act and move fast. Also there was probably security, 1000&#39;s of people near by, and chaos was involved. The Developmentally Disabled people no where near equivalent to Bataclan what so ever.</p>

<p>I mean come on, we are talking about a Developmentally disabled facility here, most in the people in this facility do not have the capacity to think or act in a sensible manner. No security guards, no threats to public hiding in this building, no religious fanatics, plus, this does not fit the description of a planned attack facility, only thing this attack really did was cause questioning, not fear, or panic or chaos just lots of why.</p>

<p>And dont give me that this doesnt have to make sense crap. It does have to make sense. This is a soft target, no real benefit to anyone here is being accomplished. The killers are not that dumb, they obviously had planned, prepped, armed, skilled and moved fast. </p>

<p>The Bataclan and the outdoor restaurants and the rest of the stuff was planned, prepped, armed and skilled as well, yet the outcome was to cause mass chaos, no matter the cost, mission accomplished there. </p>

<p>The San Bernadino case does not fit the description of the babtaclan what so ever, so you can not associate the two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) What does a bio-terrorism drill, which happened less than 3 weeks after a major terrorist attack in Paris renewed fears of terrorism, have to do with this incident? In order for your point to make any slight semblance of logical sense (despite the obvious logical absurdity in claiming that just because a drill happened recently, that instantly makes a real incident that happens later a false-flag), wouldn&#39;t the incident have to be bio-terrorism related? </p>

<p>2) See point 1. Literally every large city police department in the US have upped training exercises in the wake of the Paris attacks. </p>

<p>3) ??????? What does this possibly prove?</p>

<p>4) That&#39;s not a signal hat that&#39;s the logo of the LA Angels baseball team... tens of thousands of people in the greater LA area are wearing that hat right now. </p>

<p>5) We&#39;re back to the &quot;Hollywood movies say if you get shot you should spew blood everywhere for hours&quot; logic that drives most of these &quot;NO BLOOD = FALSE FLAG COVER UP CONSPIRACY NWO!&quot; &quot;theories.&quot; </p>

<p>6) Given the terrorist attacks in Paris and the involvement of more than 1 suspect, that&#39;s hardly a surprise. What does that prove exactly? </p>

<p>7) See point #1 again. </p>

<p>I also like how the OP didn&#39;t offer a single shred of tangible proof of a false-flag. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve noticed about <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> whenever <em>anything</em> bad happens: You have dozens of people coming on here and shoving the false-flag narrative into the discussion before any facts are even out yet. It muddies the discussion and is a classic disinfo tactic. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also an interesting voting trend here. OP&#39;s post has 72 upvotes yet the top comment only has 10 upvotes.... hmm.....</p>

<p>On another note, we just had an active shooter drill at my college a few weeks ago as well. No mass shooting there. Maybe it&#39;s due to the vigilant folks at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> who cracked the Illuminati plan or some shit.</p>

With that said, the paranoia surrounding comments of differing opinions here is incredible. I once had someone tell me they &quot;tagged me as a shill&quot; and insisted I was part of a US Navy special operations unit designed to disrupt free thinkers on forums such as <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. I couldn&#39;t believe it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is a case of lazy language. The word &#39;shill&#39; is used to describe almost everyone with a counter-perspective. That is not what the word means. Grammar Nazis patrol the intarwebz precisely because things like this happen, because minor errors can change the entire meaning of what is being conveyed. </p>

<p>A shill is a person <em>that is being paid</em> specifically to propagate a point of view that may, or may not, be contrary to their personally held beliefs. In my experience actual shills, especially of the cognitively dissonant variety, are comparatively few. That is not to say that there aren&#39;t a lot of them because there are. Anyone that hasn&#39;t noticed the amount of marketing going on on reddit over the last year or so is either wilfully blind or woefully ignorant. But the bulk of those accused of being shills in this sub are, in my opinion, true believers, &#39;useful fools&#39; (as opposed to &#39;useful idiots&#39;, of which we have a few), or casual observers. Some topics, obviously, attract more shills than others and I think that fuels the perception that they are everywhere.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to tell who from whom. Are the Flat Earthers being paid to make conspiracy theorists look stupid so someone can say &quot;they believe the Earth is flat! How can you believe anything they say&quot;? Are they involved in a psychology experiment? Are they for fucking real? How many of them are true believers? How many are useful fools and tools? They&#39;re not all shills, but we also don&#39;t really have an adequate vocabulary that all can agree upon. Is a college student doing a psychology experiment a shill? Is a soldier following orders a shill? Is a true believer, someone who legitimately believes in the given topic, a shill? Is someone that thinks it&#39;s all a load of crap except this one thing that&#39;s worth further investigation a shill? Am I a shill for calling them out?</p>

<p>Shill has become a lazily convenient blanket term, so don&#39;t be too offended if you get the label.</p>

<p>If the OP is going to claim a guy wearing a Freemason hat makes it a Freemason conspiracy, it&#39;s equally as logical to assume the Angels hat means the LA Angels are involved in this conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holly Cow, think about this! This target makes zero sense. The entire attack aspect of this situation makes zero sense. Think about it, if you are going to go out and cause terrorism (a shooting spree in this instance) this is not a place you want to cause terror, it is a soft target (center to help people with developmental disabilities). If you are a team of 3 highly trained individuals, why go after a soft target like this? It makes zero sense. It does not seem this was a personal vendetta attack either, if you are training and planning and prepping to undertake this event (team of three coordinated attackers), why hit a soft target like this, this building was used as a place for disabled families to meet and get advice on getting through their problems. This soft target, with 3 skilled attackers, has zero attack value to cause terrorism. None what so ever. This makes this scenario much more crazy and should also set off alarm bells to all people questioning this motive and event that happened today.

<p>Why? That&#39;s what terrorism is about. Hitting soft targets that can&#39;t respond, causing mass casualties, and spreading fear. Why the fuck would you hit a target that&#39;s NOT soft for terror purposes? They&#39;re trying to spread fear not turn over a bank or armored car for money...</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What makes them skilled or trained? I know gangbangers that could easily injure/kill tens of people and disappear without getting caught. Getting out of a car, shooting unarmed civilians, and getting back in the car is not evidence of being highly skilled or trained at anything. There&#39;s teenage gang members who do that shit every other month.</p>

If the motive of the attack is to terrorize people, it&#39;s terrorism (though not in the same vein as religious extremism). </p>

<p>If it turns out these people merely had a grudge or whatever, I wouldn&#39;t call it terrorism, but that doesn&#39;t mean the attack can&#39;t feasibly happen; workplace shootings haven&#39;t been too uncommon in history. Sometimes people get angry and shoot people. </p>
