       My question is, are these trolls who are coming here to stifle debate, and downvote posts, or are these actually real people interested in finding the truth out?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no doubt that there's an active campaign going on to down vote any information which questions the official narrative.  All posts and comments are being down voted heavily.

       i came here because two shootings less than a few fortnights apart made me curious and you guys seem to have the sources i dont usually stumble upon.
      </p>
      <p>
       i already have my own issues with a lot of the incidents weve been fed by the media but this one takes the cake for me. people simply standing around and a school that started active shooter drills with a prepped and ready swat team nearby? come on...
      </p>

       sounds like my little niece who doesnt know how the cake ended up on her fingers and face or where it went or why the dog doesnt have any on them since they ate it.

       Well, I might not've come here this time of day other than the shooting incident. Feel like I'll get a fuller, more rounded story about what might be happening by coming here. There might be a lot of that as well.

       as a lurker who is probably part of that 1000, i usually come here for a different side to the story than the mainstream media provides. i dont lean too far either way and keep an open mind while im here. some peoples responses seem absolutely ridiculous to me but im not here to ridicule as much as gather more info about the events from people with a different perspective than i normally encounter.

       Seriously, I come here to get a more rounded view of what's happening. I like to think the truth lies somewhere in between every educated and informed opinion of what events occurred. Then I get to this sub and I try to take it seriously but I just see a lot of people being as ridiculous and agenda pushing as any news outlet is. Not every time something bad happens is the government behind it. Why is it only that the people I knew who grew up to be total losers are the ones who are so adamant about the government doing these horrible things? They're not happy with where they are and they want someone to blame for it.

       Coming from you Bob, I actually take that as a compliment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm simply sharing information and links that others are posting and talking about, which isn't the official narrative.  I personally believe that this just another fake media hoax, and I'm not alone.  Search on YouTube and see the dozen or so videos which have already been posted.
      </p>

       This still doesn't explain the dramatic increase of users here either.  Way to avoid the question.

       That's exactly what I'm doing actually.  I'm sharing information from like minded people.  I'm not attempting to "brainwash" anyone into thinking how I think, I leave that up to other people to decide what they want to do with the information I'm presenting to them.

       Ok, well since you won't, I'll do it for you.  There's 21 videos already posted with people saying this hoax, less then 2 hours after the start of it.  It's not just me who thinks this way Bob.  There's still room on the bus for you too if you want to jump on :-)

       Dear Bob,
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure I understand why you're here. I like you, actually. You're pretty witty sometimes. And you do manage to call out bullshit sometimes. But all you seem to do is attack people who post regularly on this sub. It seems that's all you do here. I've been here nearly a year, and I don't actually see posts from you which indicate that you care at all about this sub being hurt. I usually see your user name attached to a comment that is negative. Someone says something, you say something to the effect of "Bullshit". Maybe it's your style. Either way, I would love to know why you come here. If you're not up to answering that, that's OK. I just thought I'd ask.

       I've said it ten times here. I typically, 99.9% of the time, comment on stuff I think is bullshit and disagree with. That's why you will almost always only see me disagreeing with people. I don't immediately hop into "OMG False flag!" threads and join the circlejerk, because that's all it is. I don't subscribe to the "YouTube and blogs are great sources" group.

       As we speak they're showing what seems to be a shootout on a street with these suspects, but it'll be called fake simply because it happened.

       I believe in plenty of conspiracies. That's why I'm here. I'll be sure to drop a comment saying "I agree" from now on.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example. Ive agreed with people about some things with the Boston Bombing being shady. But as soon as I say I think the crisis actor theory (which would immediately involve 50x more people) is ridiculous, the accusations come out. It's comical.

       I think that's the idea. When people toss out such easily dismiss-able nonsense like the cap, of course you're going to think, "These people are fucked". It's called

      <p>
       And yes, a nugget of proof is possible, and "deluded fools" exist, but people also come here in the aftermath of events to poison the well. Many, many people come here who don't usually, some for legit reasons, some to confound, troll, and obfuscate discussions. I've seen quite a few of those here today.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been here for nearly a year. And when I say "here", I mean both reddit and this sub. This gives me a certain advantage in that I'm beginning to see through a lot of the stuff that goes on here. So many posts from people who never post, and those posts are usually the posts that try to make the sub look bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       People will often say, "You're deluded if you think anyone cares what anyone says on this sub." I have to disagree. Reddit in its entirety is a battleground and a nest of shills. We know there are paid shills on reddit. That's hardly in dispute, and discrediting the one sub where people tend to take a position of dissent from standard narratives has to be of some importance to those who wish to maintain and reinforce official narratives. And honestly, it really doesn't take much. A few users on a single sub with at least one or two as mods is probably all it takes. I can't imagine it costs very much either.
