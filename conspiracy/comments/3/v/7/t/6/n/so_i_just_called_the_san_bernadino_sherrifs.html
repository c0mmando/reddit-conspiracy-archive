<p>The Agent that broke into my car let those searching it know they had no warrant and pushed to close the hatchback where the police officer photographed the badge.</p>

<p>Police Officers had no problem with it when I wore it to Comicon weeks before.</p>

<p>Border Patrol Agents had no problem with me wearing it through their Checkpoints.</p>

<p>The idiots that preformed the illegal search were looking for anything to make something out of nothing. They embarrassed themselves.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not the idiot trying to piss cops off. It&#39;s Law Enforcement that does that trying to give authentic Journalists a bad name.</p>

Look dude, there&#39;s nothing wrong with being psychotic, but continuing with what you&#39;re doing and wasting so many peoples time and energy is fucking disgusting. Next time you get stopped somewhere by a cop, all 5 of your GoPro&#39;s running, you&#39;re playing your usual &quot;I don&#39;t need to answer anything&quot; spiel, I honestly hope he tasers your ass and you get charged with something so substantial that you either get thrown in jail or are slapped with a massive fine.

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone is delusional and Law Enforcement capitalizes on that.</p>

<p>I spent my GM Proving Ground career making measurements and summarizing information using techniques that disregard false sensor readings.</p>

<p>My delusions force me to dive deeper and look closer to get past false signals and beliefs that many take for granted.</p>

<p>I simply question more and test more than the average person does.</p>

<p>Other Journalists made it clear the importance of fact checking in these types of stories.</p>

<p>FYI - I film with 16 cameras and collect 1 Terabyte of data on good days and the large percentage of that information has little to do with Law Enforcement. The videos that focus on it simply rise to the top since Law Enforcement manipulates the topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, my mom works dispatch. She gets shit like this all the time. Ive heard the stories. I know what it does. You are disrupting dispatch from other issues and, depending on the call center and how many employees they have, they may be slower to take a 911 call to talk to your ass. A 911 call where every SECOND matters. Thankfully, the fact that they humored you says they were having a less busy day. Take it up with someone else. The dispatch cant do shit. They have nothing to do with any of it. Youve wasted your time. Thank god you have slightly more intelligence than the people that call 911 over this shit as those calls take priority.</p>

<p>This is not about your ability to speak your mind. If you want to go act like justice hero while listening to epic trailer music on youtube , eat your heart out. You are disrupting peoples ability to handle disputes so you can <em>talk</em>. Thats the issue. Talk to someone else. Youre only lucky dispatch had time for you instead of, you know, dealing with someone who is suicidal...or a suspicious person in a neighborhood, or some crazy bitch that wont get off of someones property.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a tip: </p>

<p>Whenever a post on reddit describes a picture as:</p>

<p>&quot;Black man does XYZ&quot; it was probably submitted by a white. </p>

<p>A white will never see &quot;white&quot; in another white. A white will never describe another white as white. </p>

<p>You know why ? Because to whites, when they see white everything  looks normal. But put a black, and suddenly it stands out. </p>

<p>So in other words to you, this is normal since it is white, and you are white too</p>

<p>Citation needed.  I never said anything of the sort.  You&#39;re putting words into my mouth again Bob, lol.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s fine, I&#39;m not even mad at you for having the false reality that the TV news is making you believe.  That&#39;s your prerogative, and I am not mad at you for having it.  It&#39;s a false reality, but you are entitled to that reality Bob.  </p>

<p>I just wonder sometimes why you hang around <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> with this reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude I think you could get in some real trouble if you try to instigate a mass phone &#39;attack&#39;.   If that&#39;s the dispatch line even if it&#39;s not the emergency line there could be some phone calls that don&#39;t get through that actually need assistance.   I&#39;m not trying to debate the incident whether it was a hoax or not but think about it.  You&#39;re calling on the internet to bombard an official phone channel.  I think of something bad were to happen relating to this you could get in some actual trouble.</p>

<p>Maybe write them or the editor of the local paper letters?  I dunno.  I feel you may be risking more than you&#39;re aware here.</p>
