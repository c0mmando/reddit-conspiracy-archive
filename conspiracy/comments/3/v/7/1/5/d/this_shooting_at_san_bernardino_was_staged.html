But why is it that just because police are training automatically means it was a staged event?  What is it that you think police and SWAT in particular do when they are not responding to these types of events?... They train so they can be ready for events like this.  Do you think they just sit on their asses waiting for mass shootings? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s probably because there are drills happening <em>every single day</em>, everywhere, all the time.</p>

<p>Honestly, this is routinely one of the dumbest lines of suspicion because it&#39;s one that even a child could address. When not responding to emergencies, emergency responders train. That&#39;s what they do. And they do it all the time.</p>

<p>Do you know why?</p>

<p>So they are better prepared to respond to emergencies.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no great mystery.</p>
