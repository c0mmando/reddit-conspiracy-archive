    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I feel you. My patience comes from the fact that the facts make these people look absolutely ridiculous and any additional emotions added merely gives them ammo to detract from the point you&#39;re trying to make. </p>

<p>You also have to realize I know this guy has no intention of budging but he is bringing up valid points and I am addressing those points for the people who read the thread. Not for that guy. I&#39;m merely addressing the talking points and that guy is a vehicle for those talking points, paid or not. </p>

<p>Just spread the info, people will react their own ways, but you&#39;ll always win good honest people over with info. And in the end, those are the only people really worth the effort. </p>

<p>It does suck to be out of sync with the mainstream culture though. Realize culture is not your friend though, it is an intelligence test. It is designed to distract you at every level, and some people actually fall for it on a lot of levels. Some out of willful ignorance, but some out of just sheer never having heard the truth. You can&#39;t differentiate the two in practice, so it&#39;s best to just spread the message and then leave it be and not get caught up on trying to convince specific individuals. If you offer truth and they refuse it, that&#39;s on them, but it&#39;s good to try and at least make the info available. You can lead a horse to water but you can&#39;t make it drink. So I just try and make lots of water available in case anyone is thirsty. </p>
