       They can no longer deny the west is behind ISIS, so now they're trying to throw Turkey and Saudi Arabia under the bus. While those two countries are guilty, they get most of their funding and motivation from the US and Israeli governments! And Israel gets all the ISIS oil.

       Hey.  At least you had steam to begin with.  Lots of people haven't even
       <em>
        picked up
       </em>
       steam to inform people.  It is what it is.  We just have to gather as much information as we can - first and foremost and primarily for
       <em>
        ourselves
       </em>
       , so that WE can be informed and educated, and then if anyone else asks or wants to know? then we can pass on the information we gained and inform them as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some (sometimes many) of these people will not accept the information.  All good.  That's on them.  Give it to them anyway.  Tell them what you know, and then move on regardless of whether they accept it or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just have a "meh" attitude toward whether they accept it or not regardless.  Easier said than done, but that's what I tend to do.

       Right on. Couldn't agree more. Sometimes I wish I could help others pick up steam, but sometimes I think I should just let the information do the talking. I think your "set it and forget it" type of approach is best, can't get too emotionally invested in convincing particular people, it's more about making the information generally available.

       Yeah.  Really, at the end of the day, all this information we gather and learn about is for
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       .  It's for us educating

       You can only lead a horse to water.  You can't make it drink.  The drinking it must do on its own.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we can do is educate ourselves as much as possible, and present the water to others who are thirsty.  If they refuse to quench their own thirst, let them continue on in their lives then - wandering about, gasping for air, wondering why they're so horribly thirsty all the time and everything around them seems so damn dry.  Oh well.  Not your problem.  You give information, and then just move on, drinking and quenching your own thirst.

       Very correct, sir.  Very correct indeed.  Don't attach yourself too much if at all to the final outcome of the information you disseminate.  Just disseminate it, give the knowledge, answer whatever questions some might have, and then simply move on.

       Both of you, keep fighting the good fight! Channel that anger into something constructive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, when debating this stuff with the gen. public, I feel sometimes we (myself included) get too caught up in trying to convince people we ARE right as opposed to showing them that this is something we see as a 100% plausible reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Arguing your point from the perspective of, "honestly, I hope I'm wrong about all of this because that would obviously be better, but the facts don't seem to point that way", in my opinion, only strengthens your argument and supporting facts to someone who isn't into researching this stuff already. I guess it shows that you are more vested in the facts themselves and less vested in just winning an argument. At least that is my experience.

       Yep.  Totally.  I must remind myself of my
       <em>
        own

       words as well.  Sometimes things devolve into an attempt at just being “the right one” regardless of what is said.  I try not to do that, but sometimes it’s not easy if you can feel that the other person is coming into the conversation from a place of general negativity and is there more to hurt, belittle, and marginalize
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       personally than gain knowledge and learn information.

       If I am getting to the front page this easily (twice today on the same topic on something that took me literally 2 minutes to write), this means more people need to post about this stuff. Sometimes I feel like there's 5 of us trying and the rest are just lurking.  Lurking isn't going to stop any world wars, time to spread some info guys. Especially online where it's anonymous!
      </p>
      <p>
       If you see something, say something! The media isn't going to do it for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't mean to be preachy, but this is serious fucking business. Hundreds of thousands of people will die, if the Iraq war was any indication. Wars hinge on public opinion, and if no one is contradicting the media narrative, then guess who then owns public opinion? Going to war for profit is a snap if no one ever speaks out against it!

       Benghazi Commission: Obama Admin Gun-Running Scheme Armed Islamic State.  The Obama administration pursued a policy in Libya back in 2011 that ultimately allowed guns to walk into the hands of jihadists linked to the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and al-Qaeda (AQ) in Syria, according to a former CIA officer who co-authored a report on behalf of the Citizen’s Commission on Benghazi (CCB), detailing the gun running scheme.

       Thanks for the link. Reminds me of the "Fast and Furious" scandal where they "lost" all those millions of dollars of guns in Mexico, while giving them out and supposedly trying to track them. But in reality just were giving them to the cartel they wanted to support to help overpower the other cartels.

       No one mentioned Jews except you. The Zionist Israeli government is not the same as all Jews, that's ridiculous, half of Jews don't support Zionism. No one said Israel is "the primary target".

       As a Jew, deep within the typical liberal Angelino Jewish community, I will have to respectfully disagree. Most Jews are very supportive of Israel, regardless of "Zionism". Yes, most are in favor of a two-state solution, but that's besides the point.

       lol they weren't scare quotes. They were an indicator that Zionist is a label used very broadly. Any Jew who supports Israel is immediately labeled as a Zionist.

       Funny. I didn't know that a person can convert to another ethnicity. I'm surprised that most people haven't converted to American or European. I stopped reading after that, FYI. It lost all credibility with that one line.

       Close, it is Israeli Nationalism. Only 50% of Jews support Zionism, and it's the same 50% that support the Israeli Government. Don't get your jews confused with your nationalist zionists.

       I don't think the US arms Turkey directly, I was unable to find information supporting that. More that Turkey has NATO as a fallback, and NATO is armed by the US. This link shows that, "NATO will help Turkey against Russia if needed":
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2015/10/12/NATO-chief-urges-Turkey-to-be-proportionate-in-response-to-attacks.html">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But it also seems the government is paid by the US to look the other way about certain things. There is a lot of dirty money going around with the Turkish government, just read about the almost billion dollar palace President Erdogan built on what was supposed to be a national park. The guy is clearly corrupt as all get out:

       Further reading showing US-NATO-Turkey-ISIS ties:
      </p>
      <p>
       ISIS oil is for sale to Turkey:

      </p>
      <p>
       another link, same story, different angle:

       NATO support of Turkey after the ISIS link comes out, siding with ISIS supporters rather than admit Russia is right. Shows their true colors:

       I'd call it damage control, or a recontextualization, but I guess it's a limited hangout too. They didn't exactly want this information to come out, whereas generally with a limited hangout they do.

       I wouldn't be surprised if the drop in gas prices in the US is related to their backing of ISIS. If there isn't a direct link between the US and ISIS's oil, then there's probably an oil laundry/proxy through Turkey or Saudi Arabia

       My theory on the oil thing is that it's a way to punish russia and Iran, who both heavily rely on oil exports as a source of income. It's a way to collapse their economies. OPEC sets the price of oil, it has very little to do with actual demand or supply, because the supply amounts are chosen by OPEC to ensure they get the prices they want, that's why there is $50 oil, imo.

       The CNN headline story in the "Middle East" section is: "Russia, Turkey trade accusations over who bought oil from ISIS" as if only Turkey were involved, and as if we aren't sure if it's Russia or Turkey who is doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the US is
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       accused in the article, and Israel isn't even mentioned.

       Who buys saudi oil, thus giving them funds? Who gives them a few billion a year in military funding, with which they MUST buy US manufactured arms? The US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where does the ISIS oil go? Through turkey. Why is NATO defending Turkey after they shot down a Russian jet that was in their airspace for 17 seconds? Why do they want Turkey to join nato more than ever? So they can overthrow Assad and put in their own Syrian government.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's clear the west backs ISIS, and it's clear the US and Israel are the military spearheads of the western governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who has the most interest in overthrowing Syria, which is also the goal of ISIS? Israel. They're right there, geographically. They want to expand in to greater Israel, which is the core of the ideology of Zionism, which involves taking over Syria.
