       I couldn't agree more.  I don't think there's a better show for putting a kind of zeitgeist on display, with biting social commentary.  There were a few episodes years ago that were about things going on in my life that I actually had a brief truman show moment and panicked.  That's how spot-on they are.  And then after talking with friends, I realized that society and its memes are a lot more prevalent and universally applicable than they appear at face-value.

       For me its this season and the last, but I have to give
       <em>
        Imaginationland Trilogy
       </em>
       an honorable mention because it can be read on many levels.  At first, it seems like a silly dada departure similar to
       <em>
        'the christmas poo'
       </em>
       thing (terrible / boring imo) or
       <em>
        fish dicks
       </em>
       (which was funny but ultimately about nothing more than how clueless Kanye West is).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you can read it as a statement of the war on terrorism being a complete illusion, one of the characters in Imaginationland suggesting " just because something is imaginary doesn't mean it is not real."   Not only is it an illusion, but it's one that is created and maintained by military intelligence (they coax the children to go back to Imaginationland), acting as a kind of
       <em>
        imaginal echo chamber
       </em>
       by feeding into their own self-confirming fears made manifest: imagination itself then has come to life and its denizens are bleeding into the real world, dissolving the boundary between truth and fiction.  There whole last decade and a half are the real-world representation of this process, up to and including ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, the barrier between good and evil being torn down by fictional Islamic terrorists who reside in Imaginationalnd suggests that our illusions ultimately will create a hell on earth, suggesting that there really is some kind of occultic process of becoming playing out.  This is further elaborated by Butters being "the key" which suggests neo of the matrix as well as the key of solomon a grimoire of demons--both suggest Imaginationland was a space which resided in Butters' being, a very gnostic theme if there ever were any.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry I went commander overkill on this comment. I am a fan of spotting gnostic / freemason themes in tv/movies.

       I love satire that always comes exactly right after an event happens. It would reasonably seem that a show would need more time to show things as they will be but this show is always ahead of the curve.

       The kids were talking to ISIS thru social media thinking they were ninjas hahaha. Maybe the San Bernardino shooter was doing the same?

       South Park hasn't been funny for years. It's one of the most influential Opinion columns in the contemporary "news" sphere. Did you think that The Daily Show was funny?

       I never watched it. I don't watch TV only South Park, Family Guy, and some others. I don't even have a TV. I live in England and I won't agree to a law that says I have to fund propaganda, hence the name. Well I do have a few TV's actually 3, but they aren't connected to any aerial, just WiFi.

       For me its this season and the last, but I have to give
       <em>
        Imaginationland Trilogy
       </em>
       an honorable mention because it can be read on many levels.  At first, it seems like a silly dada departure similar to
       <em>
        'the christmas poo'
       </em>
       thing (terrible / boring imo) or
       <em>
        fish dicks
       </em>
       (which was funny but ultimately about nothing more than how clueless Kanye West is).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you can read it as a statement of the war on terrorism being a complete illusion, one of the characters in Imaginationland suggesting " just because something is imaginary doesn't mean it is not real."   Not only is it an illusion, but it's one that is created and maintained by military intelligence (they coax the children to go back to Imaginationland), acting as a kind of
       <em>
        imaginal echo chamber
       </em>
       by feeding into their own self-confirming fears made manifest: imagination itself then has come to life and its denizens are bleeding into the real world, dissolving the boundary between truth and fiction.  There whole last decade and a half are the real-world representation of this process, up to and including ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, the barrier between good and evil being torn down by fictional Islamic terrorists who reside in Imaginationalnd suggests that our illusions ultimately will create a hell on earth, suggesting that there really is some kind of occultic process of becoming playing out.  This is further elaborated by Butters being "the key" which suggests neo of the matrix as well as the key of solomon a grimoire of demons--both suggest Imaginationland was a space which resided in Butters' being, a very gnostic theme if there ever were any.

       Sorry I went commander overkill on this comment. I am a fan of spotting gnostic / freemason themes in tv/movies.
