    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t agree more.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a better show for putting a kind of zeitgeist on display, with biting social commentary.  There were a few episodes years ago that were about things going on in my life that I actually had a brief truman show moment and panicked.  That&#39;s how spot-on they are.  And then after talking with friends, I realized that society and its memes are a lot more prevalent and universally applicable than they appear at face-value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me its this season and the last, but I have to give <em>Imaginationland Trilogy</em> an honorable mention because it can be read on many levels.  At first, it seems like a silly dada departure similar to <em>&#39;the christmas poo&#39;</em> thing (terrible / boring imo) or <em>fish dicks</em> (which was funny but ultimately about nothing more than how clueless Kanye West is).  </p>

<p>Then you can read it as a statement of the war on terrorism being a complete illusion, one of the characters in Imaginationland suggesting &quot; just because something is imaginary doesn&#39;t mean it is not real.&quot;   Not only is it an illusion, but it&#39;s one that is created and maintained by military intelligence (they coax the children to go back to Imaginationland), acting as a kind of <em>imaginal echo chamber</em> by feeding into their own self-confirming fears made manifest: imagination itself then has come to life and its denizens are bleeding into the real world, dissolving the boundary between truth and fiction.  There whole last decade and a half are the real-world representation of this process, up to and including ISIS.</p>

<p>Finally, the barrier between good and evil being torn down by fictional Islamic terrorists who reside in Imaginationalnd suggests that our illusions ultimately will create a hell on earth, suggesting that there really is some kind of occultic process of becoming playing out.  This is further elaborated by Butters being &quot;the key&quot; which suggests neo of the matrix as well as the key of solomon a grimoire of demons--both suggest Imaginationland was a space which resided in Butters&#39; being, a very gnostic theme if there ever were any.</p>

<p>Sorry I went commander overkill on this comment. I am a fan of spotting gnostic / freemason themes in tv/movies.</p>
