       I got nauseous when I saw that this morning. And four months ago, I was the nut of the house for saying that by the end of the year, there'd be more suspicious shootings followed by a heavy media push for more gun laws. I honestly didn't even expect it to be this bad though. I think a lot of it has to do with putting the recent world news on the back page. It will be interesting how many people they can truly rally together to TAKE the guns in the first place. I feel as if a lot has to happen before that.

       It makes me feel sick too. They are pushing the agenda hard now. There's nothing subtle about it.
       <br/>
       What makes me sicker though is hearing the support it gets from average people. The "logic" they use to argue for gun control is so preposterous. I don't understand the mental gymnastics they have to go through.
It's what worries me most. The number of people who desire to give their freedoms up to the government keeps growing it seems. 
What happened to self reliance and taking responsibility for  our own actions?
So many people want to be babied, dependent on the system to "protect" them. No one wants to think. They want the system to think for them.
Everyday people turn more into robots. Docile brainwashed masses obedient to the system.

       I know that all too well, I live with it every day. "Nobody needs those guns" they say. "They didn't have machine guns when the 2nd amendment was written."
      </p>
      <p>
       All this with complete disregard for WHY the amendment was written  - to keep the fear of the public in government. But people who live today have never experienced this type of political injustice and can't even comprehend the idea that our rulers don't have our interests in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now I guess we are denying gun rights to people with NO trial and NO due process on the ridiculous terror watch list. Next, it will be those whose doctors report their mental health to the government. Then, conspiracy theorists. It's so fucking transparent and yeah, the majority doesn't care enough to see the whole forest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately, it won't take the majority to repel the gun grab. Once SWAT and DHS officers start getting killed by the dozens by law-abiding gun owners, the script will again have to change. You just wonder what lengths they will go to for physical confiscation, and for how long they can keep their minions on the job. The belief in freedom and civil liberties has won out all throughout history and I have no doubt TPTB are reaching further than arms' length here. I don't own any "assault" weapons but I know many who own mulitple and I will be happy to join them in repelling their efforts. There is no more honorable way to die, so whatever.

       By THE EDITORIAL BOARD
      </p>
      <p>
       DECEMBER 4, 2015
      </p>
      <p>
       All decent people feel sorrow and righteous fury about the latest slaughter of innocents, in California. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies are searching for motivations, including the vital question of how the murderers might have been connected to international terrorism. That is right and proper.
      </p>
      <p>
       But motives do not matter to the dead in California, nor did they in Colorado, Oregon, South Carolina, Virginia, Connecticut and far too many other places. The attention and anger of Americans should also be directed at the elected leaders whose job is to keep us safe but who place a higher premium on the money and political power of an industry dedicated to profiting from the unfettered spread of ever more powerful firearms.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a moral outrage and a national disgrace that civilians can legally purchase weapons designed specifically to kill people with brutal speed and efficiency. These are weapons of war, barely modified and deliberately marketed as tools of macho vigilantism and even insurrection. America’s elected leaders offer prayers for gun victims and then, callously and without fear of consequence, reject the most basic restrictions on weapons of mass killing, as they did on Thursday. They distract us with arguments about the word terrorism. Let’s be clear: These spree killings are all, in their own ways, acts of terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Opponents of gun control are saying, as they do after every killing, that no law can unfailingly forestall a specific criminal. That is true. They are talking, many with sincerity, about the constitutional challenges to effective gun regulation. Those challenges exist. They point out that determined killers obtained weapons illegally in places like France, England and Norway that have strict gun laws. Yes, they did.
      </p>
      <p>
       But at least those countries are trying. The United States is not. Worse, politicians abet would-be killers by creating gun markets for them, and voters allow those politicians to keep their jobs. It is past time to stop talking about halting the spread of firearms, and instead to reduce their number drastically — eliminating some large categories of weapons and ammunition.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not necessary to debate the peculiar wording of the Second Amendment. No right is unlimited and immune from reasonable regulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certain kinds of weapons, like the slightly modified combat rifles used in California, and certain kinds of ammunition, must be outlawed for civilian ownership. It is possible to define those guns in a clear and effective way and, yes, it would require Americans who own those kinds of weapons to give them up for the good of their fellow citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       What better time than during a presidential election to show, at long last, that our nation has retained its sense of decency?
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl-dr: it's all our fault for not holding the government accountable for their failure to secure our safety through measures that not only break our nation's founding document but also have been proven ineffective abroad.

       I'm trying to be objective. I'm trying to see all arguments for what they're worth and make up my mind about gun control. I understand the logic of taking away the guns to prevent a revolution. But it is my understanding that in countries that enacted strict gun laws (Australia, UK) gun violence went markedly down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are we sure that we really need to cling onto the notion of preserving the possibility of revolution by clinging to our guns, thereby ensuring a future of separation and conflict? Or do you think maybe we can take positive measures that are designed to directly benefit others and thereby naturally mitigate the possibility of future atrocities?

       In other words, lead with love, not fear. I realize that in

       I'm probably making myself sound like a willing little sheep ready for my herding into of the receiving end of world domination, but I don't think it's unreasonable to say that assault weapons need to be banned, or that armor-piercing bullets have any place in the public's hands. The idea that we need to be prepared for an all-out war against our government needs to end if we're ever going to move toward peace.
      </p>
      <p>
       We just need to fix the system. We need to close the loopholes of corruption. We need to prevent cheating. We need to prevent misinformation by removing any conflicts of interest between journalism and profits. Instead of antiquated notions of honor, exceptionalism, and resolute machismo, (not to mention ludicrous religions), we need to start standing for better values like intelligence, reason, patience, humility, forgiveness, and love.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the propaganda that needs to be spread. I'm so sick and tired of the hostility. I don't want to live in a world where everyone is always trying to watch their backs out of fear for what other conniving "evil" people are doing. As human beings, we all want a lot of the same basic things – food, shelter, and all the basics for physical survival, but also the intangible necessities like joy, inclusion, sympathy and true compassion (not the super-liberal/cult-hippy version). Can we just fucking calm down and start working together towards these basic building blocks of a healthy mind and body?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know a lot of people are already angry and taking their guns away is going to make them angrier, but I'm not saying no one can ever fire these weapons. Take it to regulated gun ranges/parks. Rent the guns. Buy a lifetime membership. I don't give a fuck. If you are worried about bad guys (criminals
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       governments) coming into your home with guns, I would argue that the real problem there is the very lack of abundance and joy I mentioned earlier. If we would stop being selfish in worrying about who was going to pay for feeding and taking care of everyone and just do it collectively, there would be
       <em>
        far
       </em>
       less conflict, as working together towards a common and truly noble goal that will directly benefit the entirety of humanity will in and of itself foster camaraderie. For all of you who think people can't work together, it's seriously not a difficult leap in logic to come to the realization that everyone could work "together" in their own capacity and according to their own preferences and abilities. If that means some people need more autonomy, then give them tasks that allow them to use those talents to their fullest. This isn't hard, people. I mean, it is. But there are solutions if we just look for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to think big picture. We gotta get out of this rut of guns and fear. As I alluded to earlier, you are virtually ensuring a future that looks exactly like the Old West where, after a few shots of whiskey, an ensuing fight is then ended by a few shots from a handgun. For fuck's sake, these "If the good guys had guns" people make me want to blow
       <em>
        my
       </em>
       brains out. Just imagine that reality. Everyone has a gun. How long before "I'd better shoot this guy before this escalates" becomes all-too-common reasoning? Where exactly is the line drawn on who is a good guy with a gun and who is a bad guy with a gun? You can't seriously fucking think that if we lived in a world where there was complete and total gun acceptance – that in this glorious Mecca for firearms where "good guys" have guns on their belts, that life and society would be exactly the same with the only exception being that a random terrorist or a violent, mentally ill person here or there would get shot. That is a dramatic cultural shift with a myriad of inevitable and inarguably terrible consequences. You're delusional if you don't think a lot of innocent people aren't going to die over stupid, needless shit if you take that line of thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our problem with people shooting people with guns is not an isolated issue. It doesn't operate in a vacuum. It's a part of this society we've built for ourselves. It's an outgrowth of what we've decided to stand for. It's a product of bad design. Well-adjusted, satisfied, happy people that have hopes and the ability to act upon those visions don't shoot people. Let's use that as a starting point and cut the greedy, angry, maniacal bullshit.

       It's not about guns or weapons. It's about freedom. As a nation we cannot keep giving up more and more of our liberties for a false sense of security.
The government will continue to grow and grow and strip away more and more of our personal freedoms. All in the name of "safety".
Everyday the government expands its reach into our personal lives with new rules.
The government is an insatiable beast. It grew out of control long ago. This beast is fed with laws and regulations. Laws and regulations do not solve real world problems.
People want the government to protect them. The Government does NOT do this.
The government cannot protect people. Protect from who? ourselves? The government IS the people. "We the people, for the people, by the people."
Don't look to the government to solve the problems in our world. Look to yourselves and your neighbors.
The line has to be drawn at some point.

       I won't flame you because you're fairly respectful, despite all this new age rhetoric. But the guilt tactic you're using is similar to that of the government's. Think of it this way...if the elite weren't blatantly obviously trying to limit our access to arms, then we wouldn't be so fast to arm ourselves, period. If the US gub'mint respected the constitution, then they would understand, but they're corrupt and instead are playing mind games with us so we jump on their side. We would all live in peace if we all knew everyone else was armed. Sounds backwards, but it STILL works in the USA to this day. You just wouldn't be able to tell due to all the fakery that's accelerated since 2012.
