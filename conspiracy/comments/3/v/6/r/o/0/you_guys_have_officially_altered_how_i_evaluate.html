A couple blocks away?  How convinient. 
Ready to roll?  Were they training with live ammo? I&#39;m sure they are always armed with live rounds but do they travel to a training site with enough live rounds to respond to an active shooter scenario?</p>

A great book I read said &quot;Know what you don&#39;t know&quot;. The rabbit hole goes very deep. I know that&#39;s a cliche statement, but once you start researching suppressed history such as human origins, genetic, social, and geo-engineering, and true physical health...

And the ones that mother gives you, don&#39;t do anything at all
Go ask Alice, when she&#39;s ten feet tall
And if you go chasing rabbits, and you know you&#39;re going to fall
Tell &#39;em a hookah-smoking caterpillar has given you the call
And call Alice, when she was just small
When the men on the chessboard get up and tell you where to go
And you&#39;ve just had some kind of mushroom, and your mind is moving low
Go ask Alice, I think she&#39;ll know
When logic and proportion have fallen sloppy dead
And the white knight is talking backwards
And the red queen&#39;s off with her head
Remember what the dormouse said
Feed your head, feed your head</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the mocking is fake anyways. People are just insecure. Most people discovering the things on this sub aren&#39;t loud and proud about how they were previously ignorant (although they should be, to help others). It gives us a biased picture. </p>

<p>We have a third of a million subscribers and even more lurkers. Anything that gets on the front page of this sub gets 5,000 views minimum, I have the imgur stats to prove it. That&#39;s not small potatoes. Seriously, think about it, that&#39;s like one millionth of the entire world. Can view one post anyone makes that gets to the front page. That&#39;s a lot of influence. </p>

<p>And if you could some how mcguyver your way past the mods and get something on the <em>real</em> front page, that&#39;s like 5 million views or something after you consider all the trickle-down effects to other websites. That&#39;s like 1/1000th of the world population! 9/10ths of which doesn&#39;t have English-language internet access anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because its frowned upon.</p>

<p>There was an askreddit thread a few days ago asking which conspiracy is most likely to be true.</p>

<p>Someone was bombarded with downvotes because they said they didn&#39;t know who to believe when it came to 9/11 and the WTC buildings.</p>

<p>Then they asked them why they didn&#39;t follow the mainstream explanation.</p>

<p>The person literally had to explain why he didn&#39;t believe what the media was telling them. It was crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Welcome to reality.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lawfulpath.com/ref/sw4qw/index.shtml">Here</a> is something you may find educational.</p>

<p><em>SKYNET adhered to no rules other than its own.  Morals and etiquette that had kept the human race from wiping itself out over the many centuries did not apply to SKYNET in any capacity at all.  The Geneva Convention, social mores, cultural rules and guidelines for the ethical treatment of combatants, prisoners or civilians during a conflict, even basic mercy ... none of these applied, not even the shred of basic human dignity that raised man from the other animals.  Man was just another test subject, something to be studied, taken apart, dissected and surgically examined on every level possible all in order to determine the best way to exterminate man and discover new ways of doing so.  SKYNET scrutinized the human race much as a human scientist would have studied common germs under a microscope.</em></p>

<p>Study the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate">logic gates</a>.  For me, the real purpose of studying the cabal at this point, is not to merely immerse myself in negativity.  The point is to realise that many of the methods which they are using to very precisely create a negative scenario, can be just as easily and effectively used to create a very positive one.  Science by itself is neutral.  How it is used, is up to us.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I do try to filter the news and not accept it as it is, because it&#39;s only logical that situations will be created and used by specific people for specific reasons.</p>

<p>But for example the attack in Paris I choose to believe, as I received quite convincing information about it. But many people indeed hurried to call it a fake, from the first minutes it took place.</p>

<p>Perhaps I am too blind and silly for not considering the OP&#39;s observation as a strong indicator of fraud. I don&#39;t know... Try to convince me, I guess. </p>

It&#39;s an instant-gratification society and if you can&#39;t get your point across in a few minutes, you&#39;re probably going to lose them to primetime TV or a Netflix binge.</p>

As I said in my first post, I know, because it&#39;s only logical, that situations will be created by specific people and taken advantage accordingly by those same people that have the resources to pull it off in the first place.</p>

<p>So I guess I misunderstood the meaning of this &quot;false flag&quot; conspiracy theory trend. I thought the theorists meant that the attacks never took place in the first place and everything was completely staged with actors etc (&quot;Wag the Dog&quot; style - brilliant movie btw).</p>

<p>To sum it up: If that&#39;s the case and you people doubt the reasons and the initiators of such attacks, then I&#39;m with you. But there are attacks and there are brutally murdered people while dancing in a concert and fanatics that blow themselves up to finally get some in their heaven.</p>

<p>Individuals that say this, I feel, go a bit <em>too</em> far because the fact of the matter is that TPTB have exactly <em>no</em> compunction against killing off as many civilians as are needed in order to convinced the public and make them/us think that whatever attack was staged was, in fact, real.</p>

<p>It’s real in the sense that real people got killed and murdered.  There was really a gun man, etc, etc.  It was a false flag, however, in the sense that the entire event was purposefully orchestrated by powers behind the scenes in order to exact an effect that they desired <em>unbeknownst</em> to the general population.</p>

<p><em>Some</em> false flags can be Wag The Dog type events - yes.  However, with the increased understanding of the public, TPTB understand that they have to go “balls deep” more often than not and make their false flags REAL events.</p>

<p>Heck, often time, some of the perpetrators of the crimes themselves aren’t even fully aware that they’re simply being used as a pawn by very intelligent (though evil) powers above them.</p>

<p>Take the “refugee” crisis, for example.  I was just talking to my gf yesterday and explaining to her that the stage is <em>very</em> much set for TPTB to carry out the next false flag attack involving some sort of middle east refugee attack right here in the United States.  They’ve pretty much opened up the borders and are letting a lot of international people into the U.S. as it stands.  No reason one of the “terrorists” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMnl0nO-oCk&amp;amp;feature=share">that it’s been pretty much indubitably shown that the U.S. itself funds and abetts behind the scenes</a>) can’t be allowed free passage into the United States to do whatever tf they want.  Once that person, for example, (who, understandably, probably hates the <em>fuck</em> out of the United States since the US probably bombed and killed his entire family already anyway) gets into the America, he’ll want to return the favor and blow some shit up here too.  Meanwhile, TPTB behind the scenes are safely behind their protective secrecy as the “terrorist” bombs the shit out of a school or a mall or whatever - killing shit tons of Americans, causing all the unsuspecting, MSM-watching citizens here to go into an immediate panic, and practically <em>beg</em> TPTB to impose some sort of martial law here.</p>

<p>Shit’s <em>super</em> fucked up, but that’s how it happens.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfoaLbbAix0">Relevant</a> (very relevant, in fact).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If that&#39;s the case and you people doubt the reasons and the initiators of such attacks, then I&#39;m with you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, don’t be a fucking ignoramus and blanket everyone in this sub by saying “you people”.  As if “we people” are “all of one type”.  Come the fuck on, man.  There are <em>all</em> types here.  Hell, <em>you’re</em> here, so watch your mouth before you end up blanketing <em>yourself</em> in your attempt at marginalization.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But there are attacks and there are brutally murdered people while dancing in a concert and fanatics that blow themselves up to finally get some in their heaven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course.  Not <em>everything</em> is a false flag attack.  However, TPTB <em>have</em> indeed been ramping shit up big time as of late - and regardless of whether they themselves are directly responsible for any particular attack or not, you can bet they will try to immediately USE that attack to their ends.</p>

<p>“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yeA_kHHLow">You never want a serious crisis go to waste.</a>”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And something must be done to end this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely.  100%.  Part of what is necessary for this is a sufficient amount of critical thinking ability to realize that this planet is overran by powers that have zero problem with the killing of huge swaths of the population in order to forward their agenda.</p>

<p>That kind of critical thinking ability, however, is often time not very easy when so many of us have been indoctrinated to <em>not</em> think clearly and critically and many of us have to contend with so many others trying to (again) marginalize any attempt to get to the bottom of what seems to be a level of covert, global chicanery going on around us that is resulting in a state of continued subjugation for the population of humans here as a whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly my first thought when I saw the headlines was how long till people start calling this a false flag. Then I started to read the story and the first paragraph had the comments that made me think of the questions. I&#39;m not accusing this of being a false flag, I&#39;m just pointing out that in the past I would have thought it was a lucky break to have SWAT  so close. Now, thanks to this sub it&#39;s a thing that makes me go hmmmmmmm.....</p>
