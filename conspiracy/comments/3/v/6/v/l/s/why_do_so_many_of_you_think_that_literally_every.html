<p>Taking the police/government at their word is also confirmation bias. The difference between the two is in applying experience.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s someone in your personal life that has lied to you over and over again but you keep believing them without applying critical thinking, who&#39;s the deluded one - you or the liar?</p>

<p>Yet when police/government lies to us over and over again, it&#39;s like some magic spell. People keep believing them without applying experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When somthing happens at 11am in California and at 145pm in Texas we hear about it.. remember two hour time difference. When in less than an hour a shooting goes nationwide, it&#39;s just suspicious. So you start asking questions. And once you&#39;ve put a couple puzzles together and see the pattern, it&#39;s pretty easy to assume if it&#39;s organic or not. Now we don&#39;t know all the details yet but we can see the same structure being built. I&#39;m waiting for Obama&#39;s speech on the event. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t, but it&#39;s certainly strange how a training exercise almost always coincides.</p>

<p>I try not to &#39;believe&#39; anything.  I like to think about them.  Beliefs allow you to stop thinking.  I know that&#39;s splitting vocabulary hairs, but I think it matters.</p>

<p>*Whoever downvoted me, that&#39;s fine, but I&#39;d love to know why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for answering.  And I realize that, and I&#39;m way glad they do.  They&#39;ve come to my rescue when I used to drink to much and end up in withdrawals.</p>

<p>I just meant it&#39;s odd that a shooter drill will often be within a day or two of a shooting and if not at the same location, very nearby.</p>

<p>One of the first mass shooters at the tower at UT knew something was wrong with him.  He tried to get help, but that&#39;s tricky stuff.  When do you take someone down for thought crime?  I dunno.  But he left a note that they look in his head afterwards.  There was a tumor pressing on some part of his brain.  I don&#39;t recall which.   He knew his mind wasn&#39;t firing right though.</p>

<p>Anyway,  I&#39;d say some are strange situations.  Some are guys with minds that get haywire.  *And some are people that really want to hurt people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always wanted to compare old footage of a mass shooting event with a modern one. It seems like there were a lot more people who were injured back then. There were also less people killed. Lots of blood and bullet holes, broken glass, etc. Lots more eye witnesses. Lots of terrified people crying and screaming. You could look at their faces and tell that they witnessed something traumatic. Nowadays it seems like all the crisis actors are laughing and smiling. There are lots of people on the scene but no injuries or blood. Very neat and clean. Everyone dies or lives. And, it always helps to advance the political  agenda.</p>

<p>Taking the police/government at their word is also confirmation bias. The difference between the two is in applying experience.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s someone in your personal life that has lied to you over and over again but you keep believing them without applying critical thinking, who&#39;s the deluded one - you or the liar?</p>

<p>Yet when police/government lies to us over and over again, it&#39;s like some magic spell. People keep believing them without applying experience.</p>
