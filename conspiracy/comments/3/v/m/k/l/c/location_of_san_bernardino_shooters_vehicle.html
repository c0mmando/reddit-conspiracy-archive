       I did some photo comparison and Google map comparison, and this is what I came up with. The first photo shows the vehicle located next to 1807 E Bernardino Ave, the second photo shows the vehicle located near the intersection of Richardson and E San Bernardino Ave. The third photo, a screen shot from Google Street View from 1807 E Bernardino Ave, shows that Richardson in not even remotely near the alleged scene of the suspect apprehension.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zoom in on the mailboxes in Google Street View, to confirm the addresses. They don't add up.

       What about the power lines though? Your picture has a fair amount of power line poles, while the pictures OP provided had just a few. Even if the picture were taken from far away or from another angle, shouldn't the majority of those numerous power lines be visible?

       Look how far away Richardson is, compared to where the vehicle was stopped. Also, look at the surrounding area. It looks nothing like the photo and the Street View was done in June 2015.

       is another shot from the same photographer. I think he was standing around 2000 or 2100 Bernardino and had a massive amount of zoom. It made sense to me once I found the wider shot photo and investigated 1900 Bernardino on google maps.

       What I don't understand is that the car is completely shot to shit on the front yet all the police officers are set up behind the suspect when the news cameras get there to an already dead perp. Doesn't make much sense at all.

       They are stopped somewhere near the 1807 mailbox. Look at the fire hydrant in your first picture, it looks like it is right under the mailbox, however if you look at street view it is probably 100 feet down the road. Also look at the Richardson sign and the railroad tracks, in the picture they look like they are right on top of each other, but look on the map and the tracks are actually further away from Richardson than the car is from Richardson.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really high zoom compresses the perspective and makes everything looks really close together. And this is an exceptionally high zoom lens. Low-zoom (wide angle), like what is used on the Google street view car, does the opposite and makes the perspective appear like things are far apart. So you are comparing a very very high zoom photo to a very wide angle photo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was a professional photographer for newspapers, these images make sense to me because of the type of lenses being used. Lenses used to this extreme do distort the look from what you are used to seeing though, which is why it doesn't look "right" but nothing here was faked or manipulated.

       Richardson is at 1600. It's 2 full blocks away. The photographer zoom is massive. But when I looked at google maps everything fell into place if you consider that 1600 - 1950 is all within the shot of the photo. Even the red car that appears close to the SUV is actually several houses

       That does not look like a rental car.  Tinted windows with upgraded rims.  It also looks like an older model.

       Rental SUVs like that generally have nicer equipment packages since they're frequently used by families. Also, all large SUVs have the back windows darkened with solar glass from the factory.

       The pictures show the licence plate, but I can't make out the numbers.  I think the SUV needs to be addressed.  What rental company did it come from?  Can this SUV be tied to the shooting scene?  I think they got the wrong vehicle and killed innocent people.

       I think the mailbox is behind the SUV. Its actually 2 houses down but the camera zoom makes it look close.

       They are stopped somewhere near the 1807 mailbox. Look at the fire hydrant in your first picture, it looks like it is right under the mailbox, however if you look at street view it is probably 100 feet down the road. Also look at the Richardson sign and the railroad tracks, in the picture they look like they are right on top of each other, but look on the map and the tracks are actually further away from Richardson than the car is from Richardson.
      </p>

       Really high zoom compresses the perspective and makes everything looks really close together. And this is an exceptionally high zoom lens. Low-zoom (wide angle), like what is used on the Google street view car, does the opposite and makes the perspective appear like things are far apart. So you are comparing a very very high zoom photo to a very wide angle photo.
      </p>

       I was a professional photographer for newspapers, these images make sense to me because of the type of lenses being used. Lenses used to this extreme do distort the look from what you are used to seeing though, which is why it doesn't look "right" but nothing here was faked or manipulated.
