       <strong>
        EDIT FYI: San Bernardino Citizens for Truth are holding an AMA on Reddit on Monday 12:30PM EST.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We are concerned San Bernardino citizens and people of conscience who demand transparency and competence from federal agencies investigating the San Bernardino shooting. In these times of tragedy and grief, we believe that the investigation so far has been conducted in an un-orthodox way and that there are many questions pertaining to that that deserve to be addressed officially by authorities like the FBI before definitive conclusions can be made about who was responsible for these attacks. We believe this puts our community and the nation at risk if other potential perpetrators have not been accounted for. We believe these questions deserve to be addressed in allowing our community and the nation to heal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Specific points of concern can be summarized as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why were members of the media allowed in the suspects' residence when potential evidence can be compromised? Why wasn't the suspects' residence heavily guarded in an ongoing investigation?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Has the FBI ruled out the involvement of other persons in this attack other than Farook and his wife? If so, how?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why are multiple eyewitnesses saying they saw 3 athletic, white men in masks conduct the attack? If the response is "eyewitness accounts are notoriously unreliable," then wouldn't that equally discount any eyewitness accounts identifying Farook and Malik as the shooters?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why did the high speed chase involve gunfire in San Bernardino residential areas? Is it standard procedure to put residents in danger by returning gun fire or not falling back to prevent gunfire from suspects?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Other than the dead bodies of the suspects in the black SUV is there any direct evidence proving beyond reasonable doubt that Farook and his wife were the masterminds of this attack and acted alone? Other than at the holiday party and then dead in the SUV, is there any testimony identifying Farook and his wife in the course of the shooting and the subsequent police chase? If not, how have authorities definitively concluded that the suspects acted alone or weren't themselves hostages in the attack?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       We will be answering questions (along with proof of residence) during the AMA tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are also trying to get other concerned supporters to join our Facebook Group: Truth and Justice for San Bernardino as well as use the hashtag: #TruthForSanBernardino.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Use the hashtag #TruthForSanBernardino. Join the FB group: Truth and Justice for San Bernardino.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to act fast if this is going to be more than just a fringe "conspiracy theory." I am surprised by the number of people I am hearing say, "Wow, something is fishy here," i.e., people that don't have a conspiratorial bone in their body. Let's take advantage of this before the MSM and government rhetoric squashes any skepticism in the alternative narratives. We have a right to know what really happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit 1: This is why imo we should all be suspicious of the official narrative.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The only time the suspect Syed Farook was positively ID-ed was 1) at the
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/us/witnesses-recall-day-of-terror-in-San-Bernardino.html">
        holiday party before the shooting began
       </a>
       and 2)
       <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2015/12/04/san-bernardino-shooter-syed-farook-dead-photo/">
        dead in the black SUV
       </a>
       with his wife in the aftermath of the police shoot-out. Between those two times, there is no one that could have seen his face, at least no one that has come forward. The shooting was conducted by masked men and the police found the black SUV getaway car because
       <a href="http://fox13now.com/2015/12/02/officials-at-least-20-victims-in-san-bernardino-mass-shooting/">
        they were following up on a tip in a nearby town, Redlands, and when they drove by, the black SUV sped off, attracting suspicion and causing the high speed chase
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Could the police have seen and ID-ed Syed Farook in the getaway SUV? Let's take a look at the available evidence. There are two videos circulating:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://abc7.com/news/new-video-police-chase-shoot-san-bernardino-suspects/1109221/">
        http://abc7.com/news/new-video-police-chase-shoot-san-bernardino-suspects/1109221/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2015/12/03/mass-shooting-san-bernardino-police-shootout-newday.cnn">
        http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2015/12/03/mass-shooting-san-bernardino-police-shootout-newday.cnn
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how both videos are strangely similar in the angle and how the person recording reacts as soon as the SUV comes into close view. The CNN video actually cuts the footage right as the SUV gets closer in view, which is an interesting edit to say the least. Also notice how the "high speed chase" is so slow. We can actually see the speed reader sign on the road say 30 or 40 mph. Looks like the suspects were abiding by the speed limit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But more to the point, you can see in a couple of frames in the first video that the SUV windows are tinted. Even if they were not tinted, it is unlikely someone can make a positive ID looking into a speeding SUV from behind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is all that is definitively known is Farook being at the party and then dead at the SUV. The question any scientific, rational mind would ask is, between those two times, what information do we have that beyond reasonable doubt proves that Farook was perpetrating the events of that day AND that no one else was involved?
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence we have been told proves this is just:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        weapons stockpile in SUV and found in their apartment garage.
        <a href="http://www.wowt.com/home/headlines/Shootings-Reported-in-San-Bernardino-360088721.html">
         source
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-obtains-photos-of-calif-shooters-bombs/">
         source
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        shootout with police during high speed chase (videos above)
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       That's pretty much it. Obviously, they are trying to piece together other things like Facebook allegiance to ISIS or if the assault rifles were purchased from an old friend, etc. But those two pieces of evidence are really the main things that are supposed to definitively prove Farook as the mastermind and executioner of this terrorist plot.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's look closer at those two pieces of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "massive arsenal of weapons" the investigators found was a duffel bag full of pipe bombs at the suspects' residence as well as 5000 rounds of ammunition. All we see is a grainy photo of the duffel bag (link above). Calling this a "massive arsenal of weapons" might be slightly hyperbolic, but maybe that's just me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Family members who were at the residence and were regular visitors have already stated that they
       <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/san-bernardino-shooting-syed-rizwan-farook-sister-saira-khan-speaks-out-disbelief/">
        didn't notice things like a weapons stockpile
       </a>
       . Maybe they're just lying about it. Who knows?
      </p>
      <p>
       We have already seen the shootout in those two videos, and there are some major question marks there, like, why are police shooting at the SUV in a residential area and not falling back to prevent unnecessary casualties? Shooting at an escape vehicle during a high speed chase is NOT standard police protocol in any California city
       <a href="http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Police-Pursuit-Policies-Vary-Widely-350861541.html">
        (pursuit policies slightly differ from city to city)
       </a>
       and if the suspects are shooting at the police, the typical protocol is for units to fall back in order to avoid risk of loss of life to pursuing officers, pedestrians, and other drivers. For example, see this manual (admittedly from 2006):
       <a href="http://lib.post.ca.gov/Publications/vp_guidelines.pdf">
        http://lib.post.ca.gov/Publications/vp_guidelines.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Dept. of Justice also has federal policies on police chases, what they call "Restrictive Policies":
       <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/122025NCJRS.pdf">
        https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/122025NCJRS.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea is, what we see from the police in those videos is incredibly irresponsible and completely atypical of police pursuit. You might say that this was also an atypical situation involving potential terrorists, but putting more lives unnecessarily at risk for a SUV going 30-40 mph at one point is strange to say the least.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be that as it may, it is also not clear that the people shooting at the police in the course of the pursuit were positively ID-ed as the suspects. Was Farook driving and his wife shooting back at police? Was there a third person? If not, how do we know that? Is this something out of a Hollywood movie? I think people can be left to decide that on their own...
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, I think all this evidence is highly suspect and can be easily tampered with, planted, etc. Not saying that the federal agencies or police planted anything or covered anything up. But what if a third party did so and framed this Pakistani couple? Given the huge block of time where no one saw them between those two times, the evidence seems rather thin to definitively pin things on this couple and this couple alone. The fact that the FBI and the media has been so quick to come to that conclusion is in itself suspicious, especially given the
       <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/video/it-sounded-like-a-gun-range-578218563875">
        multiple eyewitness
       </a>
       saying they saw
       <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/witness-describes-the-san-bernardino-shooting/">
        three fair complexioned, athletic build, tall gunmen
       </a>
       conducting the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit 2: Co-worker and personal contact interviews
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       All the co-workers interviewed have said that Syed Farook was a mellow, friendly guy and were shocked at the thought he would commit these acts. The co-workers even
       <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-syed-farook-tashfeen-malik-shooters-san-bernardino-20151203-story.html">
        organized a baby shower for him and his wife for their first baby
       </a>
       . I don't know about anyone else, but my coworkers have never thrown me and my wife a baby shower for our kids... Guess I'm less well-liked than Farook was with his co-workers...Neither here nor there, but telling.

       Anyway, this doesn't prove anything, but doesn't seem to match the psychological profile of a guy who is bent on "violent jihad." Keep this in mind when investigators come out and say, "He had suspicious online activity." We have to know what "suspicious" means exactly. With their standards, they might even think visiting r/conspiracy is "suspicious." And as the

       I think time has kind of smoothed over the grand effort it took to clean up and rebuild that area. People don't seem to remember just how long the search for survivors in the rubble lasted.

       Not only just a search for survivors, the searches continued beyond a reasonable length of time to pull anybody trapped in the debris and rubble.  Searches continued just hoping to find human remains to provide some sort of closure for the families of the victims of that terrible Tuesday morning.

       It's interesting because this is the equivalent of burning all the evidence. Now you can't use anything to truly connect them to the crimes, or admonish them. The truth can never be revealed after that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, any evidence that survived JFK was burnt during the Boston bombing, so basically it's relevant, it'll be destroyed in one way or another.

       Not to mention President General Butt Naked was on TV shilling for gungrabber laws the exact fucking moment the bodies hit the floor. Nobody is buying their bullshit anymore. Even soviet communist propaganda was never this brazenly bullshit. Prepare for resistance, arm yourself with deadly resolve and an eludicating love for your race while you still can.

       Stormfront is a jewish false flag to give normal "conservatives" looking for a way further right a false refuge in national-socialism and "white nationalism". All forms of socialism are explicitly designed counter to the white tribal values of individualism, elitism and personal liberty. You can't be a race realist and a communist degenerate at the same time.

       They really messed up when they didn't secure the suspects' apartment. That's what really made people stop and say WTF.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even this mainstream CNN analyst is shocked, not only that this was allowed by the FBI and SBPD, but also because, where is the fingerprint dusting? Why is there shredded paper just lying around uncollected? Why are pieces of identification lying around? Did the FBI not think to secure these items? Unbelievable.

       What I gained from watching the vultures tear though their apartment is this: the shredded paperwork wasn't collected.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means two things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either the manpower doesn't exist to try to reassemble the shreddings, or the technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either one is good to know. If you want to remain secure, shred your shit a few times, then let a neighbor have the media toss it around.

       I dunno about easily, but yeah this doesn't seem all that challenging. Determine the top and bottom of each shread, map the pixels along the border, compare strips with adjacent non white pixels, reference the combined symbols against a language dictionary, add in an algorithm for word probability with other potential matches, etc...

       Manpower? 300 government officers responded. 35 people shot or injured. The biggest question should be this. Why do we not have information from the 1.7 billion dollar nsa center right now? Saying the hard drives were broken, email deleted and Facebook took down does not get rid of that database.

       Shredding it a few times 'might' make sure your information is secure, but the best approach to getting rid of evidence is just burning it. and I mean a good burn, not a mass pile of it and then toss away.

       Just shred once and mix with water and perhaps bleach.  Once it's a pulpy goob nobody can reassemble.  Or do like I do and use the shredded paper as pet bedding.  I suppose some of it can be reassembled but it is smelly and gross. In case you are wondering,  no I have nothing to hide. I'm mainly concerned about identity theft.  And it does make good free bedding.  I love junk mail.  It gets shredded too.

       Do we have any proof of this?  I can't find an official statement by the FBI, but according to a statement the day of by the Sherriff:

       There was plywood screwed over the doors and windows in that required a power driver to remove.  That's pretty secure IMHO, even more so than a door with a lock that you could bump open in a few seconds with a pick set.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to why no fingerprint dust, remember, we don't live in the world of CSI.  You can't snap a picture of a fingerprint and have a result in a few minutes.  The best source of info is something you can immediately see and search, such as emails and things like the cloud.  So you snatch all that stuff up first, throw plywood over the any of the entrances, and if you want to come back and do fingerprints later, you can.  As for why there was no one guarding, I'm chalking that up to momunmental fuck-up that someone in some department will get demoted/fired for.

       Those type "fucking ups" can only happen on purpose. Every agency in the USA is aware of the crime scene and is involved. You would think if you pulled up and got out of your vehicle without authorization you would be arrested or shot.

       The circumstances around the attack seem odd, like the one in London with a knife, however criminals themselves are odd. The police should do genetic analysis and try to form predictive mapping.

       There is a lot of information being compiled on the Facebook page mentioned in the original post. Here is a running list of questions that have not been addressed let alone answered by authorities:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Where is the CCTV footage from the Inland Regional Center? As a facility for those with developmental disabilities, a facility that required card entry, there must be multiple cameras covering every entrance and throughout the common areas. Why has nothing from that been released to the public or at least to the representatives of the Farook family?
       </li>
       <li>
        Why are multiple witnesses saying they saw 3 male shooters, all tall, athletic-build, with fair complexion? Why is that account not being reported on by the news as being investigated? If those accounts are being dismissed because the FBI has already concluded that Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik are the perpetrators, isn't that circular reasoning? Is there no evidence of anyone else's involvement in planning or carrying out this crime other than this couple's? If not, is there any evidence being sought? If not, why not?
       </li>
       <li>
        How is a 90 lb woman who recently gave birth and had no military training able to conduct what the surviving victims and eyewitnesses described as a highly tactical, sophisticated assault operation using heavy, military-grade arms?
       </li>
       <li>
        Why do Farook's coworkers say they saw no aggression or animosity from him in the 5 years working with him? How is that consistent with the psychological profile of a sociopath who could slaughter his co-workers in cold blood? Isn't this highly unusual from a psychoanalytical perspective? If so, why aren't any of the psychologists being interviewed on TV saying as much?
       </li>
       <li>
        How did the police suspect Farook after the shooting? If a survivor or eyewitness was able to ID Farook through the mask that the shooters were wearing, where is the filed statement from said witness? What other statements did other survivors and eyewitnesses make? Why haven't we heard from the many attendees at the holiday party who were not shot or killed?
       </li>
       <li>
        After completing the shooting spree, why did the suspects go back to their residence only a couple of miles away? Did they not have an escape plan? Were they trying to retrieve something? Did they drop off an accomplice? Were they planning to lay low at their apartment and hope no one would notice their absence in the aftermath? How did no one at the apartment complex see them load all those weapons into their SUV earlier that morning?
       </li>
       <li>
        Where did they rent the SUV from? Has the rental car attendee been questioned? What statement did he/she make?
       </li>
       <li>
        If there was a high speed chase of the Farook's rented SUV, where is the helicopter footage of that? News choppers were already in the sky at that time, but none of them produced footage of the actual chase and the shoot out. Only footage of the aftermath.
       </li>
       <li>
        In one of the cell phone videos with footage of the chase we hear multiple gun shots. Is it standard procedure for police to engage in a gun battle with suspects during a high speed chase, especially when the police chase is happening in a residential neighborhood? How was the SUV finally stopped? Is it standard procedure to fire hundreds of rounds into a suspect's vehicle after the vehicle has been stopped, again, in a residential area? Why would the suspects not surrender and instead engage in a gunfight with police if they were surrounded by police wielding all the heavy ammunition that ultimately decimated the SUV? If they had a death wish, why would they try to escape in the first place, as opposed to take hostages, make demands, or just shoot themselves?
       </li>
       <li>
        Why did the attorney for the Farook family, David Chesley, mention that the suspects were handcuffed, face-down in the bed of a truck? Did he misspeak? If not, what was he referring to?
       </li>
       <li>
        If this was a premeditated attack, why didn't the Farooks leave behind a manifesto or any other indication of their purpose?
       </li>
       <li>
        Why wasn't the suspects' residence heavily guarded afterwards? Why did the FBI allow media open access to their apartment? Is this standard procedure?
       </li>
       <li>
        Where did the suspects buy their weapons and ammunition? Neighbors reported seeing packages being delivered to the Farook residence. Has the FBI checked with delivery services to see who sent these packages?
       </li>
       <li>
        Early media statements mentioned that the FBI had been tracking individuals that Farook was in contact with. Are those individuals more or less dangerous than the suspects? Why are those individuals being tracked and what light does that shed on the alleged shooter's motives?
I will edit this list with more questions as needed and any answers that come to light in the ongoing investigation.

       I am not a conspiracy theorist in The least. what made me scream WAIT JUST A FUCKING MINUTE was the statement by the attorney that he had just finished a 3hour interview with the FBI who were equally baffled and that Farouk and wife were handcuffed behind their backs face down and shot to death when police arrived.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I started looking at other stuff and none of it adds up. It's more than fishy.... this is a bizarre series of events. And now the president is going to come on tv and tell us it really happened and we should go shopping to get back at the terrorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an event that screams false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone notice that the people pouring out to ambulances after the shooting were limping or had no obvious wounds. Only the "14" were directly hit? I read that there were 80-90 people in that room. How was no one else even grazed?
      </p>
      <p>
       what about the shooters being Muslim extremists yet no one heard them yell Allah Akbar (sorry if misspelled I have great respect for Muslims)?
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw one video where there seem to have been 3 black SUV's and the helicopter zooms in on each one until he "finds" the correct vehicle. how did he know which of the 3 black SUVs wS it?
      </p>
      <p>
       What's with that "dead body" at the bottom of the screen in the SUV helicopter shot? news reported them both dead in the SUV.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's with the changing account - Syed left the party angry. - 2 days later: Wait no he wasn't angry, everything seemed normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       And most bizarre of all is one that everyone has noted: who the fuck let's all those reporters inside what should be an active crime scene.

       Why do people keep clarifying that they are not conspiracy theorists? I'm not trying to attack,just generally curious. Conspiracy theorist,as a term, is treated like a slur around here. What's wrong with believing In a conspiracy?Replace it with "critical thinker." I'm not a critical thinker,but I smell something fishy. I wear my tinfoil hat like a badge of honor.

       I agree with you -- by definition there is nothing wrong with it.  It just so happens that the CIA has mounted an effort to write people's credibility off using the umbrella of conspiracy theory.  As such, it's not an avoidance of the definition, it's an avoidance of the ignorant connotation that is widely accepted.

       Of course,all the more reason to state what you are to take away the stigma. If enough rational people keep demonstrating that conspiracy theorists are pretty normal everyday people,The more it goes away. My question was more asking,if you are not a conspiracy theorist and think something is fake,is your opinion worth more because you are not a conspiracy theorist? I see this phrase often and I just wanted to know what's the rationale behind it? I would never say "I'm not a republican but I really agree their war on women."

       I agree "conspiracy theorist" shouldnt have a negative connotation, but right now, the priority is to get as much people on board as possible, questioning the official narrative, so we can make this mainstream. If people think this is "just a conspiracy" they will be less likely to associate with it.

       because this is the first time I really do think there's a conspiracy. I've generally accepted most terrorist attacks, but this lead me to seeking out conspiracy theorists to find out what their take on this is. I'm usually just pragmatic and it's not like I have faith in our government, but I've never thought.... I think the government is actually behind this... before.. that's why I put it like that. not that it's a "bad" thing necessarily, but it's just not where my mind has ever gone before.

       you are describing something that I think is really wide spread. smart informed people feeling like they "know" things aren't that great but they aren't that bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       after 9/11 I was sure our gov was taking advantage to justify a war the people would not otherwise have supported, and I even though maybe maybe some individuals had intentionally not stopped the attack when maybe they could have, but I did not comprehend it had been by orchestrated by people within our own gov - and those who control our gov via $.

       and most of my friends  are the same way, yes the gov is corrupt - yes Fox and CNN are slanted, but overall -- we are still pretty free and there is a system still doing it's best to keep the corruption in check and America is still doing fairly well all things considered.
      </p>
      <p>
       as for the last thing - I suppose it's all relative. we are not war torn so that's a plus. but I digress --- it was a paradigm shift for me to let it all come into focus -- where there is smoke of "vague corruption" -- there is the biggest fire ever of systematic intent and action.
      </p>
      <p>
       we are under a barrage of propaganda daily. not so different than North Korea - however of a different brand that we can't pick up on easily. but it's there. the press is a huge part  of it. they literally sell us fake staged events all the time. and when an event is real - they lie so much about surrounding facts - the "event" as it is described to us becomes a muddled mess of truth and lies - always significantly refracted from real life .
      </p>
      <p>
       the multilayered lies are so expansive and some are shared and coopted by other gov's too. the scope is incredible.
      </p>
      <p>
       you mind might say -- no no no. I don't go there. I know they are out for themselves but our checks and balances are keeping the system still working. I'm offering to you -- -no. we are being given a staged show every day meant to give you that impression. The depth of the lies - I don't think anyone looking into it has found the bottom yet. and many people have dug very deep.
      </p>
      <p>
       what the end game is -- I don't know, but something incredible you have to look deeper to see is happening daily.

       I'm beginning to think you're right. and I because my mind is starting to agree with you in all of that I am terrified and I also believe something huge and very very bad is coming. worse than 9-11. I'm scared if this is all true...

       you will be ok :) ! if you are starting to see it and it's scaring you -- first thing to do is relax and treat yourself like a kid who just got their heart broken the first time. it's a shock and a paradigm shift. but you will grown to know how to handle the new information. and the world is not about to end. not any more than it has been about to end for a very long time. the only thing ending right now is your former perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       but you don't have to stop yourself from feeling it all - you will regain your equilibrium, btw. I cried adnd cried couple weeks when the grandness of the information came into view for me. I really felt like I was seeing the end of the world was coming. but it's been about a year since then and I can tell you -- I actually feel better for my knowledge and perspective and much healthier and oddly often in a better mood. perhaps the anxiety of knowing something was so wrong but not knowing how to open my attention is alleviated -- and I feel overall healthier. And I would not undo the change in my perspective for anything. What also helped was researching our history and seeing that this stuff has been going on for a long time. look into conspiracy involving the sinking of the titanic -- the shuttle disaster (all space travel) -- Lincoln assassination -- for me it was helpful to realize this has been going on for a very long time, so while it feels like it's a doomsday kind of thing as I'm finally picking up on all of it -- it might not be that kind of final moments crisis as much as --- we got a long term big  picture situation here to get our heads around and it could take some big long term thinking and action to resolve it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think any time somebody "wakes up" this horrible dread comes over them. fema camps martial law next Summer, etc. I get it. BUT. try to take it easy. this mess has been here for a couple centuries/ there are layers of deception meant to freak you the hell out as you start to learn stuff. you really don't have to be scared. everything you have been picking up on finally has been here for a very long time. you are like a kid learning for the first time it's a dangerous world, but you will adapt. knowledge is the first step.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can tell you personally - I had a break down of paranoia, maybe for a few weeks, when I first figured a lot of it out, and now a year  later-- I feel alive and healthy and capable. consider it like you are going through withdrawal from the lies. it's almost like losing your religion or something like that. it is really big deal. and a really big shock psychologically. the fear is gonna get you like a waking nightmare, but give it some time. you will be ok :) just let yourself process the change in perspective.  it's a good thing to see more clearly. in time you will be better off than you were before. and some day you'll be telling somebody else the same thing.

       I appreciate your kind words, thank you... it made me think all the way back to the assassination of Julius Caesar! that was a conspiracy and who knows what the Romans were told at the time! haha...  I guess it's a trait of an empire.. and of the powerful.. conspiracies and lies to hold on to power.

       yeah, really it's probably best to just feel the paranoia attack rather than suppress, let it run it's course. no sharp objects or kids around. and remember - no matter what sunny days do lie ahead.

       and yes about Romans . maybe Brutus was a Patsy :) - Empires have ruled people with propaganda and deception since the beginning of Empires. We just thought we were over something we are not over. Lucky us, whatever we finally do about this we will earn our own place in history too.

       but my fav is just the collection of youtube videos people make on a given topic.  once you get in it you can let youtube recommend videos for you -- and -- try em. when an even is suspicious to me I google "paris attacks hoax" for example - and track what people are posting for a few days on youtube,  -- then you can start to see other stuff you decide you like to check in with regularly.

       It's a heavy stigma people are legitimately looking to circumvent. I'd say very very few of us are "conspiracy theorists" in the sense -- of how the term originators meant for it to mean -- nutty -- paranoid -- unreasonable, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem is there is this segregated discussion board for "conspiracy". Because questioning for now remains under the umbrella of -- hey we might be nutty - paranoid -- unreasonable - but we don't hurt anybody if you keep us hidden away talking only amongst ourselves - so let us ask our wacky questions in gated peace.
      </p>
      <p>
       But lions share of questions here are reasonable and legitimate and it require no nuttiness or paranoia to see that. The dam is gonna break.

       Really is strange, and I'm surprised people caught on to all these so quick. I'm excited to see what this becomes and hope people don't dismiss it immediately, it's very easy to say "hah, rot in hell terrorists" but with all the strange events during the whole fiasco it's hard to tell what really went on.

       Any reasonably devout Muslim will say Allahu Akbar at the slightest opportunity. A Muslim launching a martyr's attack on the infidels would rather eat an entire pig than miss the chance to praise his god.

       When they showe'd footage of the French raiding the apartment after the Paris attacks, they yelled "Where is your boyfriend!"  She replied back "He us not my boyfriend!" 
When they showed that I looked at my husband and said "there is no way that woman was a suicide bomber." Had she yelled Allahu Akbar I would not have questioned  it.  A few days latter they are confirm she was not a suicide bomber.  These details are important. The fact that the shooters were not heard saying anything is significant.

       It was poor taste for the building owner to allow that. The FBI only released the building back to him. Was that a bad idea? Probably. Poor taste? Not on their part.

       Why would a building owner want the media to come in and blast a terrorist's home on national TV? That's the real question. The FBI can't really stop that if they have full control of the home back to him.

       Because it's still under investigation?  Because there are things the FBI is still trying to sort out?  What does that prove anyway?  Two (or three) people entering a building and you have a bunch of people claiming them to be crisis actors.  Or saying it still doesn't prove anything.

       Okay, I'm on the road today so I can't yet respond point by point, but I have to point out there are some serious problems many of these.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        How is a 90 lb woman who recently gave birth and had no military training able to conduct what the surviving victims and eyewitnesses described as a highly tactical, sophisticated assault operation using heavy, military-grade arms?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       So she's 90lbs and just gave birth? C'mon.  This is a contradictory statment right from the start.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        sophisticated assault operation using heavy, military-grade arms?*
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Really?  Military weapons are designed to be easily operated by either sexes, and have been for some time.  If you have any familiarity with guns, you can teach any female to be effective enough to kill unarmed civilians in very little time.  These aren't heavy weapons. You are borrowing bullshit media sensationalism to prove a point.  Call me when you've moved a mortar.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's already been mentioned her husband had been to a range many times.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        had no military training
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know this yet.  There is a lot in her backround we still don't know.  But I stand behind the statement that it takes little to teach someone how to shoot effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        As a facility for those with developmental disabilities, a facility that required card entry, there must be multiple cameras covering every entrance and throughout the common areas.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       This this true?  Are they required?  I know of no such law yet making such requirements in CA facilities, although that might have changed. If so, where is this point not referencing that specific law?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, it's too early, but already I'm seeing points that just don't cut the mustard. One unsubstantiated premise after another.  Good critical thinking and problem solving on this demands that.

       One thing to note is that San Bernardino has a lot of gun ranges, as does Redlands in this area.

      <p>
       It is not strange to go to a gun range as a hobby. That doesnt mean you are able to conduct a paramilitary attack with the sophistication that the witnesses say they saw from the attackers.

       My point is that the list makes a presumption and a conclusion  about the alleged shooter.  My question is whether or not that presumption is faulty.

       Also, I fail to see what was sophisticated in this attack. What am I missing?

       That list is no more presumptuous than the conclusions already made by the MSM. And even with no requirements by law, it's exceedingly hard to believe that inland regional center has no cameras at all, especially to ensure security of the patients and accountability of the staff.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as using a weapon, sure she could have used an ar-15 with a little bit of training. But under the backdrop of all the other inconsistencies, I'm sure you can understand why this is being viewed with heavy handed skepticism

       Are you saying she wasn't capable? Why or why not?  I dispute that she's 90lbs. Where did that come from? I've not seen that once as a description.

       Port Aurthur happened when I was too young to know what was going on, but from what I've researched there is no doubt in my mind that he didn't do it.

       Too many inconsistencies and malpractice on the part of the police and government.

       I can answer a couple questions:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         I work for the Department of Human Services for San Bernardino County. I have worked in three different buildings and none of them have video cameras. It's not unusual that this building didn't have them either.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I was listening to the scanner when the attackers were shot (me and thousands of other people - hopefully somebody recorded it) there was a witch hunt going on at the time and this vehicle and the people in it were not the only people considered suspect at the time. It was when the people in the SUV opened fire on the police that their situation became the primary interest. They initially pulled into a parking lot and the police didn't act because they were calling for back-up. Back-up didn't get there fast enough and the SUV headed East on a sparsely populated street - there are some houses but it's not really a residential neighborhood. I don't think they were given the order to return fire but it was an intense situation and when one cop started shooting the other officers felt justified in shooting. (Just like with the reporters entering the apartment.)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I don't think there's a conspiracy in these two points.

       thanks for info, it's always good to get really clear about what are the lies and what are the truths, I'm sure there is deception going on here but I doubt those cops in the chase were in on it so it would make sense they acted within reason with respect their own understanding.

       Regarding #8: I was following this live while it happened. The scanners and Fox 10 Phoenix reported that the choppers had to leave because they were taking fire.

       Then a DHS plane (rumored to have a dirtbox equipped) began circling the area:

       With the zoom capabilities of the camera on a news helicopter it can easily stay out of gunshot range while getting a good view of what's happening.  Check out this zoom.

       Except there was no evidence of anything untoward in the objects the media crudely pawed through. There wasn't even any evidence that they were not planning to come home and do the dishes and make dinner, change the baby's diaper, say their prayers and read some devotionals, and go to bed.

       5 is a big one. Maybe the media has caught on since the Aurora theatre shooter. That op wouldn't have been exposed if it wasn't for the media's unedited witness testimonies directly after the event describing multiple shooters in body armor and paramilitary garb.

       This is a strong, reasonable list of questions. There's nothing to disregard as being tinfoil hat-ish. These questions should be spread, not in a fear mongering way, but from a reasoned, critical angle. Too many important issues get swept away by ad hominem attacks on "crazy conspiracy theorists".

       I stopped reading at number two as it was enough to convince me, that's extremely odd unless all three of them happened to be family friends of the suspects and had a plan set up which is pretty much unlikely. I'm going to do more research on this, I don't even know the story very well but it sounds simply like a Pakistani couple shooting up a building that was for disabled people and then driving off in an SUV then dying, right?

       there are many sides to every story. much respect for that. however - welcome to questioning from this side! the reasons to question (re: false flag) are so abundant once a lot of it comes into focus for you you can't unsee it. but it's the initial stuff that's the hardest to open eyes to. imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       for me personally I can see it's fake because I realized boston Bombing was staged - and then I realized at least some stuff about Sandy hook was fake and then charleston shooting, Oregon, that TV reporter, Paris attacks. I'm sure I'm missing some. but before I would research research research. not sure for a long time. but now it's like short hand - I can see them fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Initial clues:
CNN and all main media give immediate round clock coverage, with an agenda for what the story is already in place, the agenda will always include a message about how we are supposed to feel and what we want to do about this, and this reaction will be strongly suggested and cultivated for us. often it's about guns. but it can be about voting for increased surveillance, it can be to stir up support for military action abroad or more militarized police here, but whatever it is it's for strengthening those who profit at top and weakening general populous.
      </p>
      <p>
       there will be bad guys -- that are the bad guys right away, no trial to suss out certainty, if there is a trial it's well after public has no doubt of who did it. there will be immediate on line evidence so public can poor over hints of -- oh this man was so bad he was into this , etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       there will be reports of "extremism" and "mental health issues" -- ask what are those things really? it's just undefinable lingo to pin "badness" on constructed "bad guys".
      </p>
      <p>
       motive always incredible vague and much more serving to powers that be to say that was their motive -- than anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       evidence is crap. really try to trace how a thing was proven and how it can be verified, you will run into so many " don't ask that means you don't believe" kind of responses. never ever ever will media provide actual clarity on how the case was solved so assuredly and quickly. tho they may take time to shame anybody who asks for that information/  - . info will always come out as " an image of killer is starting to materialize" we don;t know much but here are all the exact facts of who did it and why. "experts tell us".  and the ever classic "authorities tell us". .....sometimes they manage to name their sources and the story is still fake but when they do not name sources ...100% certainly its fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       spend a long weekend watching you tube videos. google things like "boston bombing hoax" sand hook hoax" "charleston shooting hoax" people have done an amazing job of laying out visual evidence - showing contradictions, impossabilities etc. you don;t have to "believe" anything. but you can give a listen and you might start to see what all the fuss on this side is about

       I used to be a huge conspiracy guy, until people started turning everything into a conspiracy. What purpose would a false flag serve here? None. The Obama administration has bent over backwards to defend Islam. Secondly, this guy was on the NSA watch list and still wasn't caught, further proving that spying on citizens does not prevent terrorism. Not everything is a conspiracy.  There are 8 billion people on this earth and some of them are violent and insane. Hashtag-someofyouarethinkingwaytoomuchintoshit

       Pretty sure none of those things require more blood currently. People are already willingly laying down doing fuckall as all of those things transpire. You make it sound like they have an energized population which is exercising it's democratic rights; which does not exist.

       who says it was US, maybe it was mossad this time.

      <p>
       But what makes you think they haven't done what you said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Madrid bombings, 911 etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       and even as state actors they need ro minimise possibility of it coming out public like Lavon Affair where someone squealed on the israelis planning to bomb US embassy and churches and to blame it on muslims.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you have to compartmentalise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which means you get some lone right wing nutjobs to do the crazy shit, who thinks he's being a patriot by killing to make America wake up to the islamic invasion.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then you blame it on someone else some islamic person, who gets conveniently killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       but that means you have to make sure cctv and everything doesn't exist, amd evidence gets destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that way if the right wing nutjob every starts whistle blowing they either call him a nutjob or simply kill him.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you need to minimise agency staff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't believe me? Watch the bbc documentary operation gladio.
      </p>
      <p>
       which spilled the bean on how Nato and israel did this in Europe for 40 years with nazi agents, and no doubt still are doing with far right extremists.

       People are being absolutely worn down by all these shootings. It's a war of attrition in a way. They're happening so frequently and they're getting so much exposure that people, especially those in the plugged in me-generation, feel that they need to do something about it. Take a stroll through Facebook or Twitter and you'll see more calls for gun control/confiscation than ever. At this rate, it's getting to the point where people are so outraged and these events so frequent and horrible that "common sense" will prove them to be right.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the NSA being inept, couldn't that justify increased surveillance or different methods of "control"? I could see the narrative being something like, "See? Wiretapping isn't enough. We need to do more!" I doubt that people would see the failures of the NSA and then say oh well, anarchy it is then! They'd seek alternative options of "safety".
      </p>

       There are violent and disturbed people in this world, sure. But many of these questions are worth exploring. Under your logic we shouldn't challenge any story, ever, because of the existence of disturbed individuals. That just strikes me as apathy. I don't think there's anything wrong with critical citizens asking good questions. It doesn't mean we're right, but it's better to challenge the narratives and seek more truth than what we're getting from the corporate owned governments and media.

       This takes the American publics attention away from Russia's evidence that NATO using turkey is protecting ISIS and funding ISIS through illegal purchases of oil which is crossing into Turkey to be shipped to Israel. Whilst the west is following this shooting news, the rest of the world is becoming more aware of the US led war on terror being based on more lies to hide corruption.

       I am calling bullshit. Having the ability to think critically has nothing to do with someone else leading the way for you. "People" turning everything into a conspiracy made you shy away from your own ability to smell bullshit?

       I dont know if this was a conspiracy or not so I'm not saying something one way or another in regards to that. But an argument could easily be made that government monitoring needs to be increased or more widespread/in depth, since it didn't save us.

       Gun control is better when it's 'right wing extremists' rather than ISIS. I think there's no motive here for a conspiracy. Islam is just a dangerous thing to believe, that's just a fact.

       Three men in military attire, and one of them start shooting everyone? Skin tone was white, tall, athletic build.

      <p>
       But the report originally said it's a man and woman!

      <p>
       Sarcasm there of course, have any other witnesses reported the three men in military attire? Because there wasn't any report of them being killed.

       The language  she uses seems a little...weird for a civilian. Like how many of your coworkers would know things like assault rifle, semi automatic,  and magazines. I wouls think most people would say gun bullets and shoots a lot. You know what I'm saying?

       I'm sure there have been false flags in the past, but I also think there have been a lot of legitimate shootings calle false flags, and I don't care if some shooting from the 90s was fake or not. Even if it was discovered dit was, the public wouldn't care. Just the existence of Operation northwods should invoke public outrage even now, but it doesn't.

       True. But the best way to hide a few real conspiracies is to spread wacky theories at every opportunity. So it comes down to whether it's possible to pick out the few actually fishy cases from all the disinformation noise.

       I'm not one to really consider this sort of thing but it definitely has me scratching my head. You heard from witnesses and even police themselves that there were DEFINITELY 3 shooters, all seemingly male, then suddenly it's only two?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Farook got name dropped by a witness because he was acting weird at the party, left, then half an hour later the shooters arrived. It still seems very weird to me that everyone was certain there were 3 shooters and then a couple hours after the dust settled it came out that it was only 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even know what to think about the media. I don't look at the media, I don't pay attention to it, and I don't want to support something so heinous as breaking in to the house of a mass murderer that is still under investigation. I haven't looked at any of it.

       Then several HOURS later a middle eastern male-female couple turns up dead and are presumed to be the perps? Something just doesn't add up.

       Well, just spitballing here... what if the men in black were police? I also remember seing footage of police dressed in black running all over the place. Maybe in the confusion...?

       Hopefully this community center place had security cameras rolling and the footage was backed up safely before anyone nefarious was able to seize it all.

       When they had the manhunt for that Donner guy, the police went crazy shooting up anything and everything that looked even remotely like the suspects vehicle, yet they cleaned this thing up in a hurry after killing the two patsies? All over folks thanks for your help.

       I am just hypothesizing here, but, what if creating a state of confusion, with discrepancies and a litany of questions, is exactly what a conspiratorial group want.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more fixated we become on an isolated point, the tendency is that we'd miss the broader implications.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, from reading the comments, I wouldn't say this works toward just one goal... but it's going to be used for all goals and agendas... such as gun control, domestic intel, and racial/religious walking on egg-shells.  It leaves a lot of people in limbo and this state of unsteadiness tips the balance of power back to "them"

       I'm not convinced it's a false flag op.  But it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       very suspicious how it happened shortly after NSA total surveillance ended.  Or they say it ended.
      </p>
      <p>
       My belief is that, like 911, they knew it was coming and they let it happen, to get what they want.  In 2001 they wanted war in the middle east.  In 2015 they want absolute power to surveil everyone all the time.  If I'm right, this attack will be followed by calls for total surveillance.

       Another clue for you all, I actually found a video a nurse recorded in a room with what I would presume to be other nurses in the building as the police were storming it. In the video, it is completely clear that NONE of them have any idea what is going on.. I mean, these men supposedly had heavy rifles(loud guns), and if they did injure and kill the amount of people said in the initial reports, wouldn't there be some screams which would cause chaos and upheaval within the walls of that building? It just doesn't make sense to me that they would be so clueless.. Here's the video:

       I hope this video can be of use.

       I love how they didn't secure the residence and allowed the media in which is really unusual in a police state. So they left that insecure, but they still have secured the parking lot of the building where the shooting took place. All the cars are still there including all the survivors cars, some with minor injuries yet we have not heard from one of them yet? Nothing on social media, expect for the dumb stories like "He told me "I got you" with the pretty latinia girl that I saw get of a bus with no injuries at all and thought, "hmm the media will latch onto that one"

       If we never get any video from inside the facility showing only 2  shooters, the man and woman Pakistani couple, then I just have to wonder if the confiscated video supports the eyewitness accounts of 3 larger build male, fair skinned gunmen.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the surveillance camera video supported the official narrative of the "ISIS Inspired" radicalized Muslim man and woman couple it would have been "leaked" to the media by now. If the video shows 3 male  shooters then it gets "confiscated" and never sees the light of day, sort of like the FBI and DHS confiscating any and all video from  every possible source within a mile of the Pentagon on 9/11.

       Or Sandy Hook. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to see kids or anyone being shot, but there has to be gotta footage of them at least entering the building. I'm not a Truther in that I don't think these events happened, but I just believe we are not getting the actual story.

       I think it's too early. There are always inconsistent statements early on.

       But I also think some of OPs premises are incorrect. CA LEOs have no problem firing into residential areas with little in the way of concern for others.

       As more eyewitness statements come out with supporting or non supporting evidence, we'll know more.

       I had a hard time believing this phenomena - that people get shot and killed in this country and police get called, but don't show up - until I watched 'Snow On The Bluff' (available on netflix) which, while i understand is a recreation of the actual film Curtis Snow made with a camera he stole, i think best depicts the kind of life that the impoverished, disenfranchised are FORCED to live.

       The Bluff is no joke. The movie though is just a depiction of the life. Just like a similar movie made in Las Angeles called Gang Tapes. Movie starts basically the same where a guy robs a tourist family who makes a wrong turn and gets there camera and car stolen.

       I don't have a horse in this race, but I've always wondered why people never consider what another nation state would stand to gain by instigating chaos within our borders. It has been pretty well sussed out that the US has been behind a while host of grey ops in other countries in an attempt to stir up the locals - Arab Spring comes to mind. So why wouldn't other countries do that here? I'm not saying this is the case, but if I were attempting to undermine another government whilst engaging them in economic, cyber and proxy warfare, in an attempt to wrest the Superpower World Champion belt from them, it would be a smart move to do everything I could to destabilize the opposition by supporting (creating?) rebel groups (the new crop of social justice millennials/BLM protestors) as well as equipping terroristic actors to drum up gear amongst the populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these actions serve as a great way of keeping the US government on their heels, looking ineffective as well as prevent them from taking the initiative on a global stage.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...and no, the US (assuming another government has a hand in these attacks) can't call them out on it for fear of initiating WW3 (assuming they could prove it in the first place), at least not until we have the initiative again.

       Yep. I always wondered if that was what happened in Boston - that the Tsarnaevs were just patsies in an FBI sting that was supposed to be defanged at the last minute, a big PR "win," but some listening nation-state swapped fake explosives for real. Kind of wondered if it was a message to us about interfering in Chechnya.

       Oklahoma City is another one that smells a little like a sting gone pear-shaped due to outside influence.

       I always thought they were holding off on pulling one of these is So Cal because too much real crime there already ---- so for locals it's much easier to spot differences with a real and a b.s. event -- maybe that's just what's happening.

       What I cannot seem to understand is, who are these three operatives that executed the false flag? What perspective or lens are they looking at the world through if they are capable of shooting innocent civilians. What type of person would want to serve such an agency that carries out attacks on civilian populations. I want to understand the psychology of the three white attackers. There have been two separate witnesses that say they saw three men dressed in commando gear with all black and guns, leaving the scene.

       We don't know if it was "the government" or just some rogue elements of said government or even elements of a foreign government.  Regardless, same answer.  There are plenty of violent psychopaths out there.  Also people so thoroughly owned mind, body and soul by their handlers that they will do anything ordered.

       Can it be ascertained with certainty that there was a recent nearly identical  training exercise prior to this event? If so that is further evidence because I believe Boston, LAX and other recent events can be proven to have held prior training events also. This is so far beyond the odds of mere coincidence it must too be exploited in the name of truth. I think I heard it was held in this same building in San Bernardino.

       So you're repeating exactly what I was suggesting everyone should do since this incident took place. It's not going to happen. People may want it, but they need actual guidance to achieve this. This is why leadership HAS to exist, because without it, people are lost, even if they know better than to do nothing.

       I honestly have no opinion on this topic in particular, but the more this organized activism stuff comes up the more uncomfortable I get. Im already here, so Im sure the gov knows who I am, and knows I'm just another idiot behind a keyboard, wasting my life. But trying to rise up and also being active on shit like Facebook seems counter productive. There has got to be a better way to reach people with whatever message you have.

       "There has got to be a better way to reach people with whatever message you have." Seems like there ought to be, right?  I'm open to suggestions.  In the meantime I will continue to tell my more intelligent acquaintances how I feel about this event both in person and online.  I don't care if that leads to the intel community monitoring me or whatever; I'd rather risk that than live in fear and/or try to lie to myself about my own gut reaction to this.

       I find it kind of interesting that this happens, and not even a few days later, some 'terrorist' attacks happen in the UK. It kind of reminds me of the events of the Iraq war how the US and UK worked together to invade Iraq. Crazy theory, but what if similar motives here to go back to the middle east?

       I think some of your concerns can be easily explained. First of all, the police may have a less aggressive policy for chasing suspects but this situation involved people that they beleived comitted mass murder and had the potential to do so again. Obviously in this case they were right to eliminate the threat despite typical protocol. Secondly, the authorities could have identified the suspects  before they found their SUV which would have given them the ability to identify their SUV via license plate.

       Just wondering...how are the shooters race identified at all if they were wearing mask? Why is it that it HAS to be white males and no way possible it was 2 goat fuckers? I think there is a lot of shady shit going on with this, but who did it isn't such a mystery.

       You all need to be very clear that the Sandy Hook shooting was not a hoax but this was. The Sandy Hook shooter was an evil monster. These suspects just seem like ordinary people, new parents.
      </p>
      <p>
       San Bernardino is a hoax but Sandy Hook isn't. If everyone says this then the media will have no defense.

       How can you be remotely concerned about facts and evidence? Allow the families to grieve the loss of their loved ones and heal. This process and establishing the ISIS connection should be given precedence. Don't be the boss of your own brain!

       what's REALLY sad is most people could take the last line away,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Don't be the boss of your own brain!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and they'd have this exact feeling;
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't ask about whether or not ALL of the evidence and statements/testimonies add up, this is a tragedy for the families who lost loved ones, and we shouldn't ask questions that might disrupt them getting past this time in their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       facts and evidence are the only things the majority of the public should be considering right now -- yes, leave those families the hell alone right now -- dedicate your time and energy towards something productive, like figuring out what the fuck happened in the first place, not simply accepting it and moving forward with whatever narrative or rhetoric we're told. (in this case)

       Yeah that scenario didn't happen but if you go back to the past 10 incidents like this to happen in the US I guarantee there were large amounts of users here that would up vote posts pointing to the fact that there were no videos/pictures whatever crime scene.. I've been on this sub for about 3 years and I have to stand up here and call bullshit when I see it.. There are some things we can legitimately call fishy but things like this are not included there
      </p>
      <p>
       And why are going the ad hom route? Rather than opposing the ideas I'm staying you just talk bullshit 'ms cleo blah blah making sweeping generalization' you're clearly a retard that can't have a proper debate and challenge their own views

       I called you ms. cleo as a funny way to highlight your seemingly dubious ability to see into our reactions to scenarios that haven't happened yet. I didn't mean it to attack you instead of attacking your arguement, which seems to be about the users of this sub and their reactions. You're saying we have confirmation bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       So i'm observing the media being let into an active crime scene, which is an egregious violation of police protocol, and an unprecedented move, by an elite law enforcement group, against a backdrop of questionable timelines and conflicting reports of number of shooters and motives and a plethora of unanswered questions, and adding up all these factors and saying that what is being told to me isn't what the reality is, only confirms a bias i started out with from the get go?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry but i think you're wrong.

       media members, more and more it seems, have one source semi-distant from any real info, and they run wild with conjecture. it's exciting to the layman who doesn't care much to think more about the given situation or to think critically. People that get blurbs and watch 30 second clips on CNN to recap; they get a jist of a narrative, and then they move on. The media has picked up on the apathy of most Americans and now cater directly to that lack of interest.

       I'm with you.  It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't with a lot of subscribers here.  Show the footage, or aftermath and it's, 'well they're obviously crisis actors! The whole thing is staged!' Don't show the footage or aftermath and it's, 'what do they have to hide?!'  Ironic too that these same people condemn the media for jumping to conclusions while doing the EXACT same thing in calling it a false flag with absolutely zero evidence and just a bunch of speculation.

I appreciate r/conspiracy sometimes tho to always make sure I have a healthy distrust of the government and make sure I never quit questioning things about our world/history/current events.

       I have never visited this sub before this event, and I for one don't see false flags behind every corner.  But the official story here really does not add up.  I am honestly not sure how to take your reaction other than to say, I think you ought to look into this more closely.  The more I read the more I am disturbed.

       It is easier to stage a fake crime scene and let the MSM eat  it up and regurgitate it to the masses, than it is to fake multiple surveillance videos from different sources that support the official story, especially if the surveillance videos show 3 male gunmen like several eyewitnesses have indicated.

       I had a hard time believing this phenomena - that people get shot and killed in this country and police get called, but don't show up - until I watched 'Snow On The Bluff' (available on netflix) which, while i understand is a recreation of the actual film Curtis Snow made with a camera he stole, i think best depicts the kind of life that the impoverished, disenfranchised are FORCED to live.

      <p>
       facts and evidence are the only things the majority of the public should be considering right now -- yes, leave those families the hell alone right now -- dedicate your time and energy towards something productive, like figuring out what the fuck happened in the first place, not simply accepting it and moving forward with whatever narrative or rhetoric we're told.

       Yep. I always wondered if that was what happened in Boston - that the Tsarnaevs were just patsies in an FBI sting that was supposed to be defanged at the last minute, a big PR "win," but some listening nation-state swapped fake explosives for real. Kind of wondered if it was a message to us about interfering in Chechnya.

       Oklahoma City is another one that smells a little like a sting gone pear-shaped due to outside influence.
