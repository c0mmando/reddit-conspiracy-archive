       It's funny how far we have come in the sub.  If we were talking about 9/11, the burden of the argument rests with how much
       <em>
        proof
       </em>
       you have.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Person A:  I think 9/11 was an inside job.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Person B:  Oh yeah?  Show me solid evidence linking the government to these attacks!
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Person A:  Well, I don't have anything solid.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Person B:  Then you have no argument....!
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT, with these mass shootings the burden of proof is unnecessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Person A:  I think these shooting are fake because there is no evidence showing the shooters at the crime scene.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Person B:  Oh yeah?  Why would you wanna see photos of dead people?  Gross.  You don't need to see any of that.  The police said what happened.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Person A: I just want solid proof showing the shooters at least walking on the site before it happened.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Person B:  Nah, we don't need to see anything that.  That's not important anyways......
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these mass shootings never show the shooters on site.  Never.  Don't need to see them shooting the people, but not one video still showing them walking on campus with guns
       <strong>
        before
       </strong>
       it happened?  Not one?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        There were THREE shooters people!!!!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit:
       </strong>

       Wow!  Thanks everyone for your input.  Glad I'm not the only one who remembers three people.

       Found an interesting piece to the BS puzzle.  Found a
       <a href="https://youtu.be/v5uPc-5tIjY?t=102">
        video - skip to 1:40
       </a>
       showing a craigslist ad wanting movie extras in San Bernardino of all places.  They probably have thousands of these because it's near Hollywood, right?  Well, this ad had some interesting requirements and stipulations.  Including, "casual dress, office/plain clothes police attire",  "Waivers upon penalty of perjury must be signed in regards to set location."  This is for a Wednesday shoot, Dec 2nd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can anyone pull a cached version of this ad?  I can't find the original url anywhere to verify its authenticity.

       "Once your faith, sir, persuades you to believe what your intelligence declares to be absurd, beware lest you likewise sacrifice your reason in the conduct of your life. In days gone by, there were people who said to us: "You believe in incomprehensible, contradictory and impossible things because we have commanded you to; now then, commit unjust acts because we likewise order you to do so." Nothing could be more convincing.
       <strong>
        Certainly any one who has the power to make you believe absurdities has the power to make you commit injustices.
       </strong>
       If you do not use the intelligence with which God endowed your mind to resist believing impossibilities, you will not be able to use the sense of injustice which God planted in your heart to resist a command to do evil. Once a single faculty of your soul has been tyrannized, all the other faculties will submit to the same fate. This has been the cause of all the religious crimes that have flooded the earth."

       Not really, Voltaire's opinions were quite in line with those of the
       <em>
        philosophes
       </em>
       of the 'radical Enlightenment'. In some ways, Voltaire was a reactionary, what with his notorious antisemitism and all.

       So does Voltaire's alleged anti-semitism deem all of his other extraordinary qualities null and void? I would agree with OP in that he is ahead of his time in the sense that these truisms aforementioned in the quote still apply today, if not even more so. To me it seems he possessed a near-clairvoyant comprehension of the world around him. So does this alleged anti-semitism, of which Voltaire seemed to be anti-christian and just plain anti-dogmatic in general as well, hold enough merit to be worth mentioning?

       Only if one believes in
       <em>
        Israel Uber Alles

       . Otherwise, Voltaire was an equal opportunity debunker of all things incestuous and stupid like religion and parochial tribalism.

       a) What were these extraordinary qualities? As I said, Voltaire's politics and thought are well in line with those of his society and his fellow
       <em>
        hommes de lettres
       </em>
       . I'm a bigger fan of someone like Bayle, or even Diderot, whose contribution to the progress of humanity through his editorship of the
       <em>
        Encyclopédie
       </em>
       far outstrips any work of Voltaire's.
      </p>
      <p>
       b) Yes, Voltaire's anti-semitism (which isn't alleged, and which is
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/30/books/l-voltaire-and-the-jews-590990.html">
        fairly well-documented and explained here
       </a>
       ) is definitely worth mentioning for two reasons.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         It indicates that we should be suspicious of a position like Voltaire's, which preaches 'reason' and 'tolerance' but enables the exact opposite, that is, suspicion and prejudice. (By no means am I suggesting that reason and tolerance are themselves guilty, only that Voltaire's position of abstract rationalism really was anything but - an excellent explanation for why, although people like to hold up Voltaire as some paragon of wisdom, he never had an original thought and is never taught in philosophy departments.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It is always meritorious to question idols. The greatest enemy of reason is dogmatism, and dogmatism can just as often manifest as the excessive veneration of individuals as it does the excessive deference towards religions. I like to think it is in keeping with the most beautiful and noble sentiments expressed by Voltaire that he would see an attack on him as a good example of the progress of the human spirit.

       According to Einstein, anti-semitism is normal.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The formation of groups has an invigorating effect in all spheres of human striving, perhaps mostly due to the struggle between the convictions and aims represented by the different groups. The Jews too form such a group with a definite character of its own, and anti-Semitism is nothing but the antagonistic attitude produced in the non-Jews by the Jewish group. This is a normal social reaction. But for the political abuse resulting from it, it might never have been designated by a special name."

       The issue is when speech turns into political repression. That's neither right nor should it be "normalized". Nonetheless, Judaists  should be held to the same critiques that all groups are held to and the hypocrisy and outright crimes of individual Jews who act as Jews (such as Netanyahu, Abe Foxman, Dov Zakheim, etc) should be open to public scorn instead of the kid glove treatment given by the larger society. We should be suspicious and intolerant of fuckheads like Bibi and his ilk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tacitus, Cicero, Mencken, Goethe, Proudhon, Marx, Spinoza, Disraeli, Kant...all great thinkers, none of them partial to the Tribe. I think Voltaire's status will survive the post-post-modern era's opinion of him.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, Diderot wasn't exactly a philosemite.

       But the opposite of antisemite isn't philosemite. It's not having prejudice against Jews. Sure, there are good reasons to castigate the Jewish religion. Lots of Jews have done so. But Diderot, to the best of my knowledge, doesn't castigate the Jews themselves, or the Jewish

       Being of Jewish heritage doesn't provide immunity from blind prejudice. At best, you subscribe to an extraordinarily simplified view of the history and character of the Jewish people. Answer this question: if your prejudice really is so well-informed, how is it that reasonable people don't seem to share it? Are we all shills?

       Zionism is an outgrowth of the intersections of Jewish and Christian cultures, and the worst aspects of those cultures to boot. Herzl was an anti-semite in all but name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zionism isn't Judaism and Judaism has very positive points that few Jews or Christians pay attention to (AFAIK, Judaism is the only religion to codify kindness to the stranger, for one). Unfortunately, the parochial nature of much of modern Jewish culture, a culture just as corrupt as the surrounding culture, has created the false equivalence between Zionism and Judaism so that few people can or will bother to tell them apart.

       Your reference to "the predatory tribalism of some Jews" seems to equate such 'tribalism' with Zionism. You're the one that's being dishonest by equating secular Jewish culture with Zionism with 'predatory tribalism'. All you've succeeded in doing is positing a melange of terms with nothing backing them up except vague allusions to 'Jewish' predatory tribalism. What it betrays is an inexcusable intellectual laziness. Instead of doing the difficult work of causal historical analysis, which requires a nuanced account of event, context, and human agency, you take refuge in the scapegoating of one group of people (the tactic of appending 'some' to your argument doesn't really help). As for rationality, we can agree that the number of reasonable people in the world are very few, but those reasonable people don't seem to be on your side.

       Zionism is a form of tribalism, as all nationalism is. Do you actually deny this?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the scapegoating of one group of people
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Christians and Jews are "one group"? There are far more Christian Zionists than Jewish Zionists. Recall my statement that Zionism is a result of Christian and Jewish cultures. It couldn't exist without either element.
      </p>
      <p>
       Herzl's definition of a nation was: "A nation is a historical group of men of recognizable cohesion, held together by a common enemy." This seems to be the wayward course of Zionism this past century. Looking for a common enemy requires scapegoating, so Zionism itself is guilty of what you're throwing around as a defense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I trust that you've read "Rome and Jerusalem" by Hess? He wrote it before political Zionism became an entity and Herzl stated that he read Hess's work, "The Jewish State" wouldn't have been necessary to write. Hess brags about the predatory tribalism of Jewish culture. Was he an anti-semite and "unreasonable" too?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your reason seems to go out the window when critique of Jewish culture is raised, so honestly accusing others of unreason isn't in your domain.

       Again, the crucial problem here is your equation of Jewish culture and Zionism. The fact that you can't see that this is an illegitimate equation is indicative.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for nationalism, I wouldn't exactly accept your formulation - a lot hangs on what we mean by 'tribalism' and it seems to me that this word is so inclusive as to be useless. One could easily decry the conspiratorial mindset that sees Jews (sorry, 'Zionists') lurking behind every corner as an equally pernicious manifestation of 'tribalism'. Nationalism doesn't necessarily have to be 'tribalistic' or exclusionary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really care if you impute irrationality to me. As far as I can see, I've argued in a fairly measured manner. If you feel that I've been attacking you personally or that I've been treating your arguments unfairly, then I apologize. But you'd have to admit that,  other than referring to 'the critique of Jewish culture', you haven't really given any
       <em>
        evidence
       </em>
       to back up your implication that this critique is a worthwhile or legitimate venture.

       I'm not sure how one can deny that much of modern Jewish culture and Zionism have morphed into each other so as to be almost indistinguishable at times. When it comes to Israel, much of secular Jewish culture and religious Jewish culture (minus the anti-Zionist religious Jews) are of one accord.

       I understand the difficulty of being able to to discern it as I had the same problem once upon a time.

      <p>
       I think your own bias is showing here, making it difficult for you to perceive the truth of nationalism in general and Zionism in particular. Nationalism is, by definition, an expanded tribalism that is exclusionary by nature. Throw genetic nationalism into the mix and it becomes exponentially worse.

       a) I have to disagree. Not only is it possible to draw this distinction, it  shows an extreme insensitivity to the nature of culture itself to be unable to draw it. Culture is distinct from (in some ways, opposed to) society, which is in turn distinct from politics. You simply equate 'tribalism' (again, an extraordinarily confused concept) with a concrete political ideology. In this way, you commit the absurdity of equating secular Jewish culture simply with Zionism (what of all the Jewish cultural phenomena that have little or nothing to do with Zionism? What about Yiddishkeit?)
      </p>
      <p>
       b) "Nationalism is, by definition, an expanded tribalism". That's one understanding of nationalism, but by no means is it 'the definition of nationalism', or even the most compelling definition (for example, the authoritative understanding of nationalism in the social sciences is Benedict Anderson's theory of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagined_communities">
        imagined communities
       </a>
       , which doesn't make reference to tribalism). The concrete form of inclusionary nationalism I would point to is
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_nationalism">
        civic nationalism
       </a>
       , which as far as I can see, is fairly influential theory of nationalism, even if, in practice, nations fail to live up to this ideal. I think what really deserves pointing to here is the extent to which the language of tribalism is derived from antisemitic sentiment - your own capitalization of the term 'tribe' in an earlier comment shows to what extent the Jewish people are held up as
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       tribal people people
       <em>
        par excellence
       </em>
       , to the point where the term 'Tribe', as a proper noun, is understood by all as a reference to the Jews. What you need to demonstrate, which you haven't done yet, is that the Jewish people really are more 'tribalistic' than any other people, whether by people we mean an
       <em>
        ethnos
       </em>
       , a nation, or any other type of imagined community.
      </p>
      <p>
       c) Well, again, I'd like to express my remorse if I have offended you or rubbed you the wrong way. I'll try to make my point in an even more measured manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       d) Yes, I've studied Zionism extensively - it is one of my primary research subjects, part of my more extensive research into Judaism and Jewry, which takes up a big part of my time. (Hess wasn't all too unique. Everyone knows he just repackaged the romantic antisemitism of his time and used it as an argument for Zionism. In my opinion, the work of Nordau is much more interesting, seeing as it also involves an extensive wrestling with the question of the 'regenerative' potential of Zionism [which power, it is important to note, was always placed within the context of a larger physiognomy of European decadence]).

       That's an interesting concept.  I prefer to look at Plato.  A true classcial philosophy who still believed that the best form of government was one in which there as a group of philosophers (or elite) that would rule over the commoners.

       Adam Lanza was the Sandy Hook shooter.  Sandy Hook is considered a false flag by some people.  One of the reasons cited is the lack of motive and randomness of the crime.

       Correct me if I am wrong but wasn't Lanza's(sandy hook) and Holmes's (aurora CO) father set to testify in the LIBOR case? Is this actually true cause there isn't a legit source on this. And if there was a legitimate source I must of missed it so please provide if it's out there. This is a smoking gun if I ain't never seen't one. Of course only if it's accurate.

       These prints probably belonged to the guy in cammo pants they caught in the woods.  Would be interesting if these prints were found at all these mass shootings where a mysterious 3rd guy was seen?  Too bad the police keep letting these guys go and all.......

       He was never enrolled and to this day there's no proof he was there the day of the incident. Not one frame from a security camera or a crime scene photo, and not even DNA or fingerprints. There's some who suggest he never existed in the first place.

       There is no conclusive evidence it was the Tsarnaevs.  There were lots of people with bags/backpacks on video.  And the brother that went to trial did say he was innocent.  A friend of the brothers was murdered in his home by the FBI.

       Let me help you out since you seem a little slow tonight.  When the state or the federal government accuses you of committing a crime,   you can either plead Guilty and admit you broke the law and possibly get a more lenient sentence if a plea deal is reached or you plead Not Guilty.  A Not Guilty plea does not necessarily mean "I'm innocent", all it means is the prosecutor must provide enough evidence to prove you committed a crime.  You can actually commit a crime and go to court and put in a not guilty plea and if they don't have enough then the court may find you not guilty.  In the Boston-Bomber case, he tried not guilty instead of a plea deal and guess what the state provided enough evidence that the court found him guilty.

       The evidence against him was overwhelming.  He practically admitted his guilt with his boat message alone.  His best chance was to accept a plea deal to avoid the death penalty.  His defense team strategy was to bring in character witnesses to say he was a good kid and his brother was the driving force behind the massacre.  Without him taking the stand and opening himself up to cross examination, there was no way he was walking out with a not guilty verdict.  There was zero reasonable doubt with all the evidence the prosecution had against him.

       This.  They were probably blackmailed into the driving to some location, probably near where they shot it up.  Told to wait there for further instructions.  The three shooters conveniently drive past them after they shoot the place up in a similar vehicle.  Cops show up and shoot a confused Syed and wife.  Piece of cake.

       By keeping the masses scared you keep them cowed, and unwilling to risk themselves or people they care about in revolt. Then you proceed to protect the herd of scared individuals with the protections you claim they called for regardless of whether they are good for the group or simply consolidate power for the people in charge. Ya know the people who instigated or planned the original event that got everyone scared anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were warned of these tactics, which are older then dirt, by a founding father, "Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety." Benjamin Franklin.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why there are so many attacks of late, always within a few miles of a psyops facility here in the States. (7th psyop group 12th Psyops battallion out of Mtn View in this case most likely)
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally you have a psyop group near to (within 100 miles) of each of the gun violence incidents that made the major news networks in the last couple years, as well as the racial tension incidents.
      </p>
      <p>
       I purpose that these are planned operations meant to divide the American public to keep us from providing a unified front, to keep us from as George Carlin put it "sitting around the dining table realizing how fucked we are."
      </p>
      <p>
       They keep us divided by haves and have nots, by race, by religion and as a result we never put forward the unified effort or have the observational ability as a group to see, the crooked, horrific things they do sometimes in plain sight.

       People were starting to call the Planned Parenthood shooter a terrorist, but the media can't have a white terrorist. So They find something to pin it on brown Muslims.

       lots of people believe it happened just the way the news said it did, but the truly unfortunate thing is that whether or not this attack was real or faked, it will immediately be used as an excuse to call for more gun control, more bombs in the middle east, and more intrusions on privacy and none of these things will solve a single problem. people calling into an npr show yesterday were saying we need to bomb more people in the middle east and the show has a mostly left leaning audience.

       I'm blown away at how all the news media crews were storming the apartment and airing the social security card and photo ID's....  why the fuck would investigators leave shit behind?  Why would they leave shredded papers in the bin?  Why would they not tape up the entire crime scene!?

       They sealed the doors and windows with plywood that even the landlord had trouble removing, if you watch the video.  You think simple crime scene tape would have stopped this if the landlord truly believed it was OK to enter?
      </p>
      <p>
       What's most likely is a error was made in communication and one agency never told the other that they needed to post a guard, and the landlord thought he could make a quick buck letting the newsmedia in.

       I agree with you but the tape would be more of a clear signal (to people like the landlord) of the apartment being off limits as it is a crime scene.  I can't believe how it turned into such a frenzy and so may documents were left behind.

       Hi yoodenvranx,
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure if you were watching the coverage during the "attacks", but for the entire night, they were reporting 3 shooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the OP is pointing out the 3 shooter perspective to say how much things have changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's apparent that things are not what they seem in terms of this so called "possible terrorist" attack.

       I watched the Channel 7 video stream for at least an hour (the part where they extracted the body from the SUV) and at that time there was a lot of chaos. Sometimes they said 2 shooters, then they said 3 shooter. Then there were 3 persons in the car, the next minute it was two. All in all this is just a very very chaotic situation and things will go wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, the one thing I don't understand about this sub: usually nobody in here trust the main stream medias because the media is controlled by (insert your favorite dark force here). But now when it comes to shootings and information like "there were 3 shooters" then suddenly everybody trusts the MSM?
      </p>
      <p>
       This does not make any sense. When you don't trust MSM, why should you suddenly take anything related to the shooting as fact? And if the MSM is under control why would they allowed to broadcast that the truth (assuming that there were actually 3 shooters)?

       So they only said ONCE that there were three shooters?  So if there is evidence it was said more than once on the MSS, that means it WASN'T true, and you'll believe it?

       So does Voltaire's alleged anti-semitism deem all of his other extraordinary qualities null and void? I would agree with OP in that he is ahead of his time in the sense that these truisms aforementioned in the quote still apply today, if not even more so. To me it seems he possessed a near-clairvoyant comprehension of the world around him. So does this alleged anti-semitism, of which Voltaire seemed to be anti-christian and just plain anti-dogmatic in general as well, hold enough merit to be worth mentioning?

       a) I have to disagree. Not only is it possible to draw this distinction, it  shows an extreme insensitivity to the nature of culture itself to be unable to draw it. Culture is distinct from (in some ways, opposed to) society, which is in turn distinct from politics. You simply equate 'tribalism' (again, an extraordinarily confused concept) with a concrete political ideology. In this way, you commit the absurdity of equating secular Jewish culture simply with Zionism (what of all the Jewish cultural phenomena that have little or nothing to do with Zionism? What about Yiddishkeit?)
      </p>
      <p>
       b) "Nationalism is, by definition, an expanded tribalism". That's one understanding of nationalism, but by no means is it 'the definition of nationalism', or even the most compelling definition (for example, the authoritative understanding of nationalism in the social sciences is Benedict Anderson's theory of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagined_communities">
        imagined communities
       </a>
       , which doesn't make reference to tribalism). The concrete form of inclusionary nationalism I would point to is
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_nationalism">
        civic nationalism
       </a>
       , which as far as I can see, is fairly influential theory of nationalism, even if, in practice, nations fail to live up to this ideal. I think what really deserves pointing to here is the extent to which the language of tribalism is derived from antisemitic sentiment - your own capitalization of the term 'tribe' in an earlier comment shows to what extent the Jewish people are held up as
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       tribal people people
       <em>
        par excellence
       </em>
       , to the point where the term 'Tribe', as a proper noun, is understood by all as a reference to the Jews. What you need to demonstrate, which you haven't done yet, is that the Jewish people really are more 'tribalistic' than any other people, whether by people we mean an
       <em>
        ethnos
       </em>
       , a nation, or any other type of imagined community.
      </p>
      <p>
       c) Well, again, I'd like to express my remorse if I have offended you or rubbed you the wrong way. I'll try to make my point in an even more measured manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       d) Yes, I've studied Zionism extensively - it is one of my primary research subjects, part of my more extensive research into Judaism and Jewry, which takes up a big part of my time. (Hess wasn't all too unique. Everyone knows he just repackaged the romantic antisemitism of his time and used it as an argument for Zionism. In my opinion, the work of Nordau is much more interesting, seeing as it also involves an extensive wrestling with the question of the 'regenerative' potential of Zionism [which power, it is important to note, was always placed within the context of a larger physiognomy of European decadence]).
