        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From an acquaintance&#39;s Facebook:</p>

<p>Why do people say the story of the California shooting doesn&#39;t add up?</p>

<p>Eyewitness Sally Abdelmageed told CNN:
&quot;[it was] three men, dressed in all black, military attire with vests on holding assault rifles... I couldn’t see a face, he had a black hat on and uh, from my view all I could see was a black hat and long sleeve shirt… black cargo pants with zippers on the sides, big puffy pockets, he had a huge assault rifle and extra ammo… I just saw three dressed exactly the same…. their skin tone looked white. They looked like they were athletic build. They appeared to be tall.&quot;</p>

<p>Yet four hours later, the police shot: two Pakistanis, one a 90 pound woman with a young baby, California residents in a rented black SUV with Utah plates, the military style assault rifles purchased by an unknown person. Farook attended the same holiday party last year. Since then, his coworkers threw a baby shower for him that included a registry. </p>

<p>His brother, who lived nearby, was in the Navy and earned two medals for his service in &quot;The Global War on Terrorism.&quot;  His brother said the couple wasn&#39;t radical. </p>

<p>At the party this time, Farook was sitting at a table chatting with a co-worker before &quot;disappearing&quot; -- with his coat still on his chair.  They now say there was no argument. </p>

<p>When shot in the mysterious SUV, his tiny wife was wearing fitted shorts above her knees and no head covering. Family says she was always fully covered when she went out. </p>

<p>They are portrayed as Bonnie and Clyde with a young baby. They had a fully stocked fridge with cooked food in Tupperware and pictures of their baby all over the house. Arranged flowers on tables and freshly watered house plants. Baby was left with her grandmother for Tashfeen to make a doctor appointment.  They had both been sick, assuming it was a stomach flu, but she needed a doctor. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why, at this point, it doesn&#39;t make sense. A young mom left her baby to go kill the same people who hosted her baby shower. She allegedly made a FB post pledging allegiance to ISIS on an alias page, then removed it -- at 11 am. The shooting started at 11 am. </p>

<p>CNN states, &quot;Malik made the post on an account with a different name, one U.S. official said. The officials did not explain how they knew Malik was behind the message.&quot;</p>

<p>Who were the victims? They weren&#39;t all white Christians or Jews like one would imagine terrorists would target. Just like the Paris attacks, they were very diverse. The NY Times writes, &quot;He [shared] a cubicle with a friend, Isaac Amianos, a 60-year-old father of three from Eritrea... the two of them spoke Arabic together (Farook learning from Amianos)... The health inspectors came from all over the world... Nwadike was from Nigeria. Others hailed from Vietnam, Iran, Mexico and Colombia... Bullets struck Amianos, Thalasinos and others at Farook&#39;s table. (People he was just speaking with.) A Muslim woman he prayed with was killed.&quot;  Another Muslim was shot multiple times. </p>

<p>Why would a traditional Pakistani Muslim American target these people, his friends, teachers, elders, fellow Muslims?  In California of all places, with all of its other potential targets?</p>

<p>About the &quot;argument&quot; with a co-worker: &quot;Two weeks earlier, [Thalasinos, a Messianic Jew who made anti-Islam FB posts] and Farook argued over whether Islam was a violent religion. Recounting the conversation to a friend, Thalasinos said that Farook insisted his God was peaceful... Thalasinos liked discussing such topics. There was no indication that their interaction was anything out of the ordinary.&quot;</p>

<p>The shooters left before police arrived. Police and media then said they were searching for 3 white males. Then police shot these two, who fit no stated description, around 3 pm, after receiving a tip. The story changed from 3 male shooters to a married couple. </p>

<p>In the car chase, officers fired 380 rounds, and the suspects shot 76 rifle rounds, many from the back of the SUV. By the end, 2 officers had minor injuries, apparently not worth mentioning. </p>

<p>The ammo, pipe bombs, etc., were found in their townhouse&#39;s garage. The garage was in a building separate from their home. A few minor items in the house. And a manhole in their closet ceiling. </p>

<p>And no one who knew them, including their many siblings and mother who lived with them and Navy brother who lived close by, saw anything strange.  Neighbor said they were happy. Smiled at her.  Farook would leave the garage door open as he worked on his car. Last saw them hanging out on their patio on Sunday with their daughter, enjoying their family. </p>

<p>Journalists entered their house, within 48 hrs, to rummage through their belongings. An unprecedented event. Any more evidence for or against this deceased couple, now unusable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is all to further the violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism prevention act that they tried before.  It was a thought crimes bill to mark anyone who views material related to anti-american sentiment.  Making illegal more or less to show sympathy with any movement that is unpatriotic.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Radicalization_and_Homegrown_Terrorism_Prevention_Act_of_2007">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Radicalization_and_Homegrown_Terrorism_Prevention_Act_of_2007</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued a statement saying: &quot;Law enforcement should focus on action, not thought. We need to worry about the people who are committing crimes rather than those who harbor beliefs that the government may consider to be extreme.&quot;[42]</p>

<p>The National Lawyers Guild and the Society of American Law Teachers issued a joint statement opposing the Bill: &quot;The National Lawyers Guild and the Society of American Law Teachers strongly urge the Senate to refuse to pass the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007.&quot;</p>

<p>The Center for Constitutional Rights opposes the bill.[43]</p>

<p>The John Birch Society wrote in an Action Alert: &quot;the legislation could attack First Amendment rights by mandating the government to clamp down on free speech online, among other things.&quot;[44]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reminds me of Oklahoma City in this regard. Not Terry Nichols, because he was at his home. But the day of, they were on the lookout for two men who were both seen by multiple people in the truck. I believe law enforcement even publicly announced they were still looking for the second guy after they got McVeigh. Then... nothing. &quot;Oops.&quot;</p>

<p>Convenient that the security footage from across the street is is &quot;lost&quot; forever. I don&#39;t even think they brought it to court when they did know where it was. Which is totally normal, you know, to not use definitive photographic evidence in a murder case.</p>

<p>This thing reeks. And we&#39;ll never know exactly what we&#39;re smelling. Only that we smelled it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As the scene was unfolding, they had an entire neighborhood on lockdown after &quot;the SUV&quot; where the two were allegedly gunned down.</p>

<p>It was all over the news, live - literally hundreds of law enforcement scouring the entire neighborhood for a &quot;third shooter&quot; for hours. They had analysts come on explaining what a dire situation it was to have a third gunman on the loose in a neighborhood of people. They were worried about another hostage situation occurring in someone&#39;s house and concerned about not finding him before sundown. Anchors on CNN and MSNBC were commenting on how it was &quot;eerily similar to Watertown&quot;, in which the Boston Bomber suspects fled through Massachusetts and the authorities lined the streets like an invasion looking for him all day and night. It was the same thing here - but it just... stopped with no mention.</p>

<p>Then just nothing. The next day, it&#39;s just these two killed at the SUV and nothing was ever mentioned about the whole affair.</p>

<p>Then the entire nation&#39;s media literally pried open Farook&#39;s apartment with a crowbar and ransacked the entire place on live television.</p>

<p>Have you ever looked at shredded documents?  Suppose you look in and see some parts of a mastercard logo or a Visa logo.  What are you more likely to take first, what is probably someone&#39;s shredded junk mail or a computer?  They boarded up that place so good a landlord had trouble opening it.</p>

<p>Let that sink in.  A landlord, whose job it is to fix his tenants houses, had to be helped to open it.  </p>

Clearly, any document that a terrorist thought was worth shredding is going to be of the utmost interest to the FBI.

<p>Thats probably because it had been gone through by the authorities.  They usually don&#39;t put everything back in place for you.  I mean, it makes the most sense that when they were searching they threw everything onto the nearest flat surface so that multiple people could look at it and decide if they needed to take it right now.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And yet you&#39;re ignoring how his co-workers ID&#39;d him as the shooter.  His brother-in-law claimed that he wasn&#39;t radical but was simply a &quot;bad person.&quot;  That he reached out to an Al-Qaeda affiliated group.  The tactical gear described by the woman just happens to be the same gear he was wearing when killed by police.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not trying to dismiss the witnesses account, but how close was she to the shooters.  Were all three shooters in her field of vision at the same time?  If you&#39;re going to scrutinize a situation like this, then you have to scrutinize even those who support your argument to give them credibility.  I&#39;m not ruling out 3 shooters, but until video footage shows 3 people or the ballistics analysts identify three different rifles or the investigators find evidence to support three shooters otherwise there&#39;s no reason to accept her account as gospel.  You can post it over and over, but until you substantiate it with evidence, it doesn&#39;t make it true.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t noticed, terrorists operate that you either accept their version of Islam or die.  Go look at the middle east and Africa; the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, ISIS, Boko Haram, etc. all have no problem killing their fellow muslim brothers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>edit: there are some other pictures where he look more brown-ish than in the pics I linked below. Not sure what is actual skincolor looks like.</p>

<p>edit 2: anyone has any <em>reliable</em> information on this?</p>

<p>The other thing they ignore is the &quot;but they said the shooter had white skin&quot;. If you look at the shooter you can see that he was definitively not the most brown person ever.</p>

<p>For example in this image which shows him dead on the ground he looks quite white-ish: </p>

<p><a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/04/20/2F10A4EB00000578-3345982-Bloody_aftermath_The_lifeless_body_of_gunman_Syed_Farook_with_hi-m-16_1449261008031.jpg">http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/04/20/2F10A4EB00000578-3345982-Bloody_aftermath_The_lifeless_body_of_gunman_Syed_Farook_with_hi-m-16_1449261008031.jpg</a></p>

<p>Also there is a picture in this article that shows that he looks quite white:</p>

<p><a href="http://ktla.com/2015/12/03/san-bernardino-shooter-syed-farook-apparently-radicalized-sources/">http://ktla.com/2015/12/03/san-bernardino-shooter-syed-farook-apparently-radicalized-sources/</a></p>

<p>(The small one half way down with the text: &quot;A family member confirmed that Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, is seen in this photo obtained by KTLA.&quot;)</p>

<p>Also on this page he looks quite white:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.people.com/article/san-bernardino-suspects-left-baby-with-grandmother-during-shooting">http://www.people.com/article/san-bernardino-suspects-left-baby-with-grandmother-during-shooting</a></p>

<p>There are also some picture of his wife and it does not look like that she is that brown either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the skin issue is probably more of an indication that she was some distance away from the shooters.  From a distance without any very stereotypical characteristics to go off of, I would guess that the overwhelming majority of people (if not all) could really only describe someone at a distance as being white vs black.  Especially in this scenario where the shooters are covered head to toe in tactical gear.  Looking at the picture of the dead body, you can see his arms (and based on her description and other witness they had some sort of head gear on) which means she&#39;s trying to identify someone based on a little of bit of exposed skin .  It&#39;s not like she saw their faces and could possibly identify them as middle eastern.  So without an obviously dark complexion, I can understand why she described them as white. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You see, that is the problem though.  There will never be video of the incident inside the complex.  If there is, which I highly doubt, it will be redacted or only show one or two shooters.  The third shooter paradigm will eventually fade out of existence, never to be questioned again.  </p>

<p>Same old story, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Edit: After your downvote I went back and read your post again, just to make sure I was understanding what you were saying.  Basically you believe the eye witness testimony when it comes to them id&#39;ing the shooter but not when it comes to the number of shooters?  Makes sense.  You are spreading all kinds of unsourced misinformation.</p>

<p>... I have no idea where this witness was relative to the chaos.  It&#39;s worth noting her clothing description seems accurate based on the photo of Farooks body the street.  She clearly is a credible witness but that doesn&#39;t mean her recollection is 100% accurate either.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that the 3 people originally reported as the shooters are any of the same people found in the vehicle. That sounded more like a professional hit team. If it were a team they could have been in and out in time to blend in with the rest of the onsite forces.</p>

<p>That leaves the couple with the baby. They were fleeing for some reason. I don&#39;t think they were even aware of the hit on the workplace. For all we know they could have been packed into a van and told to leave.</p>

<p>The fact that the house was sacrificed in such a risky manner points to the fact that they wanted to burn any real investigation. Being that the landlord opened the place up and let the media in makes me wonder if he might know more than he&#39;s letting on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This story is ridiculous. I feel like these events are a continuing set of tests. They of course desensitize us to these terrible events and we begin to ask fewer and fewer questions but now though... it&#39;s as if they don&#39;t even care to make it look good or make sense. They know that the media is 100 percent controlled and they will just &quot;make do&quot; with whatever we give them. They are trying to see how weak a story they can get by with.</p>

<p>These are tests of our complacency and control.</p>

<p>Even with all this clear and present fuckery... the media asks for no answers. No video of the shooters. No descriptions that matched the alleged shooters.</p>

<p>Why was it possible for a fucking news reporter to be going through personal pictures of the deceased woman, as well as holding her drivers license up to the lens so everyone watching at home could see it.</p>

<p>Where were the FBI agents? I&#39;ll tell you where they were. They were drinking coffee somewhere. They said &quot;Fuck it. Let&#39;s call call this one in today. Shooting up a generic black SUV should be enough.&quot;</p>
