But I honestly like to watch his show, I think he&#39;s funny and I want a mainstream person exposing the nwo but it does seem to good to be true. 
Does anyone have definitive proof of him being a shill or have any thoughts on him? It&#39;s been bothering me for a while. Thanks </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Truther&quot; is a derogatory term created by the linguistics division of the CIA to undermine both the concept of &quot;Truth&quot; and the 9/11 movement. If you buy into all the term, I gotta ask: Why are you even in this thread? </p>

<p>As for doing anything hypocritical, sure -- we all have. But I&#39;m not on a media-granted pedestal telling others what to do, I&#39;m not a self-proclaimed hero of all that&#39;s good and right. I also provided you with a link to literally hundred of Limbaugh&#39;s lies, which you&#39;ve completely ignored. </p>

<p>Additionally, a lot of what you write here is inarticulate, I don&#39;t really know what you&#39;re saying -- &quot;And good I&#39;m glad got will, the one hit wonder.&quot; -- no idea what that means.  </p>

<p>I do take your point about open discourse to heart, but I also think it&#39;s totally possible you&#39;re trolling me to waste my time, which I&#39;m not interested in. Read the Politifact link and tell me how many lies you think Limbaugh&#39;s told. If you tell me &quot;none,&quot; then we really have no open discourse to pursue. </p>

<p>Thank you for your response. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m sure rush has lied, I only recently had drive time where limbaugh is one and he seems alright. I&#39;m not really invested in it so I believe you. And that was a typo. It&#39;s supposed to be I&#39;m glad for will, the one hit wonder because it seems thats the only thing he&#39;s ever done. And I say truther because it&#39;s easier to type than conspiracy theorist or super smart non sheeple truth seekers or whatever you want to be called.
All I want to know is what does jones do. Does he completely lie, does he try to incite violence, does he say the truth but leaves out the perpetrators? Basically, I just want to know if I should stil listen to him with a grain of salt or just completely stop. I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re trying to say I don&#39;t belong here? My life goal since I got to college and started taking polisci is to expose the truth and Alex jones tbh have sent me to a lot of truth as I research what he says and most is true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK. Thanks for your civil reply.</p>

<p>I think Jones, as others have pointed out, is a &quot;Gatekeeper.&quot; He mixes truth with lies. It may be to keep himself alive, but I doubt it. If you&#39;re digging into The Secret History of this planet, you could do worse than Jones, but you could do a lot better. </p>

<p>If you are really digging, seeking, wanting to know, the best person who cuts to the esoteric truth of what&#39;s happening is Mark Passio. But he&#39;s digging into it from a spiritual and multi-dimensional sense, not the material world in which we live. </p>

<p>If you want to dig into the material world conspiracies of power and corruption and control, I recommend the work of the late, great Dave McGowan (&quot;Programmed to Kill&quot; and &quot;Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon,&quot; among others) and Nick Bryant (&quot;The Franklin Scandal&quot;). </p>

<p>Dig into Skull &amp; Bones, the Yale secret society, and the work of Kris Mililgan. </p>

<p>And you know what else? You should pray. Pray for guidance, pray for WISDOM (not knowledge, WISDOM) and that the things you learn -- and you WILL learn them, believe me -- do not corrupt you. </p>

<p>Best wishes and best of luck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the info but I just want to give this little side note. I was researching on the demonic side of the elite and there encounters with satan an fallen angels and I started to think for only a moment &quot;what if I joined these people, got whatever I wanted, ruled the earth&quot; then I became sick to my stomach. Your comment about not letting it corrupt you is spot on.  I was a hardcore atheist that actively shit on religion. Soon after listening to Alex jones I did my own research and found we are up against actual, literal, pure evil and started to move towards christianity. We are fighting something so insidious and we as humans have become so morally bankrupt that there is no stopping it. In my heart of hearts, I believe satan is coming in my life time(I&#39;m 20) whether it&#39;s through AI, dna splicing or he just comes to our world. What sealed it is that the mark of the beast was literally being put into the right hand as revelations stated. Just remember christ said, &quot;All those that hate me, Love death&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The anti-Christ may or may not be coming in our lifetime, but I can assure you the assholes pulling the strings, the &quot;evil that rules but does not control,&quot; sure wants you to think it is. </p>

<p>People have been predicting the Final Battle for aeons. So far everybody&#39;s been wrong, so the odds are against you. That said, the signs sure seem to be nigh, I agree. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s not our call. For all we know, humanity is on the cusp of great change for the better, and we&#39;re going to have a couple hundred years of an improved earth before we fuck it all up again. A thousand years is nothing to the universe, not even a speck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you just throw in &quot;avoided taxes&quot; as if it&#39;s supposed to demonize him, lol?</p>

<p>Bwa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!</p>

<p>(Really? You think the IRS is a legitimate organization? You do realize they&#39;re a private collection agency. They&#39;re as legit and on the level as the Federal Reserve.)</p>

<p>Your character assassination attempt accused Cooper of being &quot;deceitful&quot;. You want to see REAL deceit? Check out the IRS. They&#39;re con-men who seize funds from people&#39;s accounts who&#39;ve committed no crimes. They&#39;ve been doing it left and right lately. One business owner fought them and had her money returned. See here: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141214/11540529440/irs-drops-its-asset-forfeiture-case-against-owner-small-cash-only-restaurant.shtml">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141214/11540529440/irs-drops-its-asset-forfeiture-case-against-owner-small-cash-only-restaurant.shtml</a></p>

<p>Another business owner had over $100,000 stolen from his account. See here: <a href="http://dailysignal.com/2015/05/11/the-irs-seized-107000-from-this-north-carolina-mans-bank-account-now-hes-fighting-to-get-it-back/">http://dailysignal.com/2015/05/11/the-irs-seized-107000-from-this-north-carolina-mans-bank-account-now-hes-fighting-to-get-it-back/</a></p>

<p>You have any evidence of Bill Cooper stealing from people?</p>

<p>Because I have tons of examples of the IRS doing it.</p>

<p>So you shouldn&#39;t invoke the word &quot;deceit&quot; and compare the IRS to Bill Cooper. That&#39;s not a contest the IRS is going to win.</p>

<p>If it involves the Money Powers, the US government, the policing powers and the media, it is a conspiracy. Those that seek and hold political worldly power are conspiring by definition.</p>

<p>I could totally even believe that there are other intelligent species native to our solar system either on earth or elsewhere. Cooper mentioned in his book sightings of craft entering and leaving water. I am not opposed to a underwater or subterranean advanced civilization that secretly controls us plebs on the surface.

    <div class="md"><p>Who do you listen to for news. I mean I love talk radio in general and Alex really was funny to listen and informative. From quick research and accepting the info Alex is following the cointelpro methods of dividing the base and inciting violence and craziness to marginalize the group, radicalize them and break them up. I&#39;ll probably continue to listen but it sucks because he&#39;s working for the other tean. On a side note tho what WILL work? Peaceful things and spreading info will clearly not work. What is there to do</p>

It is not forced but a state everyone must achieve through their own thoughts. The new world order that would be made by the elites is simply the Devils work</p>

<p>For reasons of self-preservation, greed, lust, blackmail or madness, he is no longer an asset for enlightenment. </p>

<p>That&#39;s because &quot;we&#39;re&quot; actually winning, or at least making significant inroads. I literally knows at least 25 people who used to think I was a fringe thinker, but now question everything they read and see.</p>

<p>Cable TV/Satellite TV subscriptions continue to fall, especially among the educated. It&#39;s a heyday for alternative media, which is why the intelligence communities are working overtime to infiltrate and toss (Operation) CHAOS shit our way. </p>

<p>The best thing I&#39;ve heard recently was from a friend of mine who quoted the pastor of his church:</p>

<p>&quot;Evil Rules this world. But it does not control it.&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone should remember that. This is a fight that&#39;s been going on forever, nobody ever wins and nobody gets out of here alive and none of us are supposed to. The key is to get off this rock and on to the next phase of existence, whatever that it. </p>

<p>But Alex Jones? His time has passed, at least as a relevant communications force. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it is extremely complex but people were pretty patriotic and gung-hoe imperialism until the bailout. People lost hope and trust in the government when they allowed so many people to lose their houses while the banks got massive capital injections. IMO it was what began waking people up. When Kodak and all of those companies went under and the country was hemorrhaging jobs they didn&#39;t do anything to stop it. Anyone who was effected by the handling of the last financial crisis came out of it 1. not trusting banks and 2. not trusting the government. If you talk to the average person they will straight up tell you how fucked they think everything is. It is not like it was before where you would talk to them and they would think everything is good and rosy up on the hill. The problem is the average person feels powerless to the corruption and has a difficult time articulating their disapproval. This is why we see so much identity politics that people latch on to. They do not understand the TPP because they don&#39;t have time. The feeling of powerlessness actually plays into the power of the elite. When we do nothing we acquiescw to their will. </p>

<p>This could also explain the increasing apathy among the population. I bet 35% or less even vote in 2016. </p>

<p>If Trump or Sanders ends up on the ballot, you will see a shit-ton higher voter turnout than 35%. </p>

<p>If it ends up a Bush/Clinton race, we may well see only 35% -- but we may also see a third party entrant, and if that happens, and then all bets are off on turnout. </p>

<p>You might also look into Operation Mockingbird, a CIA operation to infiltrate and influence and corrupt the media. They claim it&#39;s been shuttered, but anyone who reads/sees the &quot;news&quot; knows that&#39;s bullshit. I&#39;ve little doubt Limbaugh is a top level Mockingbird asset. </p>

He&#39;s not inciting violence like Alex jones. I mean I just don&#39;t want to live a life of thinking everything is a conspiracy.

<p>&quot;Evil rules the world, but does not control it.&quot;</p>

<p>And no, not everything is a conspiracy. But many more things have conspiratorial roots than society realizes. </p>

<p>I will offer you this, though: We may not all worship Satan, but what is worshipped in this country, more than anything else? What drives and motivates the majority of the people? MONEY. It&#39;s even got a &quot;In God We Trust&quot; statement on it. So we may not be worshipping Satan, but we&#39;re sure worshipping the golden calf. </p>

<p>I will add that as I&#39;ve dug into all this stuff, I&#39;ve come to realize that there are conspiratorial forces for Good as well as evil. Pray about it...you might find an unexpected new connection in the weeks to come. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe he would push back hugely against PC culture and pussification, he would restore our military to a powerful spot and undo the purge of top officials by obama, he would secure our borders and slow immigration, his tax plans seems to promote growth and would bring trillions into the us, I also believe his management skills would be key to controlling the beuracracy. Based on the info he is trying to bring forward like hehe global warming scam, 9/11 and Hillarys shit I think he is the best</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably not but I just don&#39;t see a lot of the rumors in action. I just want to know his motivations. Is it to outright lie? To make truthers discredited? I mean it seems to me that if jones was working for the new world order then all he says is probably true and it&#39;s actually much WORSE than what it seems </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fine if you believe that. I bet you he wins in a landslide as someone of the people. I mean people are begging for someone to save them from the nwo whether they know it or not.
