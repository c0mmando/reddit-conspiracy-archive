    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s <em>not</em> about &#39;taking away the guns&#39;. It&#39;s impossible to disarm all of America; TPTB know this and so does anyone with a modicum of common sense. What it&#39;s about is, &#39;Strategy of Tension&#39;, and, &#39;Divide and Conquer&#39;. Let your average schlub <em>think</em> the Government is going to take away his guns, therefore pissing him off and making him hold on to them even tighter. At the same time, make the other side think the Government is <em>trying</em> to take away the guns, making them angry that nothing is being done.  Then, you have two sides that are bitter enemies, and also stressed to the max over the issue. (Don&#39;t get me wrong, if the Government <em>could</em> take away the guns, they would. But it&#39;s not possible.)</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>If the government could take away the guns, they would.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to disagree with you there. First off, the government can basically do whatever the fuck it wants; You can&#39;t stop a missile from hitting your house, no matter how ridiculously well armed you are for a civilian.</p>

<p>There is absolutely nothing you can do against a man in heavy body armor, even with a shotgun or heavy rifle (barring larger ammo types) and even if you <em>did</em> happen to have a .50 or .95 caliber weapon, you would just be blown up or shot before you made any conceivable battlefield progress. You can stop a car or a man with a large enough bullet, but can you stop more cars and men than you have bullets for? That&#39;s even under the assumption that the government doesn&#39;t <em>know</em> you have it before the fight even starts.</p>

<p>The gun control issue is very controversial because the people wanting to take the guns are genuinely sympathetic to people harmed by them, and gun owners do not want to give up their property rights. It&#39;s just another &quot;issue&quot; that is irrelevant and meaningless that is pushed to the front by the media because they don&#39;t want anyone to talk or care about, say, the vast disparity between ALL violence related deaths (&lt;3%) and deaths from cardiovascular disease and cancers (A combined &gt;40%).</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not ban Wendy&#39;s, McDonalds (etc.), Big Pharma, lab-born poisons (&#39;cides), let&#39;s ban GUNS, which kill ten times fewer people than any of those things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question is whether they are trying to do a plan and are thwarted, or the increased gun sales IS the plan.</p>

<p>I&#39;m old enough to know that the only reason no guns laws are being passed right now is because of EXTREME pushback.  Back in the 90&#39;s, when there was no pushback, they were banning all kinds of shit, including guns based on their scary cosmetic appearance.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m not sure which way it goes right now.  I know leftists are stuck in a mental rut and repeat their patterns like some kind of wind up toy-- if it worked in the 1930s, they run the same pattern now.  So it&#39;s hard to visualize them as having adapted to a new paradigm as recent as the 2000&#39;s.  They will likely be clucking gun-control-gun-control-gun-control as pure stimulus/response in the year 3,000.  </p>

<p>But anything is possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, this is the problem with the left and socialism-- an utter inability to change and adapt to the environment.</p>

<p>World has changed so everyone is freelancing and steady jobs don&#39;t exist?  Keep tax policies, union policies, and social security policies from 1940.</p>

<p>World has changed so everyone is in danger from militants and sleeper cells from around the world?  Keep pressing for gun policies from the 1940s.</p>

<p>In 20 years we&#39;ll have driverless cars and you&#39;ll still be squealing about everyone should have to take driver&#39;s ed.  Because, you know... 1940.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, &quot;they&quot; could be playing the long game. This current generation may buy more guns, but the children growing up now will be inundated by messages that guns are bad, only crazies use guns, guns only result in mass shootings. And since citizens in a growing number of places are very much neutered in terms of open or concealed carry, the majority of gun incidences will end up being mass casualities by a crazy as opposed to an equal firefight between a crazy and able-bodied citizens.</p>

<p>Once this idea is drummed into the next generation&#39;s heads, outright gun bans an collections will be very, very possible.</p>

<p>This makes me think...is it possibly all these mass shooting occur in gun-free zones because &quot;they&quot; don&#39;t want to run the risk of return fire? Showing that guna can be used for defense?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with that. Out of all the people I know who&#39;s parents own guns I know maybe 2 people that are against guns, and I live in Southern Texas, pretty much everyone here owns guns. People who grow up around guns, generally, aren&#39;t swayed by anti-gun propaganda. Shooting guns is a family activity for most gun owning people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it&#39;s a location/region thing. Ot I could just be totally be wrong, too :)</p>

<p>It seems to me that it&#39;s the non gun-enthusiast families that would be swayed the most at first. Where the parents might have moderate views, the children would grow up anti-gun or at least fearful of them. Then it becomes a popluation numbers game until the fearful children outnumber and outvote the reasonable ones.</p>

<p>But you could be right, perhaps Americans won&#39;t give up their heritage quite so easily. I&#39;m worried though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely agree with that now that you clarify, and I also think it is a cultural thing. I personally don&#39;t believe that guns are the issue, I think it has more to do with mental health/how people are raised. I grew up around guns, and they are an important factor in how I became the person I am today. For me it was a tool my father used to instill responsibility.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not for gun control, however I think that guns shouldn&#39;t be sold to anyone with a history of mental issues, i.e. depression, until they are cleared by a doctor. I understand this system would end up being abused, but I think it would be beneficial over all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since the shooter was in contact with individuals that the FBI were &quot;investigating&quot; it looks damn suspicious, and what about the suspect who bought them their semi-automatic weapons, will we see anything else about that? </p>

<p>When will <em>they</em> give up on running these type of black-ops, that pick out disturbed people then shepherd them and ride them, goad them on, and observe them (sometimes supply them) and then let them go ahead with the evil deed, to realize some sick and twisted agenda to rally and herd the collective consciousness in a certain direction. It&#39;s a disgrace. I could be wrong, but it appears to have all the hallmarks of another sick black-op and useless slaughter of innocents that probably could have been easily prevented. I think there may be very dark ritualistic aspects to these things, like some sort of blood sacrifice who&#39;s design it is to somehow harness evil power and direct a historical course or cause on the back of it. You just have to watch very closely the immediate reaction of the MSM and authorities to discern the agenda involved, which in this case would involve an increase in surveillance activity, an increase in the militarization of the police and further integration between the police and the intelligence apparatus while at the same time pushing the gun control meme, and ignoring the deeper systemic problems, including the evil lurking in the shadows around these events. If there is an objective observer ie: God, then woe to those shadowy operators who place themselves into an entangled mess of their own making by helping to facilitate the work of the devil. </p>

<p>Why not angle for what&#39;s right and that serves the common good instead of this march towards a hidden fascism and the eventual rise of a police state as if the people are the enemy of the government who must have more and more &quot;power&quot; to protect and serve or is it to serve and protect..? And who&#39;s protecting who from who? Who are the real terrorists?</p>

<p>What ever happened to individual civil liberty as the cornerstone and the drive to a continual improvement in the health and well being of a Civil Society? Why opt instead for the kind of thing that nothing of any value or substance can be founded on, then operate as if it&#39;s the turning point and central plot in some sort of drama where no one can tell the good guys from the bad (we&#39;re supposed to assume it&#39;s just terrorism by radical Muslims of course, with guns) and everything gets turned upside down to the way it ought to be? It&#39;s just so unnecessary and unhelpful to an authentic cause of Truth and Justice, Love and Liberty according to an authentic model of Leadership that&#39;s willing to be patient and even suffer a bit for the cause of what&#39;s right and loving (think Jesus as the model). </p>

<p>There, i said what i needed to say, and although it may appear crazy and whacked out, it&#39;s not. There&#39;s more going on with many of these events than meets the eye at first glance and it sickens me to see the authorities read it, then run with it, as to it&#39;s design and intent and become a mouthpiece for the wicked as if it was handed to them on a silver platter overflowing with blood, not unlike Bush Jr. in the wake of 9/11, although that was on another scale. </p>

<p>What a sick sick, twisted and evil way to &quot;govern&quot; by crisis after crisis, as if out of man-made chaos, man can weave order. It&#39;s just bad philosophy and it doesn&#39;t pass muster as they say in the military. </p>

<p>Everyone must try their very best in search of the good. Evil black ops only make for a useless slaughter and undermine everything that&#39;s worthwhile in this life. </p>

<p>I only hope that the good guys outnumber the bad and that they get to the very bottom of this heinous bullshit and root it out of the system at it&#39;s source. The time of the dark arts is at an end. It accomplishes nothing and serves nothing and no good comes out of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe there might have been a few, but not all. I think that it&#39;s a sign of society&#39;s fabric unraveling. It&#39;s not gonna just rip apart overnight, it&#39;s gonna start fraying at the edges first. Civil unrest is pretty standard in times like these, this neo-feudal age. The people cannot see past the smoke and mirrors, but they know that they are discontent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is &#39;spose to be <em>slick</em> &amp; for most people, the MSM is all they&#39;re gonna pay attention to. that makes me kinda sad. i have no problems with &#39;gun control&#39; but let&#39;s be realistic about it. during the news blast about the shooting i received a call asking for donation for gun control. </p>

<p>was surprised i would get a call <em>while</em> all this shit is happening. i felt like: dayymm, couldn&#39;t even wait <em>one</em> more day.</p>

<p>the American people are being &quot;played&quot; &amp; have been for-<em>ever</em>. if anything could&#39;e been done about gun control i think it would have; obviously some people have other plans how things should play out.</p>

<p>the scenario they want is bad for everybody.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what extent our government is involved in planning these attacks but at the very least I think our establishment is creating an atmosphere that breeds these kind of attacks. Kinda like our foreign policy. No one can be positive yet that ISIS is an Israeli/U.S. proxy army but what we can be sure of, is that if they aren&#39;t, then we definitely created the atmosphere for their &quot;cause&quot; to gain traction in the region. </p>

<p>What is really curious is how the last 2 majorly reported shootings (San Bernardino and Colorado Springs) happened the same days that Russia released major news on Turkey buying ISIS oil and that oil being smuggled through Turkey and into Israel. From what I understand, it has been confirmed that Turkey was/is supporting ISIS financially but I&#39;m not sure about the Israel thing. I just saw this article today and haven&#39;t had time to find a corroborating source. Also I trust Russia&#39;s media about the same as I trust ours (not much), so there&#39;s that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gun laws are one of many reasons why these false flag attacks keep happening.  I think alot of people on this subreddit acknowledge this. You see threads pointing out crisis actors and drills all of the time. </p>

<p>Other than gun laws here are some of the other other reasons why these false flag attacks continue to happen; fear, gun lobbying both for and against guns, new even harsher control mechanisms, new drugs meant to prevent any sort of violent outbreak, and many many more reasons why it helps control us.</p>
