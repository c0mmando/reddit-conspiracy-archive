    <div class="md"><p>Well if you want to look at it that way, yeah.  But I was referring to the derogatory &quot;terrorism&quot; label that has been applied (erroneously) to a number of modern Christian groups.</p>

<p>If we want to talk about historical Christian terrorism, that&#39;s a bit of a different topic.  An interesting one, though.  As far as I can tell, it began with Constantine.  Since him, the Christian faith has largely functioned as a continuance of the Roman empire (with some splintering here and there, none of which has interrupted the functional aspects of perpetual war and empire).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>honestly... this is part of the reason you guys get made fun of so much...</p>

<p>stop with the &quot;drill&quot;.</p>

<p>do you know how often &quot;drill&#39;s&quot; are done within military/police/fire/rescue? it&#39;s nearly constant. it&#39;s a way to justify the absurd spending and taxation they subject us all to.</p>

<p>it&#39;s a consequence of the way budget spending is figured...</p>

<p>lets say i run a department, and last year we spent 100k. i am &quot;allowed&quot; to increase my budget by a certain percentage each year. <strong>but</strong> the second i don&#39;t spend the entire budget, they cut me the next year. so it&#39;s advantageous for anyone in government to not only spend their budget, but exceed it each year. this way they can justify increasing their budget next year...</p>

<p>once you get that money appropriated to you, you have to find a way to spend it... so you buy all sorts of cool toys/gear and pay a bunch of overtime to your boys in the department for training. they constantly run drills to justify their spending... constantly.</p>

<p>saying &quot;OMG THEY WERE RUNNING DRILLS&quot; is like saying &quot;OMG THEY WERE ALL WEARING SHOES&quot;.</p>

<p>it&#39;s not a coincidence, it&#39;s not a conspiracy, it&#39;s just the reality of tax and spend unionized government waste.</p>

<p>this building is huge, it&#39;s owned/operated/funded by the government, it has a ton of rental space and a lot of parking...</p>

<p>it&#39;s ideal for running exercises like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In this case, there seem to be similarities between  the two shootings.  For example, the Muslim shooters were angry and shot at a bunch of people.  The Colorado shooter was angry and shot at a bunch of people.  Both may have been influenced by a group.  Both may have some political agenda to influence the public or the government.</p>

<p>I would call both attacks terrorism. Of course, the Colorado shooter doesn&#39;t seem as connected.</p>

The public is still in the reactionary stage, and the govt loves to feed people ideas in the reactionary stage. Both shootings happened so close together, and if one of these had to be staged, I&#39;d say the SB shooting. </p>
