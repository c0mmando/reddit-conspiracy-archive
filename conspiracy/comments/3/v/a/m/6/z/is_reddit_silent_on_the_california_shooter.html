       The posts have completely died down in the main reddit threads.  /politics, /news.

       Even the top post  on politics is:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Yes, The Planned Parenthood Shooter Is A ‘Christian Terrorist’"
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not saying we shouldn't hear about the Colorado shooter, but I want to hear about the recent shooting and I think that information is being silenced.

       What world are you living in where "Islamic terrorism" is not a big deal and not constantly being discussed in all media outlets, 24/7? Does OP think the media have it out for whitey and is out to demonize white Christians but will be ever so careful about Muslims? I have never heard "Christian terrorism" used as a term or "White terrorism." They weren't even going to call this San Berardino shooting an act of terrorism until the ethnic/religious background of the suspect was identified, i.e., Muslim = terrorist; White/Christian = crazy lone wolf.

       The very first conference held by the police for the media identified the attack as domestic terrorism but they were not sure of the race.  Reports at the time were identifying them as white males.

       Actually no. The early statements from police and the FBI was, we do not know if this was an act of terrorism. Translation: we don't know if the shooters were brown people.

       Actually yes.  Shortly after the shooting, the police held a press conference in which they stated "obviously at minimum we have  a domestic terrorist type situation."

       That is the only recording I could find of the conference but you have the word straight form the source here.  You literally cannot deny it, sorry.

       Well, then at best there are two conflicting accounts. The FBI director in the video I linked in the first press conference on the shooting says clearly that they do not know if this was an act of terrorism (at the 1:45 mark).

       Are you kidding me?  "Christian terrorism" has been a thing for decades.  This whole anti-Muslim parade just substituted a couple of nouns.  The SPLC has been tracking Christian, right-wing, and white terrorists for many years, and serves as a consult to the FBI for that purpose.

       Well if you want to look at it that way, yeah.  But I was referring to the derogatory "terrorism" label that has been applied (erroneously) to a number of modern Christian groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we want to talk about historical Christian terrorism, that's a bit of a different topic.  An interesting one, though.  As far as I can tell, it began with Constantine.  Since him, the Christian faith has largely functioned as a continuance of the Roman empire (with some splintering here and there, none of which has interrupted the functional aspects of perpetual war and empire).

       honestly... this is part of the reason you guys get made fun of so much...
      </p>
      <p>
       stop with the "drill".
      </p>
      <p>
       do you know how often "drill's" are done within military/police/fire/rescue? it's nearly constant. it's a way to justify the absurd spending and taxation they subject us all to.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's a consequence of the way budget spending is figured...
      </p>
      <p>
       lets say i run a department, and last year we spent 100k. i am "allowed" to increase my budget by a certain percentage each year.
       <strong>
        but
       </strong>
       the second i don't spend the entire budget, they cut me the next year. so it's advantageous for anyone in government to not only spend their budget, but exceed it each year. this way they can justify increasing their budget next year...
      </p>
      <p>
       once you get that money appropriated to you, you have to find a way to spend it... so you buy all sorts of cool toys/gear and pay a bunch of overtime to your boys in the department for training. they constantly run drills to justify their spending... constantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       saying "OMG THEY WERE RUNNING DRILLS" is like saying "OMG THEY WERE ALL WEARING SHOES".
      </p>
      <p>
       it's not a coincidence, it's not a conspiracy, it's just the reality of tax and spend unionized government waste.
      </p>
      <p>
       this building is huge, it's owned/operated/funded by the government, it has a ton of rental space and a lot of parking...
      </p>
      <p>
       it's ideal for running exercises like this.

       The fact that mainstream media will not label a white male as a terrorist when they run amok shooting people but will do it to a middle eastern man minutes after they find out is my big issue.

       In this case, there seem to be similarities between  the two shootings.  For example, the Muslim shooters were angry and shot at a bunch of people.  The Colorado shooter was angry and shot at a bunch of people.  Both may have been influenced by a group.  Both may have some political agenda to influence the public or the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would call both attacks terrorism. Of course, the Colorado shooter doesn't seem as connected.

       No, the Colorado Springs shooting and San Bernardino happened too close together. The CS shooting was a more unpredictable lone wolf situation whereas the SB shooting was coincidental to another terror/active shooter drill.

       My point exactly. They can let speculation run wild on the CS story because it's real, won't reveal much. The SB shooting however is too fresh. The public is still in the reactionary stage, and the govt loves to feed people ideas in the reactionary stage. Both shootings happened so close together, and if one of these had to be staged, I'd say the SB shooting.

       Is it not just possible that people are confused? There is a lot of conflicting information, a lot of aspects a-typical to a mass shooting. A perp with a muslim sounding name and ties to saudi arabia but the act itself doesnt seem to be an act of terrorism. I know personally the event doesnt look to me like terrorism, but when I found out his name was farouque I knew it wasnt going to be a fun day for all the brown guys in america.
