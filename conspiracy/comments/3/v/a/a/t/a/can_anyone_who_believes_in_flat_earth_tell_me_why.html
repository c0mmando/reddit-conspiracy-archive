       You just have to look at bubbles to know that a flat earth is impossible. The circular shape is the most efficient distribution of pressure which is why bubbles and planets are (almost) circular.

       That is a claim made by the "Flat Earth Society".  That group exists solely to mock the idea.  Most flat earth proponents do not make that claim and using it the way you have here is a strawman.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your original question, there is something up there to be seen with a telescope.  What it is exactly I'm not sure.  But either way it is in no way conclusive or even anywhere near direct evidence for the shape of the earth.

       Is that supposed to be serious? The article seems to have no knowledge on the topic of angular velocity.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Seems they don't understand most of science. "Specific gravity" is a thing and they just don't know about it. Also, there are just so many memes with typos...do people actually take this blog seriously?!

       Which statement leads you to believe that there is no understanding of angular velocity?
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, I don't agree with everything there.  For example section 2(B) disputes the magnitude of the variance in the force felt at the pole to that felt at the equator.  I've done the calc myself and the numbers work out assuming the official globe model using formulas for downward gravitational force and outward pushing centripetal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've spent a decent amount of time on this topic and I think most of the prominent flat earth proponents are part of a limited hangout.  They point out problems with the official spinning globe model, but at the same time offer a flawed alternative model.  This tricks people into accepting a false dichotomy so that when they see the problems with the flat model they are deceived into forgiving the problems with the official spinning globe model.

       Yes, which is why I said it was a poor point.  However, gravity is problematic, you cannot demonstrate two objects attracting one another based on mass on a smaller scale.

       Plus a purposely incorrect model is a lot easier to discredit and marginalize in the eyes of outsiders.  "Flat earth theorists don't believe in gravity, they think the earth is moving upwards at 9.8 m/s."  So fragrantly stupid that the first instinct is to dismiss the entire theory and subject from the start.

       The first recorded instances of postulating the existance of a spherical Earth as opposed to the flat Earth myth was when early astronomers deduced that the many phases of the Moons orbit (which was clearly round) had the earth's shadow on it's surface, a shadow that not only was it not straight was also vertical as opposed to horizontal (if the earth where flat).

       That isnt Earths shadow, it's just the part of the moon where it's night time. It like on Earth, night isn't caused by the moon's shadow.

         Moon has no axis spin, therefor no day and no night effect. The earth does spin and as such has night and day (and for us it seems as if the sun is moving).

       Wow really? You're going to tell me the Earths shadow is on the moon at new moon when the moon is BETWEEN the sun and Earth. Just think about it, this is like 4th grade science man. The Earth's shadow cant be on the moon for most of the month as it orbits our planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moon doesn't rotate on it's axis the way Earth does but it does orbit the Earth. That's what cause the change between the day and night side.

       asks a question about Flat Earth theory that could be answered by looking into the topic for just a few minutes. It's not a great mystery as to what Flat Earthers have to say about the ISS, so we've now established that
       <a href="/u/Tychobrahe2020">
        /u/Tychobrahe2020

       isn't really interested in finding the truth, that's not why they're here.

       repeating the claim that the Earth accelerates upward 9.8m/s
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       . This claim originates from the Flat Earth Society and ends there. The vast majority of Flat Earthers see the claim as disinformation and the Flat Earth Society as a controlled opposition group. This too is basic knowledge to anyone who has actually investigated the topic.
      </p>

       Looking at
       <a href="/u/Tychobrahe2020">
        /u/Tychobrahe2020
       </a>
       's two-week account history, it doesn't look like they believe in a single conspiracy theory. In fact, the overwhelming majority of
       <a href="/u/Tychobrahe2020">

       's posts are in relation to a fictional entertainment franchise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat Earth isn't just saying the Earth is flat; it's a meta-conspiracy composed of many other conspiracies. If you still believe in things like the ISS or the moon landings, you aren't ready for Flat Earth. Go study those some more first.

       The term I've been hearing a lot lately is
       <em>
        siloed reality
       </em>
       .  They surround themselves with only like minded individuals which continually feeds their own distorted illusions.

       I mean I don't know one way or another (I've never been to an altitude high enough to form my own opinion) but it seems like you have a lot of direct experiences viewing the earth from space and have already formed a conclusion based on what you saw.

       What's the point of creating a post like this? Is it just to poke fun at people who aren't as enlightened by the truth as you? Seems a little mean spirited.

       They only answer Ive ever gotten on this is google it. Google doesnt have an answer either, all I can find are posts saying satellites are fake but they never explain why we can see them. It seems like they don't have an answer for this so they just get mad.

       You're right, maybe they're out there right now, formulating a well thought out argument and researching data to support....
