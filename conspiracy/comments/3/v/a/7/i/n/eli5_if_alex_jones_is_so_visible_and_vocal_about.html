       I really don't know much about Jones. I've seen one episode of InfoWars relating to "Part of Me" by Katy Perry, and the most I've seen from him was a documentary regarding Bilderberg.
      </p>
      <p>
       To expand on the title: Has Alex Jones built a following so large he can't be touched without being made a martyr, or is he just a puppet spouting so many conspiracy theories that he helps contribute to the distraction and disorientation of the masses?
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like if he was legit he would have gone the way of Will Cooper a long time ago. I still feel like Chris Hedges will get gotten sooner or later.

       Totally agree here.  Alex Jones is into 'shocking' people.  Most of his news stories are half truths, or things that can't be verified.  It creates a class of uneducated conspiracy theorists who give 'free thinkers' a bad name.  If anything, he debases any kind of real change that would happen.

       Alex Jones has HOURS of air time to fill between commercials and the misdeeds and disasters of the oligarchical elite aren't revealed on a schedule, so like most entertainers, he's going to put stuff on the air that either "sponsored" content or lightly investigated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The preferred method is rather than taking Jones' broadcasts as pure fact, compare with other sources and create a mental mosaic of the situation.

       Just listen to his show.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like the guy he was instrumental in getting me into alternative theories but he is selling a product and that product needs air time. Its very hard to be topical and correct 100% of the time so he uses filler and info researched by others with dubious authenticity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a byproduct of him turning himself into a conspiracy theorist media mogul.

       But when do you cross the line and whose lines in particular?
      </p>
      <p>
       When he started the story about the weird nuclear transport from a local military base around the time when Obama released a lot higher army guys with suspicious reasons I felt it reached a red zone. But maybe the guy also has "protection" from a faction.
      </p>
      <p>
       He obviously avoids to thematize the zionists directly so that might be the red line which matters.

       Bill Hicks is controlled opposition, he just talks the talk. He never really means to do any truth telling. The best interview with this Alex Jones aka Bill hicks is when he is exposed by a BBC anchormen. The anchorman and his guest  both agreed that Alex Jones is an agent of the system. In that awkward moment Alex Jones is exposed and ridiculed as hired conspiracy theory infiltrator  on the BBC of all places.
It is priceless and sad cause they are all laughing at us

       William cooper changed his views, quite significantly i might add, not long before his death. Then is when he became a problem, so focus on his later stuff and not on his earlier material.

       He's allowed to continue because no one but a small fringe takes him seriously.  He may be right about a few things, but he ultimately comes across like an idiot shouting at people with megaphones from a space where they allowed him to stand safely away from them.  All his presentations are framed with ominous music while he menacingly monologues over all manner of unsettling imagery. I was torn about him for a while, but I ultimately decided you can't trust anyone who respects his audience so little that he tries to scare them just like all the best propagandists in the media.

       This is also mostly how I feel about David Icke. I feel he's got parts of some stuff right like his Rothschild Zionism theory, but then he starts talking about how our government is actually comprised of shape shifting reptilian aliens and I'm like, woah man, that's a bold claim with no real evidence, even circumstantial, to back it up, but man does he sell a lot of books with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is however maybe some truth to that in the sense that it seems we are mostly lead by people, around the world, who seem to "think" primarily with their "lizard brain" which is where our fight or flight (and other autonomic responses) response originates. So not lizard people obviously, but people who rely more on the most primitive parts of their brains and thought processes. That might help explain this culture of fear we have created at least. It leads to less applied logic, more instinctual "animalistic" reactions and the big ass paychecks for wartime industries just keep coming in and in turn so do the bribes for government officials.

       IIRC, he didn't start talking about the lizard people until he was sued for "anti-semetic" statements. Perhaps it's a useful way to get the message out, even if slightly obfuscated.

       could be that when we see people who are devoid of empathy, we associate them with reptiles so strongly that we encounter a cognitive phenomenon known as matrixing. same as when we suddenly see a bunch of ropes and wires and 'see' snakes until we step back. there's a whole part of the brain dedicated to alerting us to the threat of snakes, possibly because they were such a huge threat when we were arboreal frugivores. a selective pressure would favor those who were hypersensitive over snakes.

       Is being devoid of empathy a reptillian trait? (seriously asking) I'm wondering if that one story about that one bitch, and the snake with the trees and shit has had such a large impact over time that it fostered that mental connection. Do tribal people that have no knowledge of the Christian god's infinite hate make the same association? (not asking you to answer that, just wondering in general.)

       Not always. The Egyptians knew that crocodiles were excellent parents, and the associated god Sobek was revered (Though Apophis, the serpent god, was feared and hated.) Monitor lizards (thought extremely advanced for reptiles) make for excellent companion animals, and have play behavior. Ball pythons are known to adore being handled, so do bearded dragons. Of course, before some of these animals were properly observed or treated as pets, reptiles were generally bad news. Unfortunately, I'm currently in the deep south, and religious idiots will kill ANY snake on sight and boast about it. I enjoyed having one such person arrested for posting pictures of a dead (and harmless) neroidea snake on Facebook. Snakes are better company than most of the locals. of course if you want to see a REAL lack of empathy, get a cat!

       I can dig this. It makes sense. I can neither accept nor refute the shapeshifting theory since there is no absolute proof that it exists and the only evidence to the contrary is that I've never seen it with my own eyes. But I have to wonder why he'd choose his current approach  over an idea like this. Or at least lay down the base with your take on it and maybe work up to the humanoid reptillians.

       This has actually given me an idea regarding the wide range of differing animalistic instincts that appear throughout the human  race and evolution.

       According to the documents about his divorce that were made public he owned a 900k house and also had a second house in his wife's name for 1 million bucks.  He also had to sign a promissory note agreeing to pay her 2.7 million as part of their divorce settlement.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also brags about his fully loaded Dodge Hellcat which is a car that has a lowest possible price of about 61k.   I forget what kind of boat he has but I believe he talked about it with Joe Rogan and I heard him talking about it on his own show and he said that people give him shit for having a boat but he works hard and sometimes he needs to just go out on his luxury yacht and sail to relax after a long day of scaring his listeners with lies and selling bullshit supplements.

       He's a right-wing Christian nut case, racist and xenophobic. There's good reason he's not taken seriously, including by the more serious faction if the conspiracy research crowd. He's no serious threat to establishment. They also do some really stupid shit; like they had someone on talking about how psychedelic drugs are bad and all a CIA plot. False and negative BULLSHIT.

       This is very true. He's only correct enough to weed out those who see whats going on but they're lead away again by the undertones of agenda and deception from what appears to be involving big money (and possibly other psychopathic international crime syndicates). It's most apparent in his recent video with Trump

       There's been a very successful discrediting campaign against Jones.  I guess they feel he is more useful to the establishment alive than not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I enjoy his shows and there are many that do listen to him but we are usually instantly attacked when saying so, so you won't hear from us often here.  He does have a wide audience, probably 20 milllion or so listen to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe he is legit and not a shill, because his sources for news are broad as are the topics he covers.  Usually shills are more obvious and you can find places where they steer people away from the truth, Jones seems to get it right most of the time. You won't find shills that constantly talk about gun control the way he does.  You won't find many shills who have the guests on that he does.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think his infowars website is a good one and all the articles are well sourced and because the site is attacked about it's credibility the articles are more sourced than most.  When anyone tells me infowars is a crap site I ask them to point me to any article that is not sourced or plain false and they never can.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has a great knowledge base and is a voracious news hound.  He is not subsidized mainstream media but has a large operation and makes money selling some survival products and supplements.  I don't think the man should be condemned for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he also is easily excitable and occasionally prone to exaggeration, and his flaws make him an easy target for people looking to discredit him. Personally I enjoy his rants and it is refreshing to see a person in media having some emotion rather than a drone reading a script.  Another popular attack against him is that he is a "fearmongerer", but in my mind the world is not so pretty these days and with eugenicist globalists actively culling the population it is hard to tell the truth about the world today and not scare some people.  Was he fearmongering when he warned of false flag attacks before 9/11?  When the news is too scary for you do you accuse the person trying to enlighten you a fearmongerer and run away covering your ears?
      </p>
      <p>
       I say give Jones a chance and see if you get anything out of it.  He's not for everyone, but I think he's good guy trying to do a good thing and has probably woken up more people than anyone else.

       I love when one user find that he lied at one time and uses that single event to discredit him. Politicians lie all the time and no one ever brings it up when they get coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let take Hillary for example: She has caused more trouble in the world and people still support her. Its like people forget what she is done because they think a women needs to be in the kings chair.

       Well that's probably one of the only times someone has thanked me for sharing my POV on Jones rather than attacking me for it, insulting me for it, or trying to change my mind about it, so that is refreshing.  It would be nice if the sub was more tolerant of differing POVs like this.

       I knew he was not about the truth - - - A-hey showed this when in 2012 he did nothing but - "OBAMA OBAMA OBAMA- AWGUAGGGGHH OBAMA- (still does this i assume) hes the source of our woes---He's usurping we the people. ARGHHH!!!" - - - I thought you said its the central bank Mr. Jones. then the 'global elite' that control the gov't through owning the monetary system. Then he side tracks and talks like republicans are like a rare unicorn that will save us. peer gold. GTFO Jonesy. You contradict your own movie docs and narratives which makes your shill-like-tendencies so obvious. What a moron. Like politicians have any real pull anymore. they do thy bidding of the money holders. that's it. Yeah, they could change. But we know where the control really lies.

       Yeah, I think he's sincere, but I disagree vehemently with his anti-progressive politics, his Christianity, and his general vibe. Also his racism and zenophobic is really offensive. He's not a progressive dude; it's lame. And it's too bad, because most of what he's saying is true, and we do need to overthrow the "New World Order" global elites.

       Because he's either a plant to spread disinformation, or more useful for them as a way to discredit conspiracy theorists, just look at some of the sound bites and his public appearances (the gay frogs thing comes to mind). If he posed any real threat, he would be at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico by now.

       He really makes a lot of good relevant points, it's just surrounded by a lot of nonsense and fearmongering. And his presentation is obviously just about as bad as it gets, if he wasn't such a clown I think more people would probably flock to him even with his hyper-religious bent because the masses are tired of the official lines. But he is not viable, and his use of his site to hawk those snake oils is just the ridiculous cherry on top of a useless cupcake of sour grapes.

       Alex Jones is alive because he is controlled opposition.  If he told anything other than half truths mixed with direct misinformation, it would be different.  If the moment ever comes where he dares to mention Zionism in a negative light on his show (it won't), trust me, they will clean him up pretty quick.  No, Jones has made a good chunk of cash peddling water filters.  He knows his place.

       This. Exactly this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jones goes after Muslims hard, acting as if there's a massive conspiracy that the media and government doesn't address what Muslims are doing all over the world. (To be fair, there is definitely some fuckery involving this topic--MSM used to really push anti-Muslim propaganda, now everything is super PC) But he never brings up Israel or Zionism, despite the fact that these things often play a big role in certain criticisms against mainstream agendas and narratives  (as anyone whose spent considerable time researching these topics knows).
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to this, while ignoring Zionism completely, he does totally fear monger, make himself look like an absolute lunatic to discredit entire movements and also report on stories/issues that are totally out there and are complete disinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       His stuff can be deceiving, because he does expose some true conspiracies and sometimes does a good job at it. But Alex Jones and Infowars.com cannot be trusted as a source because of all the aforementioned reasons. If you start posting or sending people links from info wars, you will likely get written off as a gullible person or a "conspiracy nut" by people who see the other absurd things on his site or maybe have seen videos of him screaming and acting like a total lunatic.

       The show Black Mirror, episode '15 million merits', is a story of someone finding out the fucked up nature of his dystopian society, and then became a state sponsored radio conspiracy theorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always feel hopeless listening to Alex, or especially David icke with his theory that the moon was created by aliens to keep us in a slave mind state, seems they push the fact that we are fucked more than there is a chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Listening to every John Todd tape, every David icke concert, hours of Alex Jones, reading multiple books about the satanic power structure, diving completely into every theory about the nwo agenda, and researching every major religion, I've come to some conclusions of my own. 
1. The idea of Satan and God are metaphysical ideas.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Real Satanism is worship of the self
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The nwo agenda is partly religious, but 100 percent meant to attain power. 99 percent of everyone working in favor of the nwo agenda, are unaware of it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The top of the power hierarchy, our presidents, royal family, Catholic church, Rome, the bankers, Rothschilds, are all part of a secret organization that had its start a little before ancient Egypt. Catholicism is nothing more than a gentile version of Judaism, meant to put some sugar on the evils of Judaism and their Talmudic laws.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Jesus was just one of thousands at that time teaching spiritual liberation through repentance and compassion. Despite failing to fulfill messianic prophecy, they still put the label on him anyways and gave him a story that would satisfy Jewish, Roman and pagan dogmas.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We aren't fucked, the power structure is weak, emerging technologies will allow us to power our houses and our cars from energy we produce at home, coops and self grow ops can provide all of our food, and our dependency on the resources that the value of the dollar is based on can become no more(ie oil)

       I agree with everything you said; however I think these organizations your talking about originated from another place (or we all did) or perhaps, have been around for a very, very long time. Humans and dinosaur bones have been found together all over the sediments of the Earth. Is it the chicken or the egg?

       There's tools found from the dinosaur times, giants in Africa, sub species of homo sapiens.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I find interesting is the notion of spiritual masters from before Jewish times, ones who attained the equivalent of Buddhahood, and recorded some of it in the Vedas, upanishads, and many other traditions. They taught a path to spiritual agape, just as the Gnostic Jesus taught in the book of Thomas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coincidentally, pure, unadulterated love, produced by a willful mind, has the potential to cure the mind of trauma, cure the body of psychosomatic disorders, get rid of neurosis, end emotional repression, end egotistical thinking, reprograms the DNA structure, affects other living systems for the better, and has a ripple effect after you affect two people, then four, then sixteen and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The suppression of this is most likely part of the agenda, as it fosters an independence from state and religion.

       Hopelessness leads to nothing positive. I got a lot more out of reaching "The Law of One" then I did A. Ralph Epperson's "New World Order" in 2011.

      <p>
       Sure, one does have to face the hive of villainy at some point in their life, but becoming consumed by the concept of being controlled will only control one further.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree on all points, but specifically 3 (or maybe it was supposed to be 4) that the roots of the power hierarchy come from the teachings of the Babylonian Mystery Schools (which are rooted in groups from pre-ancient Egypt). I truly feel Babylon was the first attempt at a control system, which has been nearly perfected in America (the illusion of freedom was the great delusion).

       That was my favorite episode of Black Mirror by the way, but definitely left me feeling a tad hopeless. Thanks for your comment!

       he brought david duke in for an interview but then later deleted it and all mention of it from his site. come on why bring him on in the first place, was Zionist alex jones unaware that david duke is anti Zionist? alex had good points that not all jews are bad. but as a conspiracy theorist he should know scrubbing his site of something makes it look like david duke was right! why do that . . . I suspect alex and duke do agree and that was done to make the Zionism conspiracy theory look true . . .

       Like "Mirage Men," there's truth mixed in with misinformation. I'm sure the government knows exactly how to feed him information when it wants to. I'm sure he has "secret sources" in the govt who provide him with the stories he should tell. The biggest fear of conspiracy theorists is that they are getting played. I'm sure Jones is no different.

       Cooper was a miserable bully and a drunk. I listened to him on the radio insult and make a 9-year-old cry because the kid had the balls to ask why Cooper took his money and hadn't sent the cassettes in return. Cooper died because he shot at cops and they fired back. He had a death wish and they obliged.

       Jones speaks in generalizations - globalists this, elites that - and has never offered anything of substance. He certainly has never been a true investigative researcher uncovering real malfeasance. His research amounts to photocopying msm news and highlighting discrepancies in yellow and ranting like a loon. Mad skills.

       Lol you have such a fucking warped view of how Jewish aristocrats think. They literally don't give two shits about you at all. They don't even think for one second about ruining the pure aryan breed, their brothers in the lodge are fucking Germans, Brits and Frenchmen. The Jews are in the same cabal as the Han, Arabs and N. west Euros. This is such a stupid way of looking at reality. Like its obvious that the richest people to ever live were mostly anglo-saxons. How the fuck can you ignore that!

       I think he is a propagandist.

      <p>
       Propaganda is extremely sophisticated nowadays, and mixing your propaganda with elements of truth will be begin to blur reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       He can put a minor spin on all kinds of events and turn them from truth to a little overblown.  And I feel he has some views which are ridiculous which end up making people disbelieve him entirely.  And he is well known enough to reinforce the slander that we all hate so much, being a "conspiracy theorist".

      <p>
       He is also making a shitton of money.

       This is so true. Look at how Reddit uses propaganda. It has gotten very sophisticated, and "ad targeting" has only enhanced the ability to put the "right" propaganda in front of a viewer.

       Removing/censoring posts which is always a hot topic on this subreddit, while not propaganda, certainly helps them push an agenda.

       Alex Jones is not legit. He is the controlled opposition. He is there to frame the "conspiracist" narrative. He is the person they use when they want to show you the face of the "conspiracy theorist". How do most people see Alex Jones? I think many, if not most people, see him as a raving lunatic. That's exactly the face they want to present.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also hear he is basically a mainstream Republican these days.

       I think you are right on the money. Whether purposefully or not, Jones is a tool of the elites as the face of the loony "conspiracy theorist," the poster child of the tin foil hat crowd. He's one reason why more people on the Left don't bother to look into what really happened on 9/11, because none of them want to be associated with a crackpot like him. He does far more harm than good.

       I know! Hilarious, really. Turns out he's now doing the same thing for Republicans that he did for "conspiracy theorists". I was exposed to him way back in 2002-2003, when he was the only game in town. No youtube. But Alex Jones had a mini media outlet. He had money, and he talked a big talk. Always mixed truth and lies together. Sometimes had good people on. But after a while, it was clear that he was owned.

       Do I believe there are conspiracys - most certainly. Do I want to listen to anything that specific attention whore has to say - no. What better way to muddle the message than have a terrible messenger.   He's most effective to the government by doing exactly what he already does.

       I was agreeing with you...and making the point that not everything he says is bullshit, because I don't think it is. I think he is either a misguided CT who has good points occasionally but can't filter out what is junk and just dumps it all out at the same volume, or he is a shill who gets to drop just enough nuggets of good info to keep people coming back, but with lots of loud bullshit to discredit the entire crowd. In either case, not everything he says is bullshit like the shill stated. Call it stupid if you want.

       I just can't really tolerate AJ anymore...too much yelling and showboating. I might tune in if David Knight is hosting but that's another story. Anyway...AJ tells mostly the truth but omits a lot or makes it vague and nondescript. "Globalists, etc etc" but rarely specifics. He's considered a clown to most.

       I want to thank everyone for contributing. Ultimately, I will cautiously look more into Jones to make my own conclusion.

       I also learned the term "controlled opposition" today, which I hadn't heard before, but essentially had the concept in my head for quite some time. I suspect we will see many more controlled opposition figures in the days ahead.

       To that end, I know one guy personally who is pretty hardcore AJ faithful, i.e. he actually calls in and talks on the radio show. He's in the National Guard, he's a hardcore conservative Christian, and all the bells and whistles that you would expect to come from that. We disagree on a lot, but mostly on superficial points. Similar to the way I feel about AJ, most of what he says I'm kinda like ehhh but every once in a while I'm like hell yeah, usually on topics about globalists/bankers.

       I think you hit the spot here. Most of the critics here seem to be irritated about his antics and local cultural biases(weapon/REPs/religion) people can't relate to because they simply don't share the same background.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another big issue is that people here don't realize they aren't the target of his "show" anymore. In the past he produced his films about topics to an audience which was already interested into conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now he reaches a far wider audience and targets
       <em>
        joe users
       </em>
       and wakes them them up (somewhat). That's why I think he is not controlled opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I consider really silly is trying to criticizing his product sales. He needs to finance this product somehow and these days media is either directly financed by government, subsidized in a bigger media corporation, or have a rich sugar daddy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Independent media and no visual financing does not work. You can't have it both ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I would prefer he wouldn't just use so much filler talking points in slow news periods and instead focus on real quality with background reporting. But that requires resources he might not have. It's easy to criticize this from the armchair.

       If you watch the show he produces this is very true, he has very much shifted audience from the classic CT and has taken that loud, aggressive argument style and now he applies it to the news with the intent of hitting a sort of redneck-y ex-military or very blue collar in a more general sense, audience and he's gaining ground with that switch, his production is getting bigger and sleeker and the more he does it, the more followers he will gain. Notably on a recent episode he had a crew on the ground at a shooting. On one level, he sews so much disinformation that it seems really terrible, but he also has a very vocal anti-corporate, anti-govt bent. I'm very torn on my opinion of him. I think he generally does more harm than good...but I also want every fucking person possible to open their eyes to what corporations have been doing and getting away with. The enemy of my enemy is my friend, sort of....not that I am friends with AJ.

       The answer is simple, OP. 99% of the "high level conspiracies" he talks about are figments of his imagination. He either pedals them because he know how rich you can get pandering to the paranoid delusions of conservatives, or because he is insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a similar ELI5:  "if the government is really watching everything I do online, how come people like the San Bernardino terrorists aren't caught in advance?" Maybe because the premise is bunk and the government isn't actually watching everything everyone does online.
