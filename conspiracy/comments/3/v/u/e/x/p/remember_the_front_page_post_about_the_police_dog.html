<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3tby55/actual_picture_of_diesel_7_the_police_dog_that/">https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3tby55/actual_picture_of_diesel_7_the_police_dog_that/</a></p>

<p>I know a lot of people on here called this story about a &quot;Woman Suicide Bomber&quot; BS at the time.  It really stood out to me.  </p>

<p>With the San Bernadino shooting involving a woman, I see this &quot;Female Jihadists&quot; as becoming a meme and decided to look back at the Saint Denis siege to see if they&#39;d changed their &quot;official story&quot;.  It turns out they have, but I didn&#39;t see anything on the front page about it:</p>

<p>From the updated wiki:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Belgian state broadcaster RTBF incorrectly reported that the suicide bomber was Hasna Aït Boulahcen, who was Abaaoud&#39;s cousin according to some reports, and claimed that this was the first incident of a suicide bombing by a female in France. Subsequently, numerous media reports continued to indicate that Aït Boulahcen had died when she triggered a suicide bomb. On 20 November, however, the Paris prosecutor announced that the suicide bomber was a man, based on forensic examination of the remains, and that the female body found in the building earlier in the day had been forensically identified as Aït Boulahcen. She had died when the unidentified suicide bomber triggered the explosive vest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also:  Officials haven&#39;t released a statement on how officers or the Dog were injured.</p>

<p>this article says the Dog was shot:</p>

<p>Diesel, a seven-year-old Malinois, also known as a Belgian shepherd dog, was shot after being sent in to a flat in St-Denis where Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the man suspected of orchestrating the atrocities that killed 130 people, was holed up.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/22/diesel-french-police-dog-killed-st-denis-raid-retire">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/22/diesel-french-police-dog-killed-st-denis-raid-retire</a></p>

<p>Interestingly, the media reports that police fired 5000 rounds of ammunition, but no specific claims have been made regarding the tenants of the apartment having any guns or firing any rounds at police.  In a country with so much gun control, you&#39;d think the guns they were using would be an important part of the story.</p>

<p>Keep analyzing and thinking critically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s kindof the theme.  I just went back and called out someone that had insulted me for analyzing this story at the time, and was told that I need help for dwelling on something that happened three weeks ago.</p>

<p>It&#39;s frontpage news when it happens and the story is constructed as propaganda so people flip their lids.  But once the dust settles and the story changes, nobody wants to acknowledge it.  They&#39;re perfectly happy circlejerking about the horror of the &quot;facts&quot; as portrayed, but they aren&#39;t interested in the disparity between reality and the narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there have been a lot of young girls arrested and killed in israel lately for stabbings.</p>

<p>yes, i think you&#39;re right.  it&#39;s going to be teenagers.  Especially in france and the US where black teenagers of african and middle eastern decent are very disenfranchised and there&#39;s already a huge rift.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m guessing that Germany is going to get hit with something and that there will be a woman involved.  Based on their energy relationship with Russia and place in the EU.  I believe that&#39;s why they&#39;re getting hit so hard with immigrants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first female fighters portrayed in European media were Israeli soldiers. Then long time nothing, then about two years ago the Kurdish women brigade or something. Curiously, no (left-fem. as usual) media outlet draw conclusions about how bad the situation has to be when <em>women</em> decide to pick up guns. </p>

<p>Btw, the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalsozialistischer_Untergrund#Festnahme_der_dritten_mutma.C3.9Flichen_Hauptt.C3.A4terin_Zsch.C3.A4pe">NSU-Scandal in Germany</a> produced also a women as a perpetrator, but the circumstances occured way before that. Then there are from an earlier terror news cycle:<br/>
