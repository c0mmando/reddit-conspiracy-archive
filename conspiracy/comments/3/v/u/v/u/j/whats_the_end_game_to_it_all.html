    <div class="md"><p>Yes. You become more aware, because you become who you really are, the creator. The creator (which is internal not external) created all of this and you. If you accept and embrace that, you will begin to understand your place in this universe. Try living in Alaska, without anything modern and among the predators and wild animals. You will understand your place in the universe and will understand the beauty of existence and the simplicity of it all. You will learn about yourself and a higher force, within. Without all the modern distractions of society. That is the prison. </p>

<p>I live in the woods, used to live a &quot;normal&quot; life (made lots of money), but that wasn&#39;t fulfilling. Deep down I knew there was something wrong. Moved into the woods, and embraced a completely different lifestyle, and it&#39;s like what I&#39;d imagine seeing without glasses the first time after lasik surgery. It&#39;s hard to explain, you must live it/experience it for yourself. Seeing a family of deer grazing in a forest, is more satisfying than finding a 20$ piece of paper (to me). </p>

<p>I agree with you. I always wanted to live off of the grid. I feel modern society is based on competition, greed, and materialism (division and not unity) and it is not what the point of life is. But what keeps me back is, when I have a family, how is my kids going to survive? What about their schooling? What are they going to do with their life? What jobs would they get? This kind of scares me. How did you get over this?</p>

<p>Yes, exactly. You could meditate, but if you are meditating while still having your foot in society, it&#39;s kind of a wash. Make sense?</p>

<p>Pretty simple for me. I&#39;m single, fairly young and do not have kids. If you have kids or a partner, I&#39;d imagine it&#39;s a hell of a lot more difficult. Everyone is in different places, and I can not speak for anyone who is not in the situation I am...</p>

<p>you basically called all Native Americans Cannibals who tortured people. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, but there were a lot of &quot;Native Americans&quot; (they weren&#39;t indigenous to the North American continent, by the way) that were, in fact, cannibals who tortured people.</p>

<p>The silly notion that they were &quot;spiritually advanced&quot; is ridiculous nonsense mostly based on those &quot;Don&#39;t Pollute&quot; TV commercials from the 1970s which suggested that the Indians were somehow environmentalists before their time - a completely idiotic and ahistorical notion quite literally based on baby boomers thinking that TV was real history.</p>

<p>Hell, that actor wasn&#39;t even an Indian - he was Italian.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Witch burning, based on superstitions....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you&#39;re against it when European people do it, but you&#39;re fine with it when Indians do it?</p>

<p>That&#39;s ... pretty racist.</p>

<p>None of those groups were particularly &quot;in tune with nature&quot; - that&#39;s a modern, ahistorical notion. They were primitive, technologically, sure. But they despoiled the environment to the best of their abilities - they were just particularly incompetent.</p>

<p>Can you explain this comment? Because to me it seems like the &quot;aryan countries&quot; (US, UK, friends) are the ones run by the elite pretty flawlessly. The challenges to them aren&#39;t coming from &quot;aryan&quot; people, it&#39;s coming from people in countries like Venezuela and Libya whose (former) leaders actively plot(ted) to take down the elite.</p>
