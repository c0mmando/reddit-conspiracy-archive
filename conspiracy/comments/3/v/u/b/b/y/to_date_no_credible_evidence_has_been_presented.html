      <p>
       While actual evidence may indeed be forthcoming, please let me recap "evidence" that has been presented to us to date.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is ZERO evidence that the guy was anything more than a garden variety devout Muslim born in the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is ZERO evidence that his wife was anything more than a garden variety devout Muslim who was born in Pakistan and who had traveled to Saudi Arabia.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is ZERO evidence that he or his wife ever bought the tactical clothing they were supposedly wearing when they committed the attack and were definitely wearing when they died. To date, not a single law enforcement hero from the alleged "firefight" against these terrifying mass murdering terrorists armed assault weapons and pipe bombs has been interviewed by the press. Am I the only one who finds this a bit strange considering the media frenzy about this story? Not a single breathless eyewitness report, nor a shred of video evidence of this supposed firefight in a highly populated city has been released to date.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is ZERO evidence that Farook's wife even knew how to fire a pistol, much less that she was capable of mass murder using an automatic assault weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is ZERO eyewitness or video confirmation that the three completely covered and masked shooters who "never said a word" even remotely resembled a husband and tiny wife couple.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is ZERO evidence (other than a supposedly posted and now deleted FB post that was supposedly posted under a different account between the original attack and the police firefight according to unnamed sources) the Farooks were "self-radicalized" in any way to commit acts of violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is ZERO evidence that the Farooks ever engaged in any "firefight" with the police. No explanation has been proffered for why the couple was just a couple miles away from the original attack more than 4 hours after the attack, nor what they were doing during that time period.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is ZERO reason to believe that the FBI "investigation" into this mass murder is anything other than poorly executed stagecraft. The couple's home (but not garage) was opened up for reporters to trash. Shredded papers, IDs, passport photos, electronic equipment, etc. were left behind to serve as corporate media "reporting" props. And the guy who supposedly bought the couple their automatic weapons checked himself into a mental hospital and has yet to be questioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is all the supposed physical evidence I have found in all my searches:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/04/23/2F0A2B1800000578-3346861-A_black_and_yellow_duffel_bag_stuffed_with_home_made_pipe_bombs_-a-59_1449272383645.jpg">
        http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/04/23/2F0A2B1800000578-3346861-A_black_and_yellow_duffel_bag_stuffed_with_home_made_pipe_bombs_-a-59_1449272383645.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This bag, supposedly found in the Farooks' garage, is all the physical evidence that has been presented to date to link them to the mass shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       If and when any hard, physical or eyewitness evidence is released linking this couple to the shooting or to ISIS radicalization, please post it here. I am not saying that these folks were not horrible, hate-filled Muslim terrorists. What I am saying is that to date no credible evidence has been presented in the media to suggest beyond a reasonable doubt that they are.

        Bowdich also said that the search of the couple's Redlands home turned up 19 pipes capable of being turned into bombs.

       So they were not even pipe bombs now? They were "pipes capable of being turned into bombs"? Well, still trust us!

       It's become clear this is going to be like the lead up to the War in Iraq. The public isn't even asking for their authorities to own up to their word.

      <p>
       I think it's because now like before the War in Iraq if you stop believing the lie you realize just how absurd things have become and that is a frightening thought for all but the very strong.

       I don't know what to make of all of it, but I did notice the only "witness" I have heard NPR interview was a guy in the bathroom who didn't see anything and just talked about dropping to the floor when he realized bullets were coming through the wall. I haven't heard interviews from anyone who saw anything for a while.

       So we go into the next session. It's around 11 o'clock. They let us go on a break. I basically get to the restroom. As I'm pulling the paper towels from the dispenser, there's explosions. There's bullets flying through the walls. I look at myself in the mirror and see the blood. I thought somebody booby trapped the towel dispenser.
