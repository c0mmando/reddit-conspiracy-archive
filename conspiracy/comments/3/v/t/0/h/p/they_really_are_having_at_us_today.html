       Anyone see the conspiracy but thread?  I mean it is literally just a circle jerk of your typical sheep. I would have chimed in but I know when to pick a losing battle. Just felt really put down by seeing the majority put down so many people's work so blindly. I know only yous would understand.

       (Bring on the down-votes) There are some good points on there critiquing this sub and conspiracy theories in general. For example, people who don't believe ANYTHING the msm says, but some guy on Youtube has all the answers. People who don't believe in the moon landing or the earth being spherical. The Jews being the reason for all the troubles in the world. EVERYTHING is a false flag or staged. I like conspiracies sometimes, they're fun and they perpetuate critical thinking. However, a lot of conspiracies are just ridiculous, mostly based on ignorance or hatred or fear mongering.

       This is why I'm here. The thread in question has plenty of valid points about some of the crazier theories out there. The problem is that whenever the term "conspiracy theory," comes up in, it's
       <em>
        these same crazy theories
       </em>
       that characterize it. Thus opportunities for real discussion and
       <strong>
        critical thinking
       </strong>
       are all but drowned in a sea of utter bullshit. It's all so garbled, preventing important truths from being discerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       If only people spent less time bashing easy targets and kept their attention on the things that matter! There are topics and evidence that truly do merit discussion. And besides.. Whether or not some buffoon thinks the earth is flat isn't going to have an impact on your daily life now, is it?

       Its a stereotype. It exists in the same plane of thought as does all others about any sort of group that one is not a part of or un-knowledgeable about. Don't worry about it and steer clear of those that use stereotypes as their measure of a person or event, as they only see what they are looking for.

The more outlandish the story, the more fun it is. A few years ago I read a great one about the wreck of an alien spacecraft with the preserved body of an alien inside. They called her Mona Lisa I believe. There were photos and everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       So much of this stuff I am certain isn't true, but I like to read it. There was one on nosleep a while ago about an entire town being closed off because strange stuff was happening. Even though I knew it wasn't real I enjoyed pretending deep down that it was true.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same goes for ancient aliens. I have studied too much about ancient history to believe that nonsense but I still love reading about it, though I can't stand the horrible television show.
      </p>
      <p>
       The political conspiracies and theories are fun to read about, but more so when they are historical and not current events. The current events stories always seem so angry and that makes it not very much fun to read about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's to hoping r/conspiracy starts posting more historical conspiracy stuff, more about aliens, and more wild and outlandish stories. There is too much anger on here, too much name calling, and too many people taking themselves too seriously.

       Agreed. There are some good points in that thread. They won't touch San bernadino though, for now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway they're entitled to their opinions. And those bullshit conspiracy theories like the moon, they should be upset. So should we, because it takes away from actual conspiracies and detracts from important conversations we could be having.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the very least, what we do here is ask question and follow up on things the media doesn't. And that's healthy and good.

       Very true and good points are being made. You don't understand. I don't like to be open minded to this type of stuff. Once I've opened a can of worms like sandy hook and San Bernardino I start looking for debunking videos more than conspiracy videos. I want to be proven wrong. I want to feel like my government isn't lying. But they are and the debunk videos are as lopsided and uninformative as anything else. So I stand ground on most of my theories.

       I think it's fun that you say 'conspiracies are fun', and 'a lot are just ridiculous', but one thing you didn't say, is "but sometimes they are confirmed and real legitimate history", which they are.  I can qualify that but I'm not going to do your research for you.  So many examples exist that it's not worth doing that if you don't believe it, I"m not going to take the time to copypasta you 5 pages of links you won't even read anyway if you are who I suspect you are--an establishment person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, if you said something like 'well the fact some are true demands investigation of other more plausible ones', I'd consider you a real skeptic.  Especially the mother of all conspiracies 9/11.  But I have to wonder if you just gave us all a kind of trojan horse put down disguised as being open minded.

       You are right now mocking the whole concept of "conspiracy theories", which is taking your shilling quite many steps too far. Do Jew remember which subreddit Jew posted this on? Am I being silly for suspecting that you have a hidden agenda? That you might have financial incentives behind your actions? Is this a ridiculous concept for you? What brought you here in the first place?

       And all this is dependent on if the person I'm accusing of being a shill actually is one or not. Would you like to debate this? My stance is clear, based on the absolutely hundred percent clear patterns that I spotted straight away. I guess you are new to the understanding of how completely overrun this sub and the majority of mainstream hangouts online is, by paid agents. Why is it impossible that the person I accused of being a shill is actually one and therefore deserves to be pointed out as one?
      </p>
      <p>
       My heckling of him is based on my conviction that I'm not hurting any feelings. Trust me, he might at best be worried that his employer will fire him, but this is standard quality of paid trolls today so I can vouch for the kid has earned his spot. His employer is reading what I'm writing, so don't worry, I fixed it. Kid will afford camping trip next summer! Weee!

       We need a new word for conspiracy. I sweat all the majority sees in their heads whenever ANYONE has 2 cents of an idea for challenging the powers at force they see tin foil and aliens. This shit is starting to happen more and more. More people are waking up. Be strong! We deserve the truth.

       What's interesting is that there are no reply comments asserting the theories. Sure, some are false like flat earth, but you'd think with belief in these theories being so prevalent (regardless of whether they were true or false) that some people would be commenting why they believed them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The complete absence of anyone claiming the validity of any of the theories is strange.

       One thing Kelso, those are the same people who love to see posts like this that make r/conspiracy look butt hurt over what they actually think. We don't care what they think.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes to shit like that - No Fucks given from the r/conspiracy crowd. Ignore the ignorance. We don't speak of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take r/conspiratard for example. All those losers do is talk about us, make fun of us and have their circle jerks and old bitch sewing circle gossip sessions all about US all day long. Do we even mention them here? NO. They are beneath us...they follow US around like lost little losers looking for something in their pathetic lives to talk about.

       I would only offer that in "The Art of War," Sun Tzu says that at your weakest point, you must appear your strongest to your enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the reason we're seeing a speeding up of all this shit and more and more of it (getting sloppier and sloppier) is because they know they're not operating from such a point of strength any more.

       Personally, I am seeing more and more people who used to think me a fringe thinker now coming to me for my perspective on what's really happening, and asking where I get my information and who I trust and what I've read.

       Same. This is the only way to make any real sense of what is going on in the world. Not just in America, most of the world over. The governments lie a lot and that is a fact. If they didn't they would be overthrown just as soon as they were "voted" in to power.

       Who cares what those retards think? They're just ignorant, and when a whole group of ignorant people chat it up, they convince each other that no conspiracies exist, ever, and that anyone who disagrees is a paranoid conspiracy theorists. These people don't know their ass from their face, and will never accept any truth they disagree with until it literally hits them in the face. Let the circlejerk each other and pretend they know what they're talking about. Be better than them, ignore them and let them tell each other how funny and intelligent they are. I'm more concerned with...you know...reality?

       That narrows it down a bit, but not much. There are many angles and those aren't really that recent. Still going to wait on a reply from him.

       The proven ones for the most part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an unproven one this sub has never heard of or discussed - The Australian government is trying to cut funding for TAFE, to do this they've 'updated' the enrollment software to a broken mess of a program that makes it extremely laborious to enrol students.
      </p>
      <p>
       This results in the majority of students not being enrolled past the normal enrollment date, leading to an apparent massive drop in student numbers on paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       This apparent massive drop in student numbers is then used to justify cuts to TAFE spending.

       Please name one that you believe in that is relatively recent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you live in Australia and do you really believe in that conspiracy? Can you give me a link to information about it? It's honestly the first time I've heard about. You haven't posted about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't really seen you positively contribute to any of the threads here. Honestly I find it hard to believe that a 'conspiracy theorist' would just hang around here to criticize people who bring up theories all day long, but not really discuss any of the theories from the theorist side with any skepticism. Unless you aren't really here for the same reason most of us are here for.
      </p>
      <p>
       They downvote you because you're attempting to stop the discussions and giving off the impression that you represent most of the userbase here. Do you feel that that is the case? Is there nothing suspicious about it to you?

      <p>
       The story shouldn't be questioned, only we that are questioning it should be, huh?

       It's very interesting and funny that the only recent or current conspiracy you believe in is one that is not discussed at all on here and also has no evidence that you could prove it with.

       The most concrete, widespread conspiracy in the past 5 years and which is ongoing to this day would go to government spying.

       Another example of a proven conspiracy would be the FIFA corruption.

       Hmm, I see. Yea, I agree, but I really see no harm in them discussing them. I'm sure we've all thought many theories in the past to be ridiculous, but then some of them turned out to be true. Anyways...
