    <div class="md"><p>(Bring on the down-votes) There are some good points on there critiquing this sub and conspiracy theories in general. For example, people who don&#39;t believe ANYTHING the msm says, but some guy on Youtube has all the answers. People who don&#39;t believe in the moon landing or the earth being spherical. The Jews being the reason for all the troubles in the world. EVERYTHING is a false flag or staged. I like conspiracies sometimes, they&#39;re fun and they perpetuate critical thinking. However, a lot of conspiracies are just ridiculous, mostly based on ignorance or hatred or fear mongering.</p>

<p>This is why I&#39;m here. The thread in question has plenty of valid points about some of the crazier theories out there. The problem is that whenever the term &quot;conspiracy theory,&quot; comes up in, it&#39;s <em>these same crazy theories</em> that characterize it. Thus opportunities for real discussion and <strong>critical thinking</strong> are all but drowned in a sea of utter bullshit. It&#39;s all so garbled, preventing important truths from being discerned.</p>

<p>If only people spent less time bashing easy targets and kept their attention on the things that matter! There are topics and evidence that truly do merit discussion. And besides.. Whether or not some buffoon thinks the earth is flat isn&#39;t going to have an impact on your daily life now, is it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I come here very much for the same reason I go to r/mandelaeffect and r/nosleep. I really enjoy reading a story with the mindset that it is true. The more outlandish the story, the more fun it is. A few years ago I read a great one about the wreck of an alien spacecraft with the preserved body of an alien inside. They called her Mona Lisa I believe. There were photos and everything. </p>

<p>So much of this stuff I am certain isn&#39;t true, but I like to read it. There was one on nosleep a while ago about an entire town being closed off because strange stuff was happening. Even though I knew it wasn&#39;t real I enjoyed pretending deep down that it was true. </p>

<p>The same goes for ancient aliens. I have studied too much about ancient history to believe that nonsense but I still love reading about it, though I can&#39;t stand the horrible television show. </p>

<p>The political conspiracies and theories are fun to read about, but more so when they are historical and not current events. The current events stories always seem so angry and that makes it not very much fun to read about. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s to hoping r/conspiracy starts posting more historical conspiracy stuff, more about aliens, and more wild and outlandish stories. There is too much anger on here, too much name calling, and too many people taking themselves too seriously. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. There are some good points in that thread. They won&#39;t touch San bernadino though, for now. </p>

<p>Anyway they&#39;re entitled to their opinions. And those bullshit conspiracy theories like the moon, they should be upset. So should we, because it takes away from actual conspiracies and detracts from important conversations we could be having. </p>

<p>At the very least, what we do here is ask question and follow up on things the media doesn&#39;t. And that&#39;s healthy and good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true and good points are being made. You don&#39;t understand. I don&#39;t like to be open minded to this type of stuff. Once I&#39;ve opened a can of worms like sandy hook and San Bernardino I start looking for debunking videos more than conspiracy videos. I want to be proven wrong. I want to feel like my government isn&#39;t lying. But they are and the debunk videos are as lopsided and uninformative as anything else. So I stand ground on most of my theories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s fun that you say &#39;conspiracies are fun&#39;, and &#39;a lot are just ridiculous&#39;, but one thing you didn&#39;t say, is &quot;but sometimes they are confirmed and real legitimate history&quot;, which they are.  I can qualify that but I&#39;m not going to do your research for you.  So many examples exist that it&#39;s not worth doing that if you don&#39;t believe it, I&quot;m not going to take the time to copypasta you 5 pages of links you won&#39;t even read anyway if you are who I suspect you are--an establishment person.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you said something like &#39;well the fact some are true demands investigation of other more plausible ones&#39;, I&#39;d consider you a real skeptic.  Especially the mother of all conspiracies 9/11.  But I have to wonder if you just gave us all a kind of trojan horse put down disguised as being open minded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The proven ones for the most part. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an unproven one this sub has never heard of or discussed - The Australian government is trying to cut funding for TAFE, to do this they&#39;ve &#39;updated&#39; the enrollment software to a broken mess of a program that makes it extremely laborious to enrol students. </p>

<p>This results in the majority of students not being enrolled past the normal enrollment date, leading to an apparent massive drop in student numbers on paper. </p>

<p>This apparent massive drop in student numbers is then used to justify cuts to TAFE spending.</p>

<hr/>

<p>My own pet conspiracy is that i&#39;ve got fans that downvote me on sight regardless of what I say, for example, my comment prior to this has -4 karma, for what? Answering your question?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please name one that you believe in that is relatively recent. </p>

<p>Do you live in Australia and do you really believe in that conspiracy? Can you give me a link to information about it? It&#39;s honestly the first time I&#39;ve heard about. You haven&#39;t posted about it. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t really seen you positively contribute to any of the threads here. Honestly I find it hard to believe that a &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; would just hang around here to criticize people who bring up theories all day long, but not really discuss any of the theories from the theorist side with any skepticism. Unless you aren&#39;t really here for the same reason most of us are here for.</p>

<p>They downvote you because you&#39;re attempting to stop the discussions and giving off the impression that you represent most of the userbase here. Do you feel that that is the case? Is there nothing suspicious about it to you? </p>

<p>The story shouldn&#39;t be questioned, only we that are questioning it should be, huh?</p>

<p>The shitty enrollment software? Nope. My sources are teachers, not internet links. </p>

<p>Well I did just say you&#39;ve never heard about it... </p>

<p>By answering your question? You asked if I believe in any, I said &quot;Yep&quot; -4 karma. All of my watts.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very interesting and funny that the only recent or current conspiracy you believe in is one that is not discussed at all on here and also has no evidence that you could prove it with. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about downvotes. It&#39;s not like they are throwing eggs at you.</p>

<p>The most concrete, widespread conspiracy in the past 5 years and which is ongoing to this day would go to government spying. </p>

<p>Another example of a proven conspiracy would be the FIFA corruption. </p>

<p>So, why do you never question the events that are posted here? It seems that you only question the users here and their theories? Why do you think that is?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, I see. Yea, I agree, but I really see no harm in them discussing them. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all thought many theories in the past to be ridiculous, but then some of them turned out to be true. Anyways...</p>

<p>So why did it bother you so much that people kept referencing the conspiracy thread? </p>

<p>Sorry for the interrogation, but I really like to get to know the users in here. You seem like a cool person, behaves suspiciously, but still cool =)</p>
