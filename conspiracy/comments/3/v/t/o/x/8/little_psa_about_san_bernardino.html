        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m a casual observer of this sub from San Bernardino area (about 8min drive from SB, I was about 15min away from the location when it all went down). To be totally blunt/honest, I come by to laugh at your theories. I always find these things to be nothing more than wallowing in the chaos of an event. That&#39;s generally where all the confusion/misinformation that yall enjoy so much come from imo. But that&#39;s not what I&#39;m here to talk about. Yall are entitled to your opinions/theories and I have no intention to argue with you or shit on your theories. </p>

<p>I just wanted to give a warning to everyone that San Bernardino is not the best neighborhood. It is an area that has been a hotbed of gang violence for decades. If the same kind of things that happened after Sandy Hook (conspiracy theorists harassing family of victims, defacing monuments, etc) happen here, I fear that there will be hospitalizations and possibly even murder. I personally knew two of the victims (friends of friends type of deal) and every day hear from people who were much more affected by this than I was. Trust me when I say that there is not a lot of patience amongst those in the area. Be cautious when/if you decide to investigate for yourself. You are not going to be doing yourself any favors if you come into the area and brazenly throw accusations around. </p>

<p>All that being said, I have not followed all this super closely as it quite literally hits too close to home. Please dont ask me for any information thinking that you will get an inside scoop. I&#39;m sure I know less about this than anyone subscribed to this sub. I simply wanted to give a general warning because I&#39;m honestly scared when I imagine how this neighborhood will react to the type of stuff that you guys talk about. </p>

<p>Stay safe everyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>About 10 years ago I was on a tour of the SB courthouse and sat in on a trial where a guy shot a man on the street for asking for a light. No other dialogue according to eye witnesses. I&#39;m not saying that this is commonplace or that SB crime stats haven&#39;t gotten better since then, but the crime stats for the area are still well above average for the nation in homicide and violent crimes. </p>

<p>And for the record, I&#39;m not saying not to investigate. I 100% agree that they&#39;re fine if they &quot;dont start shit&quot;. I&#39;m just saying that harassing family members of the victims or being extremely disrespectful of the situation will more than likely be viewed as starting shit.</p>

I never underestimate the power of ineptitude. But as I said in the OP, I dont really want to discuss the theories.

    <div class="md"><p>Something that large? The United states govornment was capable of designing the first atomic bomb and 99% of the scientist working on it had no idea what the hell they were helping to build. I wouldn&#39;t consider killing 14 people to be that large of a thing to coordinate. Like you yourself have said you haven&#39;t investigated this so why even rule out  any of the scenarios</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Realistically, how many people would need to know they were covering something up in this instance? I&#39;ve heard people claim that every single media outlet is on board with the cover up. How many first responders? Many of whom are loyal to their area and untrusting of the US govt. How would they keep all those people on the same page and/or bribe all of those people? Ive worked with Government entities as a contractor and they are almost always the least efficient of my clients. Not for profits, corporations, everyone runs things better than the government. No matter what level of government people work with they always seem to have the same stories of inefficiency and bureaucracy. I have 0 faith in the govt to pull off something that organized. I often joke that the people with the most faith in the govt is conspiracy theorists. If you really think about the dedication and man hours that would be required for most conspiracies, its pretty absurd. </p>

<p>But now I&#39;m doing what I said I didn&#39;t want to do. I dont want to argue with you. If you choose to believe that stuff then that&#39;s your choice. Im not judging you for it. I even admire you for wanting the truth so badly, even if I think your logic and methods are flawed. Im still impressed and hope that if there is something to uncover that you do so. If that kind of things exists then I hope someone exposes it. Im just trying to champion the idea that you can investigate those things safely and without harassing people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You yourself have said you&#39;ve done little research. I suggest you do some before making any claims as to how many people have to be involved for this to happen. The point I previously brought up about the Manhattan project shows that people can be working on something and have no idea what its for or its purpose.</p>

<p>Realistically the only people who need to know they are covering something up is the three shooters and the single witness who mention faruks name. You may of heard people claim that every single media outlet is on board, im not one of those people. I believe this is the reason why you saw the media circus break into the alleged suspects house, to find passports and drivers license and an inventory list of munitions &quot;found&quot; by the FBI inside of the house. I believe all of that evidence was probably planted by the FBI.  the FBI allowed the reporters to &quot;break into&quot; the house to find it themselves. The first responders only saw the aftermath no cover up there. </p>

<p>I too have worked for the government doing contract work. Yes they are largely incompetent but the people you are dealing with doing the contracting work are not the same as the people working for the CIA/FBI. </p>

<p>You yourself pointed out that the first responders must be invovled in the cover up or else they would blow the official storry. Well there was eye witnesses and two of them both describe 3 tall athletic white men in black army fatigues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>More dregs in this sub, such a shame. Sounds like someone is typing out a thread to non-corporate journalists or curious citizens who are concerned about a media company that is busying polluting minds and eating their own fellow humans. Quite sad Threats in this sub - a new low. I&#39;m out in the UK but a quick google search and look at small town Riverside in CA it&#39;s hilarious that people think ISIS is in this small dumpy town. Do you research. It&#39;s a rubbish small ass town with 200,000 people into it, they all have the right to ask anything they want. It&#39;s 40 minute drive from LA so who know what the neighbors are up to. Look at the orgy of evidence that this is a cover up. The &quot;reporters&quot; raid the home tampering with evidence. They &quot;ISIS&quot; link is put out right away. Some handler starts parading around fake muslims on FOX/NBC/ZOG media and they start saying &quot;he liked isis on facebook&quot; I mean come on. The fact that there were active shooter drills occurring the same time as the shooting. The people in that small USA town need to be on high alert, because there are traitors, and liars amongst them that worship a God you have never heard of and they believe they can keep their controlled story in line but they will have to compete with the internet now. Listen <a href="/u/leaga">/u/leaga</a> we are not sure who you are protecting, or why you are siding with a media venture that want&#39;s your brain GOO but be aware by siding with these corporations and telling people not to research you are complicit in a major crime, and you should watch the company you keep or the dregs you are defending.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go through my comments. I&#39;m trying to make it clear that I am NOT saying dont investigate. If you want to investigate then do so. I just want people to know that this isn&#39;t a safe little suburb that hasn&#39;t had a murder in years like Newton was. This is the 28th ranked US city by homicide rate. This is a dangerous area and if you come into town and act like a jerk to the wrong people then you might not make it out of town. Come, investigate, spread the word on what you find. Just be careful who you piss off while you do it because a citizen might kill you before the government ever needs to cover up anything you find.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look through any of my comments on this post. I say time and again that its not meant to be a threat. San Bernardino is the 28th ranked city by homicide per capita in the US and I just want people to know the environment that they are walking into if they decide to investigate this in person. I, and anyone I know, will have nothing to do with any violence but that does not mean it isn&#39;t a very real possibility.</p>

<p>San Bernardino has double the average crime rates per capita in the US in the following categories: Murder, Robbery, Assault, Violent Crime, Burglary, Vehicle Theft, and Property Crime. Of the types of crime statistics reported they were still above average but not quite double national average in the rest of the categories: Rape and theft.</p>

<p>These statistics are easily gathered (and verified) with a simple google search about crime rates. Maybe I should have done a better job wording it and referencing stats in the OP but regardless, I know I&#39;m not a tough guy and threats have nothing to do with it. I just want people to be safe if they travel to the area.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is don&#39;t live in fear or else tptb will have already won. That being said Gary Indian is far worse than anywhere in California I don&#39;t recommend going there but I would wager a bet that most residence of Gary have good reason to hate the government. So I don&#39;t see a reason why you would need to fear them if you were there under benevolent circumstances. They would probably be happy to help expose the lies that have in slaved poor black people since the year 1619.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Living in fear is a far cry from living informed. San Bernardino may not be as bad as Gary (#28 per capita murder rate in the US compared to #3, I just checked) but they still are a bad enough area to warrant informing oneself before travelling there. In a country of ~19,300 cities/townships #28 isn&#39;t exactly a spot to feel safe. I never said not to travel or investigate or tried to fear monger in any way. I&#39;m just trying to inform those that might want to investigate in person that they should be aware of the dangers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While that&#39;s probably true that most dont do field research, i would be very surprised if the type who are hardcore enough to do field research aren&#39;t also on this subreddit. Even if they aren&#39;t, where could I put the message that they might see it better than here? </p>

<p>I admit that this might be worthless in every way, shape, and form. But I seriously think that someone will get themselves killed if they aggressively research this in the wrong parts of town. I mean regardless of if it were a conspiracy or not, whether it is because they were tricked or because they actually lost friends, family, and suffered an attack, there are now thousands of people scared and emotional in a place that already has a high homicide rate. I want to spend at least a few hours in the only place that I can think of spreading that knowledge. I would feel terrible if I correctly predicted something like that and did absolutely nothing to let people know and try to get them out of harms way. Even if what I&#39;m really doing is just shouting into the darkness. I still want to shout for a bit.</p>
