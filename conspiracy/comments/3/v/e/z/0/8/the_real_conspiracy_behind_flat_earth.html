    <div class="md"><p>Ita kind of like what happened with GWB and TANG.  The Bush handlers got Bush&#39;s damaging document and destroyed it. Then they made a forgery of the document they destroyed and released it themselves. Then when people were upset by the info, they exposed their document as a forgery.  That way it looked like the allegations that Bish was a deserter were false, when in fact, they were true.  The secretary said &quot;Those are not the documents I typed, but I did type documents that said the same thing&quot;.</p>

<p>On the same topic, that is why I have always thought ISIS has multiple names. ISIS/IS/ISIL/Daesh. The government and the media use them all interchangeably. Makes denying the truth easier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Proof?  The history of UFOs far exceeds the technological age of placing aircraft in our atmosphere.  They have been described as mechanical long before machines became common place.</p>

<p>So no, they are not all made up by the government.  And who is to say the government hasn&#39;t made up those stories to redirect the attention away from another possibility.  Disinformation is common place and while they can make &quot;some&quot; claims of experimental aircraft I wouldn&#39;t accept their claims simply because it doesn&#39;t fit all cases nor the history of unknown aerial phenomena that was surely not of a natural origin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a limited hangout.  Flat earth theory contains valid criticisms of the official heliocentric spinning globe model, but at the same time it offers a flawed alternative model.  These two models create a false dichotomy so that when people are presented with the problems in the flat model they treat these as proofs of the spinning globe model.  This is a logical error and neither of those models is correct.</p>

<p>There is more to the topic than just a distraction.  You have decided that it is entirely bs here to distract and discredit.  Set that aside for a moment and take the time to get into the specifics of the arguments being made.  The official model does not work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A quick one:  The distance you can see over water is too far.  For a globe of circumference ~25,000 miles to work with observations over water light is required to always bend downwards through the atmosphere to allow us to see around the curve.  Light does not do this.  If light travels in straight lines, then the earth cannot be a globe.</p>

<p>There is an example of a problem with the globe model that is pointed out in Flat Earth theory.  The catch is that it leaves out important information.  Any visual observation we make must be interpreted in the context of how light bends in the atmosphere.  Our eyes or any other light measuring device can only measure photons as they are when they arrive, there is no information on their path to get there.  So if we want to use visual observations as data points we need to know how light acts in the atmosphere.  This experiment with theodolites demonstrates that light always bends upwards through the atmosphere, not down (<a href="http://www.wildheretic.com/bendy-light-the-evidence/">http://www.wildheretic.com/bendy-light-the-evidence/</a>).  When visual observations are interpreted in this context we get a concave earth.</p>

<p>This video has good discussion of light and the implications of its bending in the atmosphere: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTGxoMppZM8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTGxoMppZM8</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure they have a model.  The standard flat earth model has the North pole at the center with Antarctica as a ring around the outside.  The sun takes an orbital path around the North pole, parallel to the ground, a few hundred miles above us.  The radius of this path changes to give seasons.  Some variations include a dome over us.  Some include the concept of an infinite plane beyond the edge of Antarctica, possibly with other earth like &quot;puddles&quot;.</p>

<p>There is lots of valid evidence presented in the area of flat earth, however most of it happens to disprove the official heliocentric model, not prove the alternative flat model.</p>

<p>Since the topic of flat earth exploded earlier this year I have watched how proponents of it have behaved.  Much of the activity has gotten away from discussing the specifics of the topic and devolved into conflicts between proponents.  This form of limited hangout involves building up proponents with a following, then imploding them all.  People who realized that valid arguments were there are disenfranchised when their leaders are exposed.  Here is the forum of one of the primary proponents of Flat Earth, Eric Dubay: ifers.boards.net  I have been banned from there twice myself.  No questioning of the model is allowed there, they are extremely trigger happy with the ban button and label everyone with the slightest disagreement to their position a shill.  Watching the history of new users, bans and deleted posts gives a better idea of what the place really is.</p>

<p>It sounds like you really haven&#39;t spent much time on the topic.  You can&#39;t refute the arguments properly without knowing what arguments are being made.  There are problems with the Flat Earth model, but they really aren&#39;t any more egregious than those of the official spinning globe model which does not match real world observations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I am not advocating for the flat model, just giving the standard explanation that proponents of the flat model usually do.</p>

<p>Sunsets in the flat earth:  The sun sets due to perspective.  As objects move away from you they occupy less of your 2-d viewport.  Consider looking down a very long hallway.  When looking down the hallway, the lines of intersection of the walls, floor and ceiling form straight lines that intersect in the middle of your view.  Since these lines are straight, we know our vision is finite, there is a vanishing point.  The appearance of the sun setting is due to the effect of objects approaching the vanishing point, similar to the ceiling in the hallway.  Note that in the flat earth model the sun is much closer to the earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That perspective explanation doesn&#39;t explain why a Sun would appear to be meeting the horizon when it&#39;s supposed to be more than 20<sup>o</sup> (if we assume a relatively close Sun) above Earth. Until I see a model or hear a valid explanation, I&#39;ll take the hypothesis seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All objects will disappear into the vanishing point at some distance based on the 2-d size of their exposed profile and distance from the observer.  The gap between the sun and the ground will disappear at some distance.  To see this, consider the hallway example and scale it up.  The height of the ceiling represents the height of the sun above the earth.  No matter how high the ceiling is, when you look down the hallway, at some point it will meet the floor from your perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire analogy of looking down a hallway and having the ceiling and floor converge is just not true. Yes, the perspective lines appear to converge and when sketching they are treated as such, but there is no &quot;finite&quot; distance we can see due to our perspective lines converging. In reality, our perspectives converge asymptotically. How do these Flat-Earthers account for being able to see stars at night? I imagine it&#39;s something crazy like &quot;stars are really tiny and move over the flat earth at night&quot; or something similar. </p>

<p>Asymptotes approach limits.  If you keep getting geometrically smaller approaching zero, you might as well be at zero.  Your eyes (or any other light measuring device) do not have infinite sensitivity.</p>

<p>Stars are an interesting topic.  Are they really faraway suns or something completely different?  The flat earth model generally has the earth as stationary while celestial objects move around us.  Some speculation I have seen:</p>

<p>1)  Holes in a barrier that let light through.<br/>
2)  Sono-luminescence.  The result of sound within a container filled with a liquid.<br/>
3)  Electromagnetic effect manifested visually on a barrier with source at the North pole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, asymptotes do approach a limit and there definitely is a limit to the sensitivity of our eyes. However, that does not mean there is a limit to the distance our eyes can see. It purely comes down to the size of the object being looked and the amount of light it gives off.
