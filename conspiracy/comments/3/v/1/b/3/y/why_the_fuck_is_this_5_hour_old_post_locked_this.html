       Holy shit, that was a lot of deleted comments and a lot of the deleted comments were not inappropriate by many standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are just some issues that cannot be honestly discussed and because we cannot honestly discuss them, the problems will only get worse.  I wonder if that is not the goal?
      </p>
      <p>
       Reasonable people can typically use their brains and figure problems out, but they cant figure problems out if they are prevented from having all the facts and prevented from discussing the problem.

       Eh, being white in this is no better.  Racism towards us gets worse every day.  We can't tolerate it my friend, even if it doesn't directly affect you yet...trust me, it will, or someone you care about will be affected.

       Minority here, you guys are getting shit on by BlackLivesMatter, and it isn't just that group.  Having problems?  It's white people's fault!
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how these people think, how do I know this?  Because these monkeys try to subvert other minorities into playing the same damn victim-card abuse game; and they try to get other minorities to join them in hating on white people.  It's gross and classless.  These are the same monkeys that will loot/steal/crime the neighborhoods &amp; businesses of other minorities and blacks/whites as well.  Is there something that I'm missing that excuses their actions?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yea, I want "equality," but not in the form of aggro-activism and excused racism against white folks.  Why people don't understand that these people could give a shit about everyone else but themselves is beyond me.  I'm glad as of late there has been some revealing of their true colors.

       Reddit has been overrun with tumblr style PC police. Some call them SJWs, but that term is being taught opposite to conspiracy theorist. The tern SJW triggers them to completely ignore everything you say and consider you a social degenerate and likely a conservative racist white male. Don't believe me? Read the self post on
       <a href="/r/anarchism">

Conspiracy theorist however is still a tool to discredit the offender.

       this post was locked because it sheds truth on too many issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, that parents have different roles, and there are things that a mother simply cannot provide. the going narrative is that men simply are not needed anymore. period. if the current state of the black community is any kind of example then we can see that simply isnt true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, it points a truer picture on the cause of the problems with the black community. Can't have the blacks waking up, and righting their ship, and we definitely cant have them realizing they have the power to fix their lives and communities. how else are we gonna keep the blacks resentful of whites, and the whites afraid of blacks. That would be a huge step closer to people uniting as one against the true evil of this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       i also think welfare wasn't instated until after the early 1970s which might cause people to connect the dots between that and the downfall of black society.

       They are also playing into the mainstream media approved message these days which is divide and conquer. Let's not allow any discussion that may begin to identify problems and allow narrow minded people to open their eyes and relate to those having problems in a compassionate way. We need our race war to declare martial law and sack the economy for a hard reset. All this understanding will fuck up retarded solution.
