       As soon as endlessly amassing wealth to use as power to make more wealth, at the expense of lots of other people, becomes apparent as what it is - neither natural or of any social use - then something can be done about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as the wealth controls every aspect of the human condition to its gain, nothing will be done about it.

       It's an excersize in futility anyway, because even if intelligence were to "break out enmasse" and all us peons were to coalesce into action, it's way too late.

       When a schoolyard bully starts beating kids up, does that mean the schoolyard is a battleground? The biggest asshole in the room dictates dynamic? We aren't boars. We are people. These people look at a world full of people trying to get by, compete with basically nobody, and naturally win because the world doesn't actually work that way in the first place. But, go ahead and follow the "leader" if you want.

       We certainly are at some distance in our views, but I don't think there's any reason for that to be a complete barrier in understanding. We're looking at the same elephant as two blind people, feeling different things.

       Are you responsible for AIDS because you haven't wiped it out?

       With our growth a a species we're supposed to move away from the strongest richest beat all the lesser and take all the resources.

      <p>
       Mankind can't run as fast as the big cats, isn't as strong as the great apes, can't plumb the depths of the oceans without machines...
      </p>
      <p>
       Know what we're good at? Know why we are "the number on species" on the planet?
      </p>
      <p>
       That lump of matter inside our heads. The stronger that "muscle" gets, the further ahead we get. We've glorified violence, and muscular strength, and all the "sports" aspects of our species while not bothering to nurture the ONE THING that has caused us to excel...
      </p>
      <p>
       our brains. our minds. our intellect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evolution isn't about killing everything that doesn't agree with you... it's about using the qualities that have allowed us, humans, to work our way up from being some frail pink soft creature to walking on the moon... and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry. It's no longer time for "look how far I can throw this spear and kill you with it". It's time to think. It's time to figure out what we're going to do as a species and get fucking busy with it.

       It's a genetic disease - an abnormality - and it's no less deadly than any viral killer because those who have the disease have zero mercy towards any other humans except where those people may have some part to play in their scheme.

       Polio is a disease caused by a viral infection, not a portion of the human population being labeled a disease. I agree people like that are awful, but it isn't something that can be inoculated away. The things you're saying sound very much like you're calling for an extermination of the people themselves ... and that's what I'm getting at. I'm not being obtuse, are you?

       Just because you don't like how some people live their lives, doesn't mean that they should be 'wiped out like the disease it is'.

       Your kind are the reason why we have such incidents in our history as the bolshevik revolution and the 'great leap forward' and the holodomor and other mass genocides.  All of them were done by leftists, by the way.  Right wingers may grumble about things, and maybe even do a bit of oppression here and there, but left wingers will straight up murder millions of people.

       Preach man. It is so disheartening seeing all of this left wing right wing labeling. This dichotomous thinking, black and white, me vs you, us versus them, call it what you want, but this is the real mental illness. This is what tears people and nations apart.

       Your thread title.  just because some people are greedy doesn't mean that they deserve to be 'wiped out'.  By your 'hate the rich' rhetoric, I assume you are a leftist, hence the rest of my post.

       I'm sorry I posted such a title when people like you write to me with such... myopic... nonsense.

       Maybe I should get rid of it. Yeah. That's the answer... I should delete an intelligent thought in the face of the onslaught of 'dumb' I'm being hit with...

       Q) Why don't you get into a mental battle with an idiot?

       A) Because they'll drag you down to their level and beat you with experience.

       So, rather than intelligently explain or defend your call to genocide, you simply choose to call names.  I sort of expect as much from your kind, but usually they at least put up a semblance of a fight first.

       All these are the hallmarks of a leftist.  Especially the 'wiped out' part.  Your kind so love to eliminate dissenters.  You can't even stand for me to post in your thread.
