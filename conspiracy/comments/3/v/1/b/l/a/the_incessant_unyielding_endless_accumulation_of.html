    <div class="md"><p>As soon as endlessly amassing wealth to use as power to make more wealth, at the expense of lots of other people, becomes apparent as what it is - neither natural or of any social use - then something can be done about it. </p>

<p>As long as the wealth controls every aspect of the human condition to its gain, nothing will be done about it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s an excersize in futility anyway, because even if intelligence were to &quot;break out enmasse&quot; and all us peons were to coalesce into action, it&#39;s way too late. </p>

<p>Are you responsible for AIDS because you haven&#39;t wiped it out?</p>

<p>No. You&#39;re not.</p>

<p>With our growth a a species we&#39;re supposed to move away from the strongest richest beat all the lesser and take all the resources.</p>

<p>Mankind can&#39;t run as fast as the big cats, isn&#39;t as strong as the great apes, can&#39;t plumb the depths of the oceans without machines...</p>

<p>Know what we&#39;re good at? Know why we are &quot;the number on species&quot; on the planet?</p>

<p>That lump of matter inside our heads. The stronger that &quot;muscle&quot; gets, the further ahead we get. We&#39;ve glorified violence, and muscular strength, and all the &quot;sports&quot; aspects of our species while not bothering to nurture the ONE THING that has caused us to excel...</p>

<p>our brains. our minds. our intellect.</p>

<p>Evolution isn&#39;t about killing everything that doesn&#39;t agree with you... it&#39;s about using the qualities that have allowed us, humans, to work our way up from being some frail pink soft creature to walking on the moon... and beyond.</p>

<p>Sorry. It&#39;s no longer time for &quot;look how far I can throw this spear and kill you with it&quot;. It&#39;s time to think. It&#39;s time to figure out what we&#39;re going to do as a species and get fucking busy with it.</p>

<p>Eradication has good as well as bad connotations. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a genetic disease - an abnormality - and it&#39;s no less deadly than any viral killer because those who have the disease have zero mercy towards any other humans except where those people may have some part to play in their scheme.</p>

<p>Personally I am so far to the right, politically, that I am damn near almost an anarchist, so they can all go to hell for all I care.  Especially the republican party.</p>

<p>But the left especially sickens me.  Some on the right can be greedy assholes, but the left is something else entirely.  At best, stupid, and at worst, the ultimate evil.</p>
