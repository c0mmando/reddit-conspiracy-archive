<p>t seems that &#39;they&#39; have won and humanity has lost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What you have to realize is that &quot;they&quot; not only won back in 1700s but &quot;they&quot; have been in charge for all of our entire existence. Are you healthy? Is your family healthy? Do you have a roof over your head and enough food to eat? Do you have internet access and enough free time to beat it when you want to? Then for all the corrupt bullshit going down right in front of our eyes, it&#39;s not so bad... </p>

<p>In the meantime, fully prepare yourself and your family for any and all disasters that could occur that might put your livelihood and well being at risk:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Have food and water on hand in case the food supply chain goes down for whatever reason.</p></li>
<li><p>Own <strong>at least</strong> one firearm in case your town or city destabilizes for whatever reason.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not have all your money as 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s on a computer screen. There will come a time when the financial system has to &quot;reset&quot; and if you don&#39;t have your money in your physical possession (cash, gold/silver, real estate, hard assets, etc), it will be taken. We saw what happen in Greece and we may get the &quot;haircut&quot; too sometime down the line.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Once you&#39;ve done everything you can do to <em>reasonably</em> prepare yourself, family and friends for whatever may come, then that&#39;s all you can do. Past that, whatever happens is God&#39;s Will/Blind Chance and we have no control over it. Tell your family you love them and continue to spread the truth to those that will listen (and don&#39;t try and convince the naysayers/debunkers because they won&#39;t change). And If/When the Big One does hit, make sure  you&#39;re the one helping people survive, not stomping the dead and trampling the weak. </p>

<p>Good luck and God Speed, Brother.</p>

<p>Never talk about that kind of shit on the internet or on a telephone. If you wanted to &quot;peacefully fight&quot; meaning protest without violence, then I would suggest you coordinate with people you trust and know in person and when you need to communicate use snail mail. Pick your battles and realize that anything obvious will land you in the clink for life. When you do something (peaceful), make it look as if someone else did it. </p>

<p>Realize one thing: there&#39;s no Death Star to blow up in one swift shot that makes everything Happily Ever After. Yes, people in many countries have had to rise up against governments and factions, and I&#39;m sure the exhilaration of such moments must be great, but it comes at a HUGE cost. The destruction of social structure is not something pretty.</p>

<p>So just sit on the couch and numb oneself with Netflix? If you want change, make a difference, there are many ways to go for it at your local level. Simple things like volunteering that might not seem to make a dent on the <em>Grand Global Cabal</em>... but might change a person&#39;s life, outlook and possibilities. </p>

<p>Sometimes, it&#39;s much better to start with oneself. Changing oneself for the better can be quite difficult.</p>

<p>And be very careful with the kind of seemingly well-intentioned person that talks about <em>revolution</em> and <em>setting things into motion</em> and wants you to start going into violent actions. If you&#39;ve followed many of the events and <em>heroically foiled plots</em> mentioned in this and other subs, most of the time they are covert or paid Three Letter Agencies informants trolling for the next Lone Wolf patsy.</p>

 An awakening like this is unknown in chronicled history, and they may just be sweating a bit, that&#39;s why they will probably want to usher in total control as fast as possible.</p>

<p>Will they make it? </p>

<p>Not if we stand together and refuse to hate each other, fight each other and go to war with each other. Their greatest success is our fear and hate, their greatest fear our peace, undestanding, cooperation and compassion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, they had observed some monkeys which had acquired a habit that no other monkeys had yet exhibited in other locations.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m upvoting because you make a good point that we simply do NOT know what&#39;s going on behind the scenes and how much resistance is actually occurring. Think about it for a minute - the powers that be pulled off a stunningly successful psy-op at Sandy Hook. Although some well-trained eyes were able to see through it, the vast majority, such as myself, completely bought it. It wasn&#39;t until I got suspicious after many of these hoaxes that I came back around to Sandy Hook and discovered the lies. It didn&#39;t even occur to me back then, because news had not yet been faked to the extent it started in 2012.</p>

<p>Despite that stunning success, they STILL failed to get any meaningful gun control legislation through. The president signed a few mental health executive orders, and a couple of states limited clip sizes, but many more states actually loosened gun restrictions. The plan backfired. That&#39;s not to say everything is failing - they&#39;ve managed to put France on lockdown with one of their false flags and seem to be building support for an invasion of Syria. But there are many goals they are not reaching, and as a result, plans are constantly changing.</p>

<p>So to look at everything as a lost cause is a mistake, as it&#39;s not only disabling, but untrue. People ARE waking up all over - some of my friends who thought I was a 9/11 whackjob now see through these fake shootings and realize what&#39;s happening. The internet IS probably the greatest enemy of the elite right now, which is why hammering your local representatives any time neutrality is threatened (as it will be again with the TPP), is very necessary and <strong>still effective</strong>. Most senators and congressmen, believe it or not, are not on board with some NWO agenda.</p>

Automatically accepting to support new wars and sacrificing your blood and same loved ones&#39; in far away wastelands.</p>

<p>Learn to read between the lines, spot the bullshit that passes as news, the incongruences and doublespeak, the &#39;valued allies&#39; from yesterday that become today&#39;s tyrants and monsters that we need to topple.

    <div class="md"><p>People need to understand that anyone on earth can be your friend.  Cognitive dissonance is the real enemy. I don&#39;t believe that tptb are the true enemy because they are just ignorant animals. Just like the animals that blow themselves up. The true enemy is the mind that makes them do things that are harmful; the cause. </p>

<p>It&#39;s crazy to me that people think we are stuck in this cycle of war and peace. When you ask people why there is a need for war they tell you that you can&#39;t know peace without it. Like some clever philosopher. But if you ask anyone if they want war they tell you no. Why when there is an obvious majority of the human race that wants to live in peace and harmony it is not so? The world is completely upside down. Now I am led to believe to hate the Islamic faith because some nutjobs, who everyone immediately assumed was ISIS for some reason, shot up a theater in Paris. Some of the nicest people I have ever met and am still friends with are Muslim. </p>

<p>I think the only fight we need to fight is to stop the poisoning of your mind by opening up to the idea that everyone believes in different degrees of bullshit and that behind the stupidity of some people there is still a soul. That no matter how vile the acts of certain human beings are they are the product of an infested mind and is not to be hold as an example for a race or idea. From what I&#39;ve seen here on this subreddit everyone seems to understand this to some degree and that gives me a lot of hope. I also see this on reddit and in daily life. People seem to start and trust their own senses and experiences more and more instead of what we are being fed down our throats. I do have hope there is a tipping point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is probably the best post here imho. </p>

<p>The problem is within, in the mind as you say. Those in power are simply there, because humanity has allowed this to happen, because we are at a stage of development where we still believe war, hatred and conflict is the solution the majority of our problems. Once we collectively decide that enough is enough and we choose peace instead, this planet will become an uncregonizable place, a heaven if you will. </p>

<p>We are at a turning point right now where this will either happen or it won&#39;t, where humanity will evolve and choose peace or choose war and ....well, we all know the alternative isn&#39;t pretty. </p>

<p>Lets make sure we make the right choice and end the conflict within each and every one of us - the outer change will then follow with ease. </p>

<p>There is no limit to greed. It grows by destroying efficiency in systems. </p>

<p>It will not stop, on its own, until it destroys every system that civilization has constructed.</p>

<p>The people who gain the most from greed tend to be leaders. The people who seek leadership power tend to not care about others. They are generally sociopaths.</p>

<p>For an almost immediately brighter future, point out the problem of greedy sociopathic leadership and fight to screen out  the most obvious and greedy  sociopaths from leadership positions.</p>

<p>Any of those personality types would be run out of office immediately by sheer public pressure. The pope is a recent example. He was made to &#39;retire&#39; after saying that pedophilia
 was almost normal now.</p>

<p>The pope resigned a few weeks after saying pedophilia is near normal</p>

<p>Since the public has decided that those personality types will not be tolerated in leadership positions, we could add this one more crucial type to the list and change the world immediately except for the resistance of some misdirected opponents and a large majority who have never considered the issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you give a specific  example?</p>

<p>Social pressure works in every case. Third world dictators may take   more  but social pressure works in all cases.</p>

<p>Leaders can get away with inhuman atrocities but they cannot survive against concerted  public pressure. </p>

<p>Public pressure can be brought to bear easily for sex crimes, or racism among other offenses.</p>

<p>Having a lack of conscience should be added to the list of traits considered intolerable.</p>

<p>Sociopaths only consider one  single factor when making decisions, personal greed.</p>

<p>Personal greed is not leadership, so they are not actually leaders in the first place. They are common criminals.Sociopaths, who typically  produce ideas like indefinite detention, and endless war,  should be screened out of  all positions of power by the use of social pressure.   They do far too much harm to be tolerated any more.</p>

<p>You disagree with that,  wow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s a &quot;taboo area&quot; ?  Mugabe gets away with racism.  Saddam Hussein got away just fine, plenty of support inside his country, with slaughtering the Kurds and others.  Idi Amin had a long reign in Uganda, plenty of support from plenty of the population.  The leaders of North Korea have support inside the country.</p>

<p>These leaders don&#39;t exist in isolation; they reflect a large segment of their country, and are supported by it, and do things approved by those people.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how to cure the world of racism and witch-burnings and sex crimes and atrocities.  But I can see that they don&#39;t seem to be going away, at least not quickly.  Pretending that they are, that somehow leaders can no longer be racist or murderous, isn&#39;t useful.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re in the political North, then you&#39;re probably most terrified of civil war/state terrorism of the same purseuasion as Lybia, Ukraine, and Syria have recently befallen. Or perhaps if you&#39;re in a politically northern superpower or border state you&#39;re afraid of assymetric warfare with heavy and non-conventional long range munitions.</p>

<p>Either way, fire control and medical care will be the deciding factor in the survival of at minimum tens of thousands of lives. Shooting guns and building bombs is child&#39;s play compared to saving lives. </p>

Someone posted a new 9/11 documentary over on / documetarys  a few days ago, highly recommend it. It is called incontrovertible . plugged it for karaoke last night, while singing for what it&#39;s worth .<br/>
Small steps, each one teach one.
Keep the conversation flowing. Also I believe change here in the states will not come until the rest of the world gets serious about prosecuting our warcriminals. And they most definitely Seem to be getting tired of gov&#39;s shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That fear is the first stage of awakening, it passes. &quot;They&quot; are not one homogeneous group, they are many different groups all vying for more power and control. Their empire&#39;s are all built on distraction, manipulation, coercion, fear, and above all ignorance. </p>

<p>The good news in all of this is that the current system has shown itself to be completely unsustainable in all of those aspects. There will hard times in the world coming soon. But once conflicts arise all the cards are on the table, they have no way of knowing what will happen after. So right now they are trying to set in peoples mind for the future after the conflict that more governance is needed, not less.</p>

<p>It may seem like we lost, but lots of people are waking up and realizing the matrix for what it is. It&#39;s a long path, and you cant see everyone who is walking it. I think there are many millions in the U.S. that are completely not buying what the government or media tells them. For instance, the MSM has abysmally low ratings, especially for the population. Alternative news stomps the crap out of there numbers, and there are TONS of different alternative media outlets. For things to start changing positively the most important aspect of all is to realize you have been excessively lied to and manipulated about everything by the government, media, and the corporations. We are already there, I just hope there are enough of us in the end.</p>

People who don&#39;t, aren&#39;t called realists, but get labeled with derogatory terms like defeatist, depressed, cowardly ... when in fact, the exact opposite is true. It takes balls to stare the beast straight into the eyes and admit you&#39;re no match. It doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t put up a noble fight, but winning&#39;ll boil down to sheer luck. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no coming back from this dystopian straight-jacket society, it&#39;s not going to magically blow over. People won&#39;t stand up, because most lack the guts to face themselves, their limits etc. That would mean to give up on all the delusional supply they tap into to get through the day in the first place. </p>

<p>This society is set up by sociopaths for sociopaths. To beat them at their own game is to become one and to abandon all morality you so passionately wanted to protect. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve been stripped of any propper recourse, any way to effectively oppose anything. It&#39;s still an ongoing process, but it&#39;s clearly being finalized.</p>

<p>The answer is in the question, but the question is wrong.  </p>

<p>Your question should be: what&#39;s the most effective thing I can be doing right now to turn this situation around?  (Or, in the case that I am yet-another-industry-goon trying to mass manipulate, what&#39;s the best way for me to redeem myself from the evil I&#39;m doing / have done to injure my fellow humans?)</p>

<p>There have been 3 similar sentiments in <a href="/r/911truth">/r/911truth</a>.  You won&#39;t find them, they were deleted after I shined a light on those as well.  I made all 3 of them go away by asking them what they&#39;ve done for 9/11 truth.  I also made a post about &#39;techniques they use&#39; and surprise: we don&#39;t get posts like this anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a serious problem. People are in such a dark place spiritually they assume this system, debt based money, is essential to their existence. So many people believe that money is the literal life force.  They aren&#39;t quite conscious of it, they just have a basic grasp of it, I&#39;ve been stuck in that mentality most of my life, so I know how it&#39;s quite jarring to even question it.  It seemed dirty to question it.  Instead, we debate around the edge of it, like minimum wage.</p>

<p>&quot;We need to raise minimum wage / no we don&#39;t,&quot; arguments like these is nearly pointless in our broken economic system.  We&#39;re changing the dials but we&#39;re not fixing the gears.  And of course, because this stuff is not discussed on television or in the newspapers or on the radio, people think everything is hunky-dory.  The gears don&#39;t need fixing, silly, just the dials need a bit of tweaking.  &quot;Well the solution to debt is to spend less and earn more, duh! Just work hard - you too could become a billionaire!&quot;  Wise up quickly please, this is not just your future but the future of humanity.  You might have enough money right now, you might have more than your neighbors, you might be doing fine.  What about your kids, and grandkids, and so on?  As this disparity grows more and more severe, costs rise higher and higher, wages stagnate, fees and taxes and penalties take away any notion of financial security, the masses are in permanent debt, currency creation is consolidated more and more, the endgame is that you and everyone you know is ends up a serf.  Maybe you can sell your soul and move up the ladder a bit and look down on the rest.  You&#39;ll get yours for a while, sure.  But is that the world you really want to live in?  Where we&#39;re all crawling over each other for the chance to brownnose to the upper class?  The solutions are out there: localized economies.  Your upcoming permanent servitude to centralized currency will be packaged as a &quot;convenience&quot; to your overly busy life.  Maybe you&#39;ll even get a prize!  Don&#39;t fall for it.  Money is nothing but basic math, and today it is even more trivial, merely bits in a computer.  We can opt to change the program, we don&#39;t have to live this way forever.  Where do we get the idea that this is the way it HAS to be?  Seriously, ask yourself that.  Where did YOU get the idea that this economic system is the one-and-only best-of-all-time-forever economy?  How did it get in your head to think CONSTANTLY about money, that you need more of it, more than everyone else... money is &quot;just there&quot;, like water, like air, it&#39;s just naturally occurring, don&#39;t worry about where it came from... just WANT it...</p>

<p>Money is supposed to help with division of labor.  So we could prosper together as communities, each of us specializing in a skill/trade and using money as a means of bartering between us, keeping us honest, keeping score, rewarding hard work and innovation.  But that system has become perverted.  Generally, we tend to live by that system in small groups, and that&#39;s how it appears to work.  But over top, it has been corrupted and now the pool is being siphoned, withdrawing vast piles of unearned and undeserved wealth into the hands of leeches.  Those elites, should they choose, can wield power and influence over our communities by virtue of having astronomically higher amounts of wealth.  Was this the purpose of money?  Instead of a division of labor, we have a centralization of power.  The economy has been corrupted and twisted, and now it veers towards taking it all the way into global digital totalitarianism.  The power of money still lies in enabling the division of labor, without it, the wealthy cannot control the laborers.  So a careful balancing act from above is currently necessary, so that on the one hand, our work will still enable us to make ends meet, but on the other hand, the elite can still lord over the workers, because if the money of the elite fell back into the hands of the labor pool, inflation would rise and there would be no leverage for the elite to wield control.</p>

<p>The solution then is to move to an economic system that enables division of labor, but denies elitist control.  How?  There are a number of methods.  One is the creation of currency: who can create it, and who gets it when it is made?  The most obvious solution is that governments can create their own (on all levels, country, provincial, city, community), and it&#39;s distributed equally to all citizens when it is made.  The citizens then, if they wish to rise above the &quot;mincome&quot;, must work and barter in a competition to gain more money.  Yet in this system, I predict bankers will fall and farmers will rise.  There would be lazy people who slip by on the mincome, but that&#39;s already how it is.  There would also be creative artists and inventors whose passion is enabled by mincome.  And very few would be comfortable living at the minimum level of subsistence, they would work to rise above it.  So ask yourself, what is better: that we must compete with each other to get crumbs from the money created and distributed to a privileged group, or that we must compete with each other to get the money that was created and distributed equally to all?</p>

<p>That is the best solution I can think of.  It would be complex and difficult at first, but would settle into prosperity relatively quickly once the majority of people realize how awesome it is.  Other solutions, involving patching our current system, would be maximum incomes, company equity among workers, salary ratio caps... but all these are patches and don&#39;t fix the underlying problem.  But mincome, as proposed, is just another patch, and it isn&#39;t going to work without a decoupling from reliance on foreign currency creation.  It is only going to be sustainable if those communities directly create a currency as the means to provide a mincome.</p>

<p>In conclusion, while there are alternative solutions, it&#39;s far far worse than anyone I&#39;ve met seems to understand, the power that the bankers hold is unreal.  It&#39;s also an extremely fragile power that can be broken easily - at least in theory.  Everything else is a distraction to this issue.  Money is actually a religion, it is the &quot;New World Religion&quot; that they will never actually tell you about, but people are indoctrinated into it, and ready to sacrifice their liberty on the altar of the Economy for it.  People believe in it fervently and its underlying utility is based on faith.  All the other basic religions are there to serve as a distraction - those are presented as the real religions, so you never think there is something at the top.  But the truth is money is our actual religion (albeit a Satanic one), because it is based on faith.  And you&#39;ll see preachers for it everywhere, infesting the mass media, especially the entertainment complex, which sings the praises of money all day long.  The true spirituality of this reality, those that are brought about by communion with psychedelic plants, music, people, and nature, are of course absent from any education system. </p>

<p>The next step will be the Mark of the Beast, it is 90% of the way here in the form of credit cards and digital banking, but if they can get that chip, tattoo, or transplant then it&#39;s another lock-in on our slavery.   You&#39;d be almost totally helpless to resist against such a system, for you&#39;d be blacklisted from economic transactions and be unable to eat or rent.  Do you realize the horror that is capable under such a system?  Your own family could be raped by those higher up the ladder than you and you&#39;d just have to watch on and accept it.  That type of evil bullshit happened in feudal times, and it will be far worse if it happens with current technology.</p>

<p>There is one final layer of control above money, but it&#39;s a &quot;thin film&quot;, and isn&#39;t as widespread as money - the master/slave relationship between two people.  Check this out to learn more, as it&#39;s a good summation of many things:</p>

<p>Sure, there are lots of things wrong with USA. As such a wealthy and skilled country, we should be doing a LOT better on various fronts: education, healthcare, gun-control, justice, race, equality, infrastructure, etc.</p>

<p>But don&#39;t forget the huge strengths we have. Stable, strong institutions. World-dominant or world-class industries: entertainment, software, medicine, universities, biotech, energy, finance, military, aerospace. Natural resources. Skilled people. Many people all over the world want to immigrate to USA. Investors consider USA and US govt debt to be safest places to invest.</p>

<p>Sure, we need to correct the tax system, fix money in politics, etc.  All possible.  We went through a similar thing around 1900 with Teddy Roosevelt.</p>
