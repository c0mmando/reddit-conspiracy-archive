        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><h3>Actually tired of this</h3>

<p>Tired of the establishment trying to so hard to discredit alternative medicine.  I&#39;m going to drop some science on them -- <em>their own</em> science, an act of detournement that would surely give them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploding_head_syndrome">exploding head syndrome</a> if they didn&#39;t have mile-thick-bodysnatcher-defenses against their willfully-obstinate, cognitive dissonances.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Conspiracy to Demonize Pytopharmaceuticals</h3>

<p>Medical Authorities (ex: NIH, Webmd, WHO, etc) oscillate between <em>demonizing herbs as dangerous</em> and then <em>disregarding</em> them, smugly, as <em>&#39;ineffective&#39;</em>.  It&#39;s typical controlled opposition behavior, to create cognitive dissonance, confusion and confounding so that no one discovers the truth.  Which is their problem with herbs: that they sometimes work (demonstrated below), and sometimes they work better than anything they can fool you into spending a lot of money on (more on this below.)</p>

<p>Naturopathy / herbalism holds that one should do no harm, this means not taking risk, which means gentle fixes, coaxing the body into wellness.  But we now have access to increasingly stronger extracts, and more people willing to take larger &quot;risks&quot; with supplements.  This is good if you know what you are doing, bad if you don&#39;t.  The latter forms the basis with which the establishment has on many occasions (FDA) attempted to &#39;protect us&#39; from ourselves--you know, us morons--by limiting what we can buy at the store.  This is a ruse.  Because they said it themselves, the dang things don&#39;t work!</p>

<p>That said, herbalists and practitioners like myself who do actual research know that If herbs work in a small way, in tea, then if you concentrate their pharmacologically active chemical components, you will have a formulation that can compete with a pharmaceutical offering.  Uh oh, suddenly there is <em>competition</em>.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s precisely what has happened, since the advent of pressurized solvent extractions such as butanolic (popular in cannabis mmjds), or supercritical fluid extractions (SC02) used in high tech herbalism such as used by New Chapter and <a href="http://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/ingredient/45/Oregano">Gaia herbs supplements</a>.</p>

<p>In contrast, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2582668/">some antidepressants have been outed as placebos</a>, and here&#39;s <a href="http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20080227/antidepressants-no-better-than-placebo">more info on webmd about it</a>, with links to the studies.  The reason people have reported them working is because they are clearly psychotropic--they make you think and feel overtly, noticeably different.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant_discontinuation_syndrome">The tingling means: it&#39;s working</a>.  (Except that it&#39;s <em>not</em>, but <em>your hopefulness is</em>.)</p>

<p>This, to my mind, is a <em>conspiracy</em>, albeit more of a <em>perception / deception war</em> -- a conspiracy of <em>profit-motivated, disinformation promoting annoyance</em>, astroturfing.  It&#39;s pernicious.  It&#39;s vile.  And it&#39;s hurting people because it&#39;s keeping them from inexpensive, easy and more healthful solutions than what doctors have to offer in many cases (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_resistance">one-trick pony penicillin overuse that&#39;s causing resistant bacteria</a>).</p>

<hr/>

<h4>NIH&#39;s very misleading herbal outreach pages</h4>

<p>On the NIH &#39;complementary and integrative healt&#39; outreach pages, <a href="https://nccih.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm">&#39;herbs at a glance page&#39;</a> links to infopages that display only a few prominent medical uses of each herb, universally followed by a disclaimatory statement of <a href="https://nccih.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm">&#39;there being not enough evidence to support these claims&#39;</a>.  </p>

<p>But if you search for those claims on NIH itself, you&#39;ll often find studies, numbers and the results--why not list those on the corresponding herb page?  Oh that&#39;s right, because you want to give the run-down, which is that herbs &quot;don&#39;t really work.&quot;  At what point does the highmost medical authority in the world decide if there is sufficient evidence?  Does it need Daddy FDA&#39;s approval to verify the science that&#39;s already verified?  Don&#39;t they know FDA is informed by specifically by NIH studies?</p>

<hr/>

<h4>Curious, what&#39;s Omitted</h4>

<p>As an herbal practitioner of decades, I find it most interesting that some of the most effective herbs are not represented on that page.  Specifically <strong><em>Origanum vulgare (oregano), Thymus vulgaris (thyme), Rosmarinus officianalis (rosemary), Syzygium aromaticum (clove)</em></strong>.  If I were a professional, I would I recommend these above all others.  And this would be tempered by the knowledge of <em>evidenced based pharmacological effects cited across an overwhelming number of NIH studies, specifically</em>.</p>

<hr/>

<h4>Finally, the Science</h4>

<p>The aforementioned grouping of aromatic herbs are among the most powerful because of the most prominent chemical constituents they contain--primarly the following terpenes:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carvacrol">carvacrol</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymol">thymol</a>, </li>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinene">pinene</a>, </li>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>There&#39;s a saying about how one must try their own soup before giving to others.  I googled, could not find.  The idea is that when using herbalism you have to try it yourself first, to learn from it, to know it is safe.  This is something medical doctors do not do.  I asked my doctor if he&#39;d ever taken the ketamine therapy himself.  &quot;Of course not&quot; he said matter-of-factly.  This was surprising to me, given the grandiosity of the effects (level 5 psychedelic experience -- reality 100% destroyed)</p>

<p>Those who practice herbalism responsibly--on themselves first--view herbal supplements as an inexpensive, long term solution with (permanent) results.  Tell you&#39;re doctor you&#39;re taking oregano pills and they&#39;ll roll their eyes at you, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;well you&#39;ll smell like a pizza but it&#39;s probably harmless.&quot; --actual doctor said this to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pizza the above science, bitch.  It kills the MRSA your dirty hospital gave my mom and 5 other people I know.</p>

<p>You tell them it&#39;s worked for you, and again, <em>eye roll</em>, &quot;yep, that&#39;s the placebo effect at work.&quot;  Given that this <em>placebo</em> thing works so much better than what they&#39;re selling, it&#39;s a shame we can&#39;t market and sell these placebo things.  We&#39;d cure everyone and make a killing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great collection of articles. I don&#39;t know anything about herbalism myself so I am not going to enter into that discussion but I definitely agree with your points on medical practices and how screwed up everything is. </p>

<p>And these days every little thing that you might think is wrong with you you go to the doctor. Have a little cough for longer than a week, go to a doctor and get medicine. Constipated? Medicine. Feeling down? Medicine. Stubbed your toe? Medicine. </p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18849101">here&#39;s</a> fun little article about how when doctors around the world go on strike the mortality rate seems to paradoxically drop. I once had a better source from Israel about how in one month of doctor&#39;s strikes the mortality rate dropped by a whopping 30%. I&#39;ll have a look for that article.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>upvoted for being true, nothings cut and dry and anyone saying so isnt being honest</p>

<p>no one is talking about eating acres of something as an integral part of the diet.  i&#39;m talking about taking them medicinally (short term), not alimentarily (long term).   Medicinally with herbs means weak / tea over a long time, or a lot over a short time.  I would recommend someone take oregano for only a week and then stop  (no one drinks oregano tea--yuk).  Yes, you are right that large doses taken, especially large doses over time take the same toll on your liver and kideys as would any pharmaceutical product.  That said, a key difference is that these herbal extracts, although potent, are also crude.  Which means they have hundreds of compounds in them, so the idea that it takes all the more massive a dose to incur the toxic effects of any one chemical in the &#39;soup&#39;--this inherently makes crude extracts safer, so long as there is not any known toxic constituent in it (like in chinese licorice or comfrey as examples)</p>

<p>Pay attention, folks. That is how you put together a post.</p>

<p>I applaud you, and I agree with you 100%. The medical industry is crooked as fuck, and as more and more research shows that alternative medicine does in fact work, you can expect the slander and downright malicious attacks on alternative medicine to continue, and escalate. </p>

<p>It&#39;s absolutely disgusting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if this is a conspiratorial thing, or just capitalism at work. The medical industry makes its cash on selling crap, regardless of its effectiveness, and the average doctor will jump at it when asked specifically for a certain med. A lot of people feel a little sad, call it depression, and ask for antidepressants. It&#39;s long been known and documented in the medical literature that antidepressants generally <em>don&#39;t</em> work, and they only stand a chance at working if a serotonin re-uptake problem is the issue to begin with. Ahh, capitalism ... sell sell sell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shots are a tough thing. Because, scientifically, most of them work to an extent. However, they also introduce dangerous things into the body. And on top of all of that, you will be lied to constantly about them, and nobody at your hospital will <em>actually</em> know anything about them that wasn&#39;t regurgitated from the manufacturer.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll have to find the specific shots they offer, check out the research, run the math with risks based on the numbers (which are probably fudged by the manufacturer, sadly), and make your own decisions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t allow the doctors to use a pacifier or formula, be prepared for them to pressure you or ignore your requests, they will say it&#39;s more beneficial. If you insist on breast feeding, as you should, they will pressure you to use both formula and breast feeding, completely ignoring the issue of nipple confusion.</p>

<p>Source: have family that worked as a social worker for pregnant teenagers and would spend 9 months explaining the benefits and pleading with mothers to breast feed, usually to no avail because the mother&#39;s misplaced trust in doctors overrules the 9 months of facts and mothers go right along with it. They&#39;ll say things like &#39;your baby needs to gain x amount of pounds, give them the formula full of fats.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My personal belief is that with these superbugs: mrsa vrsa and the new &quot; phantom menace&quot; disease that is neutralizing gut health defenses and simultaneously weaponizing friendly flora (allegedly...thus is the new Ebola)... I believe herbal wide spectrum solutions are going to be more effective than regular treatments.</p>

<p>I say that because in the middle ages there was a group of people who survived the plague:  perfumists, who became thieves.  Perfumes then were made of essential oils of various plants, animal musk glands.  These oils also had antiseptic, antimicrobial and pharmacological activity such as  immunemodulating properties.   Its believed that the historical &quot;four thieves cure&quot; was some combination of oils available and widely used at the time.</p>

<p>Thus would be the typical spice herbs I mentioned, but perfume wise lavender, rose, ginger, wood essences like spruce pine (male fragrances), Clary sage, bergamot, citrus, jasmine, patcholi, marigold, germanium, neroli,  musks... Many of these have similar activity against pathogens but to a lesser degree than the ones in the original post. </p>

<p>No one really knows thape formula for 4 thieves.  As with soma, the secrets are lost to time</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in a sucky situation with only a kundke fire today so forgive my brevity...typing on it sucks.</p>

<p>Those supplements are all very good esp for controlling inflammation.  Whuch means immunomodulating.  The lions mane and bacopa are good cognitive enhancers -- they are generally safe and effective, mild.  </p>

<p>Be careful of any others for this purpose,  specifically herbs with galantamine (,or hydergine).  These are <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholinesterase_inhibitor"> reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitors</a> which means you&#39;ll have more free acetykcholine in the system until its cleared usually 24 hrs..too much though is very bad...nausea, severe muscle cramps and can be fatal.  Venoms and poisons are ACHel drugs.</p>

<p>This is the only category of herbalism I&#39;ve run into where it was almost a medical problem for me (galantamine-- snowdrop extract)</p>

<p>Mycomedicinals are very good.  Stamets&#39; brand.  Especially cordyceps and reishi.  Turkey tail is so aggressive and common you can collect yourself, dry it grind it and capsule it for the price they charge at the store.  I&#39;ve done this and there are no &quot;bad&quot; imitators to turkey tail--its easy to identify.</p>

<p>Also chaga mushroom and agarikon.  Stamets is cultivating agarikon and he&#39;s the only person on earth I believe.  Because he spent months trying to find another viable specimen by boating along a conifer laden coastline with a crew using binoculars trying to spot the massive shelf fungus in the trees</p>
