       Both my mother and father are completely devoted to fox news.  They refuse to watch anything else.  I feel like they are completely brainwashed.
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple weeks ago,  I couldn't take it anymore.  They had fox on tv in the background while we were eating dinner.  The anchors were babbling back and forth with the usual ISIS fearporn bullshit they're always spewing out.  Anyway,  I got up and walked over to the TV and turned it off.  "Hey I was watching that! " my dad yelled. I said to everyone that they were over exaggerating and trying to scare everyone, and that fox is the absolute worst news source on television.
      </p>
      <p>
       My dad thinks it is the best and everything they say is true and they would never intentionally lie to further an agenda.  I told him I would be more than happy to provide/show him evidence of their fuckery. he said he would "love to see the evidence because none exists" but later on.  I accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
       We both forgot about it and a week or two passed.  This morning he asked when I was going to show him proof of fox news manipulating him and lying to him.  I told him after dinner and he accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please help me bombard him with irrefutable evidence so he will stop watching that pathetic excuse for a news source,  once and for all! He is finally willing to hear me out and see the proof.  I want this to be executed flawlessly,  leaving him no choice but to be disgusted by fox. Any help is greatly appreciated!
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:. Mission failure. All I can do is hope for the best. This is a bummer.

       Here's a video highlighting the word ing they use to sway your opinion. They also use other forms of brainwashing like the tones they play at the beginning of the broadcasts.

       They use sigils too. A subconscious form of witchcraft.

       If you want to go a little more intellectual, take it back to Edward Bernays.  Called "The Father of Public Relations" , he worked in the administration of Woodrow Wilson designing propaganda techniques to get the American public interested in WW1, also a nephew of Freud.  He wrote a handy guide for us: 'Propaganda' (1928):
       <a href="http://whale.to/b/bernays.pdf">

       In there he describes the importance of news media in the field of topographical psychology (mass brainwashing).

       You have to teach him some logic. The problem can't be solved without teasing apart the tangled hairball coughed up by Fox and its CIA advisors every day. You might start with one story or premise. Go to George Washington's Blog. Pic a story that he debunks and juxtapose it with the story Fox is hyping.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prediction: the closer you get to proving any truth to him the more angry he will become. You may be even kicked out of the house.

       Just be patient, introduce them to new information slowly, do not overwhelm them with info. They will get angry and lash out and you'll end up fighting. I went through this with my parents and it took a while now my dad sends me articles that I never thought he'd accept as true back a few years ago, they have come a long way, but it was a long... Long road

       I just wanted to say that everyone is their own gatekeeper. Nobody can have their opinions altered by others without first opening themselves up. The fact that your dad is even willing to listen is a great start!
      </p>
      <p>
       His opinion won't change over night, but you can plant the seed that allows for growth and change. One of the bigger things you can do to help your dad is show him how to find reputable, unbiased internet sources. Show him how to google! Teach the man to fish for himself, etc.

       All I do is say, when I hear a made up "fact," "That's not true" and say what the truth is and, when pressed, find the actual data (i.e., the case-by-case basis strategy). It's easy to do with the yelling talking heads, because they mostly just make preposterous shit up and try to make people as angry and hateful as they sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't usually work, though, and mostly enrages my father. When he gets really pissed at me, though, about why I believe and dig into the things I do, I tell him, "I learned it from you, Dad, I learned it from you." Of course, that enrages him more, but it does serve to de-escalate a little. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't lost hope, though, because it's true - I'm a critical thinker BECAUSE of my Dad and I hope that, one day, I'll wrest my formerly-critical-thinking father's mind back from the boiling frog morass that is Fox News.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, please know that you're not alone out there!

       Good grief, the situation with my father is exactly the same.  This is the most intelligent man I've ever known and yet he just refuses to see whats right there before him - it drives me up the wall. I love him dearly and he's really all the family I've got, so I am constantly walking on eggshells around him (which, of course, means biting my tongue and ignoring the Fox News assholes who are talking in the background
       <em>
        practically every minute of the day
       </em>
       ); it saddens me to my core that he is so oblivious to this mind-rape despite being damn near a human lie detector. Seriously, I havent lied to this man since I was about 6 years old because there really is no point - doesn't matter who is lying about what...he just always knows! And yet, he eats this bullshit up with a spoon.  I've ruled out things like stupidity, hearing and/or visual impairment, and racism (although he IS kinda racist and loves him some N-bombs), and honest to Christ all that seems left is multiple personalities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bonus - hate with a side of hypocrisy: In the Bush years, my brother and I were having a good laugh about Dubya's mental midget status during one of our Sunday dinners and my father nearly birthed an alpaca and let loose this gem, verbatim:
       <strong>
        He is your PRESIDENT - you WILL show some respect!
       </strong>
       Fast forward to Obama winning the election and that shit went right out the window. Ostensibly because...y'know...."not MY president!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Weird hit-and-run sanity bonus: after the first debate this year that enraged teatards from sea to shining sea, he turned to me and said "You were right about those assholes. Fuck Fox!"
      </p>
      <p>
       FML there's a glitch in the matrix bonus: his boycott lasted precisely three days....so much for strength of convictions, I guess...at least when it comes to this. How in the spotted the fuck can anyone debate a person who is this easily swayed? I think its becoming very clear why they are always against raising taxes for public education.

       Cripes, right on the nose with Presidential respect - I and my husband don't agree with the President but we treat him with respect Because By God our fathers taught us and beat it into us and wowza, they...don't. It's the weirdest phenomenon.

       I don't like your use of the word "teatards" - the Tea Party was just like Occupy and BLM - started with principles, were infiltrated quickly, and maligned by the media. Whenever family talks crap about Occupy or BLM, I remind them of what happened with the Tea Party and they immediately understand what I'm getting at, even if they don't really want to.

       My apologies for the slur....its a bad habit that should have peaked and gone away at the same rate of the Tea Party but it slips out every once in awhile.

       The presidential respect thing never fails to amaze me. Ever since Obama came along its as if that Sunday dinner argument never happened. And holy hell, can my father drop a stunning amount of n-bombs during one tiny soundbite...if I facepalm any harder, I might snap my neck.

       The problem is that people have been made to believe by the media owners that the media is required to tell the truth.  People accept this belief, and they begin to look to the television for their everyday truths, essentially turning the tv into their god...even building shrines to their god-box in their living rooms, making it the center focal point in the room, and placing pictures of their loved ones around it.  With 24-hr "truth" coming from their god-box, people no longer have a need to think; indeed they forget
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       to think.  They just believe what they are told to believe, without bothering to question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Convincing some people that their god would lie to them can be very difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have to come to terms with the
       <em>
        fact
       </em>
       that the media owners have freedom of the press as well as freedom of speech.  This also means they have freedom to tell you whatever lie they want.  They can tell you straight up lies that directly benefit their bottom line.  For example, check out
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Genie_Energy&amp;amp;diff=680299853&amp;amp;oldid=679807173">
        this (recently changed) wiki page on Genie Energy
       </a>
       , and see who's on their advisory board.  Now
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=genie+energy+syria&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8">
        google Genie Energy Syria.
       </a>
       See anything there that could be a conflict of interest?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing people have a hard time coming to terms with is the
       <em>
        fact
       </em>
       that "reporters" are nothing more than actors reading their lines off teleprompters.  Bill O doesn't go out on the street and track down stories.  He gets paid tens of thousands of dollars a day (
       <em>
        $77k per day
       </em>
       , last I heard) to sit in a red-white-and-blue studio, and look directly into a camera lens while reading off the tpt, and (1) make the viewer believe the words are his own, and (2) convince the viewer that his words are the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a good book on the subject called
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DTTEDPC/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;btkr=1">
        Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television, by Jerry Mander
       </a>
       .  He was an ad exec for many years, till circumstances opened his eyes.

       After a certain age, some people just really can't accept that what they've thought was reality for so long isn't right.  It's too painful for them.

       Try not to get angry at anyone you care about if they can't see what you show them, it's truly not their fault.  I see the dissonance in people I love, they know I'm intelligent and informed, but they can't let go.

       LOL I want to show my dad why he is wrong but I need others to do it for me. This is amazing. You tell your dad that he is being misled by people with an agenda and then you turn to a conspiracy subreddit to prove your case for you.

       Not at all.  I just want to be prepared and have as much proof as possible at hand.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.  If I go into the conversation ill prepared,  I will not be successful.  I have a few video clips and a couple articles that I have come across myself,  but I could really use help having backup ammo for the talk.   No need to ridicule me for that.  I finally have a chance to change my dads way of seeing the news,  and he is pretty well set in his views.  I can use all the help I can get.  Thanks for laughing at me though,  real cool.
