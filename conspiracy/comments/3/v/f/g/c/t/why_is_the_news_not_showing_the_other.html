       I dunno.  This is so odd.

       <strong>
        THREE
       </strong>
       people dressed in black combat gear hiding their faces.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police chase black SUV with no footage of said chase.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police shoot up SUV with no footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police say it was just the husband and wife, no third person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Case closed?  Fuck that.  There is more to this than what they are telling you.  Most likely their CIA handlers blackmailed them.  Told them to go park the SUV somewhere.   CIA handlers go shoot up place, then drive similar SUV past where the parents were told to wait.  Police roll up on them and turn the car into swiss cheese.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, is there any footage of them chasing the SUV or shooting at it?  If there is zero, then I'm calling BS.  You have LA/Southern California the king of high speed news chases, see OJ Simpson, but in this case no helicopter was allowed to follow this chase before they shot it up.  Not one?

       Well said. If this is how the event is being summed up, then there is a problem with that scenario. It makes no sense. Your more likely explanation makes more sense to me. But the problem we have now is we're moving away from explanations of events that involve
       <em>
        evidence
       </em>
       . Evidence has been replaced by faith-based explanations. An event occurs, the media are given a script as the event unfolds, and asking for evidence is considered crass, because we must respect the victims and their families, or somesuch. It's as if to ask for evidence is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while I like your explanation, there is no evidence. And it doesn't appear there is much evidence for the narrative we've been provided with in the mainstream coverage. At least as far as I know. And we won't get it, because asking for evidence is wrong. That's where we're at right now. And I think it's getting worse.

       I think releasing the the condo back to the landlord, then he lets the media in the condo all within 48 hours or so is extremely fishy.  Now if there was evidence in there that the police missed,it's surely been compromised.

       so weird, I want to know what is up with the 3rd guy.  I was watching the local news (I am in LA) and a husband and wife saw the 3rd guy that was hiding around a church as the sun went down.  They saw him with a rifle trying to play it off and running down an alley, taking his camo off and having an orange shirt underneath... anyone else heard about that?  The couple was on tv that night and they called the cops 3 times trying to help get him and they said they had him in custody....  all on the scanner too.

       That's TV ratings Fear Fuel.  Because why else let them rummage through the biggest mass shooting in SoCal's history crime scene after only 48 hrs?  I'm sure that refrigerator had to have been chalked to the gills with Hummus and baba ganoush when the reporters where looking through it.

       There certainly isn't much evidence based on the narrative they're giving but it's obvious to me that they have an agenda and that agenda is for every citizen to be a snitch and to contact authorities when

       This. There are way too many inconsistencies. Two eye-witnesses, including the officer on radio during engagement, reported a "dark skinned male". That is not a dark skinned male. The people will never know the real story and that makes me sick for the families that have lost loved ones during this tragedy. This is bigger than terrorism - rich powerful people are being protected by this scapegoat.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS After a little digging, I've found that these centers control up to $4.1B in state AND federal funds. I have not heard this reported on the news. Is this a coincidence?

       I take issue with her even being his wife without proof (why the different last name?), was his dating profile still up, is that her real name considering it is not a Pakistani name?

       So none of the family ever came over to the house to visit their mother, who lived with them? Have any of the injured that were at the baby shower his coworkers threw for them confirmed the burqa? Or is that just coming from them?

       From the NYT link you provided...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A second lawyer, Mohammad Abuershaid, described Ms. Malik as a “caring” and “soft-spoken” housewife who spoke Urdu and broken English. She prayed five times a day, he said, and did not drive.
        <strong>
         He added that male relatives of Mr. Farook had never seen her face because she always kept it covered in their presence.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        “She was a very, very private person,” Mr. Abuershaid said. “She kept herself pretty isolated.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       From a family lawyer, so make of it what you like. I also saw a snippet (somewhere) that the Imam at their mosque had never seen her either.

       The quality of that video is a little garbage but it does show the suspects being chased by the cops and then the subsequent shootout that happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       It might seem a little odd though that there aren't any news choppers hovering around getting the chase on video but then you have to realize that all the news stations with choppers are based out of LA and it would take a while to get from LA to San Bernardino.  I bet they planned it that way.

       That video does not show a shootout at all.  It shows a car being chased by police and then the sound of gunshots in the distance.  And who the fuck says "gunshots, we got gunshots" other than a cop or poorly scripted actor?

       You can see a muzzle flash from the car in the video posted, and there are a couple others available like
       <a href="https://youtu.be/ORII1IWoUGg">
        this one
       </a>
       . I'd say it's a pretty big stretch to say that the chase was faked, I was listening to the police feed during it and you could hear all the cops reacting. That as well as having to make fake videos seems a little unlikely.

       Agreed.  Both those videos don't show any conclusive evidence of police actually shooting up that car.  And that has to be the slowest police chase in history.  25 mph, maybe?
      </p>
      <p>
       Both people shooting the videos are suspect too.  The first dude has the same look on his face as a publishing clearing house winner at their front door,
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Px4qrt4.gifv">
        "My house is getting shot at right now.  Holy shit!"

       The second video practically is narrated out like a bad movie script,  "gun shots!  guns shots!  police! police!  car sounds! car sounds!  birds! birds!  clouds! clouds!  sun! sun!!!"

       This shows the 25 mph police chase.  Gun shots can be heard, but no visual evidence of them actually shooting at the suv.  I'm talking about videos shooting the suv where they found the bodies.  Those videos don't exist.

       Its another pussypass. Probably. Im honestly surprised there was a woman shooter at all assuming the media is telling us the whole truth, which i dont assume.
      </p>
      <p>
       But apparently that Saed fellow pledged allegiance to ISIS, which is exactly why i dont think this whole thing is right. Since when does ISIS allow women to shoot along with the men? Women are the ones they usually strap the bombs onto. The whole thing definitely smells like bullshit. I just wish we could have the goddamn facts and not all this other bullshit along with it

       Any idea what the story with the handcuffs was? The pictures of Farook dead on the pavement have him handcuffed. Like other stories like this, the bits and pieces don't make any sense yet.

       It is a general procedure across the nation to handcuff the suspect, even if it is a corpse. Happened in a few of the police shootings earlier this year.

       When I watched the video on the news, the SUV was a black one as the news said and filmed it  being next to a white picket fence on  a 4 laned street
      </p>
      <p>
       Then after looking online, i found this image:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The similar one in this photo (lower right hand corner) is identical but theres no damage to it yet in the other news pictures the suspects car was rammed by  the green swat truck and was heavily shot up and yet this one here is next to an island.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the images of the SUV on the other news coverage, no island is present. Is there a connection here? Hmm...

       Here's what we have: "On Friday it was claimed Tashfeen Malik had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State on Facebook prior to the rampage. Officials claimed Malik had posted her comment under a different name. Screenshots of the alleged post were not provided to the media."
      </p>
      <p>
       No evidence. Some unknown FBI agent said that she said, through a fake Facebook profile, something pledging allegiance to ISIS. This is certainly not evidence.

       Columbine, which included multiple kids specifically naming another kid in their class who participated. (I believe the kid they named was an FBI director's son as well)
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandy Hook had the chase through the woods as well as reports of more than one shooter, although those are far less substantial than the Columbine ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Aurora theatre shooting also had reports of more than one person in a gas mask. I believe more than one mask was found at the scene too. Again, multiple witnesses had the same claim that they saw another shooter.

       Dave McGowan did a great piece on the the Columbine Shooting entitled
       <a href="http://www.davesweb.cnchost.com/littleton.htm">
        Anatomy of a School Shooting
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In fact, one initial report from Littleton began: "Three young men in fatigues and black trench coats opened fire at a suburban Denver high school Tuesday...," and also noted that a "third young man was led away from the school in handcuffs more than four hours after the attack, and student Chris Wisher said: 'He's one of the ones who shot at us'" (Associated Press, April 20, 1999). This third suspect has, oddly enough, never been identified or even mentioned again by the press.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a televised interview, the mother of a student who had escaped the attack quoted her daughter as saying that she "looked up and saw a gunman in a black trench coat with a very huge gun ... He had dark brown hair, thick bushy eyebrows and was very ugly," a description that clearly did not fit either Harris or Klebold. When asked if the gunman was a student, the mother replied that: "She didn't recognize him as a student. No. Not as a student" (KUSA-TV, April 20, 1999; transcript posted on The Konformist)

       Yeah there is some really strange stuff going on there. IIRC many of the students actually said the third person was a student at the school and identified him by name. I believe there were multiple reports of him throwing explosives onto the roof of the school early on in the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, the quality of the eye witness statements at Columbine in regards to the third shooter seems to be far higher than those about Sandy Hook, and maybe only slightly better than the ones at Aurora.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always felt pretty strongly those Columbine witnesses were credible.

       For the aurora shooting, it was because he left through the exit, put a clamp on the door, and then came back in, which people confused as two people. Not sure about the source of the second mask, although bringing a spare isn't beyond believability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another case is the Ottawa shooting, initial reports had upwards of 5 "suspects", and an entire extra location that had no shooting (the Rideau Centre). Initial witness statements confused the parliamentary driver as an accomplice , and some plain clothed police (after the event) as being involved. There's video of the entire event from when he gets back in his car to the front steps of parliament that show no accomplices.

       No, I didn't.  The last line was tongue-in-cheek. My point was actually that while eye witness testimony, especially testimony about traumatic events, is notoriously inaccurate it doesn't mean that every single eye witness testimony ever given is inaccurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see it a lot in
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       where they believe the testimony of some, but completely dismiss others for the reason that they were involved in trauma and they probably are not remembering things right. I try not to selectively believe witnesses based on what they witnessed.

       the aurora movie theatre shooting was rumored to have an accomplice right, that someone had opened the exit door and came in, that there was multiple shooters?
      </p>
      <p>
       and sandy hook, the guy running from the school caught in the woods, all on tape from the view of a helicopter.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, whats the reasoning behind opening the opening the apartment of the san bernadino shooter to the media? isnt it a crime scene? seems like the media is trying to serve up indeniable proof that these were the only people involved, "see! see, look here, look with your eyes at the appartment!"

       Cops usually hold onto the most basic of crime scenes. A fight down the street from me as a kid happened and one guy pulled a gun, shot and missed, and that house was yellow-taped for five days and that was an isolated incident with two drunk suburbanites.

       The Oklahoma City Bombing, when a third suspect was initially part of the manhunt in addition to Tim and Terry.

       There was a report that the FBI has video footage of McVeigh with an as yet unidentified third suspect at the scene, in the van, and that McVeigh leaves
       <em>
        first.

       That's nothing out of ordinary. The imam is just terrified and saying what the authorities or media wants to hear.   Or he phrased it as the way it is in Muslim culture and the media twisted and made it sound as if its a big deal. It's not.

       Interestingly, she lived most of her life in Saudi Arabia:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Two Pakistani officials said Malik was from the Layyah district in southern Punjab province, but moved to Saudi Arabia with her father 25 years ago. She returned home five or six years ago to study to become a pharmacist at Bahauddin Zakariya University in Multan, they said.

       "Tashfeen Malik" should have had her photo taken many times as part of her K-1 Visa process. I know women who came here on K-1 visas. The Department of Homeland security should have photos of her before she came here as per the pre-marriage application proccess, on her passport, after she arrived at her local INS center, and when she got her greencard as a resident alien. She was fingerprinted and background checked, like everyone who came her on a K-1 and became a resident.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Tashfeen Malik" is just as guilty as her husband, but is treated as an afterthought or someone in the background, with people SPECULATING that she "radicalized" her husband.
      </p>
      <p>
       I submit to you that "Tashfeen Malik" is really a "code name". Her Facebook page was under a different name. Her name comes up empty on the databases online. Why is her last name different from her husband's? Is there any proof they were married? Is all the info coming from the family lawyer? What did the FBI agent really say about what we know about her? Where is he getting his info? Why didn't he give the media her photo that is IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM?
      </p>

       Lazy reporting or government cover-up?

       Enlightened people do worship the concept known as "Lucifer". The Bringer of Light is in opposition to the One God, because Lucifer knows that there isn't only one god.

       Too bad they all haven't figured out there is no God period. That would solve a shit ton of problems if we could have a worldwide enlightenment on that subject.

       While it is possible there could be some type of "spiritual" phenomenon that we haven't discovered or been able to explain yet, but it's safe to say that sky daddy ain't up there in the clouds looking down on of us worthless sinners who will sinners and garbage no matter what we do.

       Well, we can certainly know for sure that the god of the bible is not real.  It is real simple to figure that out since his primary characteristics contradict each other.

       There is no proof of that. Anyone can kill a baby for whatever reason they want to, you cannot pin that on a religion that doesn't even have prescribed rituals. Satanism is completely made up by it's practitioners.
