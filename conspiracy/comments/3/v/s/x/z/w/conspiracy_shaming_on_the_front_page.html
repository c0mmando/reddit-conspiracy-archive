    <div class="md"><p>Looks like a typical reddit hit job. The part that scares me is the 2nd highest post is about that Michigan/Ohio nuclear readings cover up a while back, and the SLC daycare thing. They&#39;re laughing like &quot;we&quot; just got all worked up over nothing. Isn&#39;t that kid that found out about those radiation readings still missing? And SLC was shut down on here so hard I still might get shadowbanned for mentioning it.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see if some news related to either of those two comes across soon, and they want to ensure the narrative is set...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a Reddit hit job. That thread is representative of how most people view these conspiracy theories -- not just with disagreement, but with exasperated incredulity. The reason is that most of these theories collapse under even very cursory critical examination, and they&#39;re left wondering how someone could believe them with such devotion. </p>

<p>If you prefer to spend time in forums deliberately created to cater to conspiracy theories, you might start believing there&#39;s some sort of legitimate consensus about their merit, and impose false narratives like &quot;Reddit hit job&quot; when you&#39;re confronted with opposition. </p>

<p>My advice. Instead of posting about chemtrails in a conspiracy forum, test your theories in a meteorology or science forum. Instead of discussing vaccines in a subreddit that&#39;s also discussing false flags every day, strike up a debate with an expert in the field. Try to disprove your hypothesis to validate it, rather than bask in the false security of an echo chamber. Or, for vaccines i.e., you could review all of the science available (if you can resist cherry picking), and follow the trail in this case to the overwhelming scientific consensus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m guessing &quot;sorority&quot; is a typo.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m referencing is your casual dismissal of theories that many people take the time to actually research in order to provide evidence for or against them.  &quot;Common sense&quot; does not apply in these instances.  In fact, an amazing amount of the way the world works is not according to common sense at all.  Instead, common sense is what is used for practical situations, such as not jumping onto train tracks to retrieve a dropped bag.  The approach to new ideas that you&#39;re describing is simply prejudice, arrogance or laziness, or a combination thereof. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the spirit! Keep an open mind, that&#39;s certainly what we&#39;d expect from someone reading a conspiracy website. All conspiracies are open for debate, except the ones that I don&#39;t agree with!</p>

<p>First of all, look at the work of Antony C. Sutton. Specifically, Wall Street influencing the rise of the USSR. One may speculate that the cold war was a hoax to promote the rise of the military industrial complex.</p>

<p>Leaving that aside, one might wonder why the USSR wouldn&#39;t spill the beans on the fake moon landing. (As if that&#39;s the only piece of evidence that doesn&#39;t bring the whole thing crashing down.) I&#39;d invite you to look at the great grain robbery of 1972 - in which the US sold grain to the USSR as a vastly reduced price, resulting in the overnight drop in worldwide grain prices. One may speculate as to why the US would give such a favorable trade to their number 1 enemy at the time. I posit that this did buy, in part, their silence for the fake moon landings.</p>

<p>Regardless, let&#39;s assume for the moment that the USSR would&#39;ve be blown the whistle if they could. Let&#39;s put that piece of evidence in the, &quot;Moon landings happened&quot; pile. </p>

<p>As such, the moon landings were a scientific endeavor, and should be scientifically rigorous in its evidence. In that case, the scientific evidence for the moon landings should be massively in favour of them happening, and the scientific anomalies of the mission should be small. I invite you to explain away the following scientific anomalies:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>no sign of radiation on the photos aside from visible spectrum radiation (on a planet with no atmosphere, outside Earth&#39;s magnetosphere.)</p></li>
<li><p>no scale on the LM to account for the weight of the moon rocks brought back </p></li>
<li><p>no visible evidence of water exhaust from the PLSS system</p></li>
<li><p>the first mammals to travel outside of Earth&#39;s magnetosphere were human</p></li>
<li><p>the dosimeters on the astronauts agreed with scientists calculations, despite the fact that years later it would be found that the moon was MORE radioactive than first thought</p></li>
<li><p>insufficient shielding on the spacesuits to protect against ionizing radiation</p></li>
<li><p>the movements of the astronauts are not commensurate with a 1/6th gravity atmosphere</p></li>
<li><p>lack of hydrogolic fuel signature upon LM liftoff</p></li>
<li><p>explosion on Apollo 13 didn&#39;t send them off course, despite the introduction of an outside explosion (violating Newton&#39;s third law)</p></li>
<li><p>linear liftoff speed rather than exponential acceleration path for LM liftoff (violating rocket propulsion principles)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Not to mention the lack of testing when it came to landing the LM, connecting the LM with the orbiting capsule, the engines that fired on the LM which could only be used once, etc...</p>

<p>So yeah, I&#39;d say the veracity of the moon landings is certainly up for debate, and doesn&#39;t hinge on whether or not the USSR blew the whistle.</p>

<p>Further, pertaining to your statements in general:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chem trails: one of the stupidest conspiracies out there.
Sandy Hook: if you really think it didn&#39;t happen, you have issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who declared you the arbiter of which conspiracies are valid or not? Your attitude seems to be, &quot;I&#39;m right - and anyone who thinks differently about these issues is a moron.&quot; Frankly, that&#39;s a chilling attitude to carry around with you in a subreddit about conspiracies. </p>

<p>All conspiracies should rise and fall based on their presented evidence. Not because some poster shouted down and insulted those who dared to question these events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember when conspiracy theories where popular on reddit and the US was considered in a pre revolutionary state. People were talking about conspricay theories in real life too everyday three or four years ago. Then the word conspitard entered. Something easy and witty for people to repeat ad nauseum without thinking. Young people dont like feeling like they are being made fun off so they take this new seemilngly more popular opinion. And at the same time racial discord is on the rise with the help of the media. Watch Liberal Media they say everything well crafted to get black people angry and same for conservative media fox is stirring up white people against black people. This is the American governments oldest tactic dating to pre revolutionary war for keeping people from attacking them get the poor people mad at each other and they wont have time to be mad at us. </p>

<p>That and they are probably trying to cover up that the San Bernardino shooters were most likely FBI assets in the &quot;create the threat, stop that same threat&quot; program they have been running with the last few years because <strong>they fucked up and the shooters carried oit the plan before FBI could stop them</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read through that post part of the way.  What I saw was people mentioning flat earthers, antivaxxers, chemtrails, moon landing hoax, lizard people rule the world, young earth creationism, and climate change deniers.  Then there were comments about stupid shit I hadn&#39;t even heard of: we built the moon, memories from other dimensions.  Those <em>are</em> bullshit.  And I am going to look at you like your a moron if you believe that stuff, because yes, you&#39;re cognitive abilities are deficient.  Hell, I&#39;ve watched a flat earther video and a few YEC videos on YouTube for shits and giggles.<br/>
 I really don&#39;t see any one here on r/conspiracy posting anything on those theories.  Then again I may not be scrolling down far enough down to see the downvoted stuff...</p>

<p>Of course, yes I also saw mentioned flase flags and 9/11 mentioned once, as well as media censorship.  We know that shit is real.  </p>

<p>I really didn&#39;t see this as an attack or smear campaign.  The OP asks people what conspiracy they cannot stand.  So people are posting the stupidest shit theories, not the most plausible ones. The puppet masters or whatever they are (I Dislike refering to them as &quot;they&quot; but we&#39;re kinda lacking a good label for them IMHO) aren&#39;t so hands on to be bothered doing some smear campaign.  Let&#39;s not be so offended or paranoidally arrogant to think r/conspiracy is being targeted here.  </p>

<p>And so what if it is?  Doesn&#39;t change a thing, nor does it bother me.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one that really stuck out to me (as dis/mis info/psyop) was the person commenting about the sovereign man. This to me is the worse one to slander, because there is a fuck tonne of truth to it, if you understand what it truly means for a US citizen. I&#39;m by no means an expert about it, but from how they were describing it, shows they have no fucking idea what it is and people were circle jerking the poster. Learning the difference between definitions of law is key in getting back our freedom/liberty/self that the founders handed down to us. I&#39;m 100% sure TPTB do not want us knowing that the game is rigged via the Fed and legalese.</p>
