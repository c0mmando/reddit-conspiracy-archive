       However, when asked about it, they downvote and move on. I'd like a real answer, since I haven't much found anything regarding that to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       His net worth is $700,000
      </p>
      <p>
       All he seems to advocate is fair pay, ending private prisons for profit, lowering prescription drug costs/making healthcare more available to lower income families, legitimate diplomacy(not diplomatic rhetoric them bombing when a deal isn't immediately reached) and depowering PACs and lobbyists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding Israel, he is for a dual-state and is against the Likud's right wing stance, as well as Israeli expansionism(which makes him anti-Zionist at that point). This is a point people are critical on it seems, because some folks feel that Israel shouldn't exist at all(this isn't a discussion on that).
      </p>
      <p>
       Being that he is actively seeking a peaceful resolution to the disproportionate violence against Palestinians by Israel, how does that make him 'bought and paid for by Zionists' as I've seen stated?
      </p>
      <p>
       Please tell me what I've missed given his voting record mirrors the above?
      </p>

       TL;DR provide evidence that the title is true, or explain reasoning behind it.

       Do you think he would be allowed to "fight the system" on our behalf so easily?  While Ron Paul are entirely pushed aside?  He says the good things but he would play ball just like all the others have.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people think he would actually be able to make changes and turn stuff around without a fight from the other side, I think that's crazy talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       He says all the right stuff and gets all the airtime (mostly) he wants.  I also don't believe there is some rogue element in the media who is secretly championing his cause and going against the current paradigm to get him elected so he can make such change happen.  That's crazy and impossible as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't make sense in our current world to have one man come out of the same system we're trying to expose and suddenly and successfully make changes the way a hollywood movie would show with a happy ending.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just one opinion though.  I've been around for a little while, and there have been zero examples of this yet.  RP would have been "real change" had he stood any chance against the beast he has been talking about for years and years and years.

       Ron Paul was eviscerated by the media and portrayed as a lunatic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet is full of transcripts, interviews, and voting records, and this generation of voters is savvy enough to figure out how to access the above. We have enough people disgusted with how Fox and CNN portray 'news' that they are losing their propaganda war.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Yes, I agree, Ron Paul would have been a fantastic candidate if he hadn't been
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bork">
        Bork'd
       </a>
       and slandered.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media would be the last person to do that, considering he just won the Time person of the year, yet is minimized by all mainstream sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm absolutely not trying to shill for him(not saying you're saying that), I'm just trying to figure out how people have concluded he's bought and paid for.

       Well, I cannot provide proof of any kind.  He just fits too easily into the process without so much as a hint he is
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       a threat to the system.  I think bought and paid for means that if he doesn't meet with any real RP type resistance, then he is likely going to be toting the line just as all others have.

       Obama was all labeled as "change".  Did we see that?  Nope, we saw the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think we're going to get that with Bernie.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, again in my opinion only, the people who downvote and move on without a debate means they're probably just very, very pissed off that after so many years there is zero hope of piercing the armor of the beast.  There is almost no reason to debate because its just not going to happen.....it cannot happen, currently.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it were to happen, people would be shocked and happy for it but.....let's be honest.  This is not hollywood.  This movie has
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       strayed from the script.

       A fair and honest response which I most appreciate. Obama was labeled as a candidate planning change, however he had no vetted voting feats(so to say).
      </p>
      <p>
       Given Sanders' apparent progressive approach(IE legalizing gay marriage) however still opposing the Brady Bill, yet still being for an assault weapons ban(in the wake of Sandy Hook, however it DID go down, the media portrayed the problem as the availability of firearms{of course ignore the guy with the AR in the woods with camo on}), it sounds like his opinions are marginalized as being either of one spectrum or the other, without taking into account that there isn't a direct or easy approach.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if they're so jaded that they have to downvote a concept, they should really find a different pass-time activity than looking through something like

       There is also the possibility that they may allow for supposed "alternative" views so they can demonize and marginalize those views and direct those who still beLIEve in the system to go with those "mainstream" candidates.  To guide some sheep into voting for the most "popular", like Hilary.  I think they want her in.

      <p>
       Bernie might just be given some airtime so he can participate and be defeated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two Bushes have held the position in the past.  Possibly two Clintons might achieve the same thing.  That is bullshit and a good example of a rigged game.  Ralph Nader never got a chance except to be made fun of on a huge scale.  It's a joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for people who don't want to debate......I get that.  I don't want to either, some days.  People are frustrated in a huge way.  That's why they're here.  Seeking some kind of kinship, some kind of understanding in a world that seems to ignore the obviousness of it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can be depressing and it leads to people being ornery.  The best can keep doing what they're doing with their chin up.  I can't say I've always done that.  My username was chosen because I thought I was going to correct some minds and thoughts about the process.  Really "show those folks what's really going on!!". I hope I've done that, but it may have taken a while to get the right formula.  Others need to find theirs.

       I can see the first statement as being pretty true, and I absolutely agree that how the HELL the last three presidents have gotten a second term is so far beyond possible, it's near fiction.

      <p>
       Ornery or not, expecting kinship from many people of many backgrounds with varying experiences is a bit... hopeful, isn't it? And while that statement may seem counter to the point of my post, I only wanted to know why people were downvoting without bothering to cite or respond. You and quik did, although he was a bit of a jerk in his approach(saying my countering his points with, well, counterpoints, was "sucking Sanders's dick"). I appreciate your taking your time to at least provide your own perspective on it. That's all I really wanted.

       I also wanted to quickly mention another point about some ornery people.  Not to be an apologist for them but they/we all have to deal with shills here.  Bots or otherwise, accounts who are incapable of reason.  They are designed to pretend there is only insanity in this sub.

       I think Ron Paul was a lot more vocal about the Federal Reserve's effect on our economy. That is real reform. Sanders is "feel-good" reform. If he proposes more state-sponsored programs, we will need to print more money, which would continue to weaken the dollar itself. I think they are willing to let Sanders do his thing as long as he doesn't draw attention to the Fed itself.

       Why would we have to print more money? Why not stop wasteful spending, IE our DoD budget's black budget(which isn't included in the budget hearings, however includes things like PRISM), or spending on no-bid contracts through KBR and Halliburton, such as the ridiculous funding they received to house and feed Coalition/US troops in Iraq/Afghanistan?
      </p>
      <p>
       $39bn to Halliburton alone, in Iraq alone. Meanwhile, troops were housed in Conex boxes(the metal shipping containers), and loads of laundry were coming out to $200 a load through KBR.

       place money can come from is printing it? That's not true at all. Bernie wants to tax the top 1% more than they're being taxes and defund a lot of the US warmongering to pay for his plans. The money is there. It's just being spent on the creation of misery instead of helping people.

       If you think that we can solve our problems by increasing the taxes on the rich, then you don't understand the true problem at hand. Anyone who is allowed to talk about reform on television is being allowed to because they aren't a true threat. We need a true threat to the system. I don't know if that is someone who would ever appear on our ballot in the US. If you think so, then you are either too young or too dumb.

       Haha ok. Well the question Bernie is trying to answer is if the government is even capable of changing lives of the poor. I think it can. The government exists. Your magical solution does not. Unless you've got one and you're holding out on us. If not, you're either too young or too dumb.

       The poor don't need help from the government. The poor are poor because of the things the government is doing. Convincing them that they need the help from the government is like convincing a child to continue breastfeeding into his adulthood. People are inherently good and will come up with solutions to help others. We don't need the government to demand more taxes from us only to have it mismanaged through bureaucracy and corruption. If you think Bernie is going to make real reform, then you are naive. My first solution would be to take back control of our currency from the Federal Reserve. If Bernie doesn't push this agenda, then nothing he says will matter. Do you understand this? Any help he creates will only be superficial because our money will continue to become worth less while our debt to the Fed continues to increase beyond comprehension. Do you understand this concept?

       I agree. I've seen those documentaries too. How exactly do you expect this to happen without political intervention? The Fed is just going to give up? Because we asked? Violent revolution? I don't understand how you can advocate this solution and still think government is powerless to help. You're contradicting yourself. You've taken the bait. You've been fooled by businessmen who want you to think there is no hope in politics. The government, aka institutionalized cooperation, is the best way to control our economic overlords.  Name me a better agent to act in the interests of people like you and me. You gonna sue Monsanto and Wal-Mart? No. You gonna get the army to overtake Wall Street? Yeah right. You're going to advocate for political policies that limit the harm they can do.

      <p>
       This is ignorant. Without things like minimum wage, the weekend, sick days and unions we'd be even more slave-like than we already are. The government is the only power that can protect us because its the only power that we have the tiniest bit of control over. I'm not a fan of the journey but its a much better option than violent revolution. The time may come for that, but the people are going to give 2016 elections a try no matter how futile because it's better than civil war. This is why Bernie and Trump are leading the polls. People want major change and this election may be the last hope, the dying breath, of political power. Either they're going to fix things or things will get so bad we'll revolt. Either way politics is the path. Do you understand this concept?

       It's reverse psychology. They generated a fake media blackout in order to produce a movement that was for all intents and purposes "organic." Paul was a real media blackout and that's why he never made it past the first debate. He's not someone they can control easily. If Bernie has made it this far, then it means he is under their control.

       My asking a question is sucking his dick now? I see. I'm as for him as I am Ron Paul, as much as I am for anyone who proposes an improvement to Society as a whole.

       While the term "assault weapon" is certainly a bullshit political term,

        That vote

       was fewer than 6 months after whatever it was that happened at Sandy Hook. I'm not defending that, either. By the way.

       There is also the possibility that they may allow for supposed "alternative" views so they can demonize and marginalize those views and direct those who still beLIEve in the system to go with those "mainstream" candidates.  To guide some sheep into voting for the most "popular", like Hilary.  I think they want her in.

       Bernie might just be given some airtime so he can participate and be defeated.

       Two Bushes have held the position in the past.  Possibly two Clintons might achieve the same thing.  That is bullshit and a good example of a rigged game.  Ralph Nader never got a chance except to be made fun of on a huge scale.  It's a joke.

       As for people who don't want to debate......I get that.  I don't want to either, some days.  People are frustrated in a huge way.  That's why they're here.  Seeking some kind of kinship, some kind of understanding in a world that seems to ignore the obviousness of it all.

       It can be depressing and it leads to people being ornery.  The best can keep doing what they're doing with their chin up.  I can't say I've always done that.  My username was chosen because I thought I was going to correct some minds and thoughts about the process.  Really "show those folks what's really going on!!". I hope I've done that, but it may have taken a while to get the right formula.  Others need to find theirs.

       I also wanted to quickly mention another point about some ornery people.  Not to be an apologist for them but they/we all have to deal with shills here.  Bots or otherwise, accounts who are incapable of reason.  They are designed to pretend there is only insanity in this sub.

       They can be difficult and frustrating to deal with.

       Take care out there.
