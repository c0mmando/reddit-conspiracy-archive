       that it looked as though Obama was in front of a green screen.  This would explain the podium in front of the desk approach.  So, is  there intelligence of terrorist capabilities to attack the White House?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        No one on the no-fly list should be allowed to buy a gun.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This one really bothers me. First of all, the Constitutionality of the "no-fly" list has never been proven in court (and in fact, the government has lost every case brought to trial, and settled with the rest.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, neither the President, nor Congress has the right to infringe on someone's individual liberties.
       <strong>
        That's the entire fucking point of this country.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       But now, Obama thinks he (or the TSC) can arbitrarily declare that an individual cannot purchase a gun?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's absolutely preposterous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, he later says "Freedom is more powerful than fear."
      </p>
      <p>
       So, since we can't prevent the bad guys from getting guns, we should take them away from everyone? Because bad guys with guns is scary? Something doesn't add up.

       When I first heard about Jade Helm and the whole martial law thing I thought it was paranoid nonsense.

       However, it's clear what this is really about.

       Theses war games really are "practice" for when they do turn the military on us, but they can't do it until they disarm the citizenry.

       Do not let them take guns from

        this Washingtonian story
       </a>
       is interesting - as of 2013, rumor was they were building a replica Oval Office underneath the White House. You could see the trees outside, though, someone with more interest in this topic than I could probably do an analysis of the trees outside the window in 2013 vs. the trees outside the window in 2015 to see if there's any change that wouldn't be attributable to two years passing. What type of trees are those, anyway? They appear to still be green but it's been a weird Fall and a scattered few cherry blossoms were even blooming in November.

       It doesn't make much sense for the president to spend much time at the White House and I doubt he lives there. Why would they allow tours in the home of the debatably most important person in the government? I would not be at all surprised if it was a green screen.

       Doubt it was in 4K. Theres barely any film on 4K let alone broadcasting in 4K. Most just dont have tvs capable of that high res anyway

       This is an interesting theory. I doubt if it was in front of green screen, but I could see a replica of the oval office for safety. Then again I truly believe he was in the oval office, also why does it really matter?

       I saw two different video clips from two different angles, one where he's looking straight on, one where's he looking away from the camera. It would be easy to check if it were green screen (unless they're using, like, Avatar technology or something)
