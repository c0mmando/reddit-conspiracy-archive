    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>No one on the no-fly list should be allowed to buy a gun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one really bothers me. First of all, the Constitutionality of the &quot;no-fly&quot; list has never been proven in court (and in fact, the government has lost every case brought to trial, and settled with the rest.)</p>

<p>Secondly, neither the President, nor Congress has the right to infringe on someone&#39;s individual liberties. <strong>That&#39;s the entire fucking point of this country.</strong></p>

<p>But now, Obama thinks he (or the TSC) can arbitrarily declare that an individual cannot purchase a gun?</p>

<p>That&#39;s absolutely preposterous.</p>

<p>Also, he later says &quot;Freedom is more powerful than fear.&quot;</p>

<p>So, since we can&#39;t prevent the bad guys from getting guns, we should take them away from everyone? Because bad guys with guns is scary? Something doesn&#39;t add up.</p>

<p>When I first heard about Jade Helm and the whole martial law thing I thought it was paranoid nonsense.</p>

<p>However, it&#39;s clear what this is really about.</p>

<p>Theses war games really are &quot;practice&quot; for when they do turn the military on us, but they can&#39;t do it until they disarm the citizenry.</p>

<p>Do not let them take guns from <strong>ANYONE</strong> they only people carrying out these mass murders is the government!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So anyway, <a href="http://www.washingtonian.com/blogs/dead_drop/white-house/obama-moving-to-a-new-oval-office.php">this Washingtonian story</a> is interesting - as of 2013, rumor was they were building a replica Oval Office underneath the White House. You could see the trees outside, though, someone with more interest in this topic than I could probably do an analysis of the trees outside the window in 2013 vs. the trees outside the window in 2015 to see if there&#39;s any change that wouldn&#39;t be attributable to two years passing. What type of trees are those, anyway? They appear to still be green but it&#39;s been a weird Fall and a scattered few cherry blossoms were even blooming in November.</p>
