       So I am aware "long gun" just refers to rifle which is pretty broad.  What stuck out is that I had not heard the term "long gun" before the
       <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/11/15/assault-rifles-stolen-from-massachusetts-army-reserve-armory.html">
        Army Reserve armory was burgled in Worcester 2 weeks ago.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Six M4 assault rifles, 10 pistols, and several long guns were taken from the armory, according to the source.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Like anyone else who saw that story break, I planned to watch closely for anything that appeared related.  Then that term "long gun" popped up again
       <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/02/authorities-responding-to-reports-of-mass-shooting-in-san-bernardino-california-nbc-los-angeles.html">
        today in San Bernadino.
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Burguan said the suspects were armed with assault rifles and hand guns and that there was "sensitive stuff" around the vehicle [...] Burguan said earlier that the shooters were armed with long guns
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, I know "long gun" is a pretty vague term that existed long before I first heard about it.  So this is a pretty big stretch.  If anyone shares my suspicions who knows more about guns than me, it would be great if you could keep an eye on info about specific types of guns involved in both incidents.  I will be keeping watch as well, but my gun knowledge is limited.  Also very curious about the "sensitive stuff" if anyone saw more info on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Editing in a rough working theory, thanks to everyone who has commented.
I don't have any real evidence that these are connected.  Nor am I trying to tell you there is a connection.  I just think it's worth keeping an eye on, and hopefully others can post some more concrete evidence if they come across any.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why the fuck would anyone rob a federal armory just for the guns?  Why not rob a gun/pawn shop, or buy black market.  There was something specific in that armory that was worth getting in.  Something that would have been left out of the media if it were "sensitive."  So fuck the long guns, that's just how I remembered the armory thing happening.  This sensitive material seems important.  As for the distance, something important enough to break into a federal armory is certainly worth traveling 2900 miles for if you happen to have "some personal or friend's connection to, one that someone knew the layout and security of. Even if this armory was far away from you, that would seem more sure than winging it with a different armory." (quote credit to

       )
       <br/>
       The level of coordination and equipment used in the attack just doesn't make sense just to shoot up a disability center.  I've seen plenty of people in other threads speculating that the target was a specific person inside this facility.  Is it so crazy to think a group of assassins with "sensitive material" on their vehicle would also be capable of robbing an armory on the other side of the country?  This could be my imagination from being on this sub too often, But consider this theory.  It doesn't seem all that far-fetched.

       "sensitive" is an interesting word for a cop to use, because it's official jargon for material that the public isn't supposed to see.  Military and police equipment fall into that category.  An example that springs to mind is a nightvision headset.  Civilians can buy old nightvision rigs, but police can buy military low-tech and soldiers can get military high-tech.  Both are called "sensitive."

       That's interesting.  It's all the double-speak that keeps catching my eye.  It's too easy to just gloss over the term "sensitive" or "long gun" as being insignificant.
       <br/>
       When I originally saw the armory story I didn't think twice about the long guns.  Assumed it meant rifle, seemed like lazy journalism, and moved on.  It's such an insignificant term being used in just one of the stories.  But together I think it's at least worth watching what type of rifles they were.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess I should state that I am not declaring a connection between these 2 events.  Because I know mother fuckers are going to split hairs and explain what the terms mean or some shit.  I just think it's worth keeping an eye on.

       ..about the "long" guns.. Its a good observation to make. I've grown up around guns and gun owners.. and rarely did I hear anyone say "long" in reference to a rifle.. especially "long gun". Its like some antiquated way to say "rifle" with more letters or something. This caught my eye (ear) when I heard the dopey and seemingly inept coroner at sandy hook say "long" in reference to the rifle found in the car but was apparently used in the school building.

       Same.  Lot of hunters where I grew up.  My job closes opening day of deer season.  Nobody says long gun.  Really weird that they used it during Sandy Hook as well.  Must be a term reserved for false flag reporting or some shit.

       Eh, I'm not so sure about the long gun thing. All a long gun is, is a rifle. Whether it be bolt action, semi-auto, etc. An M4 is a long gun, but they like to say "ASSUALT" rifle. Makes it more scary and should only belong to LEO's and Military. Complete bullshit. But, the sensitive stuff is odd, I'll give you that..

       Ah ic. I must of been typing it when you posted your comment somewhere else. I see where you are going with this, but, I think the important thing is the "sensitive material". I highly doubt this has anything to do with the armory, seeing the distance and the abundance of black market weapons in this particular geography. Too much risk, tbh.

       This is why I think the armory story is so important.  You don't rob an armory for guns you can buy elsewhere.  You'd rob an armory that had something very specific inside that you want.  Which is where the "sensitive material" comes in.
       <br/>
       I'm aware "long gun" term bears little significance.  That's just how I noticed the connection between the 2.  So instead of tracking gun types, let's find out if this "sensitive material" was inside that armory.  Because again, why the fuck would anyone rob a federal armory just for the guns right?

       Yes, why the hell would anyone steal guns from a secure government location when they could go door to door durning spring break on some college campus lookin under frat dudes beds and and probably find some shit. The more and more it sounds like just the plot of specter the more and more I feel like it's bull-honkey.

       Ehhhh, technically....maybe (slug w/rifle barrel). But I've never heard it as being such. A shotgun is always a shotgun, a rifle is always considered a long gun (rifled barrel can shoot further, and has completely different ammo).

       Worcester is 2900 miles from San Bernardino. Why would sometime steal six assault rifles (from the Army) and travel that far to shoot up a disability center?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure the guns used today weren't assault rifles, but regular ar-15 rifles.

       If you robbed a federal armory, why wouldn't you travel a long distance before shooting people with them?  Just seems like covering your tracks 101.

       You would probably break into an armory you had some personal or friend's connection to, one that someone knew the layout and security of.  Even if this armory was far away from you, that would seem more sure than winging it with a different armory.

       And for all of this trouble there would definitely have to be a specific target in mind.  Seems like a lot of trouble for the building itself to be the target.  So let's assume the target is a person.  The distance between your selected armory and target gets pretty irrelevant for an operation like this.  I've seen a lot of coverage about how planned and calculated the shooters behaved.  The same level of operational planning required to say... rob an armory.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this proves any shred of connection between the 2, but they fit pretty nicely together.

       If you're risking robbing a federal armory, there's probably something pretty specific inside.  Otherwise you're right, just go to Mexico. Or rob a pawn or gun shop.  There's gotta be a lot more to the armory story than the media will ever tell us.

       Possibly something "sensitive" was stolen from said armory.  Which

       long gun refers to basically any rifle, could be specifically snipers I have yet to hear any clarification.  I'm aware the long gun part is a tenuous link, but through the comments now I'm more focused on the sensitive material involved in Cali.  Read around and I explain how that may be connected to the armory.  It's still a huge stretch and 100% speculation.  I'm trying to make that point very clear.  Nothing has convinced me there is a connection, just a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for catching that guy... There was a robbery at a
       <a href="http://www.newschannel6now.com/story/30641259/new-information-released-on-texas-armory-robbery">
        Texas armory in which suspects have been taken into custody.
       </a>
       That may be what you heard.  Unless I missed something about suspects for the Mass. one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad people are skeptical of this idea.  It's nice to see this sub not jump onto theories at first glance.  And it's helped me to focus on other aspects and give up others.  I'm still not convinced it isn't worth at least watching for more info on both stories.

       about an arrest being made in Mass.  It seems unlikely that 1 dude broke into a federal armory.  Though this basically dismisses my entire theory.  Which is fine, I'll be watching his case closely.

       This is why I think the armory story is so important.  You don't rob an armory for guns you can buy elsewhere.  You'd rob an armory that had something very specific inside that you want.  Which is where the "sensitive material" comes in.
       <br/>
       I'm aware "long gun" term bears little significance.  That's just how I noticed the connection between the 2.  So instead of tracking gun types, let's find out if this "sensitive material" was inside that armory.  Because again, why the fuck would anyone rob a federal armory just for the guns right?
