<p>You only call Trump fans &quot;racist&quot; because they are White. I bet you never called black Obama fans &quot;racist&quot; because they were black, even though they only voted for Obama because of his race.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL I don&#39;t hate white people, I&#39;m white, So what, I have to hate other races and religions. Secondly I made it a point to talk about Hate when referring to muslims, which is what racism is about, but not technically race. 
Christians are shit bags, 
Muslims are shit bags
Bhuddist monks have a lot of shitbags
Religion is filled with hate. 
You keep telling me what I hate. You are jumping to conclusions without using common sense or trying to understand. Which, amazingly enough, is a pretty good sign of an ignorant bigot.
So go ahead and try and tell me who I hate, I laugh at your assumptions. I don&#39;t even hate you and you are an extremely annoying person. 
It&#39;s hard to have discussions with intelligent people without getting a little angry. 
It&#39;s impossible to have discussions with an idiot and not get annoyed.
All you do is try and tell me how I feel based on nothing. When you could actually make a decent argument without much effort. I suppose it&#39;s easier to just call someone a racist to try and discredit them instead of thinking about what they discuss and replying. 
Trump raped his wife. 
Don&#39;t think he&#39;s an idiot? well his memory sucks then. Asking what muslim sports figure was considered a hero. When there&#39;s pictures of him shaking mohammed ali&#39;s hand. </p>

Later on we have the Spanish Inquisition, and even today we&#39;ve got wackjobs blowing up abortion clinics in the name of Jesus.

<blockquote>
<p>You can&#39;t compare the age of Islam with the age of Christianity and say, &quot;Hey, it still has to evolve.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes I can. Look at the desert where these fools live, homie. All that advancement doesn&#39;t really exist out there like it does here. You think some dude that lives in a mud shack in afghanistan can hop on r/atheism and wake his whole tribe up? It&#39;s still like the middle ages in some parts of the world today. Furthermore, religious fundamentalism STILL exists still in this age of computers and what-not; it&#39;s not like ISIS are the only cats out there doing fucked up shit in the name of their god. Even though the technology has changed, fervent belief is the same, stale mode of thinking it always was. </p>

<p>For the record, I&#39;m not saying &#39;let it evolve&#39;: kill it where it stands, and then turn around and put a bullet in the head of every other monotheistic religion as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The wackos targeting abortion clinics believe they&#39;re saving the lives of babies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right, just like the ISIS wackjobs think they&#39;re protecting Islam by killing heretics, or defending their &#39;state&#39; against &#39;enemies of Islam&#39;. It&#39;s the exact same shit, bro. </p>

<p>As far as I know, the only actual real estate he owns is the Trump Tower in Manhattan - most of the buildings labeled &quot;Trump&quot; are owned by other people, they just pay a license fee to use his brand name.</p>
