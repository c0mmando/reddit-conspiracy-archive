    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m of Jewish descent. Until 10 years ago, I believed the accepted narrative of the holocaust. Then I learned that Churchill never mentioned gas chambers in his history of WWII. That one fact sent me a personal research mission to learn more than just &quot;accepted&quot; history.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not &quot;holocaust denial&quot;. People shouldn&#39;t be bullied, fined and thrown in jail for having an opinion about history, religion or politics that differs from the government&#39;s opinion, as happens in much of Europe with regard to this one aspect of history.  That&#39;s the very definition of tyranny. The holocaust is history, religion and politics rolled into one.</p>

<p>This site describes honest revisionism well:</p>

<p>&quot;The aim of this site is to promote intellectual freedom with regard to this one historical event called &quot;Holocaust.&quot; It is our belief that this will in turn help advance the concept of intellectual freedom with regard to all historical events. We find it vulgar beyond belief that Americans would spend more than half a century condemning the &quot;unique monstrosity&quot; of the Germans when we have not yet learned to condemn our own, or to even recognize it.</p>

<p>CODOH is not a membership organization and is not affiliated with any political party or political group. It is not the purpose of CODOH to prove the Holocaust “never happened,” or that European Jews did not suffer a catastrophe during the years of the Hitlerian regime. Those who try to convince you it is want to muddy the waters. While we no longer believe the gas chamber stories (we used to very much believe them) or the “genocide” theory, we remain open to being convinced we are wrong.</p>

<p>We understand perfectly well that the Hitlerian regime was anti-Semitic and persecuted Jews and others. We understand many peoples, European Jews among them, experienced unfathomable tragedies in Europe during World War II. Nevertheless, to be clear, we no longer believe the German State pursued a plan to kill all Jews or used homicidal “gassing chambers” for mass murder during the years of World War II.</p>

<p>For some seven decades the homicidal Nazi gas chambers have been at the heart of the Holocaust narrative. In the literature, the two have been absolutely inseparable. It&#39;s tempting to say: “No gas chambers, no Holocaust.” But too often it can be—has been—misleading, particularly to those who are just becoming acquainted with revisionist arguments. It is misleading because it suggests that, if there were no gas chambers, the Jews of Europe did not suffer a tragedy at the hands of the Hitlerian regime. They did.
While it is true that Third Reich Germany was criminally responsible for the death of large numbers of civilians, so were the major Allied powers, particularly the Soviets, the British, and the Americans. But much “eyewitness” testimony about Nazi atrocities against Jews and others is demonstrably false, and it appears that all such eyewitness testimony about homicidal Nazi gas chambers is false. It is wrong to bear false witness against others—most of us were taught to understand this when we were children. False testimony against anyone, including Germans, together with those who promote it, should be exposed to the light of public scrutiny.</p>

<p>The attempt to identify every call for open debate about the gas chamber controversy with anti-Jewish sentiment is juvenile. Those who protest that it is more important to be sensitive to “survivors” than truthful to the historical record represent a world view that has no place in Western culture.</p>

<p>We are willing to be convinced we are wrong about any or all of this. We are willing to be convinced it is hateful to weigh the evidence for and against any historical narrative whatsoever. We are willing to consider the possibility that the university and the press in America are justified in their efforts to suppress a free exchange of ideas about the Holocaust or any other matter. We are even willing to discuss the idea that intellectual freedom itself corrupts public discourse when it involves the gas chamber controversy.</p>

<p>We are not willing to remain silent, however. We will be heard.&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;re an idiot. Holocaust denial is the act of denying the genocide of Jews in the Holocaust during World War II. Holocaust denial includes any of the following claims: that Nazi Germany&#39;s Final Solution policy aimed only at deporting Jews from the Reich, and included no policy to exterminate Jews; that Nazi authorities did not use extermination camps and gas chambers to mass murder Jews; and that the actual number of Jews killed was significantly (typically an order of magnitude) lower than the historically accepted figure of 5 to 6 million. The methodologies of Holocaust deniers are often based on a predetermined conclusion that ignores overwhelming historical evidence to the contrary. Most Holocaust denial claims imply, or openly state, that the Holocaust is a hoax arising out of a deliberate Jewish conspiracy to advance the interest of Jews at the expense of other peoples. </p>

<p>&quot;I would like you to believe me. I saw the gas chambers. I saw the crematoria. I saw the open fires. I was on the ramp when the selections took place. I would like you to believe that these atrocities happened because I was there.&quot; -SS-Rottenführer Oskar Gröning &lt;--- That man was there, and you weren&#39;t, soooooo yeah, I guess I should just take your word.</p>

Also, you do realize that there were three camps at Auschwitz, only one was a death camp. I would flood this page with a ton of proof of the Holocaust, but a neo-nazi such as yourself won&#39;t listen to any of it. You will simply pull up a few bullshit articles to TRY to discredit THOUSANDS of articles, journals, photographs, etc...

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. It wasn&#39;t just Churchill who omitted to mention the gas chambers - none of the wartime leaders (de Gaulle, Eisenhower etc) mentioned them. Neither was there any mention of the &quot;human soap bars&quot; or &quot;human skin lampshade&quot; myths that were peddled to discredit the German people at the end of the war. In fact these myths were debunked at Nuremberg.</p>

<p>Furthermore the Encyclopaedia Britannica, despite a detailed and frequently revised account of the terrible treatment of Europe&#39;s Jews by the Nazis didn&#39;t mention &quot;gas chambers&quot; until perhaps the late 1960s. The bizarre truth is that the gas chamber, as a mode of execution, is a &quot;historical meme&quot; which was reverse-engineered onto the narrative of the Shoah long after the event. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re a moron. Do you think that Hitler is alive chillin with Elvis because Churchill didn&#39;t see his brains hit the wall? Have you looked up the historical records from African Americans, homosexuals and gypsies? Have 
you been to the U.S. memorial museums in every major city that chronicle the lives of locals that lived through not only the 3 Aushwitz sites, but the death marches, labor camps, mass executions and bearings ? Did you forget that many of the ghettos, which were in the public eye and highly photographed, killed many Jews before the final solution started? In Lithuania alone, 95% of the entire country&#39;s Jews were killed, and that&#39;s at the LOWEST possible figure. Many GERMAN records showed 270,000 Jews in the Lithuanian capital&#39;s ghetto alone, and less than 2600 lived to make it out of there alone. The only camp that the English liberated was an exchange camp that traded Jews/ P.O.W.&#39;s for German soldiers.  I&#39;m not even Jewish and know that Russia and the U.S. (in that order) liberated most all of the actual death camps, with Canada Liberating one or two also.
Say there was 3 million killed total; does that make it better? Or how about 10,000, which is way more than 9/11 (but I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t believe that happened, and watch 17 year old&#39;s you tube videos). So it&#39;s cool then at those numbers? The only thing that matters to people little shits like you is that it doesn&#39;t affect you. Rwanda/Syria/WW2/9.11/Yugoslavia/Sudan, it&#39;s all bullshit as long as it doesn&#39;t mess up XBT&#39;s life. But you&#39;re probably the type who&#39;s &quot;having the worst day ever!!!&quot; when Starbucks switches over their seasonal drink.</p>

<p>In Europe, governments conspire with private interests to put people in jail who publicly speak about having an opinion of the holocaust that doesn&#39;t agree with those private interests. </p>

Personally, my eyes were first opened when cross-training with Israeli troops at a US base. They were fucking evil, and we were basically told that they&#39;re above the law.

<p>Yes.  Agreed.  And it <em>is</em> in fact leading us to a better, more open level of understanding with regard to the deceit and chicanery that truly exists in this world.  So man more of us are more “woken up” today than we ever were before the internet existed.</p>

<p>9/11 inside job -evidence, videos, lack of an investigation, supports that they are trying to cover something up.
why?
Justifying a war on terror
for
oil.
my theory, very basic, very simple, and supported by the terrorist insurance policy taken out by Silverstein 6 months before the attacks.</p>

<p>Now for the holocaust,
I just went on the thread for holocaust and saw the first article which shoes how the holocaust evidence looks like it is planted there,
now, I cannot determine how a picture showing a guy testing the ground proves that there are not decomposed bodies underneath, however
what would be the purpose OF the holocaust as a conspiracy.
Who gained from this?
Obviously the zionists.</p>

<p>But did the Democratic nations benefit by systematically killing hitlers character because he was a threat to democracy?
Did Hitler actually want to protect the world?
Like should I not think he was a horrible person? I don&#39;t know what to believe if this is a thing you know?</p>

<p>The bankers and Western corporations (Ford, DuPont, Morgan, Rockefeller, IBM, Bushes, the list goes on) made billions off the war and the Nazi labor camps. They were not death camps, they were forced labor camps and internment camps. Very similar to what the US did to the Japanese/Germans here. Forced internment.</p>

<p>You should really watch this video (or at least watch the first ~40 minutes). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Qt6a-vaNM">Everything is a rich man&#39;s trick</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did Hitler actually want to protect the world?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, he did not want to protect the world and No, he was not a good person. He was a dictator/tyrant. He wanted a  united pure German state. This is good for Germans, but not for the foreigners inside the country. However, the same can be said with Israel today (pure Jewish state). The hypocrisy behind this is laughable. </p>

<p>Now, I do believe nations should be able to do this, if they so choose. But, you cannot be hypocritical about it (ie. Israel vs Hitler&#39;s Germany).</p>

The vast majority of &quot;deniers&quot; simt dispute the 6 mil number. This is bc in the late 80s the <em>official</em> number of people that died at Auschwitz was changed from 4il to 1.5 mil. So literally the official number was changed by the Jewish group that runs auschwitz from 6 to 3.5 mil. Yet even though it&#39;s now official fact, you still can&#39;t say less than 6 mil without being called a denier.</p>

<p>Remember the 80 year old lady that just went to jail in Germany for &quot;denying the holocaust&quot;. She only denies the 6 mil figure and she&#39;s in prison for it..... </p>

<p>The number 6 million is a red flag in Jewish history...any of their history. So it&#39;s suspect that 6 million did not die.</p>
