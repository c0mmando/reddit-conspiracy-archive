       The government has no incentive to prevent "terrorist" attacks. Any time something happens, the government acquires more power via taking away more of our rights, establishing more of a police presence, allowing themselves access to more of our information, and many other oversteps and abuses to human rights and our existence as citizens under the guise of "the law." The people in power benefit from these events taking place. Regardless if they are actually behind the attacks or not, it is not in the government's best interest to prevent them from happening.

       The tax dollars I can understand but the other stuff seems to be heading the other way, although I will be honest and say I am not really very well versed in the details of this stuff.  Always keen to learn more about it though.

       What I find frustrating is that people tend to get either very aggressive or defensive if people don't agree with all their ideas. It should be possible to have mature discussions even with differing opinions. 
 The other annoying thing is people will make a comment like "the answer is in plain sight, think outside the box" as though they know more than everyone else, they then get defensive or continue the vague catchphrases when asked to explain.
 Its not very welcoming or helpful for someone that is agnostic on many of the topics on this sub.

       I am pretty sure that I could program an algorythim myself, that could identify high risk people, that are conversating with international terrorists, buying tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, guns, materials to make pipe bombs, and visiting hot spots of radical Islamic terror such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, for very cheap if I had access to all of the data that the NSA does.  This should set off massive red flags.

       When you visit Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and come back and buy tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, materials to build pipe bombs, and speak with international terrorists, yes, you should be put on a list and monitored.  It should immediately set off red flags that you may want to harm this country and it's people.

       I don't think 24/7 monitoring is a solution, if it was my decision I would probably suspend the arms-purchase deal and have a talk with the guy himself. Run a few checks, see if he's lying about things, check out if he's been known for radical thoughts, etc.

       Then just pay him to kill some people so I can start a war.

       I still think it's crazy that the band that got shot up in Paris, (Eagles of Death) have a song called "Berdoo Sunburn" In the song it says, "We make plans and then we head out To San Bernardino."

       Meanwhile the entire alt news spehere was calling the "FSA" what they were, terrorists. But somehow the DOJ didn't see it until it was too late. What a shame.

       Correct, the State department sent them to the "Free Syrian Army" who then for some reason they got into the hands of ISIS.

       pathologically staking utterly benign civil rights activists, and these shooter folks weren't being stalked? Of course they were. This was criminal negligence on the part of the watchmen, if we're being very, very, generous.

       It would be awesome if the victims families could file a law suit against
the NSA/FBI/DHS for failure to protect its citizens.

       These incidents just keep exposing the citizens to the effed up lying government that we have. More people will start questioning why the government can't stop these attacks with all the intrusion/spying that they do.

       So why is he politicizing these events then before the bodies are even cold?  Just like the people here who are calling the event a hoax, or a false flag immediately, he is politicizing these events within hours and calling for more gun control. How is this any different?

       He's the president. If he comments, people say he's politicizing it. If he doesn't comment, people say he lacks leadership. It's almost like people will complain about what he does either way.

       Exactly my point actually.  He is the president, and his words to matter, but he's coming out within 2 hours and demanding more gun control.  Just like people here who are saying this was a hoax or a false flag, before the bodies are even cold.  Shouldn't he, like we, wait until all the facts come out before he comments on it, let alone politicize it and try to further his own agenda?

       The majority of the mentally ill, overwhelmingly, aren't violent, and the majority of the violent aren't mentally ill. Last I'd heard, guns used in the attack had been purchased legally, though that may have changed- one state having strict gun laws doesn't mean much if they're extremely lax in across the state line, ask Illinois.

       What's the point of restricting the conversation to this? There is clearly an anti-gun agenda. The guns would have been taken away if it was made easy for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you trying to say no gun control agenda exists because nobody had their guns taken away?
      </p>
      <p>
       Gun laws all over the country have seen some pretty major shifts in both directions.

       Your disdain for this community is on display for everyone to see.  If you feel this negatively about "conspiracy nuts", why are you here commenting on this post?   I have said nothing, nothing about a false flag, or a hoax, or any other controversial, taboo subject, I'm meerly asking a quesiton.

       He asked you a question for clarity, so answer it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's Obama's agenda and what do you expect him to do? Surely you're aware that the country is divided on gun control, so it can't be terribly insane to expect one half (the left wing) calling for gun control while the other half (the right wing) rejects it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And before I disappear into downvotes, both shroom and I are asking legitimate questions. Because I honestly don't know what Obama's agenda might be, and, frankly, this all seems insane.

       Maybe we need to increase the NSA budget, because clearly the terrorists have taken to a tactic of simply overwhelming our defenses?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, even the NSA couldn't catch them all, and now one slipped through. What if the success of this latest attack is a rallying cry or signal to sleeper cells throughout the continent that NOW is the time to strike?

       I saw the news headline saying something along the lines of "Police found over 5,000 rounds of ammunition at shooter's house."  That just kind of bothers me because they were making a big deal like 5000 rounds is a lot of ammo for somebody to have.  Anybody that shoots very often is likely to have thousands of rounds lying around.  It's easy to go through 500+ a single trip to the range.  Sometimes there's a good sale on... sometimes you have a few different caliber firearms...thousand+ rounds a piece because it's a pain in the ass having to go buy ammo every time you want to shoot.

       now the MSM is saying that the wife pledged allegiance to ISIS before the attack.  if thats the case then why is ISIS not taking credit for the attack?

       Pledging allegiance and being an "official" cell are two different things. They probably had no idea who this lady was.

       When you visit Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and come back and buy tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, materials to build pipe bombs, and speak with international terrorists, yes, you should be put on a list and monitored.  It should immediately set off red flags that you may want to harm this country and it's people.

       No but I think you should keep a very close eye on someone buying thousands of rounds of ammunition and pipe bomb materials. Oh yeah also traveling to known countries who harbor terrorist and oh yeah the little notion of him communicating with know terrorist.

       So yes sure he shouldn't have been interrogated right off the bat, but all of that combined should have thrown up some red flags.

       The majority of the mentally ill, overwhelmingly, aren't violent, and the majority of the violent aren't mentally ill. Last I'd heard, guns used in the attack had been purchased legally, though that may have changed- one state having strict gun laws doesn't mean much if they're extremely lax in across the state line, ask Illinois.
