        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just a theory, but this is a place for conspiracy theories after all. Just thinking aloud. I had an idea where the whole ISIS thing could be going, and it makes sense to me so I wanted to share. </p>

<p>In Syria, ISIS is there as a proxy army for the west. It also simultaneously provides justifications and legal reasons for the west to take military actions in Syria (like the Paris attack). So then the west can attack Syria, pretending to attack ISIS, while secretly supporting them and cooperating to overthrow the existing government. It&#39;s a foot in the door to a region they&#39;re not allowed in. </p>

<p>If ISIS is truly the Israeli Government&#39;s tool, which seems to be the case, they could pull the exact same stunt to get rid of another more direct enemy, the Palestinians. </p>

<p>All they need is an ISIS attack coming from one of the Palestinian regions, and then they can easily spin it to say the government there and the Muslims supported it (be it Hamas from the Gaza Strip, or Fatah in the West Bank) and then use that as a pretext to start a full-on invasion, retaking &quot;Greater Israel&quot; as the Zionists, Israeli Government, and Freemasons all have as their primary goal. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3v98ms/this_a_map_of_what_zionists_want_the_promised/">Here is a map of this goal, the Biblical boundaries, notice Palestine is gone.</a> This pretext of &quot;Hamas = ISIS&quot; would give them enough popular support to carry out their conquest of Palestinians without substantive opposition. Because then that would mean that supporting Palestine is supporting Terrorism, which is exactly what Zionists would love everyone to believe, because then no one would stand in their way as they conquered it.</p>

<p>And if you have any doubts the Israeli Government would consider pulling a false flag to achieve its geopolitical goals, I would kindly direct you to watch <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3ella9/this_has_made_the_rounds_before_but_apparently/">this 2 minute video of an Israeli thinktank guy talking about starting false flags to &quot;get them to war&quot; like they want.</a></p>

<p>I think if we can see these things coming ahead of time, we can be better prepared to react to them in ways that don&#39;t encourage warmongers. </p>

<p>Thoughts? Am I way off base here? Does this hypothesis make sense to anyone else? Do you see a more probable direction this is headed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I was replying to an interesting comment, then it was deleted. The comment was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Haven&#39;t there already been stories about ISIS cells operating in occupied Palestine? Like how the fuck did they gain entry? And then there was the bag of ISIS flags found to be the property of the invading Jews...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My reply:</p>

<hr/>

<p>Good points, got an article on either of those? I hadn&#39;t heard that. I was looking for it myself, and stumbled across this instead... <a href="http://www.thetower.org/2461-analysts-increasingly-seeing-isis-link-in-palestinian-violence/">http://www.thetower.org/2461-analysts-increasingly-seeing-isis-link-in-palestinian-violence/</a></p>

<p>They&#39;re <em>already</em> pushing the narrative I described. I didn&#39;t realize things had advanced this far already.</p>

<p>And people are already pushing <em>back</em> against that narrative (3 days old opinion piece &quot;The Palestinians Are Not ISIS&quot;): <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.689214">http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.689214</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In the wake of the ISIS attacks on Paris, Israel’s top leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on down, has been equating ISIS with Palestinian terror&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it is getting more and more obvious where this is headed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they&#39;re going to try and make a bunch of them refugees and push them in to Jordan and create a trail of tears kind of situation. And the ones that won&#39;t leave will be killed. Unfortunately that&#39;s typically how existing populations are displaced from land they&#39;re on. That&#39;s how the West Bank is/was being &quot;vacated&quot; in to Jordan.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they have any interest in exterminating them all per se, they just want them gone away somewhere, so they can have the land all to themselves. Displacing them as refugees is almost certainly a preferable option for many reasons, I would imagine. </p>

<p>The Gaza Strip though... there&#39;s really no where to go. I don&#39;t know how that one will be resolved. That&#39;s the reason I think it&#39;s more likely we&#39;ll see &quot;ISIS=Hamas&quot; instead of &quot;ISIS=Fatah&quot; as a narrative, because the Gaza Strip has 1.8 million people and no obvious route of exodus... I really worry for those people, I hope they try every available means to leave that place if it is still possible, before it is too late. I seriously worry about how the Gaza Strip will play out. Hopefully they don&#39;t go beyond squeezing them down with Buffer zones and then leave them be, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a stable situation after the Hamas takeover in 2007 and the 2014 Israeli attack. 95% of people in the Gaza Strip have PTSD. It&#39;s the most densely populated place on earth, and most have had someone they know die from war. </p>

<p>I just really hope Israel can ease up and let those people form a life, but I know it&#39;s probably not going to happen after what they did in 2014. But it may. Just leave them that little strip of land. The problem is Hamas is super violent and has taken it over, and actually is a bit of a problem in terms of killing people (although like 1/10th of the number of people Israel kills in response...) so it&#39;s pretty fucked. The tensions are extremely high on both sides, but it&#39;s clear Israel is the one who needs to be the bigger man and leave them alone as much as possible despite these horrible attacks, because Israel has all the power in this situation. </p>

<p>The patience required to resolve this peacefully... Zionists don&#39;t have it, I am pretty sure. Especially if things like the Gulf of Tonkin and the six-day war and the settlements are any indication. So hopefully there will be some sort of exodus route for the people of the Gaza strip, it&#39;s all I can hope for because it seems like they&#39;re not going to leave the Gaza Strip alone. What a mess. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a <em>way</em> easy one.  Just listen to their wording.  They&#39;re very careful about how they word what exactly is going on over there.  All the war and ruble and damage and death going on in Gaza?  It&#39;s BECAUSE OF ZIONISM and the occupation of Palestine.  They tip toe like a motherfucker around that and are real careful not to lay the obvious blame on Zionist bullshit for what&#39;s going on over there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s pretty anti-zionist, I&#39;d say.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Na.  It&#39;s anti Zionist by virtue of how obvious it is to everyone watching the presentation that all the damage is Israel&#39;s fault.  However, it&#39;s actually <em>not</em> all that obvious if you just listen to how the narrators phrase things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The second one, I can see a bit what you are talking about, but still I think it&#39;s mostly making the settlers and the state look bad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second one is even worse than the first one.  The perspective they paint in the presentation gives a lot of &quot;balance to both sides of the issue&quot; when the actual fact of the matter is that Israel is conducting a genocidal occupation of Palestine and the <em>real</em> &quot;balance&quot; is in calling what&#39;s going on what it actually <em>is</em>:  The genocidal occupation of Palestine by Zionism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I agree they didn&#39;t make the strong link between Zionism and the Israeli government, but they also didn&#39;t link in other things like Rothschilds and so on. They can&#39;t include everything, and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s as a result of being overly pro-zionist. Just my 2 cents, I don&#39;t really know that much about VICE. Although last night I did come across this satirical article about VICE that gave me a good laugh: <a href="http://www.clickhole.com/article/stunning-map-shows-just-how-much-iraq-and-syria-vi-924">http://www.clickhole.com/article/stunning-map-shows-just-how-much-iraq-and-syria-vi-924</a></p>

<p>In the end, in my opinion I think VICE is about as even-handed as it gets, since almost all media is corrupted in some way or another. It&#39;s important to get a variety of perspectives anyway, no one should be relying on one news source. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, but Israel needs the Palestinians still, as pawns, bargaining chips and human shields for as long as the neighboring states need a good thrashing and a central bank. Palestinians are last on the list, or close to it – certainly after Syria and Lebanon. Perhaps next, ISIS will have infiltrated Hezbollah (hell, I&#39;ve probably already missed that headline somewhere).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except ISIS and Hamas are enemies. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/30/islamic-state-threatens-hamas-gaza-strip">ISIS has threatened to topple Hamas</a>, and Hamas has been cracking down on jihadis in Gaza that oppose truces with Israel. </p>

<p>(ISIS of course isn&#39;t going to do that because it has its hands full.)</p>

<p>Also, Hamas was backed by Iran, which is an enemy of ISIS, but now is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/will-irans-post-sanctions-windfall-benefit-hamas-maybe-not/2015/08/30/08d0c62c-481e-11e5-9f53-d1e3ddfd0cda_story.html">seeking backing from Saudi Arabia</a>, which is also an enemy of ISIS. ISIS has <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/06/suicide-bomber-attacks-mosque-in-saudi-arabia">sent suicide bombers to attack Saudi Arabia</a>, and the Saudis have <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/23/us-syria-crisis-saudi-idUSKCN0HI1Y120140923#ogy1zftY1bbuWcKG.97">dropped bombs on ISIS</a>. If Hamas even attempted closer ties to ISIS, it would be committing suicide because it would lose its foreign support, and ISIS would sooner wipe Hamas out than become its partner.</p>

<p>This is common knowledge. The Israelis and everyone else in the region knows that Hamas and ISIS are enemies, and Hamas&#39; backers are also enemies of ISIS.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Besides, Israel does not need ISIS as a pretext to invade Gaza. Any time Hamas fires a few rockets into Israel, or kidnaps an Israeli soldier, Israel invades.</p>

<p>And yet, Israel doesn&#39;t want or need to invade Gaza, at least not to hold ground permanently. There&#39;s nothing in Gaza remotely worth the blood and money that would be spent taking it over and controlling it. The Israelis have it sufficiently wrapped up with its border walls and truces with Hamas. It&#39;s much more efficient to let Hamas worry about governing Gaza, with its economic problems, shitty infrastructure, and socioeconomic decay. </p>

<p>In fact, Israel would find itself swamped by Gaza&#39;s 1.8 million Palestinians, because its own population is just 8 million. Israel has no desire to dilute the Jewish character of its state by swallowing up so many non-Jews, and would collapse financially if they tried. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR Hamas and ISIS hate each other, and nobody in the region would confuse the two. Also, Israel doesn&#39;t want the shitty job of governing 1.8 million Gaza residents.</strong></p>

<p>Except for Netanyahu and his administration, apparently... They have already declared there to be a link between ISIS and Hamas: <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.689214">http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.689214</a></p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Nowhere</strong> in that article does it state that. This is the quote from Netanyahu:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In Israel, as in France, terrorism is terrorism,” Netanyahu wrote on his Facebook page in response to the ISIS attack. “It is the terrorists who are to blame for terrorism.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He does not say Hamas and ISIS are linked in any way, except that they share the use of terrorism.</p>

<p>When he says, “it is the terrorists who are to blame for terrorism,” he is saying that nobody blames France for being attacked, so neither should anyone blame Israel when it is. He is arguing against those who blame Israel&#39;s treatment of Palestinians for Palestinian terrorism.</p>

<p>Again, from the article you linked:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the real thrust of Israel’s efforts to promote solidarity in victimhood between Israel and France is the claim that it “is not the territories, not the settlements and not any other thing,” that causes terrorism...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Netanyahu wants to end criticism of Israel&#39;s West Bank settlements and its Gaza blockade. That goal has never been a secret or conspiracy.</p>

<p>There is no link between ISIS and Hamas, any more than there is a link between the IRA and Hamas. Netanyahu does not claim either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the actual quote, from the article you just linked:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“When it comes to their ultimate goals, Hamas is ISIS and ISIS is Hamas. And what they share in common, all militant Islamists share in common.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For better context, <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/arabs/netanyahusept29.html">here</a> is the complete speech.</p>

<p>Here is a fuller quote of that section:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So when it comes to their ultimate goals, Hamas is ISIS and ISIS is Hamas. And what they share in common all militant Islamists share in common. Boko Haram in Nigeria, al-Shabab in Somalia, Hezbollah in Lebanon, al-Nusra in Syria, the Mahdi army in Iraq, and the al-Qaida branches in Yemen, Libya, the Philippines, India and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Some are radical Sunnis, some are radical Shiites, some want to restore a pre-medieval caliphate from the seventh century, others want to trigger the apocalyptic return of an imam from the ninth century. They operate in different lands, they target different victims and they even kill each other in their battle for supremacy. But they all share a fanatic ideology. They all seek to create ever-expanding enclaves of militant Islam where there is no freedom and no tolerance, where women are treated as chattel, Christians are decimated and minorities are subjugated, sometimes given the stark choice, convert or die. For them, anyone can be considered an infidel, including fellow Muslims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And again, nowhere does Netanyahu claim any of those organizations are tied to each other except in ideology and willingness to commit violence. In fact, he says outright that they are <em>not</em> linked and in fact oppose each other:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They operate in different lands, they target different victims and they even kill each other in their battle for supremacy.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, because that&#39;s largely the <a href="http://journalism.about.com/od/editing/fl/Heres-the-Secret-to-Writing-Great-Headlines-for-Your-News-Stories.htm">goal of any headline</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The challenge is to write a hed that&#39;s as compelling, catchy and detailed as possible, using as few words as possible. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You say: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A media company owned by Zionists tends to push Zionist narratives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/q/mh?s=TWX+Major+Holders">here</a> is who owns Time Inc.</p>

<p>Zero % of shares are held by insiders. 84% of shares ore owned by institutional investors and mutual funds. </p>

<p>The biggest shareholder is the Vanguard Group, which offers <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp">index funds</a> and <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp">ETFs</a>. In other words, the Time Inc. shares are owned by hundreds of millions of everyday investors around the world in their retirement portfolios and such. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Come on. It&#39;s clear what the implications are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What are they then? That Netanyahu is making a public speech to the entire world, then secretly directing a headline writer employed by a multinational corporation to transform those words from their original meaning into propaganda that will trigger an Israeli takeover of Gaza?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s confusing to us because the main group of people the rulers of Israel are trying to convince are Israelis themselves, who are mostly good people albeit brainwashed by religion. Moses in the old testament didn&#39;t use false flags to let his people go, he used gods magic against legitimate bad guys, the pharaoh and his folks.
