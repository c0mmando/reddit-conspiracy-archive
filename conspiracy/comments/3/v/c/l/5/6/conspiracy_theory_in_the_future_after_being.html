       Just a theory, but this is a place for conspiracy theories after all. Just thinking aloud. I had an idea where the whole ISIS thing could be going, and it makes sense to me so I wanted to share.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Syria, ISIS is there as a proxy army for the west. It also simultaneously provides justifications and legal reasons for the west to take military actions in Syria (like the Paris attack). So then the west can attack Syria, pretending to attack ISIS, while secretly supporting them and cooperating to overthrow the existing government. It's a foot in the door to a region they're not allowed in.
      </p>
      <p>
       If ISIS is truly the Israeli Government's tool, which seems to be the case, they could pull the exact same stunt to get rid of another more direct enemy, the Palestinians.
      </p>
      <p>
       All they need is an ISIS attack coming from one of the Palestinian regions, and then they can easily spin it to say the government there and the Muslims supported it (be it Hamas from the Gaza Strip, or Fatah in the West Bank) and then use that as a pretext to start a full-on invasion, retaking "Greater Israel" as the Zionists, Israeli Government, and Freemasons all have as their primary goal.
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3v98ms/this_a_map_of_what_zionists_want_the_promised/">
        Here is a map of this goal, the Biblical boundaries, notice Palestine is gone.
       </a>
       This pretext of "Hamas = ISIS" would give them enough popular support to carry out their conquest of Palestinians without substantive opposition. Because then that would mean that supporting Palestine is supporting Terrorism, which is exactly what Zionists would love everyone to believe, because then no one would stand in their way as they conquered it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you have any doubts the Israeli Government would consider pulling a false flag to achieve its geopolitical goals, I would kindly direct you to watch
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3ella9/this_has_made_the_rounds_before_but_apparently/">
        this 2 minute video of an Israeli thinktank guy talking about starting false flags to "get them to war" like they want.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if we can see these things coming ahead of time, we can be better prepared to react to them in ways that don't encourage warmongers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thoughts? Am I way off base here? Does this hypothesis make sense to anyone else? Do you see a more probable direction this is headed?

       So I was replying to an interesting comment, then it was deleted. The comment was:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Haven't there already been stories about ISIS cells operating in occupied Palestine? Like how the fuck did they gain entry? And then there was the bag of ISIS flags found to be the property of the invading Jews...

       Good points, got an article on either of those? I hadn't heard that. I was looking for it myself, and stumbled across this instead...

       They're
       <em>
        already
       </em>
       pushing the narrative I described. I didn't realize things had advanced this far already.
      </p>
      <p>
       And people are already pushing
       <em>
        back
       </em>
       against that narrative (3 days old opinion piece "The Palestinians Are Not ISIS"):

        "In the wake of the ISIS attacks on Paris, Israel’s top leadership, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on down, has been equating ISIS with Palestinian terror"

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think it is getting more and more obvious where this is headed.

       Actually, I really do think this resembles Israel's eventual plan for the Gazans. They will make up a grand excuse to exterminate them. They've already rounded them up to one convenient spot.

       I think they're going to try and make a bunch of them refugees and push them in to Jordan and create a trail of tears kind of situation. And the ones that won't leave will be killed. Unfortunately that's typically how existing populations are displaced from land they're on. That's how the West Bank is/was being "vacated" in to Jordan.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think they have any interest in exterminating them all per se, they just want them gone away somewhere, so they can have the land all to themselves. Displacing them as refugees is almost certainly a preferable option for many reasons, I would imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Gaza Strip though... there's really no where to go. I don't know how that one will be resolved. That's the reason I think it's more likely we'll see "ISIS=Hamas" instead of "ISIS=Fatah" as a narrative, because the Gaza Strip has 1.8 million people and no obvious route of exodus... I really worry for those people, I hope they try every available means to leave that place if it is still possible, before it is too late. I seriously worry about how the Gaza Strip will play out. Hopefully they don't go beyond squeezing them down with Buffer zones and then leave them be, but I don't think it's a stable situation after the Hamas takeover in 2007 and the 2014 Israeli attack. 95% of people in the Gaza Strip have PTSD. It's the most densely populated place on earth, and most have had someone they know die from war.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just really hope Israel can ease up and let those people form a life, but I know it's probably not going to happen after what they did in 2014. But it may. Just leave them that little strip of land. The problem is Hamas is super violent and has taken it over, and actually is a bit of a problem in terms of killing people (although like 1/10th of the number of people Israel kills in response...) so it's pretty fucked. The tensions are extremely high on both sides, but it's clear Israel is the one who needs to be the bigger man and leave them alone as much as possible despite these horrible attacks, because Israel has all the power in this situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The patience required to resolve this peacefully... Zionists don't have it, I am pretty sure. Especially if things like the Gulf of Tonkin and the six-day war and the settlements are any indication. So hopefully there will be some sort of exodus route for the people of the Gaza strip, it's all I can hope for because it seems like they're not going to leave the Gaza Strip alone. What a mess.

       Perhaps, but I don't know how you could watch that first video all the way through and come away with any sort of pro-zionist impression at all. It's pretty anti-zionist, I'd say. The second one, I can see a bit what you are talking about, but still I think it's mostly making the settlers and the state look bad.

       That's a

       easy one.  Just listen to their wording.  They're very careful about how they word what exactly is going on over there.  All the war and ruble and damage and death going on in Gaza?  It's BECAUSE OF ZIONISM and the occupation of Palestine.  They tip toe like a motherfucker around that and are real careful not to lay the obvious blame on Zionist bullshit for what's going on over there.

       Na.  It's anti Zionist by virtue of how obvious it is to everyone watching the presentation that all the damage is Israel's fault.  However, it's actually
       <em>
        not

       The second one is even worse than the first one.  The perspective they paint in the presentation gives a lot of "balance to both sides of the issue" when the actual fact of the matter is that Israel is conducting a genocidal occupation of Palestine and the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       "balance" is in calling what's going on what it actually

       :  The genocidal occupation of Palestine by Zionism.

       They do the same thing with drugs. On the surface they appear to be very pro-drug but if you pay attention to their language and how they frame everything it's clear they are promoting the opposite. Almost all of their drug stuff, especially recently, is about how dangerous and connected to crime these substances are.

       I can see what you mean, but I think in the second one they just gave that settler guy enough rope to hang himself with. The guy sounded like a tremendous douche bag using his own words, they didn't need to say "This guy is a douche". But I guess I can see what you mean, if you only look at the surface presentation.

       What I say is more valid the deeper you dig though.  On the surface what I say
       <em>
        seems
       </em>
       valid.  If you go under the hood though and see what's
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       going on, then what I say becomes pretty locked on correct.  If you don't really dig, then it "seems" like Zionism "might or might not be
       <em>
        somewhat
       </em>
       at fault in this".  It's when you dig deeper that you discover just how truly heinous and at fault Zionism is in all this.

       Well I agree they didn't make the strong link between Zionism and the Israeli government, but they also didn't link in other things like Rothschilds and so on. They can't include everything, and I don't think that's as a result of being overly pro-zionist. Just my 2 cents, I don't really know that much about VICE. Although last night I did come across this satirical article about VICE that gave me a good laugh:
       <a href="http://www.clickhole.com/article/stunning-map-shows-just-how-much-iraq-and-syria-vi-924">
        http://www.clickhole.com/article/stunning-map-shows-just-how-much-iraq-and-syria-vi-924
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, in my opinion I think VICE is about as even-handed as it gets, since almost all media is corrupted in some way or another. It's important to get a variety of perspectives anyway, no one should be relying on one news source.

       as even handed as it gets, but considering the owner of the magazine is none other than a millionaire Jew named Richard Szalwinski, I’m not really so super sure actually at how even handed it would be in its coverage of what’s happening in Gaza.

       True but I would venture a guess, based on personal experience, observation, and logic, that the majority of millionaire and billionaire Jews
       <em>

       Zionists, and certainly the majority of Israelis are.

       Like what needs to go their way for this to happen? Seems to me like they could just do this whenever they wanted, but I imagine they may wait for the Syrian government to collapse first and take care of that so they don't spread themselves/ISIS out too thin.

       I agree, but Israel needs the Palestinians still, as pawns, bargaining chips and human shields for as long as the neighboring states need a good thrashing and a central bank. Palestinians are last on the list, or close to it – certainly after Syria and Lebanon. Perhaps next, ISIS will have infiltrated Hezbollah (hell, I've probably already missed that headline somewhere).

       Except ISIS and Hamas are enemies.
       <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/30/islamic-state-threatens-hamas-gaza-strip">
        ISIS has threatened to topple Hamas
       </a>
       , and Hamas has been cracking down on jihadis in Gaza that oppose truces with Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       (ISIS of course isn't going to do that because it has its hands full.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Hamas was backed by Iran, which is an enemy of ISIS, but now is
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/will-irans-post-sanctions-windfall-benefit-hamas-maybe-not/2015/08/30/08d0c62c-481e-11e5-9f53-d1e3ddfd0cda_story.html">
        seeking backing from Saudi Arabia
       </a>
       , which is also an enemy of ISIS. ISIS has
       <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/06/suicide-bomber-attacks-mosque-in-saudi-arabia">
        sent suicide bombers to attack Saudi Arabia
       </a>
       , and the Saudis have
       <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/23/us-syria-crisis-saudi-idUSKCN0HI1Y120140923#ogy1zftY1bbuWcKG.97">
        dropped bombs on ISIS
       </a>
       . If Hamas even attempted closer ties to ISIS, it would be committing suicide because it would lose its foreign support, and ISIS would sooner wipe Hamas out than become its partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is common knowledge. The Israelis and everyone else in the region knows that Hamas and ISIS are enemies, and Hamas' backers are also enemies of ISIS.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Besides, Israel does not need ISIS as a pretext to invade Gaza. Any time Hamas fires a few rockets into Israel, or kidnaps an Israeli soldier, Israel invades.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet, Israel doesn't want or need to invade Gaza, at least not to hold ground permanently. There's nothing in Gaza remotely worth the blood and money that would be spent taking it over and controlling it. The Israelis have it sufficiently wrapped up with its border walls and truces with Hamas. It's much more efficient to let Hamas worry about governing Gaza, with its economic problems, shitty infrastructure, and socioeconomic decay.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, Israel would find itself swamped by Gaza's 1.8 million Palestinians, because its own population is just 8 million. Israel has no desire to dilute the Jewish character of its state by swallowing up so many non-Jews, and would collapse financially if they tried.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR Hamas and ISIS hate each other, and nobody in the region would confuse the two. Also, Israel doesn't want the shitty job of governing 1.8 million Gaza residents.

      <p>
       When he says, “it is the terrorists who are to blame for terrorism,” he is saying that nobody blames France for being attacked, so neither should anyone blame Israel when it is. He is arguing against those who blame Israel's treatment of Palestinians for Palestinian terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, from the article you linked:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But the real thrust of Israel’s efforts to promote solidarity in victimhood between Israel and France is the claim that it “is not the territories, not the settlements and not any other thing,” that causes terrorism...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Netanyahu wants to end criticism of Israel's West Bank settlements and its Gaza blockade. That goal has never been a secret or conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no link between ISIS and Hamas, any more than there is a link between the IRA and Hamas. Netanyahu does not claim either.

       Here is the actual quote, from the article you just linked:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “When it comes to their ultimate goals, Hamas is ISIS and ISIS is Hamas. And what they share in common, all militant Islamists share in common.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       For better context,
       <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/arabs/netanyahusept29.html">
        here
       </a>
       is the complete speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a fuller quote of that section:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So when it comes to their ultimate goals, Hamas is ISIS and ISIS is Hamas. And what they share in common all militant Islamists share in common. Boko Haram in Nigeria, al-Shabab in Somalia, Hezbollah in Lebanon, al-Nusra in Syria, the Mahdi army in Iraq, and the al-Qaida branches in Yemen, Libya, the Philippines, India and elsewhere.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some are radical Sunnis, some are radical Shiites, some want to restore a pre-medieval caliphate from the seventh century, others want to trigger the apocalyptic return of an imam from the ninth century. They operate in different lands, they target different victims and they even kill each other in their battle for supremacy. But they all share a fanatic ideology. They all seek to create ever-expanding enclaves of militant Islam where there is no freedom and no tolerance, where women are treated as chattel, Christians are decimated and minorities are subjugated, sometimes given the stark choice, convert or die. For them, anyone can be considered an infidel, including fellow Muslims.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And again, nowhere does Netanyahu claim any of those organizations are tied to each other except in ideology and willingness to commit violence. In fact, he says outright that they are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       linked and in fact oppose each other:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        They operate in different lands, they target different victims and they even kill each other in their battle for supremacy.

       What are they then? That Netanyahu is making a public speech to the entire world, then secretly directing a headline writer employed by a multinational corporation to transform those words from their original meaning into propaganda that will trigger an Israeli takeover of Gaza?

       I think it's confusing to us because the main group of people the rulers of Israel are trying to convince are Israelis themselves, who are mostly good people albeit brainwashed by religion. Moses in the old testament didn't use false flags to let his people go, he used gods magic against legitimate bad guys, the pharaoh and his folks. That's what the people want to happen again, as prophesized.

       There is no need to
       <em>
        try
       </em>
       to link them. Both Hamas and ISIS are branches of the Muslim Brotherhood. The Palestinians are their first front organization, started by MB co-founder Haj Amin al-Husseini. There have already been attacks from Gaza and WB claimed by ISIS. The Saudis, Qataris, and Emiratis have paid off enough Americans in high places to squelch any attempt to cut funding to the PA as part of an anti-ISIS campaign. Israel can't get the US to cut funding to the PA with clear evidence of PA leaders ordering attacks.

       "To get the sheep to hate/fear them?" That's A LOT of collateral for what could be accomplished by a few stateside attacks like SB or Paris.

       After your proxy army reference, you then state that ISIS is a tool of Israel? How can it be both? Especially when the point is made in this sub 400 times a day that US and Israeli interests are not the same?

       Well i mean for starters if you make the enemy scary enough you can get the entire world to do whatever you want. People are also a lot more sensitive to security measures after attacks. But if there is a group that actively exists, as a living menace which actively threatens the HomeLand. Then you've got your dragon to go slay. It just makes sense, plus i'm sure ISIS has been selling oil to European nations as well as running drugs and weapons like all good CIA operations do.
