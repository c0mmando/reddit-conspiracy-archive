<p>Could it be that the reason it &quot;doesn&#39;t make sense&quot; is that a pro team did the shooting wearing masks, and the patsys were just staged to be killed, to take the blame?  We see the same with Bataclan and Charlie Hedbo - the shooters are always masked and then revealed later when they die. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the real conspiracy is to think Muslims are so rabidly fanatical that a new mom would just dump her baby to...what? Shoot up some low level health inspectors? </p>

<p>And my point was not only that it is implausible from a human perspective, it is also physically implausible. New moms can take more than 6 months to fully recover from giving birth, especially petite women like this alleged &quot;mom Rambo.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t heard of any footage of them taking down the shooter, but that&#39;s the weak point in the whole idea - conceivable these perps were out in a black SUV with their machine guns and pipe bombs, trading fire with police.  All we would need to see is one video of them shooting at or throwing a pipe bomb, and that would confirm the suspicion that these were radicalized jihadis.  I don&#39;t think the police would be in on any conspiracy so, I have to believe it happened as has been reported.

</blockquote>

<p>My own theory on why some shootings look sloppy while others look professional is that they are staged by different intelligence agencies/law enforcement organizations/ etc. Some organizations might have simply more experience in staging false flag attacks, while others are still in the &quot;learning phase&quot; .... Just a thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can anybody post video clips of either reporters or witnesses saying that there were three shooters. Also are there any clips that show reporters or witnesses describing the shooters? I have read they were described as white men in a few articles and even some have said that at least one of the men had a big build. Does anybody know a rough estimate of Farook&#39;s build? I might start another thread later tonight if I can get a few of these clips together to kick it off. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t suddenly go from that to 5000 rounds of ammo, heavy grade weaponry, full body armour and a radicalised wife who will fight to the bitter end by your side.  Especially not within a few minutes.  Some element of this was pre-planned and had bern for some time; you don&#39;t just pick that stuff up in Walmart on a whim when the red mist comes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly...think about it. If you&#39;re a terrorist and have bought all these guns, built all these bombs, and purchased tactical gear, then wouldn&#39;t it stand to reason that you&#39;d go for maximum casualties? Instead, they decide to use the equipment on a whim after a spur-of-the-moment argument? In a conference room at a medical center?! I just can&#39;t believe that they would stash all this gear and use it just because they had a bad guy rather than say, a shopping mall, which would hurt the very corporate culture they believe are partly responsible for the injustices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s not give this story more credit than it deserves. The police response was rehearsed, the &quot;shooters&quot; were public pariahs who probably aren&#39;t dead, the &quot;victims&quot; were crisis actors. It&#39;s a false flag point blank. Where&#39;s the news coverage of the victim&#39;s families? Why are the shooter&#39;s families immediately swept into it? Why were there ID&#39;s and passports still left in their apartment for the news teams to find after the FBI apparently searched their home? If they were Muslim, what mosque did they go to? We know where they lived but not what Mosque they worshiped in? Where is the woman&#39;s baby? Why were they handcuffed before being shot to death? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So - few more thought.  If it were staged, they had to nab the man from the party; they could have misled him with an important phone call.  If the shooting scene at the SUV happened, it would have required only one dirty unit to kick it off. It seems there is some evidence of the gun battle during the chase, how would that have been done?  it would have required the per staging scene to do the firing, the perps are dead, the dirty unit trades Fire with the staging team. The staging team shoots the perps and flees over the fence.  This just seems really challenging thought.  It seems more plausible to me that this was as it is presented by the media.  </p>
