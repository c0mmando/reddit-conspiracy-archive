       Masks were worn, many reports of three shooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it be that the reason it "doesn't make sense" is that a pro team did the shooting wearing masks, and the patsys were just staged to be killed, to take the blame?  We see the same with Bataclan and Charlie Hedbo - the shooters are always masked and then revealed later when they die.

       The attorney for the Farook family says that the wife was just a 90 pound woman. Add to that that she gave birth just 6 or 7 months ago and now she is Rambo, gunning down people in tactical gear with an assault rifle? Even if that is physically possible, wouldn't the witnesses have noticed that one of the masked gunmen was quite petite?

       Yeah, the real conspiracy is to think Muslims are so rabidly fanatical that a new mom would just dump her baby to...what? Shoot up some low level health inspectors?
      </p>
      <p>
       And my point was not only that it is implausible from a human perspective, it is also physically implausible. New moms can take more than 6 months to fully recover from giving birth, especially petite women like this alleged "mom Rambo."

       He didn't say what he buys or doesn't buy, just argued for sense. The fact is, women do horrific things involving newborns pretty frequently and it's terrible - but the fact that she had a newborn isn't evidence that she didn't do it. I would think she probably
       <em>
        didn't
       </em>
       but not at all for that reason.

       You're specifically asking for evidence of a likely unrelated phenomenon, because somebody said it's a thing? The point was that a mother with a newborn isn't automatically innocent.

       That's probably why the police wouldn't let witnesses talk to the reporters. They had to ensure that the news only received their scripted story of events.
      </p>
      <p>
       "police have warned people not to talk to the media. At one point during the KTLA live stream, the reporter attempted to interview a witness and multiple officers rushed up and pushed the reporters and the witnesses apart."

       True! And the media is allowed to go into the couple's house, a crime scene, thereby eliminating any potential evidence of guilt or innocence that would have been there. Now due to media interference"whatever story they give to us is the only "truth".

       Do we have any footage of them taking down the shooter? I think they had somebody cuffed already then took them out and shot him while the real shooters were helped to escape.

       I haven't heard of any footage of them taking down the shooter, but that's the weak point in the whole idea - conceivable these perps were out in a black SUV with their machine guns and pipe bombs, trading fire with police.  All we would need to see is one video of them shooting at or throwing a pipe bomb, and that would confirm the suspicion that these were radicalized jihadis.  I don't think the police would be in on any conspiracy so, I have to believe it happened as has been reported.  Although zia proposed the postulate, I don't necessarily brelieve in it, it's just a thought.

       Thing is, if it was a conspiracy, my theory would be that this "center for the disabled" was a human trafficking front that they wanted to mop up.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that were the case, it's likely at least some of the department would be in on it, sort of like the sheriff in the Johnny Gosch case.

       My own theory on why some shootings look sloppy while others look professional is that they are staged by different intelligence agencies/law enforcement organizations/ etc. Some organizations might have simply more experience in staging false flag attacks, while others are still in the "learning phase" .... Just a thought.

       He was arrested for being seen running near the SUV during the shootout.  Probably was ethnic or close enough to car that it raised eye brows, and wasn't allowed to go right away.  Cops released him after finding no connection.

       The detained and then the orange Camo guy are two separate people. I refer all of you to the closed reddit live thread to view the events as they were transcribed in real time, you can see the reports of the two are different. Also note how long it took for the church to be code 4

       Can anybody post video clips of either reporters or witnesses saying that there were three shooters. Also are there any clips that show reporters or witnesses describing the shooters? I have read they were described as white men in a few articles and even some have said that at least one of the men had a big build. Does anybody know a rough estimate of Farook's build? I might start another thread later tonight if I can get a few of these clips together to kick it off.

       You don't suddenly go from that to 5000 rounds of ammo, heavy grade weaponry, full body armour and a radicalised wife who will fight to the bitter end by your side.  Especially not within a few minutes.  Some element of this was pre-planned and had bern for some time; you don't just pick that stuff up in Walmart on a whim when the red mist comes.

       Exactly...think about it. If you're a terrorist and have bought all these guns, built all these bombs, and purchased tactical gear, then wouldn't it stand to reason that you'd go for maximum casualties? Instead, they decide to use the equipment on a whim after a spur-of-the-moment argument? In a conference room at a medical center?! I just can't believe that they would stash all this gear and use it just because they had a bad guy rather than say, a shopping mall, which would hurt the very corporate culture they believe are partly responsible for the injustices.

       Another quick thought on SB shooters:
      </p>
      <p>
       What ever the government says happened is a lie.  Do not believe the official story.  The government never tells the truth, they are not going to start now.

       I think there'd be too many moving parts, and too many questions that would be asked if something went wrong which it easily could have. What if some rando cop happened to be around the corner and went all John Mclane, unmasking several implausible shooters, and raising a lot of suspicion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there'd be too much risk for any Hollywood style coverups or false flags.

       Let's not give this story more credit than it deserves. The police response was rehearsed, the "shooters" were public pariahs who probably aren't dead, the "victims" were crisis actors. It's a false flag point blank. Where's the news coverage of the victim's families? Why are the shooter's families immediately swept into it? Why were there ID's and passports still left in their apartment for the news teams to find after the FBI apparently searched their home? If they were Muslim, what mosque did they go to? We know where they lived but not what Mosque they worshiped in? Where is the woman's baby? Why were they handcuffed before being shot to death?

       Out of every single one of these "false flag attack"  threads claiming crisis actors and media/government collusion, there has never been a single piece of solid evidence supporting the claim. With thousands of people involved in these things somebody would have slipped up by now. There are bodies, video, photos, eye witnesses, and paper trails that all support what is reported is actually the truth.

       So - few more thought.  If it were staged, they had to nab the man from the party; they could have misled him with an important phone call.  If the shooting scene at the SUV happened, it would have required only one dirty unit to kick it off. It seems there is some evidence of the gun battle during the chase, how would that have been done?  it would have required the per staging scene to do the firing, the perps are dead, the dirty unit trades Fire with the staging team. The staging team shoots the perps and flees over the fence.  This just seems really challenging thought.  It seems more plausible to me that this was as it is presented by the media.
