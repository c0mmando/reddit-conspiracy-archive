    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a fuzzy distinction, but I don&#39;t think the govt explanation of 9/11 qualifies as a &quot;theory&quot;.  It has actual evidence supporting it.  Whereas some claim that the govt did 9/11 is a theory; no solid evidence of that.</p>

<p>Evidence that supports the govt explanation: footage/pictures of the hijackers in the airports, video and eyewitnesses of planes hitting the buildings, records of hijackers entering the USA, records and eyewitnesses of hijackers taking flight lessons, phone calls from passengers saying &quot;we&#39;re being hijacked&quot;, flight 93 cockpit voice recorder showing struggles, accidental radio transmissions of the hijackers voices from the planes, Bin Laden claiming responsibility (after first denying it).</p>

<p>There&#39;s no footage of Atta at Logan Airport. His trail goes cold in Maine.</p>

<p>Sure, the govt evidence is not COMPLETE.  As in any big event, there are gaps, contradictions, information destroyed, etc.</p>

<p>A blanket dismissal of all evidence is just unreasonable, just a mark of wishful thinking.  You have a conclusion you want to be true, and you will deny or invent facts to support it.  That&#39;s the hallmark of conspiracy theory.  And religion, by the way.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure most of the public is unaware of most details about 9/11.  Why does that mean anything ?  They don&#39;t care about details.  They saw planes crash into the towers, and the huge collapses that damaged surrounding buildings.  All of it makes common sense.

<p>If a person isn&#39;t into conspiracies, then they&#39;re most likely not going to read an FOIA document.  These kind of people only get their news from the MSM and that&#39;s it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So? I had assumed they were going to say no which is why I put the next sentence.</p>

<p>When you ask someone whether they read or heard about some important sounding news that they don&#39;t know about, they feel slightly insecure about their ignorance which makes them more receptive to the information you&#39;re about to suggest.</p>

<p>For someone who&#39;s into reading between the lines, you don&#39;t know much about manipulation, do you?</p>

<p>No they don&#39;t.  People will either ignore you or get offended when they feel insecure.  </p>

<p>No, I don&#39;t know much about manipulation because I don&#39;t try and manipulate people but it looks like you&#39;re soooo into manipulating people that you have manipulated yourself into believing your own bullshit.  </p>

<p>Shit, think of where you are right now. Reddit is essentially a list of links saying &quot;have you seen this?&quot;</p>

<p>I would strongly recommend you do some research before delving into alt media. This stuff can really mess with your head if you don&#39;t know how to recognize which agenda is which.</p>

<p>And I very well know about media agenda, regardless if it&#39;s for or against conspiracies.  I have to go through all the media bullshit and try and make an educated guess as to what&#39;s really going on.  You can&#39;t believe everything you read.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m very skeptical of alt news also. Everybody is pushing a agenda. That&#39;s kind of the definition of news. Somebody chooses what to display as valuable info, and another person decides how it should be presented. 
Maybe the only thing we could call real news is raw data, example: police scanners, government documents, financial records, etc. </p>
