<p>Just like practically every part of the government, the FBI is compartmentalized.  </p>

<p>The FBI agents were told to forget about the 3rd suspect when a higher up who knows the whole story told the agents to forget about the 3rd suspect.  </p>

<p>One things for sure. There has to be video of the shootout from police and news helicopters.  They should show exactly what happened.

<p>Starts at 10:11 AM California time and goes in 1/2 hour increments until 8:08 PM.  This is the main Police Channel that most people were listening to.  If you want earlier than 10:11 AM or later than 8:08 PM please let me know.  I have to go out to run errands.  When I return I&#39;ll post Fire and Sheriff if there&#39;s interest.</p>

<p>Edit 17:20 more questions about 3rd man. Police &quot;don&#39;t have information&quot; on whether detained man had weapons on him.</p>

Primarily the part where the reporter says &quot;pressure from the top administration&quot; and that they are &quot;dragging their feet&quot;.</p>

<p>To me,  it seems like the FBI got pissed and exposed evidence in the home to the press because of pressure from the top administration to deem this &quot;work place violence&quot;, just as they did the Fort Hood shootings.  If you don&#39;t recall what occurred in Fort Hood and know they only recently classified it &quot;terrorism&quot;, Google it. </p>

<p>I think someone in the FBI will be <em>stepping down</em>(getting fired) soon.  If there is a conspiracy here,  it&#39;s that the administration did not want this classified as terrorism.  For reasons I&#39;m unaware of.  Why else would the ID&#39;s be placed on the bed next to the Koran?  I think the FBI just went against the administration and so did the news.  The administration wanted this to be solely &quot;domestic terrorism&quot; and the wife with the K9 visa fucked it all up,  haha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was being sarcastic.  Of course any manipulation from the top would quickly be exposed.  These theories that 9/11 was ordered by the White House or similar things are complete nonsense.  No such secret would be kept for more than a few days.  The govt is full of people with conflicting loyalties and motives, from opposite parties, competing with each other for advancement or budget, etc.  The notion that, say, FBI and CIA and NTSB and EPA and ATC and NYPD and NYFD all could cooperate to do and hide 9/11 is ludicrous.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. No way they could pull off 9/11 and fail at something as simple as planting evidence of wmd&#39;s in Iraq.  That&#39;s been my entire argument. It would have justified everything.  That and rigging the towers to explode  with nobody noticing,  while lacing the building with thermite is next to impossible.  That shit sinks. </p>

<p>But still,  the home being set up and released to the press and the extreme pull to not say this was terrorism in San Bernardino,  along with Fort Hood,  scream they want to sweep terrorism under the rug but failed.  </p>

<p>I think that&#39;s the real conspiracy,  even though it&#39;s not as fantastic sounding as a fake shooting or alien lizard men. </p>

<p>I mean,  president Clinton couldn&#39;t even hide a blow job,  haha. The government is okay at hiding things,  but it&#39;s made of many people,  and over 3 people in on something,  it&#39;s bound to leak. </p>

<p>This seems nonsense to me.  If they wanted to sweep it under the rug, they would have had a nice fire in the apartment.  Heck, they found bombs there, I think.  They could have just let one of them go off and destroy everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you wish to keep believing known and proven liars, good luck and godspeed to you too.</p>

<p>Americans who just &quot;believe&quot; their cops, their media and their government on word alone are no different from the ISIS members that do the same.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Once your faith, sir, persuades you to believe what your intelligence declares to be absurd, beware lest you likewise sacrifice your reason in the conduct of your life. In days gone by, there were people who said to us: &quot;You believe in incomprehensible, contradictory and impossible things because we have commanded you to; now then, commit unjust acts because we likewise order you to do so.&quot; Nothing could be more convincing. <strong>Certainly any one who has the power to make you believe absurdities has the power to make you commit injustices.</strong> If you do not use the intelligence with which God endowed your mind to resist believing impossibilities, you will not be able to use the sense of injustice which God planted in your heart to resist a command to do evil. Once a single faculty of your soul has been tyrannized, all the other faculties will submit to the same fate. This has been the cause of all the religious crimes that have flooded the earth.&quot;</p>
