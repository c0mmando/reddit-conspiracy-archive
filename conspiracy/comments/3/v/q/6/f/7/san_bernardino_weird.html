       Please feel free to provide info/input on any of this. I am relying solely on minimal live viewing, the full scanner feed, my

        notes
       </a>
       and any articles I can find regarding my questions. I have not kept up with any progressions in this case. One thing I am nearly certain of after spending the last few days on this: there were at least
       <strong>
        six
       </strong>
       main suspects throughout the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       First thing that I find interesting is that they seemed to have learned their lesson. I think that if it weren't for the scanner, they might have pulled this one off. In reference to Sandy Hook and Boston: 
To bypass mistakes made at Sandy Hook, buses were on seen (and reported) very soon after the shooting to transport the "witnesses and victims." This is the
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/3FusZz0.png">
        route
       </a>
       that the buses likely took to The Rock Church. They then set up the
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RJ23FI6.png">
        Hernandez Center
       </a>
       for families of victims and witnesses. I found this article which was able to
       <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/nation-world/national/article47697530.html">
        catch a reunion
       </a>
       before all the families were sent to Hernandez.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A few minutes later, a woman, her face streaked with tears, emerged from a police car that had driven her to the end of the church driveway and crumbled into the arms of her family. “I’m OK,” said the woman, who would not give her name.
        <strong>
         “We can’t talk to anyone. They told us: not to anyone.”
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No more Gene Rosen mishaps or merry go rounds at the staging areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       [[For nearly three hours, there is a clear confusion over the scanner as to why the victim's families are being directed to the Hernandez Center, and there are repeated reminders that witnesses go to The Rock, then Hernandez, as witnesses were showing up at the Hernandez Center, and family was showing up at The Rock. (This is important for later)]]
      </p>
      <p>
       We see a repeat of Boston..
       <em>
        Entire neighborhoods were on lockdown as the authorities conducted house-by-house sweeps to look for the heavily armed suspects.... This sprawling community of strip malls and shopping centers, a refuge for Latino, Asian and Middle Eastern immigrants in the mountains an hour east of Los Angeles, was transformed into a rolling crime scene; a sea of screaming sirens, roadblocks at every turn, bomb threats and police officers wearing flak jackets marching down the street or breaking down doors.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Only, there was such a distinct perimeter that the media wasn't able to see it all. The media was set up at
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KzVwhTv.png">
        3 key locations.
       </a>
       I will be interested in seeing upcoming amateur footage of these door-to-doors.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is strategically, one of the
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/qnUH2xT.png">
        best locations
       </a>
       that this could have happened, in the area. They really knew what they were doing. This facility was literally cornered in, anything that happens within this area is going to be controlled and easily manipulated. It is near several major roadways, and is within seconds of easy access to any direction they please: North, south, east or west. There is also an airport. They're not limited to the roadway, either. The Santa Ana River (or sand bar) is right there, too. Throughout the day, there are multiple reports of suspicious men near, on or under bridges that this "river" passes under. It is also a
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Y2KmPPu.png">
        pretty easy drive
       </a>
       to the residence, there are many routes that can be taken. Everything I am about to discuss occurs in

        this box.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Okay, let's get into the nitty gritty.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The most ballsy thing the media is doing right now is completely manipulating what transpired by way of combining
       <strong>
        two
       </strong>
       high speed pursuits into
       <strong>
        one
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        three areas of insight
       </strong>
       into
       <strong>
        one.
       </strong>
       I will be comparing a timeline prepared by
       <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/02/san-bernadino-mass-shooting/">
        Breitbart
       </a>
       to show how they are doing this. I will also be referring to my
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3v6p1q/authorities_responding_to_reports_of_mass/cxkrb0i?context=3">
        notes.
       </a>
       I'll also be including some times on my recording for good measure. My recording begins at Edit 3 and is 5:33:53 of recorded feed.  I estimate that my recording began around 12:13pm Pacific time.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Breitbart:
       </strong>
       <em>
        3:00 p.m.: There are conflicting reports from police. Publicly, police seem to be saying that they do not know who the suspects are, or where they are. On the police scanner, however, there is talk of “two at gunpoint” and pursuit of a male in camouflage.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Here is what happened according to the scanner:
       </strong>
       Edit 52 2:28:40/2:30:20: An officer comes on the radio mention an a call that came in 1 hour prior about someone dressed in cammo at
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/wyZqRJc.png">
        30th and Waterman
       </a>
       armed with a long gun. Dispatch returns saying no one went to that call. It is confirmed and a .22 long rifle is picked up. 
Edit 57 2:39:00: (also ties into Edit 71) Dispatch calls out a 15 min old report of a man in camo at
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/sZWNTz4.png">
        1729 S Richardson,
       </a>
       which is followed up with a report on the 1700 block of East Coulston. 
Edit 59 2:40:35: Two suspects are held at gunpoint. There is an immediate switch of channel, to channel 2. 
Edit 60 2:42:20: A possible handler is sighted in the area. Described as "east of them" - a heavy set while male in a champagne colored SUV (honestly believe this is our possible 3rd vehicle from Edit 70).
       <br/>
       Edit 65 2:49:18: Two new bomb threats are immediately reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something or someone is
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/3xcFWST.png">
        in this area
       </a>
       that EVERYONE (suspects) seem to go to, or tries to get to. It is interesting that
       <a href="http://abc7.com/news/new-video-police-chase-shoot-san-bernardino-suspects/1109221/">
        this video
       </a>
       was taken at 1491 E. San Bernardino Ave (street view shows the same silos and white/green building/gated entry). In the video, you can see the black SUV travelling slowly, speed up to 40mph towards Richardson,
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/gqNzWvp.png">
        turn on their flashers
       </a>
       , and shoot their weapons. This was planned and this was a warning that shots would be fired, or the suspects were trying to alert someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Breitbart:
       </strong>
       <em>
        3:12 p.m.: Police scanners are reporting that officers have exchanged fire with the occupant(s) of a black SUV. One reports “suspect down in the westbound lane” of the 10 freeway. show police vehicles surrounding someone on the ground, and a car crashed nearby. Earlier scanner reports indicated a chase at 110 mph, but it was not clear if it was related.
       </em>
       Helicopter shots from
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjIHvGdMMW4">
        KABC
       </a>
       The link provides a view of this misdirect, as they are focused on a speeding F150 at first.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        According to the scanner:
       </strong>
       [Backstory]
Edit 50 2:22:00: There is a clear and distinct mention of "someone was here who is no longer here" and an investigator is requested to examine evidence. 
Edit 53 2:30:30: A report comes in about witnesses seeing people hiding in a vehicle the same area of the parking lot. It is noted that this was a much earlier call and that "they may have already gotten them." A K9 unit sweeps the area and finds no one. 
Edit 54: An unanswered call comes over the radio that witnesses are claiming a suspect is at the staging area (Hernandez Center).
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/UCcQpIu.png">
        Here is the relation
       </a>
       of Edit 50 and Edit 53 based on description from both officers reporting these events. It is very possible that people were left behind accidentally or purposefully due to the quick response of police. Two of these people seem to be who was involved in the
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4NeqTgy.png">
        first pursuit
       </a>
       right before the couple went all jihadi.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Here's how that first pursuit went down:
       </strong>
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Gduf6qR.png">
        Edit 66: It started near animal control at 2:50:48,
       </a>
       where they broke a fence that remained attached to the vehicle. It was a dark colored Chevy SUV. (Also interesting is that up until this point, the dark SUV was always referred to as a Yukon or Suburban).
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/gEanle6.png">
        It remained on surface streets after leaving the target parking lot,
       </a>
       as the driver began driving north towards the Hernandez center.
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/mQ3Uicj.png">
        It continued north
       </a>
       until the driver hit a white truck seconds from the Hernandez Center. The initial location comes in at Rialto and Sierra. We then find out that someone
       <em>
        got out
       </em>
       of the vehicle or
       <em>
        ran from
       </em>
       the Hernandez Center at Allen and King and the officer goes down on
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/JKiwWUj.png">
        E 2nd and Bryant
       </a>
       . 
Edit 67: This is our "official" 3rd suspect being detained at the crash on Rialto and Sierra, another location of Allen and King is mentioned at 2:55:31. A second runner from this crash is mentioned as having a cut on his left hand at 2:54:50.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one being detained was wearing a dark shirt and blue jeans running east bound through a parking lot at Bryant. It is during
       <strong>
        this footchase
       </strong>
       that the officer goes down. I have spent hours trying to find
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBqhB5KCP3c">
        this residence
       </a>
       and can't. But the video is edited to make it appear as if it is near the initial shooting. There are clips of the railroad crossing seconds from where the vehicle was shot up, which make it seem as though they happened at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wondered why the media is not correcting this and found a plausible answer: There are
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/tJ6OvDZ.png">
        3 Targets
       </a>
       and 3 main
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/SUzWNhK.png">
        Animal control
       </a>
       facilities. They are all right next to each each other. Near three main scenes: The home, the original shooting, and the location of the .22 found. This chase 'could' have started at any of these locations, it would take someone to go in and map each street to see that it occurred near the original shooting location and the Hernandez Center. I think they are relying on people just automatically thinking it occurred at the Target near the suspect's home.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Main Pursuit:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 62 2:44:30: This is the first serious sighting of the black SUV with Utah plates. It is sighted at
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/WweVj8c.png">
        Tennessee and State St.
       </a>
       2:47:32: Officer who saw the SUV states that it did a "soft drive-by" (of the residence which is right around the corner). This just so happens to be the "same time" that police get a tip about the home. 
2:55:00: It is noted that the vehicle did not seem spooked, was driving slowly. 
2:55:37: This is our
       <strong>
        shots fired
       </strong>
       call at San Bernardino and Richardson. That is what
       <a href="http://abc7.com/news/new-video-police-chase-shoot-san-bernardino-suspects/1109221/">
        this video
       </a>
       captures. They are driving slowly, speed up to 40mph, turn on their
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/gqNzWvp.png">
        flashers,
       </a>
       and begin shooting. 
2:55:45: "one in custody" comes over the scanner with mention that there
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       another pursuit going on. I believe this is our 3rd suspect in the blue shirt over by the Hernandez Center. 
2:56:53: 'One suspect is out of the vehicle.'
       <br/>
       2:57:42: A request to shut down the road at Mountain View comes over the scanner. This is East of Richardson. 
2:58:25: The location of Southbound 7th comes over the radio. This is near the Hernandez Center. I believe this is a sighting of our runner with the cut on his hand from earlier.
       <br/>
       2:59:26: We hear gunshots, and a bearcat is requested at 1797 E San Bernardino Avenue. 
3:03:00: This is our first mention of "possibly one on the run." I don't think anyone ran from the vehicle, I think a civilian ran from the scene. 
3:04:23: We have mention of another officer down, but not a serious injury. 
3:04:41: They mention securing the south perimeter for a runner. 
3:05:00: Eagle 1 says they saw NO ONE running. 
3:08:40: Someone is detained on Cooley St. 
3:09:08: Dispatch tries to relay the message that a dark SUV was involved at the Rialto crash, but she is cut off abruptly by static. 
3:10:00: We begin our neighborhood lock down in the area. Door to door teams on the ground. 
3:17:53: A report of our runner in the backyards is reported on Allen St. This neighborhood is quickly locked down and yard to yard searches occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       My lingering questions:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Orange Shirt Guy
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Orange Shirt Guy is first mentioned shortly before the SUV is sighted at 2:44:05. His location is reported being at 715 E Brier Drive. The time we first hear of him is roughly 2:42:00 but the report is old (approx 15 mins). A man with a cut on one hand is mentioned at 2:54:50 at Sierra and Rialto. We hear of orange shirt guy again at 3:39:51 back on Brier Drive... as having a cut on one hand. Their focus is the Wells Fargo, but air traffic and any additional support is sent to Brier Drive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am really kind of confused on Orange shirt guy. He either left the Rialto crash, and doubled back to this area, or there are two orange shirt guys in this scenario,
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       they are completely working off of our first call at 2:42:00. Something I found interesting, is that they refer to this location on Brier as being a Wells Fargo. It’s actually a copier repair company. The only Wells Fargo that I could find in my box that had a parking garage was.. you guessed it.. by the Hernandez Center.

       ) captures our Amazon shooter in the beginning of this clip. These two suspects are later confirmed detained at 3:28:50. I have no clue who these people are or why they randomly shot a gun outside or near the Amazon. Perhaps it was a diversion tactic. I believe it was a diversion. Someone was running across the runway of the airport when they were detained. “Hearing shots and running away” is a good excuse to be running on an airport runway. Also, later in the evening, we have reports of runners by the airport along 3rd Street but no further mention of detainment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there is the show that the police put on at the home:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At almost exactly 6:30 p.m. what sounded distinctly like a shotgun blast came from the condo complex. It shook up the gaggle of local news people who were setting up their stand-ups. At that point, a huge contingent of press and neighborhood looky-loos was gathered behind a police cordon a little less than a football field away from the complex.
About 20 minutes after the blast, police pushed the press line back two blocks to the north so it was about a half a mile away and unable to see anything. The officer said there was a threat and the press needed to move back for safety.
A Daily Beast reporter slipped through the cordon and down a side street, and was able to get a direct view of the condo, where there were orange flashing lights that looked like they were on top of a pole that was coming out of a truck. The homes, some of which had been decorated in Christmas lights,
        <strong>
         seemed largely abandoned
        </strong>
        . Besides the SWAT officers and press, the neighborhood was entirely silent.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is weird. The orange lights on a pole? The abandoned neighborhood? The fact that SWAT waited nearly
       <strong>
        2 hours
       </strong>
       after arriving at this home to enter it? None of it makes any sense, and none of it screams "attack by a radical." This was highly thought out event.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if it weren't for the scanners, no one would be able to piece any of this together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusion
What the conspiracy theorist in me says:
      </p>
      <p>
       We see a repeat of OKC - Handler moves up the date of the attack and frustrates Syed. Mistakes are made, and every authority on this case plays cover-up for the next 5 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       6 people were involved. 2 drove away, 1 (blue shirt guy) was caught up in the chaos and 3 traveled south by foot to the area of Richardson/Coulston.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 (the couple) ditched the .22 at the area of 30th and Waterman after leaving the site of the shooting. I am not sure what they did for the next 4 hours, but something made them drive by their 'residence' at the
       <em>
        'same time'
       </em>
       police received their tip about the home.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 were apprehended at Richardson,
      </p>
      <p>
       1 (orange shirt guy) traveled by vehicle to pick up blue shirt guy at the Hernandez Center. There was a crash, which provides an explanation for our runner having a cut on one hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blue shirt guy was apprehended at the crash site, orange shirt guy managed to get away. Orange shirt guy was then able to evade the police and made it to the airport down 3rd from the Hernandez center. I am almost wanting to say this guy got on a plane that night.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have absolutely no clue how the Amazon shooting plays into all of this other than it being a diversion.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I can say for certain, is that none of this makes any sense.

       This is a lot of info. You need to put this together into a book and self-publish on Lulu. If someone did this for each one of these suspicious events, we'd have great resources to always go back to when this stuff happens in the future.

       It's a shame that talking about reality in such an honest fashion can get a person suicided these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Picture it. America 50 years from now on 2065. An old man is having a conversation with his beloved grandson. 
Boy, when I was a kid we were allowed to a call a school bus yellow without being killed for it...
      </p>
      <p>
       Wow Grandpa, society was so uncivilized back then! At Sandy Hook, were taught that calling the sky blue, or stating out loud that pigs, by law of nature, absolutely cannot fly, has taken a risk at collapsing all of civilization! It could lead to anarchy and collapse of society! The only word to be spoken are words that are LEGAL! We're in a democracy, the laws change when something is broken because we run it duh! Obviously they are illegal FOR A REASON. I just can't WAIT to go to school tomorrow and tell my teacher a real life example of just how bad things can get from slip of the tongue! Love you pappy
      </p>
      <p>
       Grandpa dies within days after realizing all hope is lost in the war. The war for Homo Sapiens right to not be domesticated and enslaved, like many species before it. Only a "miracle" will bring us back to a world resembling anything REMOTELY like 2015. Ok now I'm sad.

       Here transcripts of the only two first-hand eyewitness interviews that were broadcast on tv:
      </p>

       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTYja7GXcY">
        Witness 1

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Scott Pelley: One of the witnesses today is _____, who works at the Inland Regional Center, the building where the attack took place. She saw the attackers enter the building and we spoke to her by phone.
       </p>
       <p>
        Witness: I heard umm shots fired and it was you know from an automatic weapon so you know it was very unusual... why, you know why would we hear shots? As we look out the window a second set of shots goes off, and its just pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop and we saw a man fall to the floor. Then we just looked and
        <strong>
         we saw three men dressed in all black military attire with vests on they were holding assault rifles
        </strong>
        and they (breathes) as soon as they opened the door to building three and one of them opened up the door to building three he started to spray shoot, you know shoot all over into the room, that's the room that we typically have conferences in, and we just heard more gun shots go off.
I got my phone. I reached for my phone. I called 911 and I just hid under my desk. I didn't see anymore, I just heard more gunshots go off as I was talking to the dispatch. We went into my manager's office, locked the door, barricaded it. We heard running and things happening upstairs. About 30 minutes later someone came to the door, knocked on the door. But we didn't obviously answer. Then another 60 minutes later someone came and took us into a secure room.
       </p>
       <p>
        Scott Pelley: Ms. ____ can you describe to me in as much detail as you can, what did the gunmen look like?
       </p>
       <p>
        Witness: I couldn't see his face, he had a black hat on and from my view all I could see was a black hat and black long sleeve shirt, possibly gloves on. Ummm... he had black cargo pants on the kind with the zippers on the side and the big puffy pockets. He had a huge assault rifle and he had extra ammo. He was coming ready for, he was coming ready for something. To reload I don't know. He had [inaudible] magazines. Umm... I couldn't see what else, I just saw three dressed exactly the same.
       </p>
       <p>
        Scott Pelley:
        <strong>
         You're certain that you saw three men?
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Witness:
        <strong>
         Yes, it looked like their skin color was yeah, was white. They looked like they were athletic build and umm... they appeared to be tall.

        <strong>
         Where I was at right here we seen there were three white men in military fatigues, um taking off.

       <p>
        Q: What were they driving?

       </p>
       <p>
        Q:
        <strong>
         Do you think that they might have been the shooters?

         Yeah, the way they were driving...yeah

        Q: And how many shots did you hear?"
       </p>
       <p>
        Witness: Oh, a lot, it was a lot, it sounded like I said it sounded like a gun range just shots going off. It was crazy. It was a lot. A lot of shots.

       I really wish I could find out if these two went to The Rock before these interviews.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they did, this was the official story: 3 crazy white guys with guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       If not, 2 people are dead that shouldn't be (other than the 14).
      </p>
      <p>
       The only hangup on witnesses saying they saw white men after, is this conversation that takes places early in my recording which features some more witness statement:
      </p>
      <p>
       (min 9:20 into my recording): "I have some info from the LAPD on them wanting this suspect. I heard someone was trying to (IMV &lt;- sounds like IMV) him, who do I give this info to."
      </p>
      <p>
       Several minutes later (12:20),
      </p>
      <p>
       Responding officer: What's your 20, we're going to send a unit with that info.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inquiring officer: Well, if someone has a phone, I can just call.

       Responding: No one has a phone over here, unless you want to call into dispatch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pause for several minutes (28:11 Det Tony king? Is requested)
      </p>
      <p>
       Inquiring: My understanding is you're the one who came up with the info on this subject, if so who did you get it from, who is that person?
      </p>
      <p>
       King: Ryan Shulky is the one who's got it, he's got the notes on it, physical description, name and I just put it on the air.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inquiring: Okay I got that info, just wanted to know who it came from, I'll contact him, I guess.
King: Okay
      </p>
      <p>
       Inquiring (29:00): Can you raise the unit with Junior Officer Shulky and have him go to 5 please.
Responding Unit: My understanding is you got the guy's name and date of birth, where did that info come from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shulky: I got it from a witness, who said the guy sitting next to him was a country worker, was acting a little 
weird, left early, bout 30 minutes later shooting happened, shooter matched height and build of the guy, I have a name and no date of birth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inquiring: Where is that witness now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shulky: South side of golf course with the rest of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inquiring: What's his name
      </p>
      <p>
       Shulky: States witness name
      </p>
      <p>
       This witness could very well have been a plant to mention Syed's name, or it could be an honest mention. I am not sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, my theory of six people still kind of can play into the notion that it was 3 men. It's highly possible that 3 were agents, or other white men, and 3 were the fall guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I can really say is that the police were very focused on 6 main people that day - not 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: As far as the woman, I am willing to say that she wasn't involved. I honestly think that if she were involved, it was just as a driver. However, I can't stand people saying it wasn't her because her height/weight make it impossible for her to carry the gear. I am roughly the same size, can carry a rifle, and didn't ever have issues any time I had to wear gear during my stay in the Army.

       Let me first applaud OP and everyone here for questioning things laid out by the government and media both. A lot of shit gets reported wrong, important things don't get reported, and stupid BS makes headlines.
      </p>
      <p>
       But... you're doing it all wrong. First off, let me tell you that I am former military and currently a first responder, so I have a strong understanding of the systems you're using for OSINT, or open source intel. Kudos on the technique and sources, but your understanding of them is leading you to flawed work. Let me outline how, so that you can dig deeper into things - I'm not being critical to be a dick.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Scanner traffic is almost %100 unreliable when coming from dispatch. Why? Dispatch is in a locked down secured office with no windows. They're ONLY able to relay what citizens or other units call in and report. They're not on scene and trust me when I say the average person calling in is almost always wrong. Sometimes they don't know better, sometimes it's second hand and theyre extrapolating, sometimes they like fucking with us. Field units, such as fire, ems, and police can be wrong too. Even when the scene is all around you shits confusing.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The good stuff never goes out on the air. Detailed call notes and updates get messages to the mobile data terminal in their vehicles. Units  can message each other and dispatch here too. Anything sensitive goes via encrypted data via computer, so most of the radio traffic is using these messages as context that is hidden from listeners. If it has to go out over radio and is sensitive such as victims names or tactical movements, encrypted channels are activated so you cant listen anyway. This can account for inaccuracies heard over air, and a seemingly sudden or silent change or redirection of efforts or information... its because the updated info went out over the MDTs everyone read. There's no recap because this system is for the people working, not for you. They stay up to date and don't even think about giving a fuck if some poor scanner hobbiest is confused.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         People are stupid and gossipy. This goes especially for the media. Yes, they have an agenda - to get as much ratings as possible. People on scene are this way too, but for their own twitter accounts. Ive literally been holding pressure on gunshot wounds while the persons friend is walking around asking when the news crews will be there. ... more than once. This reinforces point 1 that people are stupid, confused, and don't get information right and builds to point number 3 that: People can't keep their yaps shut. Things like staged attacks, actors, falsified crime scenes that are sets wouldnt last a fucking second because people would be on that story like flies on shit.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         That would also mean good men like me and better men and women that I work with would be a part of setting shit up to fool and traumatize the communities we work and live in. For what? A corrupt, broken government? Money? No. Fucking. Way. I find it personally offensive when people tell me that the shattered lives I've experienced are fake, that me putting my ass on the line is an act and the reasons I can't sleep and visit my therapist Jack Daniels is a conspiracy theory. (Down vote away.) I know people are fucked and there are real conspiracies, but no local responder will ever betray their community like that. In 99% of America Your local responders will literally die for you, and some have (Colorado) so if you think that's fake fuck you.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The sad truth is all of the good info is obtainable only to those on the inside. The second best thing is people who were there, and a very very distant third is media. Cuz unless you got one of the first two types of intel, the media is all you got.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       So while I applaud your efforts, please realize you do not have good intel from just the scanner recordings. It can, if its correct, give you a better picture than the media offers. But it is usually not correct AND there is hidden context in computer messages you can't see. You simply cant base a hypothesis solely on radio chatter and media reports.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big picture here is that people are dumb, first responders do their honest best but aren't perfect, and there is no real freedom of information. Big brother is alive and well and YOU aren't allowed to know jack shit. (And for 99.9999% of everything I am not allowed to know jack shit either.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I am on my cell phone, so please pardon the shitty typing. Another point I wanted to make was just because you notice various groups standing around "not doing anything" does NOT mean that A) theyre not doing anything or B) somebody else isn't out doing it. There is VERY strict rules for who's doing what based on their assignment. Just because you don't know the rules you look for patterns that are logical to you... but the reality is that unless you know what's going on, you can't tell from the outside in what's going on. (This is because in all honesty it is completely fucking illogical to anyone who doesn't do this.)  I suggest looking at the homeland security ICS (incident command system) courses that are free online if you want a basic structure to get familiar with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Incident commanders are top paid brass - old farts with lots of experience - because keeping track of all the moving pieces in this game is a nightmare. Even if you were ushered into the command vehicle and could see all the units on all the maps you'd still have to know the rules each unit plays by.. which is different for each unit. If you see people standing around it's because they: are waiting at that spot to be called into action, are waiting for the action to come to them, are there to prevent action if ABC occurs, are there to stop action from happening if XYZ occurs, etc. You cant have officers (especially SERT or SWAT or whatever cali calls em) running around if ANY detail is missing. Action is referred to as high intensity, low frequency. As opposed to waiting around for actionable intel which is known as high frequency low intensity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this helps. If you have general questions I can answer, but I was NOT there and I'm also going to bed because night shift, but I'll wake up in a few hours anyway.

       I honestly haven't paid as much attention to this latest mass shooting, but underlying assumptions that Sandy Hook and other events were staged is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's why I believe these events are susceptible to this sort conspiratorial observations:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Until the situation is assessed, police dispatchers, citizens and everyone else report lots of unrelated events just to be on the safe side. Basically, there are lots of well-intentioned reports that don't have anything to do with anything.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         These early reports are frequently contradictory, don't make sense, and are dropped for no known reason. Often, things can quickly be ruled out, or don't turn out to be anything and it may seem suspicious more isn't reported.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Media make mistakes as they try to make sense of things, and when they do, policy implications are often brought up as filler.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Gov't lockdown crime scenes to preserve evidence and control notification of next-of-kin. This can seem to have a sinister purpose.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Witnesses willing to go on camera are notoriously unreliable. They may just be looking for attention and make stuff up, or more often, know little and are confused themselves.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There are always reports of more suspects since everyone is on guard.

       Exactly. Just like in Sandy Hook, a parent of a student wearing camo was walking towards the school. Someone reported it, and it got blasted over the police radios and the media as a "shooter in camo firing from the woods". They even have video of someone getting arrested after one such report.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if a shooting would happen in a public area and there
       <em>
        weren't
       </em>
       any initial contradictory reports, confusion, or police keeping people quiet, that would be suspicious.

       Thank you to both of these comments.  This kind of contradictory misinformation in the initial reports is so often embraced as concrete evidence of a cover-up by onlookers, most people don't realize that it is just a natural part of the chaos, and is certainly accepted as such by law enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tiniest bit of misinformation can snowball.  For instance, in the case of James Holmes, I am frustrated at the fact that people still claim he referred to himself as the Joker.  This never happened.  A NYCPD ranking officer, hours after the shooting when he had no concrete idea of what the Aurora police were dealing with, claimed to the press that Holmes had referred to himself as the Joker.  This little tidbit of bullshit lit up the imaginations of the public, that this man indeed envisioned himself the mass murdering psychotic of the Batman mythos; it is more likely that the NYCPD officer had heard a joke or rumor from a cohort, inspired by Holmes' dyed hair.  I know that many are on the fence to this day about Holmes, whether or not he was "programmed" by the Gov't or one of its arms, or whether the man shown on trial was Holmes at all.  I recently attended a seminar given by an Aurora official (can't provide details, it's a work thing) detailing how they dealt with the shooting, the investigation, and the sentencing.  While I am personally still on the fence regarding the second gunman theory, or where Holmes got the $10,000 to buy all his equipment when he was on unemployment, there is no doubt in my mind that Holmes was everything they concluded him to be: an emotionally disturbed criminal genius, a guy who was able to adapt his skill with neuroscience into the planning and execution of a massive shooting that rocked the US, and the construction of a highly complex and deadly set of explosives that baffled bomb squads on the scene.  Some people might not like that answer, but it seems like the right one to me after seeing handwritten lists of weaponry, notes on bomb making, diary entries, text messages to friends, emails to family and teachers, and crime scene photos of the death trap that was Holmes' apartment.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, as you said, people do indeed get involved as witnesses in cases such as this simply for attention, just as people claim to have been abducted and probed by aliens, just as hundreds of people have come forward claiming to be responsible for killing sprees.  I am highly suspicious of witnesses, all the way to the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the claims of law enforcement regarding the Holmes case, because I have seen a convincing amount of evidence.  Evidence, not witness testimony, not the conflicting details in early reports, evidence of premeditation.  There may be a deeper story there, but as far as I am concerned I am personally closing the case.  After all the tumult dies down regarding San Bernardino, I'll begin to do my personal investigation into that, but again, will make my decisions based on available concrete evidence reviewed by experts, not witness testimony and speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: and yes I am aware of the theorized connection between Holmes and Lanza through their involvement as witnesses in the Libor trial, and that Holmes' father didn't testify.  An interesting connection indeed, but by and large a little too complex for me to speculate on without that 20/20 hindsight that is EVIDENCE.

       Another strange phenomenon is that there are
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       weird connections and happenstances when you look at any event closely enough. For instance, I'm in the camp that believes Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone, so I've read quite a bit on Kennedy's assassination. One of the hard things to slog through is all the strange coincidences--who was in town, who just left, who got Oswald the job at the book depository, who visited Jack Ruby, etc. There is a pretty well known "Umbrella Man" who, strangely, opened his umbrella just as Kennedy and his motorcade passed by. I always assumed it was sinister, why would someone have an umbrella on a sunny day in Dallas in November and just happen to open it right then??? Well, he was making some odd protest against Kennedy family appeasement of Hitler before WWII.We know this because someone tracked down the guy many years later. Weird, weird, weird...but if you look close enough there are always these oddities, and deciding which ones matter and which ones don't is hard work.

       This is an excellent point.  One of the hallmarks of the JFK assassination is that the cover story blaming Lee Harvey Oswald came together with supernatural speed --
       <em>
        and it never changed
       </em>
       .  The government narrative of a lone Communist nut as assassin was in place within
       <em>
        two days
       </em>
       of President Kennedy's assassination and it was ultimately served up -- unchanged -- as the Warren Commission Report.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the
       <em>
        lack
       </em>
       of divergence that gave away the phony narrative sold to the American public.

       The jumper was our orange shirt guy. He was located at the Wells Fargo near the Hernandez center, which was passed off as being on Brier.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mention of him "maybe jumping" is all that is really mentioned, because he supposedly walked to the top of the parking garage. In both locations, there are better suited buildings/bridges for jumping which makes this kind of inconceivable to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only other mention of females is a vehicle with two arabic women being followed near Redlands BLVD. Nothing more was mentioned about these two on my recording. It may have been mentioned after I tuned out and went to bed, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my initial notes, I am fairly certain that I confused the two arabic women and the woman who was pulled out of the vehicle with a weapon as being one in the same.

       Random thought I am going to chime in here: If this were a false flag, consider that even certain scanner frequencies can be faked. If you are getting links immediately to police scanners during these events, always remember there is a scanner you don't have access to.

       I listened to them while watching live local (LA) news.  They said they had run the suspect a week prior.  Also there was a couple who said they saw orange shirt guy 3 times with a rifle, and they hid behind a postal service truck in fear.  This was as the focus was shifting to the residence and they had live crews around the church.

       Spot on analysis!   I would be willing to bet that they use the same crew of thugs for all these false flags.  You could probably connect prints from all these events to two or three of the same dudes.  Too bad the police control all the "crime scenes" and all.

       Either the same people are present, or the same people are planning these events. As time goes on, you can pick up where they alter plans due to failures of past situations.

       If that blue shirt guy did manage to make it to the Hernandez center accidentally, it was the screw-up of this situation.

       Not entirely. A lot of times, the shooters/bombers do indeed die. Usually killed by police instead of captured alive. They manufacture these "mentally ill" people, unleash them, then kill them so they won't have a chance to tell their side of the story. And the media can paint them however they want. Notice how it's always a "lonely guy, very quiet and secluded, no friends, usually only a has mother, not much family. Usually a dropout, no real online accounts, etc". These people don't fit the mold of society because they never were in society to begin with.

       I was following this live while it happened. The scanners and Fox 10 Phoenix reported that the choppers had to leave because they were taking fire.

       Then a DHS plane (rumored to have a dirtbox equipped) began circling the area:

       I agree. They learned from Sandy Hook. They made sure to have an actual photo op of the "perp". Remember, there are no pics of Adam Lanza at that school. They are also going to limit the number of actors. It got out of hand with Sandy Hook, and I really think they expected to get away with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also might acutally have recorded some fake surveillance footage this time of a man and woman walking in. But we'll never see anything conclusive. They'll never release the dashcams from that shootout. I think this False Flag might be the one that actually hits mainstream and opens up peoples minds. If nothing else, this might expose Sandy Hook to more people--that to me, is the worst thing the country has ever done to its people. Pure treason and terrorism. How do they explain the Full Size SUZ with tinted windows? Still going with the rental car story?! It's just embarrassing.

       Sandy Hook was pretty bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I still have to say Waco/OKC was the worst they've done. Only because I don't think anyone was actually shot at Sandy Hook. We know, for a fact, that children were killed at Waco and OKC.

       This
       <em>

       reminds me of OKC. I
       <em>

       think that there were/are undercovers at the mosque these two attended.

       I met a little boy (and grandpa) at an Aquarium about 5 or 6 months after who was in a class next to one that was shot up in Sandy Hook.. (not sure how we (my family) found out he was involved, I think we were waiting in line for something and were talking about where we were from). It's not like we discussed it much (as to not traumatize them more), but there's no way the whole thing was completely staged.

       The kids described it as "someone banging on/slamming doors" and their reactions were more.. a bit weirded out and a little scared. But if you pull up the footage of the Columbine shooting, I tell ya.. those Sandy Hook students had balls of steel compared to those high schoolers at Columbine. There's also too much speculation, the laws that were passed that prevented autopsy reports and whatnot from being released. Then there is the pristine crime scene photos and the overall.. odd backstories of the victims and their families.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm the type who thinks the Govt knows situations like this will occur, or inserts undercovers to instigate these situations, does nothing to stop them, plans their response, capitalizes where they can and then uses it to write new law.  I think that when things like this occur.. the govt views us as collateral damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am actually giving the government the benefit of the doubt in saying that they didn't allow anyone to be killed that day. There are a lot who think the govt knew, or were involved in killing the kids.

       So that means you're in San Bernadino?

       Much respect for doing this. This is the kind of research we need. Fact based rather than speculation. Yesterday I did a scene by scene break down of the latest ISIS video noting the many irregularities. Felt good to do some proper analysis. Keep up the good work. Why are you doing this if I may ask? And where do you find the time? Were you listening in real time on the scanner or can you somehow record the calls/broadcasts and then review later. Very interested in what you're doing. Cheers from South Africa.

       Chicago PD scanner on a Friday night is always a good time.

       Edit: saw your addition. I was listening live during, had the scanner on my phone, recorder on my tablet, and live stream on my computer. I was updating my notes during. I didn't plan on this becoming a focus in my life, but listening to the scanner raised questions and I wanted to answer them for my own personal satisfaction. As I went through things though, I realized that there was a lot that people just needed to know about this situation. And the time was really..a lot of long nights.

       I'm from the San Bernardino area, my sister is an emergency dispatcher. I think you reading a lot into the scanner traffic. The reports I heard on the scanner sounded pretty typical for San Bernardino. They were just following every suspicious report. You also have to remember that there are several methods for law enforcement to communicate, so the picture you get is muddled.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will say my sister believes there was a third shooter, and law enforcement is being quiet about that possibility. Also, the calls my sister's work got from the scene said the shooters looked middle eastern.

       Here's the video:
       <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=4da_1449237693">
        http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=4da_1449237693
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       With regards to credentials, I don't have any other than that I work in the medical industry and perform blood tests on a regular basis, so I'm familiar with blood. If you look at the earlier ISIS videos, you'll notice that a lot of the blood looks quite light in colour, almost like tomato sauce or ketchup. Where as all blood I've seen in real life (and in other videos of what are considered to be real executions) is much darker in colour. If you watch that Mexican chainsaw beheading video you'll see what I'm talking about. Compare that to ISIS supposed beheadings. I don't actually recommend you watch that video though, it's probably the single most disgusting thing I've ever seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is my analysis of the ISIS video:
      </p>
      <p>
       04:57 - 1st execution. No blood spray visible from first angle as guy is shot in the head. The guy falls, the kid shoots again - still no blood, just gushes of air. Only in the next angle do you see the head wound and blood. Looks quite real.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, how is it possible to get shot in the head without immediately sustaining a visible bullet wound and without causing a blood spray? It doesn't make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       07:25 - 2nd execution. No blood spray as man gets shot point blank in the head.
      </p>
      <p>
       09:20 - 3rd execution. No blood spray and no visible bullet wound in first angle as man gets shot in the head twice at point blank range.
      </p>
      <p>
       10:45 - 4th execution. No blood spray as man gets shot in the face at point blank range.
      </p>
      <p>
       12:23 - 5th execution. No blood visible as man gets shot in the face in the dark, but with light being shone on his face.
      </p>
      <p>
       14:07 - 6th execution. Lots of blood visible as kid cuts at man's throat. Approximately 5 seconds of the cutting is shown, buy in slow motion. So probably around 2 - 3 seconds of real time cutting is shown, while the video flashes and then abruptly cuts before any significant throat wound can be observed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall I'd rate this one a 7/10 - looks quite real at times, but the total lack of any blood or bullet wounds with the first shot of each execution, in my opinion, exposes this an elaborate fake. Watch for yourself and let me know what you think.
      </p>

       I knew the second I watched dozens of LEOs casually walking around the crime scene that it was a FF. There was no sense of urgency to find these escaped terrorists. It was unbelievable. They would have reviewed every possible piece of footage, had a license plate, and had the whole city on lockdown.

       What I don't get is .. if there was some kind of need for a False Flag .. why not just set off a bomb somewhere and kill a dozen people?  It seems like it would be sooo much easier to "control" a situation like that, and if you drop some passports or "find some irrefutable evidence" it seems like the effect would still be there - panic, revenge, etc etc.

       The apparent growing sophistication demonstrated by this post is one of the more chilling things. As far as the "Why?" I have no idea, and you make a good point. It's all about the narrative, and how they can use the events to further their agenda, whatever it may be.

       Yea almost  as weird as two eye witnesses describing 3 tall white athletic men in black army fatigues. The FBI allowing media to break into the home of the alleged suspect with nothing more than a screw driver. The FBI being so incompetent as to leave the passports and drivers licenses laid out on the couples bed along with an inventory list of all of the munitions that were allegedly found their. The 125lb wife carrying her body weight in gear simultaneously  posting to Facebook exactly 1 minute after the shooting began declaring her allegiance to isis. The fact that there is no cctv or security camera footage of the alleged shooters at the scene of the shooting. The fact that there was a swarm of cop cars chasing the guy before the shoot out yet not a single dash cam video of the shoot out has been released. Yet the only eye witness cell phone video of the shootout has the guy filming saying the police just started shooting.

       So this is what I mean right here.  Like .. couldn't they find 3 dark-skinned hispanic guys that would look "terrorist-y enough" to any witnesses?  Or .. if there were three active shooters .. why not have 3 patsies so that there isn't an obvious mismatch, right?  Because all it would take is some overlooked witness from a window somewhere with an iPhone to discredit the whole thing and raise uncomfortable questions.  Why the chase at all?  Why not a "suicide attack"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not plant "smoking gun" evidence of a terrorist connection .. instead of this "How did they become radicalized" crap?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying there is no cover up.  But .. that kind of stuff just really seems weird .. considering the "puppet masters" should be

       were the puppet masters, there are about 10 different ways we could think of that would be easier to contain and generate fewer "loose ends".
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean .. really.  Why not 2 "real shooters" who actually look like terrorists?  Why 3 white guys?  Or .. if you are using 3 "real shooters" why not set up 3 patsies?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the people at the center who were actually shot at and survived?  The witnesses to the shooting?  They would have seen the 3 white shooters and now have to be silenced somehow, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why have a plan that involves a long chase .. by this couple who ostensibly didn't actually shoot anybody .. right?  Is there a chance of them
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       dying, or being captured alive, and talking?  Any chance of something going wrong there?  So many variables, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is the
       <em>
        entire
       </em>
       police force there in on this?  Ok .. well now what about one of
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       talking?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many other scenarios that would have been "more tidy".
      </p>
      <p>
       For example .. get 3 guys with pistols on a intercity bus on an overnight .. pull the driver over .. kill everybody there .. drive away on the dark highway ... how long before people even realize that there has been a shooting?  Release a "terrorist video" and hold the head of one of the victims as proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       See?  MUCH safer / foolproof.
       <em>
        And I don't even do this for a living!
       </em>
       That's what I mean.  The whole thing is just weird.

       OK guys.  I'm kinda new here.  Open minded and just curious. I'm sure ill be hung for this... But why would someone or a government go through so much effort to cover something up or create such a big lie? I just dont understand, i guess, what they would benefit from creating such outlandish and exposable lies and alienating an entire planet in the process. All while trying to tie it back to middle eastern terrorists.  Is it oil? Is it something else? How could so many be in on it  without knowing or without spilling the beans more easily? If someone has the time or would even care to answer, i appreciate it. If not, that's ok too. And if you guys are right about all this and past events. ...holy shit.

       Muslims are mass murdering people and you guys blame our government.

      <p>
       Maybe Muslims have a lot of bad apples,  like cops.  Couldn't that just be the case?  Is the main stream media staging murder by cops so we will fear them?  Didn't think so.   Grow up guys,  the government isn't faking all of this.  If they did, they have invested a ton of money with zero return.  No strict gun laws have been  passed.  Muslims make themselves look bad... The government isn't behind every bad thing that happens.  I don't mind diving in and researching,  but surely you know this isn't staged to makes us hate Muslims.   You have fallen over the left edge

       This is all just blowback for us making a warzone out of the middle east for the last 15 years. Do you really think they want us there? They dont. They want us the fuck out and gone and until we leave, they are going to fight back. This is Veitnam 2.0. We dont even know why the fuck we are there anymore. It certainly isnt to liberate and bring freedom to these people, else we would be fighting human right abuses in Africa, China and North Korea. But they dont have Oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans need to get over themselves. We are not fighting terrorists, we are creating them. What would you do if Putin decided that Obama (assad/hussein) was a dictator given that half our country complain that he is one. Now what if Putin armed the South and placed troops on the ground to help "liberate america" from the oligrhacy with aims to restore democracy? This is exactly what we are doing to them. They DONT WANT OUR HELP. They want us gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let them kill themselves over there. We let the african kill africans and the chinese kill chinese. Whats so different about islam? Let that continent deal with that continents problems.

       Agreed.  We are only there to make sure oil keeps flowing and being sold in dollars.   I wish we weren't there and I am no ignorant to their plight..

       They need to do the fighting on their country to kick us out. When they use suicide bombers in other countries as their attack plan,  I don't care much about taking their land and oil.   We kill innocent people with drone strikes,  but Islamists target innocent people.  They are stone age fanatics.

       Wars and the defense contracts that go with them are worth trillions. So, a false flag action that inflames public opinion and turns around the votes of politicians who need to approve those wars can be extremely valuable. An ongoing climate of fear is necessary to continue to boost military spending at the expense of domestic programs that advance public welfare.

       What I find most odd is that the news had a whitness on the phone who said she saw 3 shooters, all appearing to be white, all male, tall and athletic built with black hats and black gloves.
      </p>
      <p>
       She (the whitness) didn't mention a woman at all.

       But the other night, I saw the interview with one of the families in which the Mother was killed, they interviewed her Daughter and her Husband.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were fucking emotionless, pure bullshit, I can't find the interview, maybe you have it.

       The reaction from the gentleman behind the girl at the 50 second mark after she says "
       <em>
        I Don't want you guys like grieving or like crying that's like when I'm taking in some place
       </em>
       " speaks to me. The lips cringe followed by the heavy swallow. As if she went off script and was tanking the interview.

       So either;
      </p>
      <p>
       A. This girl and her family are emotion-less beings, or beings that weren't conditioned like normal people (very unlikely).
      </p>
      <p>
       B. Paid actors. Hired/forced/paid/etc. to do this interview. (highly unlikely - risky).
      </p>
      <p>
       C. Mom is not dead, in witness protection of some sort; interview was done as a protocol witness protection operation. Girl just sucks at acting (more likely imo).

       Yeah except this is a reoccurring trend in all these types of attacks. Remember the father of Lanza laughing and then quickly switching to crying as soon as the "cameras" turned on? It's a consistent trend.

       I saw that one, too. The daughter didn't look, or speak, like someone whose mother had been murdered a few hours earlier. Maybe they took a handful of anti-depressants to cope?

       On second viewing, they're not emotionless zombies on drugs; on the contrary they seem quite alert and animated. It certainly doesn't look like a suddenly grieving family to me.

       I did hear a clip of someone who made the claim that we should have had NSA programs running to catch this. (Fox News??)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, none of the NSA programs have been cancelled. The onky thing that changed is data storage - the phone companies have to store every character tyoed, every sound uttered through you cell phone for 7 years for NSA. The NSA programs to siphon off a direct copy of all communication to their datastores is still in place. Furthermore, given that these guys were not terror suspects to begin with (probably FBI assets in truth), they were never on a "watchlist", so NSA programs would have been meaningless.

       This would be a sweeping injustice to the American people. It's been tried before and was blocked. There's really no due process, you don't have to be notified, and removing your name is.. almost impossible. You don't even have to have your name on it, if you have the same name as someone on it, you're doomed. And this was a focus of Obama's address, tonight.

       The street is blocked off at that point but there is a press area about 500 yards closer. Also you can park anywhere near where they were and walk up to the police line which is within probably 100yds of the building.

       OP is stating what he heard from first responders and scanners. It is true that something else is at play here but most of the first responders calls and scanners are not facts and they are passed around not based on facts but based on what info they receive from an ongoing event which is very fluid and ever-changing and most of those scanners and calls cannot be inputted for final reports due to their lack of reliability and even government knows this.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP did a great job putting back the pieces of the puzzle but it is not a complete and reliable picture even though he quoted those things from the "official" sources. But I'm not denying 100% of it but I'm not taking it as 100% truth either.

       Nope. Apparently every terrorist attack ever was perpetuated by the US Government or Santa Claus or something. I think that we're definitely left in the dark on a lot of shit, but for Christ sake, sometimes wackos just fucking kill people outside of ridiculous conspiracies.

       Yea people do go off and kill people.   However if you compare the news coverage of this event to the news coverage of other mass shootings that aren't  used to push legislation or stronger military Involvement  there is striking differences. There was a police training exercises nearby you have hundreds of LEO standing around doing nothing. If you're not a shill, actually take the time to listen to the police scanner from that day. If you listen to the police scanner it's downright impossible the events unfolded the way the media is portraying the

       Sorry I forgot the /s tag. There are tons of shootings that have gone on that seem pretty legit and organic, except those stories are always a minor blip on the news. Hardly covered. Events like this are always covered for weeks and new legislation is passed in their wake. Like flies drawn to shit, watch which events cause the attraction of mainstream news and government reactions.

       I can't imagine this was a "false flag". It doesn't fit their narrative - if gun control is their end game, they wouldn't pin it on Muslim terrorists.

       This is so much better than what the news or governments present to the public. Lets see...no government accountability for letting this event happen just like 9/11! Business as usual. We will just take more of your liberties away.

       Great work. Wait until you see the fake muslim kids some Hollyweird handler brought into the corporate media news "camps" to interview to add authenticity to this thing. The indian/muslim/paki guys don't even know where they are from... some of them look Indian... some say they are form the USA but the accent is soo thick this is obviously a lie. They are not even from the regions discussed about the shooter, and they are wearing head to toe ethnic token Muslin indigenous garments which looks absurd and hilarious. They were actually bringing these guys in an out of the TV camps to interview them in from of the "scene of the crime" days after it occurred. Totally preposterous.

       So... I was watching the reddit live thread and the US live channels through the internet when it was happening. It was
       <del>
        evident
       </del>
       obvious even to me, at the other side of the world, that there were three shooters and they were looking for three "suspects". What's the official statement on that change of the number of shooters and suspects suddenly like that?

       Good question.  I was listening to the radio feed live.  They were looking for a man in an orange shirt and camo pants.  One officer radioed in and said he had a Hispanic male with camo pants and orange shirt.  The guy was cooperative.
      </p>
      <p>
       After an hour of listening, the same officer asked if he should take the man to the station or hold.  (just stay tjere)
      </p>
      <p>
       I turned it off and went about my night,  but I am very interested in the 3rd shooter... Why isn't anyone talking about it? Did I miss something?

       Only the Target in San Bernardino, the one right off of the 215, is next to an animal control center. The other locations you mapped are actually ads for Target selling animal control products, that's why they are in yellow and not red like the San Bernardino animal shelter.

       ok, so please forgive my ignorance, and i am asking sincerely here because i want to know, i'm not trying to be facetious.   are we saying here, that our government, or some type of authority figure, is staging these mass shootings across the country?  and if so, to what end?  to make us scared?  to unite us against a perceived common enemy?  to just randomly kill people?  to create and reinforce a police state?
      </p>
      <p>
       and if so, what can we do about it?  because this shit has  got to stop.  i feel like i'm living in some kind of pseudo reality, where shit like this is becoming the norm.  and i do believe that sandy hook, and the boston bombings and other recent events were staged, but i'm not really sure i understand why.  i cannot wrap my head around it.

       The cia/fbi/abc agencies have been carrying out attacks against the general populous since WWII. They do so with the intent of influencing and shaping public opinion. The first reported and de-classified occurence of this was during operation Gladio. During operation gladio cia members working with extremist inside of itally carried out terrorist attacks against itally in order to scare the Italians of the spread of communism.

       Again is this really what you choose to do with your free time? Or do you honestly believe two radicalized Muslim extremist shot and killed 14 people. When the first two eye witnesses interviewed describe 3 white tall athletic men. Do you really think the fbi wouldn't secure the house of an alleged terrorist who just conducted a mass shooting and allow journalist to break in with litterally a screw driver. Do you really believe the FBI is so incompetent that they left the passports and drivers licenses along with an inventory list of all the munitions and explosives the couple had at their house laying out on the bed?  What is your reasoning for the cctv and security camera footage not being released? Do you think the image of the two alleged shooters walking into the place is too much for the public to handle?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly if you believe all conspiracies are fantasy and therefore un able to be discredited why have you spent so much of your last 4 years on this website attempting to do just that

       Maybe they have safehouses everywhere and a special tactical team to fill it with paraphernalia fitting what happened. It would only take about a dozen persons to stuff things into a flat for a day, the purpose being hiding/securing the real place where all happened. Nobody would notice. Especially not dumb cameras and media types.
      </p>
      <p>
       The group could be a special evidence handling group, e.g. or plain CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously this only works in big, anonymous cities.

       The kids described it as "someone banging on/slamming doors" and their reactions were more.. a bit weirded out and a little scared. But if you pull up the footage of the Columbine shooting, I tell ya.. those Sandy Hook students had balls of steel compared to those high schoolers at Columbine. There's also too much speculation, the laws that were passed that prevented autopsy reports and whatnot from being released. Then there is the pristine crime scene photos and the overall.. odd backstories of the victims and their families.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm the type who thinks the Govt knows situations like this will occur, or inserts undercovers to instigate these situations, does nothing to stop them, plans their response, capitalizes where they can and then uses it to write new law.  I think that when things like this occur.. the govt views us as collateral damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am actually giving the government the benefit of the doubt in saying that they didn't allow anyone to be killed that day. There are a lot who think the govt knew, or were involved in killing the kids.

       I had a buddy of mines mom die suddenly last month and he was out with the boys the very next night drinking, laughing, having a good time. We didn't even know his mom had died until he told us he was going to her funeral. Really weirded us out.

       The apparent growing sophistication demonstrated by this post is one of the more chilling things. As far as the "Why?" I have no idea, and you make a good point. It's all about the narrative, and how they can use the events to further their agenda, whatever it may be.

       They are definitely getting better at the choreography of it all.

       Good question.  I was listening to the radio feed live.  They were looking for a man in an orange shirt and camo pants.  One officer radioed in and said he had a Hispanic male with camo pants and orange shirt.  The guy was cooperative.
      </p>
      <p>
       After an hour of listening, the same officer asked if he should take the man to the station or hold.  (just stay tjere)

       I turned it off and went about my night,  but I am very interested in the 3rd shooter... Why isn't anyone talking about it? Did I miss something?
