       I honestly hadn't given it a second thought until I watched Obama's address and saw him obviously lying throughout, so I came to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and am seeing things here and there about a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still burnt out from the Aurora shooting/Sandy Hook/Boston Marathon days, so I'm really not wanting to drive myself crazy over something again... but if there's support and evidence, I'd like to see it.

       Yeah, I just read through this. Almost need an ELI5 for it, though...
      </p>

       I was hoping for a user-contributed big thread with lots of links to contradictory eyewitness testimonies and local news coverage that undermines the official narrative. That was super well put together, though.

        Witness 1
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Scott Pelley: One of the witnesses today is _____, who works at the Inland Regional Center, the building where the attack took place. She saw the attackers enter the building and we spoke to her by phone.
       </p>
       <p>
        Witness: I heard umm shots fired and it was you know from an automatic weapon so you know it was very unusual... why, you know why would we hear shots? As we look out the window a second set of shots goes off, and its just pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop and we saw a man fall to the floor. Then we just looked and
        <strong>
         we saw three men dressed in all black military attire with vests on they were holding assault rifles
        </strong>
        and they (breathes) as soon as they opened the door to building three and one of them opened up the door to building three he started to spray shoot, you know shoot all over into the room, that's the room that we typically have conferences in, and we just heard more gun shots go off.
I got my phone. I reached for my phone. I called 911 and I just hid under my desk. I didn't see anymore, I just heard more gunshots go off as I was talking to the dispatch. We went into my manager's office, locked the door, barricaded it. We heard running and things happening upstairs. About 30 minutes later someone came to the door, knocked on the door. But we didn't obviously answer. Then another 60 minutes later someone came and took us into a secure room.
       </p>
       <p>
        Scott Pelley: Ms. ____ can you describe to me in as much detail as you can, what did the gunmen look like?
       </p>
       <p>
        Witness: I couldn't see his face, he had a black hat on and from my view all I could see was a black hat and black long sleeve shirt, possibly gloves on. Ummm... he had black cargo pants on the kind with the zippers on the side and the big puffy pockets. He had a huge assault rifle and he had extra ammo. He was coming ready for, he was coming ready for something. To reload I don't know. He had [inaudible] magazines. Umm... I couldn't see what else, I just saw three dressed exactly the same.
       </p>
       <p>
        Scott Pelley:
        <strong>
         You're certain that you saw three men?
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Witness:
        <strong>
         Yes, it looked like their skin color was yeah, was white. They looked like they were athletic build and umm... they appeared to be tall.
        </strong>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Witness:
        <strong>
         Where I was at right here we seen there were three white men in military fatigues, um taking off.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Q: What were they driving?
       </p>
       <p>
        Witness: What was it like a... like a black impala... SUV...SUV... or yeah...
       </p>
       <p>
        Q:
        <strong>
         Do you think that they might have been the shooters?
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Witness:
        <strong>
         Yeah, the way they were driving...yeah
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Q: And how many shots did you hear?"
       </p>
       <p>
        Witness: Oh, a lot, it was a lot, it sounded like I said it sounded like a gun range just shots going off. It was crazy. It was a lot. A lot of shots.
