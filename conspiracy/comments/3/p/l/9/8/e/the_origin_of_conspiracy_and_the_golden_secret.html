       To keep all this secret was the original conspiracy and everything that has come after is just more lies to cover the dirty truth.  Right now as you read this the world has already switched to gold and silver as money but you didn't get the MEMO... The reason you didn't get the memo is because your destiny is to die and your skeleton will be used to create "more gold".   Right now people have a store where they are spending gold and silver just like you spend money at wal-mart or the grocery store but the items and foods they receive are vastly different than anything you are allowed to know about because of your destiny there is no reason for you know about it.   The biggest scam and conspiracy of all time is the reclamation of NORTH AMERICA.  Indeed the entire north american continent is an vast and endless gold mining system that is started over every 88 years and under antartica is a 2nd north america being reclaimed.
      </p>
      <p>
       For 88 years the world lives "in the past" in an attempt to recreate conditions that are favorable to a complete reclamation they are using the eruption cycle of yellowstone volcano to create massive amounts of gold. They create so much gold it takes another 88 years to mine up... and this entire operation is done in secret over and over by slightly changing climates they force people to move right to the eruption location right before the volcano explodes people are sheeped to the northwest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every 88 years the world moves north america to the north pole and the previous north america becomes visible and mineable again.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you have is a system of gold creation and gold mining done side by side in perfect unison to keep a steady supply of gold created to mine.  The largest operations are done in antartica (2nd north america) where the gold is freshly created and the operation is a complete secret. At this same moment the gold is being harvested in 1 place bones are being grown by "paper" people who don't have any idea what is going on... their entire life is spend chasing fake dreams and lies and paper while another group of people live right beside them are actors pretending to use paper money while secretly buying gold for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you drive past a freemason lodge and you see that mysterious pentagram with the letter G in the middle you are about as close to GOD as you will ever get as the entire system is a series of lies on top of lies to hide the ultimate truth.. these freemasons are already using gold as money but you just don't know about it and they hide everything they buy from the gold store.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they sell in that store is probably everything you knew existed but never could figure out why nobody made it.   Flying house/cars..longer life spans... computers that are thousands of years further along in technology and probably your own dome world but this is just speculation because you can only imagine the future based on the terrible lies that have been presented.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't just gold either.. every time they begin a new process that involved the eruption of yellowstone volcano they end up with billions and billions of gallons of byproduct... they call this crude oil but they have this funny story about how it was made from big dinosaurs not people from the past who died to become gold in north america.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now it is the year 1932 in antartica and they have already started rebuilding the united states of america.  As soon as yellowstone volcano erupts they freeze the entire area and open the new USA at the new location and it starts with the building of the hoover dam and of course NASA. Nasa is an entertainment company that specialized in creating fake realities for people to live in... every single thing nasa has ever said or did is complete fabrication because there is no 'Space" to visit.  There is only another ocean above a massive dome that was built to hide the truth about gold and human life.   The human who believe in this NASA lie are the victims of what the sumerians warned about..the winged planet LIE.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyways
The united states of america ends with the crashing of the hoover dam and the flooding of the yellowstone after the rivers reverse direction when yellowstone begins to erupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       A true alpha and omega event.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the people are told from ELEMENTARY school... North america belonged to the indians and then your ancestors killed them and stole it for themselves and build the most powerful nation ever "lol".
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways the people are continuously told they are free to leave but they never leave because they are entertained too much and love the money world even though it comes to an end over and over.
      </p>
      <p>
       But right now to this very day you can take any bar of gold and turn it UPSIDE DOWN and see clearly  the numbers   666 and that is just a sign for you to understand how childish religous beliefs can make people's mind... it is also on silver bullion coins and bars.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you knew that the price of gold was going to be 1billion dollars per OZ once the store is temporarily opened to the public you would see the chance i've presented here for you to think about... all the money ever made in the USA has been pennies... even the biggest billionaires are just kids with pennies compared to how high the price of gold will go and billionaires who don't know the secret ahead of time will spend their billions just to get a few OZ of gold to spend in the store.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason the price of gold will be so high is because once the store opens to the public all the gold will be gone in hours the richest people will have it all... because they don't want you or anyone from your family in that store and nobody will buy cars and ground based houses anymore they will become worthless and the people who bought them will become gold for the next harvest.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire world is just a gold sequencing event that starts over every 88 years all history is fabricated lies by freemasons to try to make violent crazy warlike people who want to believe in bullshit and it works great.

       Where can one buy "fresh" gold? I'm talking 88 years and one day. I don't want any "old" gold that's been sitting around for too long. And I don't want pieces of bone showing up in it either.

       What does the federal reserve have to do with a winged planet or construction of pyramids?    look closer at the 1 dollar bill and explain to yourself why a winged planet is on the outer rim of the black sun on the left of george washington...  the letter A for boston has the largest winged planet display and the others get small towards L and some are broken logos.   I didn't make the federal reserve

       Well history told you indians were in north america first but it didn't tell you they had advanced technologies and build a gold production facility.  So you do the math.   The only gold left behind for the white men to mine was less than a small olympic sized swimming pool and its taken them 30 years or more to get that much done.    The indian machines are much larger and work on a much larger scale so they probably take tons and tons of gold from under the ice before it starts over again.

       If you go the hoover DAM and look at the huge golden mural that goes above the elevator in the middle of the dam you can see the story of genesis &amp; revelations in pictures... it shows the lord as an indian man who fights the horned white man and ends with the indian putting the woman and child into an oven reached by a ladder.

       I don't think the white man ever conquered anything but a lot of staged events leads to a lot of lying and bad thinking.   The entire idea of stealing land from people and then declaring yourself "God's people"  I.E " In god we trust" was a great idea and you betcha i believe it will end in deep regrets for all those involved.

       The stage is huge and so many people are actors.. even actors are actors pretending to be actors which is pretty confusing but with the right eye and the right timing you can see directly.

       The only real problem with this is the fact that if they did have the capacity to develop such technology then someone would have created a fusion reactor capable of creating gold from other elements thus rendering the entire process of killing us and turning us into gold pointless.

       fusion reactor capable of creating gold from other elements... ahh yes called "yellowstone volcano".  a 4 state wide gold creation furnace requires a lot of bones to operate at full production
      </p>
      <p>
       the problem is that the amount of gold is 100s of times larger than you expect

       I forget to add this in the original part but it was somewhat important to the way the world is designed.   All the prison populations of the entire world will be set free in north america when the economy collapses something for you to look forward to.   Have a great day    It will be one big fuck fest up there in yellowstone when everyone gets there

       The entire worlds prison population and poor will be offered amnesty within the USA after the economy collapses... just like when all the sick homeless people came in from cuba or wherever but just a lot fucking worse.  It will be the worlds reaction to the situation created by the end of money and the lack of gold and silver to use for money people will be forced to starve to death because not enough farmers to grow food.

       But you know so much about it. But can't read a link. I'm done with your "look over here" nonsense arguments that you can't cite or source.

Some peoples minds are so programmed into a certain way of thinking and when other people hurt their feelings by blowing their way of thinking out of the water they get sad and play with microwave burritos.

       I'm done. You think people are hacking your vehicles since 2007? Since you were 10? Come on. Link something credible or come up with something other than "we need to put on tinfoil hats" and I will discuss. At this point you are living up to your reputation. - karma and nonsense posts.

       4 months and you can't be in the +1 category?

       Go do whatever you want to do with a burrito and keep trying to degrade people by calling them fat when you know nothing about them. (Great sign of a troll - random jabs at someone they know nothing about trying to play into an insecurity... LOL. little does he know....)
