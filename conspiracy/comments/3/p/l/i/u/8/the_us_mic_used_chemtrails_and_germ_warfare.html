<blockquote>
<p>During the second half of the 1970&#39;s, revelations of American military and CIA germ warfare experiments emerged in the public press. Surprisingly, many of those experiments were conducted in U.S. cities and were directed against U.S. citizens. In the 1950&#39;s, for example, a &quot;germ fog&quot; had been sprayed by a Navy ship at San Francisco. According to the Los Angeles Times:</p>

<p><em>In an experiment designed to determine both attack and defense capabilities of biological weapons, a Navy - ship blanketed San Francisco and its neighboring communities with a bacteria-laden fog for six days in 1950, according to U.S. military records. The records contain the conclusion that nearly every one of San Francisco&#39;s 800,000 residents was exposed to the cloud released by a Navy ship steaming up and down just outside the Golden Gate. The aerosol substance released by the ship contained a bacteria known as serratia, which was believed harmless by the military at the time but which has been found since to cause a type of pneumonia that can be fatal.</em></p>

<p>The LA. Times added that at least twelve people were hospitalized around that time for serratia pneumonia. One of them died. That was just the beginning. The army disclosed that it had conducted 239 open-air tests between 1949 and 1969! Of those, 80 were admitted to have contained actual germs. The tests were directed against Washington, D.C., New York City, Key West, Panama City (Florida), and San Francisco. If we accept the army&#39;s figure of 80 livedisease experiments, we discover an average of four &quot;germ attacks&quot; against U.S. cities every year for twenty years! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think people knew about these experiments in the era they are being done? No, experiments like this are classified for years before they are declassified and released to the public (if they ever are). Maybe in 50-70 years someone else will write a book about the experiments that were going on in the 80&#39;s/90&#39;s/2000&#39;s and on. Rinse and repeat. Your logic and understanding is very flawed, regarding this topic.</p>

<p>Also, Patrick Roddie recently <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2015/08/geoengineering-activist-patrick-roddie-testifies-before-the-epa.html">testified before the EPA</a> and told them to <a href="https://youtu.be/n4OHLx6bX8k">&quot;do your job&quot;</a> in regards to halting geoengineering experiments. <a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?327586-1/epa-hearing-commercial-aircraft-emissions">Here is the entire hearing</a>.</p>

<p>As far as <a href="https://youtu.be/4Ew05sRDAcU?t=17m15s">climate change goes</a> (the whole video is worthwhile, but I linked the most pertinent part), it is apparent that what we as human beings <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radiation_management#Cloud_seeding">are doing</a> on this planet is affecting the way the earth behaves. Perhaps they are geoengineering for some sort of good, but it is seemingly affecting peoples&#39; health and is very concerning to others, including myself as I have chronic health problems that have only gotten worse as the years go on (I&#39;m only 26). More than anything, it is my belief that this issue is the number one most dire situation that needs to be dealt with concerning government corruption as it is affecting <em>every single one of us</em> due to it being the <em>air we breathe every day.</em></p>

<p>I can&#39;t take credit for it.  I was just quoting from the source I referenced.</p>

<p>Perhaps St. Louis wasn&#39;t the only location where it happened, however (unfortunately).</p>

<p>The results have <em>already</em> happened...and continue happening (again, unfortunately)...</p>

<p>It&#39;s not old news when many think it never happened.  It&#39;s not old news when people <em>today</em> say that &quot;chemtrails don&#39;t exist&quot;.</p>

<p>Wow.. you&#39;re just a contradiction wrapped in an enigma, aren&#39;t you?</p>
