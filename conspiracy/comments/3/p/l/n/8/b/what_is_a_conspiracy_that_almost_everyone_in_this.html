Egyptology is a hilarious, bureaucratic mess run by the same people for too long, suppressing knowledge to fit their theory.  There&#39;s much more to it than our mere uncertainty.  If you do some research, you&#39;ll find that much more is out of place than you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think nobody argues that natural selection isn&#39;t the main drive - just that there can be others on the side, in this case i think what they are referring to is the alien genetic engineerism conspiracy. Basically more evoluted beings came here, did some experiments with us, then left ( or not ) again. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t found evidence or enough strong indications as this knowledge can be real aswell as to be a strumental hoax like many others.</p>

<p>Altough it would connect the dots nicely with my main &quot;conspiracy&quot; belief ( Existence of advanced civilizations way before us and total cover up )</p>

<p>Or, maybe he was just referencing the same i think ( Total other human history than we hear at school )</p>

<p>I actually know a bit about the Anunaku  (spelling?) And how that theory relates to the origin, but thought it was very far from being accepted by the majority of this sub.</p>

<p>I&#39;m confused about the part we were taught in schools. Was there no Ben Franklin? No Aristotle? At what point, and in what context, does our history vary from what we were taught?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vedas ( indian sacred texts ) describe how to build helicopters and ufo-like flying machines ( 5000 years ago )</p>

<p>Pyramids are 12k+ years old.</p>

<p>The oldest pyramids if i remember well are 30k+ years ago and pretty unknown</p>

<p>There has been some remarks about a sunken city that resembles the descriptions of Atlantis IIRC.</p>

<p>I&#39;m quoting just basic facts because i&#39;m not that well versed in this sector after all, i don&#39;t have a framework where to put things together yet.</p>

<p>All that is obvious is that the extreme resistence by mainstream &quot;science&quot; to even acknowledge the presence of these remains has to mean something.</p>

<p>What would be the problem if there were older pyramids ? so much the better, more tourism. What if an ancient advanced city fallen into the sea ? that&#39;s an awesome thing to know, and it doesn&#39;t ruin any legit business i can think of.</p>

<p>Yet all of this is censored and shrouded in a veil of tabù and foolishness. People who still lash out news are ridiculized and often shut down one way or the other if they succeed to gather any credibility despite the academic mobbing.</p>

<p>All of this makes me think there is something really important that happened some thousand years ago that we mustn&#39;t know ( and i wouldn&#39;t discard 100% the alien thing, altough it&#39;s unnecessary imo ), something that would change our perception of history and ourselves deeply.</p>

<p>Or on the other hand, to play some Occam, it may be that some greedy strumental dicks find nothing profitable in these things and fear losing some credibility if they are proven wrong.
Or maybe it&#39;s just the credibility thing and they fear that if we are to acknowledge the mistaken history we would feel entitled to investigate on much hotter nowadays topics.</p>

<p>I still feel something is really scary wrong with that so my feelz go for option #1, but maybe i&#39;m overthinking and option #2 and #3 are valid. In the end, i can&#39;t really know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually wasn&#39;t referencing the Annunaki at all.  I respectfully decline to believe in extra-terrestrial involvement in our past because I personally don&#39;t find the evidence to be cohesive enough to support the theory.</p>

<p>Of course these historical figures existed.  A majority of what we&#39;ve been taught are real things that occurred.  It&#39;s not about what happened, but how the stories are told.</p>

<p>Moving beyond that point, I&#39;d also like to say that I was simply stating that much of what we&#39;ve been taught in school is through a biased lens and a great deal of focus is not put on questioning the current story.  .I was pointing out that I believed that many people on this subreddit would recognize that to be true.</p>

<p>There is also a great deal of evidence that there were advanced human civilizations much earlier than we thought, but I&#39;m not sure that a majority of people would include this in the &quot;accepted&quot; category.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I meant absolutely nothing about evolution or the origin of our species as humanity.  I was referring to the specific timeline of events that we were taught that happened in historical time, not the way that our species broke off from primates and became human.</p>

<p>To name a few examples that show evidence toward a timeline of history different than what we&#39;ve been taught: the Piri Reis and Oronteus Finnaeus maps, the water erosion on the Sphinx, and the entirety of Tihuanaco&#39;s construction.  In other words, if what we believe about our species&#39; history is correct, many artifacts are out of place.</p>

<p>I guess I assumed that most adults realized that our distant past is a huge, mushy, unknowable mess, and not composed of the certain, linear timelines told to us by teachers reading textbooks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the story he tells in that book is evidence of is that UFOs exist, which should be obvious to most of us by now.  It says nothing about them being ET technology or about any ET&#39;s actually existing, and in fact Cooper himself later in life came to believe that all of the &quot;aliens&quot; info he was told was most likely disinfo to throw him off the trail.  He came to suspect that most if not all UFOs were actually just top secret, exotic human technology.</p>

<p>Also check out a documentary called <em>Mirage Men</em> in which it&#39;s clearly shown that disinfo agents spread &quot;alien conspiracies&quot; as cover for black military research/testing.</p>

<p>To me the only question is whether all UFOs are human tech or if only some are.</p>
