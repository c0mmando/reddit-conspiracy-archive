    <div class="md"><p>How exactly do you suggest we separate from their &quot;economic tyranny&quot;? I&#39;m very curious. I spoke to my economic professor yesterday on his opinion on the TPP and he said that free trade is good, that having restrictions on trades only harm domestic and international economies. </p>

<p>Trade deals work by allowing countries who have a comparative advantage in things to specialize, while areas of work will more than likely be shifted and some americans will loose jobs if we import more, it will also allow us to export more and expand other fields of business that america has a comparative advantage in. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the originial idea of the TPP is bad, I do think there are some shady things going on with pharm. companies, but that&#39;s a whole different story on the costs that those companies go through just to produce one drug. Did you know on average it&#39;s about 1/10000 drugs that work out of all the ones they try. Then you have the lifetime of the patent and a whole mess of other things to consider. </p>

<p>What you&#39;re really saying here is that you don&#39;t think the PR talking points coming out of the media about the TPP are bad.  It&#39;s the reality that is: it gives multibillion dollar, multinational corporations power and leverage over sovereign governments and their people.  This is never a good thing, regardless of whatever propaganda gets spouted in support of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess original TPP was a bad choice of words. I just want to make the point that free trade agreements aren&#39;t bad themselves, and that a lot of negotiations that have to deal with economics. A lot of the time what makes economical sense isn&#39;t what is popular with society either due to society not seeing the broad economic view or from many other factors such as added in parts to the agreement. I&#39;m personally waiting until we can see the full paper from congress before I decide how I feel about it. However I am in support of free trade no matter what. It increases the standard of living for all countries that are a part of the trade agreement in the long run.</p>

<p>I agree with you, but let&#39;s be clear that that isn&#39;t the reality of the TPP.  It will give more power to huge international corporations <em>exclusively</em> - it&#39;s almost the opposite of a true free trade agreement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I mean if you look through history there were always a lot of public outcry about trade agreements. It does give a lot of power of the corporations over people and a high amount of power to all the countries that are a part of the agreement. </p>

<p>I think the problem comes from corporations and the rights that they have. I agree the TPP from what I&#39;ve heard is no good I really would like to see what goods are going to be specialized and maybe some of the potential benefits to the agreement. Do you know any links that talk about that? I&#39;m on mobile right now avoiding my math class.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please read this article for at least an introduction into some of the reasons why the TPP is (and would be) so awful for most of us.  There&#39;s a lot more out there about this, including the leaked text of the TPP itself which should be required reading for everyone in my opinion.  Because it will affect all of us if it passes, and it won&#39;t be good for you and I.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/final-leaked-tpp-text-all-we-feared">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/final-leaked-tpp-text-all-we-feared</a></p>

<p>The summary at the bottom:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But we have struggled to come up with more than two positive points about the TPP, and even then the absence of these tragic mistakes is a pretty poor example of a positive point. If you look for provisions in the TPP that actually afford new benefits to users, rather than to large, rights-holding corporations, you will look in vain. The TPP is the archetype of an agreement that exists only for the benefit of the entitled, politically powerfully lobbyists who have pushed it through to completion over the last eight years.</p>

<p>There is nothing in here for users and innovators to support, and much for us to fear—the ratcheting up of the copyright term across the Pacific rim, the punitive sanctions for DRM circumvention, and the full frontal attack on hackers and journalists in the trade secrets provision, just to mention three. This latest leak has confirmed our greatest fears—and strengthened our resolve to kill this agreement for good once it reaches Congress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you expect to find an article listing benefits when there aren&#39;t any benefits to anyone who isn&#39;t a huge international corporation?  You&#39;re looking for information that doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>The article I just linked you to tried to find some actual positives, and so did I when I read through the text myself - I didn&#39;t find any.  The best I can say about it is that they removed some of the <em>truly</em> bad provisions in the final version, but that isn&#39;t really &quot;good&quot; so much as it is &quot;less bad&quot;.  It&#39;s still horrible.</p>

<p>I was thinking something along the lines like this but for the TPP, I&#39;ll keep looking though. It would also be nice to see the specific corporations and who is really gaining from the TPP.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The results above suggest that many college-educated Americans are not internalizing the implications of free-trade models that they were presumably exposed to in their course work or that other considerations are more salient when it comes to NAFTA in particular. With close to 20 years of news coverage touting both extremes of the NAFTA story, perhaps it is not surprising that substantial portions of the educated American public are skeptical of NAFTA and its implications for the U.S. economy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While both are trade agreements I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s fair to compare the two unless it&#39;s like a then and now comparison. The TPP feels more political then free trade oriented. Also don&#39;t think it&#39;s changed but isn&#39;t the TPP still making it so corporations can effectively sue a government over their policies(read laws) that the corporation doesn&#39;t like(aka affects their profit) and that such cases will be handle by a tribunal of the TPP&#39;s design.  I could be wrong, but I don&#39;t believe they&#39;ve change it. </p>

2) TPP/TTIP take this up a step as there is an uneven representation between voted respresentatives and  industry representatives. 
3) If anything it will be more dangerous for the partner states except the USA. [Doesn&#39;t makes this any better]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would be correct. </p>

<p>They only conceal these documents (which I&#39;m told are quite hefty, perhaps over 500 pages, maybe more.) because some Internet sleuths and grade A journalists would jump on it and ascertain the true goals of this &quot;Free Trade Agreemnt.&quot; Then they&#39;d get to posting and the information would disseminate throughout the net. </p>

<p>You&#39;d have people like Rand Paul and Bernie up in arms about it in order to gain popularity and eventually all of the hype would boil over and we would come I find that the TTP had been slow cooked and was now dead in the water. </p>

<p>On the other hand. If it remains a secret, if we can&#39;t get the entirety of those documents leaked as soon as possible then we shall find that the working class and lower class among many other things would be the ones that had been slow cooked til&#39; death. Right now they&#39;re lowering us into the pot, we still have enough time to jump out and push them back in, but we need a few brave and freedom loving souls to leak those documents ASAP. It should definitely be our priority, alongside just trying to get the whole thing publicize outright legally. (Let&#39;s face it though, you and I as well as the rest of this sub understand that there is a clear reason for this secrecy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How exactly do you suggest we separate from their &quot;economic tyranny&quot;? I&#39;m very curious. I spoke to my economic professor yesterday on his opinion on the TPP and he said that free trade is good, that having restrictions on trades only harm domestic and international economies. </p>

<p>Trade deals work by allowing countries who have a comparative advantage in things to specialize, while areas of work will more than likely be shifted and some americans will loose jobs if we import more, it will also allow us to export more and expand other fields of business that america has a comparative advantage in. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the originial idea of the TPP is bad, I do think there are some shady things going on with pharm. companies, but that&#39;s a whole different story on the costs that those companies go through just to produce one drug. Did you know on average it&#39;s about 1/10000 drugs that work out of all the ones they try. Then you have the lifetime of the patent and a whole mess of other things to consider. </p>
