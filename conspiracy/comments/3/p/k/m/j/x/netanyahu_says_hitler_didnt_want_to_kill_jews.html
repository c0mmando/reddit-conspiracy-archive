He flew to Berlin. Hitler didnâ€™t want to exterminate the Jews at the time, he wanted to expel the Jews. And Haj Amin al-Husseini went to Hitler and said, &quot;If you expel them, they&#39;ll all come here.&quot; &quot;So what should I do with them?&quot; he asked. He said, &quot;Burn them.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did Hitler ever personally kill any jews?  I mean, there have been no documents found to support the genocide claim.  There&#39;s a crazy &quot;holocaust survivor&quot;, Emmaly Reed, that claims she saw Hitler tie her dad down then burn him at the stake...but she also said nazis hammered a long spike into her head then pulled it out (as an experiment), and that she only weighed 32 lbs at fifteen years old, when the camp was liberated. </p>

<p>I know Hitler was in WWI, and it seems I recall him being decorated.  But I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any evidence that he personally killed anyone.</p>

No sweat, though- here they are again in German: <a href="http://nuremberg.law.harvard.edu/php/pflip.php?caseid=HLSL_NMT01&amp;amp;docnum=2496&amp;amp;numpages=3&amp;amp;startpage=1&amp;amp;title=Besprechung+mit+Reichsfuehrer+SS+Himmler+am+18.9.42+in+seinem+Feldquartier+in+Gegenwart+des+StS.+Dr.+Rothenberger+.+.+..&amp;amp;color_setting=C">1</a>, <a href="http://nuremberg.law.harvard.edu/php/pflip.php?caseid=HLSL_NMT01&amp;amp;docnum=1674&amp;amp;numpages=2&amp;amp;startpage=1&amp;amp;title=Betr.:+Loesung+der+Judenfrage..&amp;amp;color_setting=C">2</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I know is that historians on both sides of the question say there is no order from Hitler. </p>

<p>Premier holocaust historian Raul Hilberg testified in the trial of Ernst Zundel that he knew of no documentation...surely if these were authentic, the Crown would have presented them at trial.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what you said.  Even in context, it appears you meant to suggest there was no documentary evidence of genocide.  </p>

<p>Anyway, the absence of evidence is not proof of absence. There is ample circumstantial evidence, such as Himmler&#39;s &quot;the Fuhrer&#39;s time is no longer to be burdened with such matters.&quot;  </p>

<p>If Hitler <em>didn&#39;t</em> know what was going on, then he was dumber than pig shit-- which we both know he wasn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, no, they weren&#39;t. They were in German. Besides, just because one part of a trial is tainted doesn&#39;t mean all of it is.

    <div class="md"><p>He just shifted the blame of the decision to actually kill Jews away from Hitler, to a Palestinian. The man is out of his fucking mind. He undermined the enduring narrative of the Holocaust by claiming that Hitler did not actually come up with the idea to kill Jews. This is truly one of the most jaw-dropping things I&#39;ve ever heard spew forth from the mouth of a head of state.</p>

<p>If this isn&#39;t incitement, I don&#39;t know what is. I can think of no other reason for this outrageous statement, except for an intentional effort to incite hatred against Palestinians as a pretext for something Israel is about to do. The label of &quot;antisemite&quot; can have real-life consequences for people labeled as such; therefore, the consequences of being labeled as the people who actually came up with the decision to exterminate Jews are potentially terrifying. </p>

<p>Yes, he did, and your &quot;lady doth protest too much&quot; Hasbara spiel suggests what your agenda is here. The Prime Minister of Israel has accidentally sunk a fundamental tenet of your beloved Holocaust myth, and you don&#39;t know what to do with yourself.</p>

<p>This same prescience, led my father to say decades ago that the threat to world peace would come from those parts of the Muslim world where oil, terror and nuclear energy mix. It also led him to say to me, in the early 1990s, that Muslim extremists would try to bring down the twin towers in New York â€“ a prediction I included in one of my books.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahaha, they didn&#39;t- that&#39;s why these documents are prominently identified as translations.  You must have missed it, but it&#39;s right at the top there.  Take another look.  </p>

<p>Surely you&#39;re aware that it might be necessary to translate a document into English for the benefit of people who speak and work in English? No sweat, though- here they are again in German: <a href="http://nuremberg.law.harvard.edu/php/pflip.php?caseid=HLSL_NMT01&amp;amp;docnum=2496&amp;amp;numpages=3&amp;amp;startpage=1&amp;amp;title=Besprechung+mit+Reichsfuehrer+SS+Himmler+am+18.9.42+in+seinem+Feldquartier+in+Gegenwart+des+StS.+Dr.+Rothenberger+.+.+..&amp;amp;color_setting=C">1</a>, <a href="http://nuremberg.law.harvard.edu/php/pflip.php?caseid=HLSL_NMT01&amp;amp;docnum=1674&amp;amp;numpages=2&amp;amp;startpage=1&amp;amp;title=Betr.:+Loesung+der+Judenfrage..&amp;amp;color_setting=C">2</a>.</p>

<p>I probably got those faster than you expected.  Quick, better move those goalposts.  Let me guess-- they&#39;re forgeries, right?  Please provide <em>some</em> evidence that these <strong>specific</strong> documents were forgeries.</p>
