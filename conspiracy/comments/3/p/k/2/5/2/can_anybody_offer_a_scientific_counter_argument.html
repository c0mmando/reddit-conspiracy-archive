        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>the earth spins on an axis. this means if you are standing at the equator you are making a 24,900 mile rotation in 24 hours. therefore you are moving just a bit faster than 1000 miles an hour while standing still. you never feel this movement because the rotation is constant. constant speed feels like nothing it&#39;s only acceleration and deceleration we feel. great. all good.</p>

<p>but if you are standing very near the south pole the distance you spin in a day could be as slight as only a ~few miles an hour. because you are very near the axis you have a much smaller circle to travel in so you travel a much smaller distance by standing still - than somebody standing at the equator, but you never feel your own motion so long as you stay near the south pole because the spin of the earth is constant.</p>

<p>however - when you travel - from say alaska to central america - in addition to the acceleration of your airplane - standing still -- -is a difference of ~800 miles an hour. which far exceeds what the human body can withstand in acceleration in a day. you have to accelerate beyond speeds the human body can survive over the course of a day when you travel from far south to the equator, and vice versa if we live on a globe spinning on an axis.
how do you explain that people do not experience incredible physical trauma or death making this journey?</p>

<p>~800 miles an hour. which far exceeds what the human body can withstand in acceleration in a day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. Incorrect. Not even close. Perfectly survivable. Over an entire day, probably just subconsciously mildly comforting as it pushed you ever so slightly into your seat, less than you would even notice. The turbulence and drag noise caused by moving through the atmosphere at such speeds are far more noticeable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how do you explain that people do not experience incredible physical trauma or death making this journey?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of them do. Usually caused by too sudden of a deceleration. Most vehicles capable of flight or supersonic speeds still lack the thrust to kill their passengers by pancaking them to their seats.</p>

<p>Seriously, it&#39;s a nonsense theory. There is no basis at all in fact, and most of the basic ideas on which the theory is founded can be disproven with a casual glance at the world around you. You just suggested that accelerating to Mach 1 without killing the pilot would take over a day (then again, you probably think m/s means &quot;miles per hour&quot; - bloody murikinz). That&#39;s like saying a universe can be created in 6. They might as well be suggesting that Yahweh usurped Zeus&#39; Holy Throne even though Odin was CLEARLY next in line. It&#39;s just a load of crock, made up to bait views and sell a book or two. Believing it hurts the world, your family, your friends, starving children in Africa, those who seek World Peace and little orphan kittens. Stop.</p>

<p>We care about you. That&#39;s why we want to see you get better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone always seems to forget that you never leave the relative space that&#39;s moving with the planet. The atmosphere is just like water, only thinner. It&#39;s also moving with the rotation of the planet. Even though you are too heavy to float in it like water the atmosphere still is what you are surrounded by.</p>

<p>If the atmosphere wasn&#39;t traveling relative to the earth you would experience very fast winds. No?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always assumed this was the case, the earth was a closed system - everything in the atmosphere essentially functions like a solid and spins with us, it always made sense. </p>

<p>until I realized the surface of the earth must be spinning at a different rate in different places. then there is a big problem with the atmosphere too --- as air going at different speeds stirs with other air - as also must be happening with ocean water - you are going to have incredible friction. incredible rumbles of energy. crashing of speed into relative stillness - all day long. you could say this is where we get wind and waves. but I don&#39;t think it adds up - I think we should begetting way more cumulative friction that we do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>possible - but I do not think so because as far as I know the em field doesn&#39;t vary wildly over the course of a day, </p>

<p>I was thinking about the kitchen tool a whisk - a whisk is specifically designed to be wider in part than others - to when you stir with it you create a great deal of friction - and turn eggs into fluff - etc. the earth actually has a similar property - (if it&#39;s a spinning ball) it has a wider part and narrower parts and it&#39;s spinning - it should be whisking the atmosphere into a fluff via all the varying speeds and stirring it&#39;s providing. if you think about it - it doesn&#39;t make sense we ever get clear skies. (If I think about it - I know you may not come to same conclusion) </p>

<p>but - you can say we&#39;d have crazy winds if the atmosphere wasn&#39;t moving with the earth. however - the atmosphere in the upper and lower hemispheres is not moving at the same speed as atmosphere in the middle - so we should be getting that crazy weather - and I think it&#39;s notable that we do not. I think it brings the spinning ball model into question. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have just stumbled onto the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect">Coriolis Effect</a>.</p>

<p>If you are traveling north or south in the northern hemisphere, your path will be deflected to the right.  If you do the same in the southern hemisphere, your path will be deflected to the left.  This is caused by the fact that you are moving at a different eastward velocity than the ground.  Planes traveling a great distance north or south have to take this into account, adding the appropriate east or west component to their travel to counter this.</p>

<p>If you were to suddenly teleport from the pole to the equator, you would appear to everyone at the equator to suddenly be launched 1000 miles per hour to the west.  This acceleration would almost certainly kill you.  In fact, if you could teleport, you wouldn&#39;t be able to travel very far north or south before the change in velocity became dangerous.</p>

<p>However, because we have time to travel, our relative velocity changes as we move, generally.  If we move fast enough, though, the Coriolis Effect kicks in, and your path will bend because of your speed change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aircraft pilots do exactly this. The Admiratly board of navigation has addressed this. It&#39;s called &quot;the Great Circle&quot;, and it sums to 1 nautical mile of deflection per 1&#39; latitude or longitude traveled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Technically, you probably could.  The problem is that you have to be traveling fast enough so that the atmosphere doesn&#39;t have time to impart its energy to you (if going toward the equator) or take energy from you (if going away from the equator).  Every second you spend touching air while flying means you have your inertia changed that much more.</p>

<p>The effect becomes much more pronounced when masses of air or ocean currents are moving.  Ocean currents in the northern hemisphere will circle clock wise, while currents in the southern hemisphere will go counter clock wise.  Since these currents are transporting fantastic amounts of matter, the surrounding matter doesn&#39;t have enough energy to change the velocity before it moves far enough north or south.  This allows it to retain its eastward velocity, and appear to change direction.</p>

<p>The effect becomes REALLY noticeable with satellites.  It takes quite a bit of energy to do this, so we don&#39;t do it often, but we sometimes set a satellite going in an orbit that passes over the poles.  The reason it takes so much energy is that we first have to cancel out the east inertia from the spin, then we have to get it to orbital velocity going north or south (Fun fact, most satellites go east ward, because they already have a boost from the earth&#39;s rotation).</p>

<p>Then you have fun things like hurricanes.  They appear to spin opposite of the Coriolis Effect, spinning counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere.  This is because, at its center, there is a low pressure system.  All the surrounding air tries to move toward the low pressure, and gets deflected to the left.  Since you have air coming in from all directions, and getting deflected left, it looks like the storm is spinning counter clockwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is super long - so I respect that makes it all the less approachable  - but this is a conversation with a navy missile instructor explaining among other things that they never account for coriolis effect. he goes on to explain a lot of other practicals about his work out at sea that bring the globe model into question. </p>

<p>so among other things - it gave me strong reason to doubt the coriolis effect is occurring at all... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to bear in mind that the difference in velocity over short distances is not great, and it’s this difference that causes the apparent force.  Even in the case of hurricanes, which can span over 100 miles, only get partial deflection (not a complete circle) from the Coriolis Effect.  Over the ranges most artillery work, the effect is considerably less.</p>

<p>The apparent force from the Coriolis Effect is not large, and difficult to observe on small scales.  Only when scaled up to massive scales does it become readily apparent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s an experiment you can do in your back yard, but it&#39;s a little involved.</p>

<p>Two wonderful science channels <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihv4f7VMeJw">Veritasium</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDorTBEhEtk">SmarterEveryDay</a> released a pair of videos intended to be played at the same time.  In them, they demonstrate the Coriolis Effect, and explain why they had to go to such lengths to demonstrate it.  With a little DIY and a place sheltered from the outdoors, you can do this yourself.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not impossible to see, it&#39;s just difficult to see.  Sweeping and easily measurable changes only occur over great distances.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:  To address your last paragraph: Says who?  Physics is physics.  Do high energy particles not exist because I can&#39;t make them in my microwave?  Does general relativity not exist because I can&#39;t go half the speed of light?  Does ice not exist because I live in the desert?</p>

<p>Our inability to see something doesn&#39;t make it any less real.  I will never see, taste, touch, hear, or smell radio waves.  At best, I&#39;ll get a second hand experience as they are filtered through some machine, which will spit out a completely dissimilar wave.  Does that make them any less real?  Does that make the equations that describe them meaningless?  My inability to generate neutrinos doesn&#39;t make them any less real.  Physics is physics, here in earth&#39;s climate or elsewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two people, in opposite hemispheres, set up a large pool.  They have a hypothesis that the pool will drain a certain direction.  However, they know that the force that would cause the pool to drain in that particular direction is small, and easily overridden by other forces.</p>

<p>To start, they fill the pool, such that it starts with a current in the opposite direction.  This means that, should the pool drain in the opposite direction, it must have been from the Coriolis effect.</p>

<p>They then set up their pools in sheltered areas, to prevent as many outside forces at possible for inducing currents.  They also let the pool sit for a day, to allow any energy from the currents of the pool to dissipate.  After waiting a day, they open a valve at the bottom of the pool (on the underside, so they never have to touch the water).  Using food coloring, they add several drops of dye to the pool to better observe the water&#39;s movement.</p>

<p>Both pools move exactly as predicted.  The ability to make accurate predictions is the key to accepting any proposed model.  What&#39;s more, it is easily repeatable.  Anyone with the inclination can follow the same steps themselves, and see if the results are re-created.  That is why I think these videos offer strong evidence.</p>

(if you see flat earth model this is readily apparent) &amp;  it doesn&#39;t speak to stronger spin in center of the earth than top or bottom, it doesn&#39;t answer the much bigger questions like why planes don&#39;t have to use much more fuel when they go against the effect then when they are aided by it. it&#39;s not a proof we live on a spinning ball. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s exactly what it&#39;s speaking to.  The reason the water in an otherwise still pool has a preferred direction to drain is because the earth must be spinning.  You have to have a difference in velocities at different latitudes, otherwise the water would have no preferred direction.</p>

<p>I will gladly concede that a single experiment is far from definitive proof.  This is another observation to be placed next to ocean currents, and the fact that no hurricane that formed and dissipated in the northern hemisphere ever rotated the other way, the same with the southern hemisphere.  This is one in a multitude of observations that all build on and confirm each other.  That is why I accept the Coriolis Effect.</p>

<p>Having said that, I would be fascinated to hear alternate explanations that assume a different geometry at work.  Is the planet still required to spin?  Why does it change between hemispheres?  I&#39;ll keep my questions centered on the topic of the vortices in fluids, and leave any other questions aside.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree - at the end he seems to make an error at the end, the first couple times I watch it was like -- oh he&#39;s forgetting the earth is still spinning underneath so the runway always catches up with the additional acceleration the plane is experiencing. but then I changed my mind -- and realized he is accounting for that -- the runway catches up --- but the problem is in the turning -- the force was applying in one direction for the plane and not it needs to be turned - force is directional. you have too much force going east - so you are coming at the runway way way too fast even if the runway is catching up to your lateral movement, , -- I actually think he is right. tho it&#39;s still a little confusing to me - I&#39;ll allow I&#39;m not sure. but I think if he did the experiment from LAX to -- some airport much further south instead of parallel - - so that the constant rotation of the earth is is varied from air port to air port there would be no question there would be a huge problem. that&#39;s my opinion. that&#39;s what I work out every time I try to imagine it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the theory is that the flat (at least topically) earth does not spin. (which was actually harder for me to take in that that it was not a ball. I was like - well it can be flat but it&#39;s still spinning. ) it took me a couple months of more research to realize - even the spinning can&#39;t be occurring. </p>

<p>it&#39;s a lot of shift in perspective, and the whole of it sounds ridiculous - yes. but if you break it down to small questions - and really require the globe model to be provable not just a working theory -- a lot happens in perspective. </p>

<p>as for specifically the fluids question - I haven&#39;t researched that topic intensely. but I have looked at weather patterns - and what we experience makes a lot more sense on a plane than a ball. ...</p>

<p>this video has goofy music and takes itself very seriously. but it talks about a problem with water on the globe earth - </p>

<p>to summarize: water surface does not curve. ocean water level - is always level. to &quot;wrap&quot; around the earth - ocean water level needs to arc/curve - but it never does. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This person doesn&#39;t understand the claims being made, and seems to be refuting straw man arguments.  They make ridiculous examples, and claim this is what is being presented by the standard model, then make statements that plainly aren&#39;t true.</p>

<p>Their big claim is that water always remains level.  This is patently false.  Water always remains in the lowest energy state.  Water in free fall forms droplets.  In the Vomit Comet, the zero gravity plane that flies over the Gulf of Mexico, you can see water form spherical shapes due to it&#39;s surface tension.  This is being a little nit picky, I&#39;ll admit, but it&#39;s important to help illustrate that water does not always stay level, it just does what takes the least energy.</p>

<p>In an accelerating car, water will move to the back of a glass.  This is getting a bit into more advanced physics, so I&#39;ll try to keep it brief, but that is basically the same as bending gravity.  In relativity, gravity and acceleration run through the same equations, so it becomes nonsensical to treat them differently.  When under this changed force of gravity from an accelerating car, &quot;level&quot; becomes a new angle in the water.  In the same way across an ocean, water would naturally form &quot;level&quot; as tangent to gravity.</p>

<p>The video makes a serious mistake of &quot;I can&#39;t see it, so it must not exist.&quot;  No where does the author of the video say what amount of curvature we should expect to see at that height from the water level, or at what altitude it would become visible to the human eye.  The author would be much more credible if they researched the actual claims being made and attempted to refute those.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate you&#39;r point - thou the droplets example still show water reaching to the bottom of it&#39;s occupied space - not upwards - and yes if I hold a glass of water in my hand while riding in a car accelerating onto the freeway - the level will change to a line that shows a shift in force. (I might add since our bodies are mostly water this only confirms that we should  always FEEL acceleration) but - back to point at hand -- there are very clear charts of the exact curve water should be taking as it curves around the earth. if in fact water can curve - though for all the provable examples, such as droplets and in a glass in a car -  where it may curve convexly - I can not think of a single example where it can steadily maintain a concave curve. a wave is the best example but waves are never static and do not hold their shape. </p>

<p>the curve water must maintain to &quot;wrap&quot; around the earth bust be concave not convex - as in a glass in a car. - you can pull water down into an arc - (or allow in to fall down into an arc ) but you can&#39;t push it up into an arc - </p>

<p>the specific curvature of the earth for all surface area (allowing for topography) because it is a ball and the circumference is 24,900 is 8&quot; per mile. and then it grows exponentially - I think squared - for each additional mile. you can google earths curvature - it&#39;s an accepted #. the guy in the balls out physics video explains expected curvature quite succinctly.   </p>

<p>so there is a very specific expected curvature of the earth&#39;s surface, and the problem is - droplets in a volcano or not - the ocean never conveys the curvature of the earth. this point is confirmed by the navy guy&#39;s testimony - he can see for ~20 miles and never have his view be obscured by curvature. </p>

<p>this is a real issue, whatever the explanation - he should not be able to see ships that out , - they should be around the curve - hidden from his view - it&#39;s not supposed to happen with what is believed to be the curvature of the earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to be too pedantic, but you can actually get water to bend in a convex manner.  In fact, if you have an unusually strong magnet, you can do it in your house.  However, this doesn&#39;t happen on any scale that would be impressive (you&#39;ll rarely see more than a few ounces of water), and even then most experiments measure the movement in millimeters.</p>

<p>You see, water is diamagnetic.  This means that, in a sufficiently strong magnetic field, water will generate a magnetic field in the opposite direction, causing it to be repelled.  You can search diamagnetism in YouTube and find dozens of people with strong magnets causing convex bending in water.</p>

<p>However, we know that the magnetic field of the earth isn&#39;t anywhere near strong enough to hold water in a convex manner, because we can measure the magnetic fields around us.  If the earth&#39;s field was strong enough to do something like that, the computer you&#39;re working on right now wouldn&#39;t be able to store data on its hard drive, as it would constantly be wiped.</p>

<p>As to feeling acceleration, you have to be careful.  The acceleration would have to both be strong enough for us to feel, and long enough for us to perceive.  While instantly moving even a relatively small distance north or south would easily produce significant accelerations, most such journeys take hours or days, massively reducing the acceleration at any single point in the journey.  While 1000 miles per hour of deceleration may seem massive (going from a pole to the equator), the 18 or so hours that acceleration would be spread over is much less massive, especially when compared to turbulence of the plane, the earth’s gravity, and even the force of acceleration you feel with you shift your weight in your chair.</p>

<p>As to your final point, I begin moving out of areas I&#39;m experienced in.  I have a basic understanding of optics, but any specific and insightful follow up questions to this will be out of my league.  I&#39;ll present what I can, however.</p>

<p>You have to bear a couple of things in mind when talking about sight lines close to the earth&#39;s surface (close astronomically speaking, within 100 or so miles).  Because light is in traveling through the atmosphere, it doesn&#39;t behave like it would in a vacuum.  Fortunately, the earth&#39;s gravity is fairly small, so we can pretty much ignore it for the distances we&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>However, the atmosphere that is normally fairly clear over short distances of a few miles, it can being interacting with the light over much greater distances.  More dense air will interact more with light than less dense air.  This means air closer to the surface bends light more than air higher above the surface.  In addition, air temperature can change the density of the air as well.  To complicate things further, multiple layers of air, each with different densities, interact with light in even more complicated ways.  Hopefully you&#39;re beginning to see why this is rapidly falling outside my domain.</p>

<p>To grossly over simplify, more dense air is usually on the bottom, and less dense air is usually on the top.  This means that light traveling through the atmosphere is typically bent downward.  This has the effect of bending light along the earth&#39;s surface, at least for a short distance (short when compared to the speed of light).  The net result would be an increased sight line by things that use light (like your eyes).  The exact math and equations are well above my education, but are freely available to anyone who wants to look them up.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:  Just a quick addition, make sure any equations you use for sight lines on oceans include the observer&#39;s eye level above the water.  Even the difference of a few feet can mean many miles of change in the observer&#39;s horizon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As long as you walk away with a little more knowledge about the actual claims about the standard model, I&#39;ll be happy.  Too many flat earth proponents don&#39;t exactly understand the claims being made by the standard model, and present arguments about things that no one is proposing.  If you are better equipped to recognize these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man">straw man</a> arguments because of this conversation, then I&#39;ll rest easier.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  I just wanted to state again that, Brian Mullin, the author of one of the videos you linked previously, is probably the single best flat earth proponent of the flat earth model so far.  While I&#39;m no doubt getting a little bit more philosophical than my inner physicist would approve of, mathematics is the fundamental component to understanding the physical universe.  Any deep and comprehensive model of what we perceive will be best described mathematically.  Mr Mullin&#39;s use of algebra is the most mathematically concise model of the flat earth I&#39;ve seen so far.  While I may find fault in his equations and interpretations, he is the only person I&#39;ve found looking in the right direction.</p>

<p>Any model that is proposed that lacks a mathematical justification should be viewed with the utmost scrutiny.  It&#39;s a sign that the proponent doesn&#39;t understand the nature of physics, nor the science involved in describing the physical world.  While I regret to admit this, my own understanding of mathematics is limited, and by extension my ability to answer your questions is limited (see, the equations that govern the refraction of light).  If you truly want insight into the physical world, there is no better education you can pursue than that on mathematics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not know. But I know people do not like to admit they are wrong. the globe model makes a lot of sense,  -- until you start to realize in some ways it doesn&#39;t make sense. maybe it wasn&#39;t about hiding but just not realizing. ---or there is the very suspicious history of trade routes, possible some people wanted to put one over of some other people and have a better angle on the best trade routes. quite the game changer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea. I&#39;m also not sure we know what we are looking at - because when we look up we only see a two dimensional image of what we think are spheres  - how we really can be sure that we are looking at spheres - I&#39;m not sure. but either way. a mushroom is still not a bumble bee - even if that&#39;s all it sees when it looks up. (sorry - its a sincere metaphor) - I just think we should not be as certain as we are. if you go back and look at how they decided we are a sphere - it&#39;s not as solid science as you might assume, they found an explanation that fit - that was all.they did not test against it.  they just taught it. and it was the church that declared it fact, and ruled that it must be taught. (which is neither here nor there but I think it&#39;s good to remember - it was a law - not an open discourse for a long time, and kind of still is if you think about it)  my feeling is just because you find a system that functionally explains something doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s unltamately the correct explanation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>:) </p>

<p>thanks! &amp; just as a precursor - I have no problem if you stay believing we live on a spinning ball/ or if we both change our minds or neither does. I don&#39;t believe this conversation is about who&#39;s smarter or who&#39;s fooled - but only that it super interests me to entertain the new questions being raised. </p>

<p>the tides are really interesting - and I actually don&#39;t think the flat earth model has come up with a perfect explanation for them, but I think even more significantly the globe model explanation for them does not make sense. </p>

<p>personally I wonder if the flat earth doesn&#39;t have a slight wiggle - and  this tiny back and forth tilt is cumulative for the giant amount of water in the oceans - so its sloshing the oceans from side to side throughout the day with this very very slight wobble. &amp; maybe it also doesn&#39;t even have to be a wobble - since heat is motion - the presence of the sun on one side and then the other - could possibly create enough variance - from warm/expanding to cool/condencing - to create this sloshing. - but I haven&#39;t seen anybody else with that theory that&#39;s just my person thought. </p>

<p>but -- even if it can&#39;t be explained with certainty otherwise yet - here is why I think it is decidedly not explained with the globe model: the moons gravity is supposed to be counter acting the earth&#39;s gravity to create tides. how does this make sense via the rules of physics? force never gets separately applied to water than to solid matter. all matter feels the same force applied and all force is like an arithmetic problem - counter forces do not both act - the lesser is subtracted from the greater - and the force is quantifiable. if you consider water is the only thing supposedly effected by the moons&#39; pull - why is dust - clouds, the hair on our head -- never effected by the same pull. water is actually quite dense - there is so much less dense material that should be demonstrating the pull of the moon&#39;s gravity also - if in fact the moon&#39;s gravity is what is &quot;pulling the oceans&quot; -- we should all be leaning a little in the directions of the tides ourselves - after all - we are mostly water. but tis is not the case, we do not feel the same force. so the explanation seems very flawed to me. </p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> Not a scientist, I just wanted to see if I can answer this question in a way that makes intuitive sense.</p>

<p><strong>Why don&#39;t we feel the Moon&#39;s gravity, if it can cause the tides?</strong></p>

<p>The gravitational pull of the moon actually <em>does</em> act on us, but it&#39;s so small that we&#39;d never notice it. Let&#39;s calculate the actual amount of force in terms of m/s<sup>2.</sup> I&#39;ve approximated some numbers just for simplicity&#39;s sake.</p>

<p>The Earth&#39;s gravity exerts a force of 9.8 m/s and has a radius of 6,370KM. If we were in a typical &quot;medium earth orbit&quot;, we&#39;d be about 20,000KM from the surface, or 26,370KM from Earth&#39;s center of gravity. Since gravity follows the square root law, that means we&#39;d experience about 1/16th the force of gravity at that particular orbit. Here&#39;s the actual formula:</p>

<pre><code>g1 / g2 = (r2 / r1)^2
</code></pre>

<p>Filling in the values (g2 being the force of gravity at 26,370KM):</p>

<pre><code>9.8 / g2 = (26370 / 6370)^2
</code></pre>

<p>Solving the right side of the equation gives us:</p>

<pre><code>9.8 / g2 = 17.13
</code></pre>

<p>And then solving for g2:</p>

<pre><code>g2 = 1.75 m/s
</code></pre>

<p>Does this still make sense so far?</p>

<p>Okay, now the moon, meanwhile, has a surface gravity of 1.6 m/s<sup>2,</sup> and a radius of 1080KM, and is approximately 240,000KM from Earth. We can use that same formula to plug in that distance and get the amount of force, in m/s<sup>2,</sup> the moon&#39;s gravity exerts on the surface:</p>

<pre><code>r1 = Distance from the moon&#39;s surface to it&#39;s center of mass (1080KM)

r2 = Distance from the Earth&#39;s surface to the moon&#39;s center of mass (241,080KM)

g1 = Force of the moon&#39;s gravity on the surface of the moon ( 1.6m/s^2 )

g2 = Force of the moon&#39;s gravity on the surface of the Earth
</code></pre>

<p>Plugging in those values gives us this:</p>

<pre><code>1.62 / g2 = (241080 / 1080)^2
</code></pre>

<p>So, solving the right side, just like last time:</p>

<pre><code>1.62 / g2 = 49828.16
</code></pre>

<p>And solving for g2:</p>

<pre><code>g2 = 0.0000325
</code></pre>

<p>So, at the surface of the Earth, the average force the moon&#39;s gravity exerts is about <strong>0.03%</strong> Earth&#39;s gravity. And the difference caused by the tides would be a tiny fraction of that since the total distance from the Earth&#39;s surface to the moon changes by 13,000KM (to find the difference do the same calculations as above but with 247,450 instead of 241,080 and subtract from the original).</p>

<p><strong>Part 2: Why can it create the tides if it&#39;s so weak compared to the Earth&#39;s gravity?</strong></p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, the reason comes down to a fairly obvious behavior of fluids to seek a state of equilibrium (someone else please correct me if I&#39;m using the wrong term here, I may be). This is why you can hold water in a glass sideways if you swing it around, why siphoning works, etc...water is attempting to find the equilibrium between the forces acting on it.</p>

<p>The force exerted by the moon, compared to the Earth, is incredibly tiny, but not zero. So the difference between high and low tide is also incredibly tiny, but not zero. Staring at it from the shore, it looks like a lot, but the average depth of the ocean is almost 4KM, something like 10 empire state buildings. It&#39;s a minuscule difference.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think I can possibly do the calculations for tide levels by hand, since fluid dynamics is insanely complex.</p>

<p>My god, this post was way, way longer than I originally intended it to be. I&#39;m going to go watch TV now.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> So after my post this afternoon, it got me curious about how tide levels are predicted and I looked some stuff up after dinner. I was right about calculating tide levels being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_tides#Laplace.27s_tidal_equations">way too f&#39;ing complex</a> for me to do by hand, but there are various organizations around the world that release Tide Tables or Tide Charts that predict future tide levels based on:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The position of the sun and moon (since the sun contributes to tides as well, just not as much as the moon)</p></li>
<li><p>Historical tide levels based on direct observation</p></li>
<li><p>The geography of the seafloor in the area</p></li>
<li><p>The predicted atmospheric conditions at the time (I&#39;m assuming barometric pressure, since low pressure zones are what creates hurricane storm surges)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Since this is new information to me, I&#39;ll have to read and digest it before I can try and come up with a good summary of it. I&#39;ll try and get back to you in the near future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi - - I hope you enjoying whatever is on TV. </p>

<p>Thanks for your long post, I appreciate all thoughtful answers!</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to say I understand all of your math, and I think you may have the earth&#39;s radius wrong. But -- I&#39;ll say I do think I understand and agree with the general conclusion of your math -- being that a force could be effecting the ocean and creating the tides - and while we technically are effected too - comparatively the effect on us is so minimal (given size of ocean in relation to &quot;size&quot; of tides) that we do not discern the force as a sensation. </p>

<p>ok. I agree, I agree it is probable that something is effecting the the ocean that is also effecting us - and the result is tides and otherwise - practically nothing. </p>

<p>I do not think it&#39;s the moon&#39;s gravity that is doing it. But I&#39;ll agree - the fact that we as people don&#39;t physically lean with the tides - &amp; feel whatever force is creating the tides - is not alone proof that the moon&#39;s gravity is not creating the tides. </p>

<p>but - if it is the moon exerting pull does create tides , I think it would be very hard to exert that force on a spinning ball. the middle of the ball spinning at 1033 miles and hour -- how could moons pull have time to focus on one side of the ocean vs the other, -- if the earth were flat and stationary - lying fully still and prone to moons pull - then perhaps the moon would have a chance of pulling the oceans one way and then the other over the course of a day - imo. </p>

<p>the latter part of your response reminded me of another issue with globe earth -- that is probably easier to measure - and prove or disprove. and it has to do with the behavior of water, - that fluids seek a state of equilibrium. I agree. I think specifically water seeks to fill the bottom of any vessel - and the surface of still water can always be counter on to be perfectly level. (allowing for meniscus at outer edges) I think when you slosh water in a glass you will see - the surface of the water may take on any kind of depressed type shape -<br/>
where the edges rise and the middle is lower, because you are continually altering where the &quot;bottom&quot; of the vessel by swinging it around. but except for waves - which can never hold their shape - I&#39;d argue it is impossible - no matter how you slosh that glass - to get water to maintain a convex surface. </p>

<p>water can not maintain a convex surface, if it is still it is always flat. if you slosh it in a container you can get it to create a concave surface, but no knowable force or combination of forces can get water to maintain a convex surface. </p>

<p>and yet if earth is a ball. mostly covered by water. the surface of water must be following the convex curve of the earth. </p>

<p>given that the earth&#39;s circumference is supposed to be 24,900 miles. the curvature should be 8&quot;per miles - and then squared for every additional mile. yet no body of water can be measured to ever demonstrate any convex curvature. in the words of the first flat earth youtube-ers - where is the curvature?</p>

<p>anyway. feel free to have a go at that one too, if you feel so inclined. </p>

<p>I went back and checked and you&#39;re right, the radius of the earth is 6371KM (according to wikipedia) and I put 6700KM instead. Derp. I&#39;ll go back and update the numbers in a few.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The force gravity applies depends on the mass of the object and it&#39;s distance from the center of gravity, so whether an object is rotating or not only matters if the distance from the center of mass changes - it&#39;s just a force vector, after all.</p>

<p>I can even think two experiments you can use to demonstrate that fact.</p>

<p><strong>Experiment #1:</strong></p>

<p>Take a magnet and place it close enough to a metal ball bearing that it&#39;s slowly pulled toward and eventually touches the magnet. Record the maximum distance required for the ball bearing to start moving toward the magnet and the amount of time it took to do so.</p>

<p>Next, perform the same experiment, but before you place the magnet, spin the ball bearing as rapidly as you can manage without causing it to move from its static position. If your hypothesis has merit, there should be an observable decrease in the maximum distance and/or an increase in the minimum time.</p>

<p><strong>Experiment #2</strong></p>

<p>Set a basketball on a smooth floor at a set distance from a hairdryer with the business end pointed directly at the basket ball&#39;s center. Turn the hair dryer on the lowest setting and observe exactly how long it takes the basketball to be blown into the far wall from the force of the air dryer.</p>

<p>Next, perform the same experiment, but start spinning the basketball rapidly first. As with the previous experiment, if the there&#39;s something to your hypothesis you should detect an observable increase in the time it takes for the basketball to hit the back wall.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think it&#39;s important that when we refer to water being &quot;level&quot;, that we mean the surface of the water in a container is, at any one point, <em>perpendicular to the net vector of the forces acting on it</em>. For something like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPrVOiMJwNE">water bottle centrifuge</a> you will see a downward-slanting concave surface. Why? Because the amount of force depends on the distance from the center of the centrifuge. So the shape you see is the result of the concave surface that is perpendicular to centrifugal force, plus the downward force of gravity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but except for waves - which can never hold their shape - I&#39;d argue it is impossible - no matter how you slosh that glass - to get water to maintain a convex surface.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree!</p>

<p>In the water bottle centrifuge, the water surface became concave because that was the shape at which the same amount of force is acting on the water. Now, in the video I linked, what would happen if I removed the gravity force vector entirely? According to basic physics, the only force acting on it would now be the centrifugal force, and the equilibrium would be a perfectly concave surface instead of a downward-slanted one.</p>

<p>Now, if a force pushing outward from a central point (centrfugal force in our centrifuge) would create a perfectly concave surface, what happens if you reverse those force vectors? According to the same math, same rules that we just demonstrated with the centrifuge, it should form a perfectly convex surface instead of concave one...a sphere. And that&#39;s exactly how gravity behaves in this case...a single pulling the water towards its collective center of mass. There&#39;s also surface tension, but I don&#39;t think it matters much at a scale larger than a water droplet.</p>

<p>The next step, of course, is how to demonstrate these physics at work. In terms of physics, it&#39;s simple...just apply a 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> force directly opposite to gravity. In terms of practicality, if you want to do this for any significant length of time, you need an aircraft that can accelerate downward fast enough that the vertical component of that acceleration completely cancels out gravity.</p>

<p>In addition to aircraft owned by various space agencies, there is a commercial company that sells flights that do just that:</p>

<p>Now, I assume that if you believe the earth is flat, you probably also believe anything coming out of NASA is completely fake, so you won&#39;t take this next video seriously. But this is footage from NASA&#39;s Vomit Comet, demonstrating what happens when you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTqLQO3L4Ko">pop a water balloon in zero-g</a>. As you can see, the masses of water clearly start to settle into spheres, just as a sloshing bucket of water settles into a flat surface. Different force vectors, but same physics. I think that&#39;s about as detailed as I can get without buying a college physics book and I&#39;ve already served my time in physics 101. ;)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>given that the earth&#39;s circumference is supposed to be 24,900 miles. the curvature should be 8&quot;per miles - and then squared for every additional mile. yet no body of water can be measured to ever demonstrate any convex curvature. in the words of the first flat earth youtube-ers - where is the curvature?</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna have to address that tomorrow...I&#39;m kind of brained out at this point, haha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hi again :) </p>

<p>re: your experiment # 1. ok - sure i can agree a magnetic force could have same pull on spinning ball as a whole. (not that moon is a magnet - but) but when tides occur the oceans are moving in a manner than is separate from the earth/ball as a whole. an effect that is manifest just on the surface - and not to the whole ball is going to be differently played out. I&#39;d say. -- but I gotta come back to - I think it&#39;s still a problem that the force effects the oceans and not the rest of earth in a noticeable way., because IF water can e pulled while the earth stays put (relatively) than when the earth moves/spins the water should stay put/ move independently to some degree - so if water can move separately from the earth as a whole -  water should be sloshing over the entire planet in contrast to the spin of the earth - constantly. rr. I know it&#39;s accepted science.  believed it myself all my life until a  few months ago. but now I no longer do.   ... anyway, that&#39;s my thoughts on your example #1. I&#39;ll read more of your response and respond to each at another break time. </p>

<p>so if water can move separately from the earth as a whole - water should be sloshing over the entire planet in contrast to the spin of the earth - constantly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I spent a couple hours trying to figure out the how I could answer this mathematically without having to re-learn a bunch of physics I haven&#39;t thought about since I was a college sophomore, but I think i found a better way.</p>

<p>Your thinking is that because the earth is spinning so quickly, it should have a massive impact on the ocean, and the water&#39;s inertia would sent it crashing over the surface like a massive tidal wave. I can address this two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Calculate the total force of inertia created by the ocean and compare that force against the force of the Earth&#39;s gravity. If that force is greater than or almost equal to the force of gravity, then the ocean should be sloshing</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the rotational speed of the ocean at the surface and compare that with the rotational speed of the ocean at the pacific seafloor. If we can demonstrate that difference is slower than the fastest ocean currents, we know it can&#39;t cause tidal waves. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I really wanted to do #1, but unfortunately I don&#39;t know all of the math required well enough to be confident of my answer, so for the moment I&#39;m going to do the (relatively simple second technique). </p>

<p>My thinking is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We know normal ocean currents don&#39;t cause tidal waves</p></li>
<li><p>We know the maximum recorded speed of an ocean current</p></li>
<li><p>We can calculate the radial speed of the ocean at the surface and the sea floor</p></li>
<li><p>Given #2 and #3, if the speed of the ocean at the surface CAN&#39;T cause tidal waves unless it&#39;s significantly faster than the fastest ocean currents. I think that&#39;s a logically sound approach, hopefully you do too.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Maximum speed of ocean currents, <a href="http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/EugeneStatnikov.shtml">based on this source</a> is <code>2.5 m/s</code>, or <code>9KM/h</code></p>

<p>The average depth of the Pacific ocean, <a href="http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/oceandepth.html">based on this source</a>, is about <code>3.7Km</code></p>

<p>Circumference of the Earth at the surface, at the equator: <code>2 * 6731Km * pi = 40,031.12Km</code></p>

<p>Radial speed of the Earth, at the surface, at the equator: <code>40,031.12Km/24h = 1667.96Km/h</code></p>

<p>Circumference of the Earth at the equator, at the floor of the pacific ocean: <code>2 * (6371 - 3.7) * pi = 40,006.94Km</code></p>

<p>Radial speed of the Earth at the equator, at the floor of the pacific ocean: <code>40,006.94Km/24h = 1666.96Km/h</code></p>

<p>So, the difference in speed between the ocean surface and the pacific sea floor amounts to almost exactly 1Km/h, only 11% as fast as the fastest ocean currents. If that difference in speed is so small, how could is possibly send the ocean cascading across land?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hello again -- I see you just left this I must have good timing. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I understand how the information you are offering answers my question - but maybe I could make my question more clear to see if what I meant to ask is what you meant to answer -- </p>

<p>to first respond to what you are saying - I take no issue with proving the weather patterns we already experience do not cause the oceans to wash over all the land masses, I feel this is a given - since we can observe it does not happen in all of our recorded history (unless you go back to possibly verifiable great floods of ancient history - but that&#39;s a totally different question) .. anyway from what I gather from what you are saying is that the oceans don&#39;t wash over the continents from the spinning of the earth because the oceans don&#39;t wash over the continents. -- but the problem I see with that is -- I think that because the oceans don&#39;t wash over continents - might be evidence that we are actually not spinning. I&#39;m saying IF we were a spinning ball I think they would(along with a lot of other phenomena we don&#39;t experience)  - and so because it is observable that the oceans do not wash over the oceans - I think this is another reason to strongly consider that we are not a spinning ball. </p>

<p>take the experiment where you have a glass of water and you slosh it around. for the sake of my effort to explain my question - imagine  land as the glass - and ocean as the water inside. when the glass is at rest - the land an water both retain their form,  when the glass is sloshed around - the glass retains it&#39;s form but the oceans-water - goes racing up the sides of the glass and covering areas of it it would never cover when it was still. when you wove a solid object with liquid in it - the liquid flows -- but the solid stays the same shape while it moves, --- </p>

<p>it&#39;s this kind of phenomena which makes me ask -- if we are a spinning ball - why do the oceans retain their shape as if we are relatively still. </p>

<p>the argument could be presented -- because the speed is constant. and so these are constant forces - the flow is set. but the problem is on the surface the earth does not at all spin at a constant speed throughout. at the equator (if we are a spinning ball) we spin 1033mph. and if you are very close to the north pole you must be spinning only a few mph. we know that water does not stay exactly at the same meridian line all the time - water stirs with itself constantly. but the contrast in forces the water should  be carrying - ( from 1033 mph - ~0mph) are never on display. </p>

<p>I agree the kind of weather and storm patterns we do have are incredibly minimal - on the grand scale of the plane/planet we live on. and I don&#39;t see how that is possible if we are spinning. </p>

<p>anyway. slightly hung over from spooky last night. hope you had a good one yourself. </p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s just a tautology, so it&#39;s not terribly useful as a proof of anything. ;)</p>

<p>What I was going for was demonstrating that the difference in speed between the surface and bottom of the ocean is so small that it can&#39;t directly create a strong ocean current. In which case, the only currently uncalculated factor is the ocean&#39;s inertia.</p>

<p>I understand that you might be incredulous that the rate of rotation doesn&#39;t send the oceans cascading across land, which is why I was hoping to demonstrate that mathematically. I&#39;m still working on that but it involves re-learning college physics I haven&#39;t studied in about ten years without neglecting my toddler or getting fired, so it hasn&#39;t been easy. ;) Do you know any physics majors? I bet they could give you a good answer.</p>

<p>They are, it&#39;s called the <em>Coriolis Effect</em>. Have you noticed that hurricanes always rotate in one direction in the northern hemisphere and in a different direction in the southern one, and that the global ocean current <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/%7Egeol105/images/gaia_chapter_4/oceancirculation.jpg">circulates in opposite directions</a> in the northern/southern hemispheres?</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can ask a military sniper or artillery operator, as they fire projectiles over ranges long enough that they need to take the difference in speed, depending on the direction they&#39;re firing, after a quick google I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiRaP8qxqa4">this video demonstrating it</a> in terms of long-range shooting (note - I haven&#39;t watched the whole thing, just skimmed it).</p>

<p>I suppose that all of this information could all be faked, and all its providers part of the conspiracy, but it would have to include a significant population of the entire earth. Entire industries rely on the accuracy of tide tables, trade wind patterns, etc. Again, I wish I could demonstrate the math myself but it&#39;s still beyond my current level of understanding.</p>

<p>I spent Halloween afternoon driving around, trying to find a Princess Sofia costume in my toddler&#39;s size. In the end we went with a size bigger and used safety pins, but by then it was a bit late so trick-or-treating wasn&#39;t too long. Since keeping a bag of candy in a house with a toddler is akin to storing plutonium in the living room, I&#39;m trying to figure out how to quietly get rid of it without dying of diabetes in the process, haha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s also been a long time for me since I took physics - so to be fair - all your math is a little hard for be to follow and I just look at the beginning and end and see if the conclusions sound reasonable to me. </p>

<p>don&#39;t neglect your toddler or get fired, not for flat vs ball earth math!! :) my feeling is flat or ball - the life we are living while on this earth is still the biggest priority. also don&#39;t eat all the candy. never eat all the candy. :) Somebody gave me some chocolate and then I just handed it to the next people I saw - they were grown men not in costume, I was like here have some candy, he was like trick or treat - thanks. and I was like done! halloween! :) </p>

<p>to be honest I do know a physics expert - and I had him read your math for me on previous posts (he&#39;s the one who caught the radius error) but after a few months of our own debate he now thinks the earth is flat too. at first he was like -- no non o non /jnoonnonoo. but now he&#39;s a believer. </p>

<p>there&#39;s also this physics guy from the internet, who I do not know at all - but i like his videos:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh9YulmnqJI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh9YulmnqJI</a></p>

<p>there are also videos of navy missile instructors explaining that they never account for coriolis effect/ and maps for trade routes that actually show all ships predominately follow what would be the shortest routes if the earth were flat - but what look like quite convoluted routes on a globe. </p>

<p>anyway - I do think there is a big conspiracy to keep it hidden, but i also think interestingly it&#39;s not that hard to keep it hidden since the globe model works so well to explain what is happening - it just isn&#39;t what is happening. imo. </p>

<p>anyway, I am super at peace not agreeing what the shape of the earth is. </p>

<p>it&#39;s been nice chatting with you!!! I wish you and your toddler princess the best :) </p>

<p>tides are really interesting - and I actually don&#39;t think the flat earth model has come up with a perfect explanation for them, but I think even more significantly the globe model explanation for them does not make sense. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well this depends on whether or not you understand the globe model. </p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to explain it, if you want. But during this explanation it becomes obvious that tides are impossible on a flat earth:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>personally I wonder if the flat earth doesn&#39;t have a slight wiggle - and  this tiny back and forth tilt is cumulative for the giant amount of water in the oceans - so its sloshing the oceans from side to side throughout the day with this very very slight wobble. &amp; maybe it also doesn&#39;t even have to be a wobble - since heat is motion - the presence of the sun on one side and then the other - could possibly create enough variance - from warm/expanding to cool/condencing - to create this sloshing. - but I haven&#39;t seen anybody else with that theory that&#39;s just my person thought. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well; then you raise assertions that have no evidence, logic; facts or reasoning to support them</p>

<p>There is no evidence for anything you just stated and no evidence as to what energy causes the wobble or why its presence isn&#39;t felt on land rtc...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but -- even if it can&#39;t be explained with certainty otherwise yet - </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it can and has been explained</p>

<p>I&#39;ll lay another challenge for you, since you can&#39;t explain tides:</p>

<p>Explain how a lunar eclipse is consistent with a flat earth </p>

<blockquote>
<p>here is why I think it is decidedly not explained with the globe model: the moons gravity is supposed to be counter acting the earth&#39;s gravity to create tides. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not exactly</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how does this make sense via the rules of physics? force never gets separately applied to water than to solid matter. all matter feels the same force applied and all force is like an arithmetic problem - counter forces do not both act - the lesser is subtracted from the greater - and the force is quantifiable. if you consider water is the only thing supposedly effected by the moons&#39; pull - why is dust - clouds, the hair on our head -- never effected by the same pull. water is actually quite dense - there is so much less dense material that should be demonstrating the pull of the moon&#39;s gravity also - if in fact the moon&#39;s gravity is what is &quot;pulling the oceans&quot; -- we should all be leaning a little in the directions of the tides ourselves - after all - we are mostly water. but tis is not the case, we do not feel the same force. so the explanation seems very flawed to me. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah: as I stated above, you think it doesn&#39;t make sense because you don&#39;t understand it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you an explanation, tell me if you understand it:</p>

<p>The way we know whether or not a star is being orbited by planets is by observing it&#39;s motion. Hence if a star is wobbling in its rotation, it&#39;s pulling on an object that is also pulling back.</p>

<p>Same thing happens with the moon. When the earth pulls on the moon, the moon pulls back. This causes the earth to: you guessed it, wobble </p>

<p>Here are a few links to explain it more: <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/tide-cause.htm">http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/tide-cause.htm</a></p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s one area is done, tides.
Globe earth can explain tides, flat earth can&#39;t</p>

<p>Let&#39;s move onto: lunar eclipse </p>

I can imagine - maybe you don&#39;t notice this traveling in a car, although I actually think you would notice a difference in traveling north south vs east west , but I for sure can&#39;t see that you would&#39;t notice a 800 mile cumulative acceleration over the course of a say ~10 hour  airplane ride. that is a huge shift. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fly almost every week for work, so I am quite familiar with the feeling. You feel the acceleration most at takeoff, as that is when it is greatest. Going from 0 to 800mph over 10 hours is an acceleration of less than .01 m/s, which is about .001 G. That means it&#39;s less than a tenth of a percent of normal gravity, which over that period of time would be just about imperceptible. </p>

<p>To put it in perspective, the acceleration you feel in a jet taking off is somewhere between .2 and .4 Gs of additional force. That&#39;s 20 to 40 times the minimal acceleration we are talking about here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>hm, it&#39;s true - it&#39;s not making sense to me. because I know that acceleration is cumulative. speed is continual over time - but acceleration is constant increase. </p>

<p>so say for the first 20 mins you don&#39;t notice much, but there is going to be a moment - whah - from the cumulative acceleration - you are moving a lot faster than you were a little while ago. and then it just keeps adding up. there is no way to escape registering the change. - because at some point you must process the cumulative shift. </p>

<p>can you think of an example in life (not world travel) where you do not process total big speed increase due to slow rate of getting there? I can&#39;t think of an example of that - if you can offer me one it might help me to understand/imagine what you are saying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re looking at this the wrong way. Your acceleration doesn&#39;t increase - it&#39;s your speed that does, at a very slow rate. 
The acceleration stays the approximately the same. The whole reason you don&#39;t notice it is because the acceleration is steady. Would you notice the force of acceleration in a car if you were accelerating in a car at a steady .02MPH? That&#39;s the car equivalent of the acceleration we are talking about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In total. Acceleration is a constant, so you get 4 ounces added to your &quot;weight&quot; when the .001G acceleration starts, and the weight would go away when the acceleration stopped. </p>

<p>For example, you start at rest. Then, after one second you&#39;re traveling .02mph, and after two seconds you&#39;re traveling .04 mph and so on every second for the 10 hours it supposedly takes you to gain the additional 800 mph of momentum as you travel from the pole to the equator.

I personally find it interesting, like a mystery, that&#39;s my mo. </p>

<p>as for the 2d vs 3d -- consider - there are a lot of people who wonder if the moon and planets are projections on a dome like surface. it is true we could get the appearance of rotation - from an optical phenemon - instead of from a sphere above us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two people, in opposite hemispheres, set up a large pool.  They have a hypothesis that the pool will drain a certain direction.  However, they know that the force that would cause the pool to drain in that particular direction is small, and easily overridden by other forces.</p>

<p>To start, they fill the pool, such that it starts with a current in the opposite direction.  This means that, should the pool drain in the opposite direction, it must have been from the Coriolis effect.</p>

<p>They then set up their pools in sheltered areas, to prevent as many outside forces at possible for inducing currents.  They also let the pool sit for a day, to allow any energy from the currents of the pool to dissipate.  After waiting a day, they open a valve at the bottom of the pool (on the underside, so they never have to touch the water).  Using food coloring, they add several drops of dye to the pool to better observe the water&#39;s movement.</p>

<p>Both pools move exactly as predicted.  The ability to make accurate predictions is the key to accepting any proposed model.  What&#39;s more, it is easily repeatable.  Anyone with the inclination can follow the same steps themselves, and see if the results are re-created.  That is why I think these videos offer strong evidence.</p>

<p>I think what really matters are evidence, facts, logic and reasoning:</p>

<p>tides are really interesting - and I actually don&#39;t think the flat earth model has come up with a perfect explanation for them, but I think even more significantly the globe model explanation for them does not make sense. </p>

<p>Well this depends on whether or not you understand the globe model. </p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to explain it, if you want. But during this explanation it becomes obvious that tides are impossible on a flat earth:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>personally I wonder if the flat earth doesn&#39;t have a slight wiggle - and  this tiny back and forth tilt is cumulative for the giant amount of water in the oceans - so its sloshing the oceans from side to side throughout the day with this very very slight wobble. &amp; maybe it also doesn&#39;t even have to be a wobble - since heat is motion - the presence of the sun on one side and then the other - could possibly create enough variance - from warm/expanding to cool/condencing - to create this sloshing. - but I haven&#39;t seen anybody else with that theory that&#39;s just my person thought. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well; then you raise assertions that have no evidence, logic; facts or reasoning to support them</p>

<p>There is no evidence for anything you just stated and no evidence as to what energy causes the wobble or why its presence isn&#39;t felt on land rtc...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but -- even if it can&#39;t be explained with certainty otherwise yet - </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it can and has been explained</p>

<p>I&#39;ll lay another challenge for you, since you can&#39;t explain tides:</p>

<p>Explain how a lunar eclipse is consistent with a flat earth </p>

<blockquote>
<p>here is why I think it is decidedly not explained with the globe model: the moons gravity is supposed to be counter acting the earth&#39;s gravity to create tides. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not exactly</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how does this make sense via the rules of physics? force never gets separately applied to water than to solid matter. all matter feels the same force applied and all force is like an arithmetic problem - counter forces do not both act - the lesser is subtracted from the greater - and the force is quantifiable. if you consider water is the only thing supposedly effected by the moons&#39; pull - why is dust - clouds, the hair on our head -- never effected by the same pull. water is actually quite dense - there is so much less dense material that should be demonstrating the pull of the moon&#39;s gravity also - if in fact the moon&#39;s gravity is what is &quot;pulling the oceans&quot; -- we should all be leaning a little in the directions of the tides ourselves - after all - we are mostly water. but tis is not the case, we do not feel the same force. so the explanation seems very flawed to me. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah: as I stated above, you think it doesn&#39;t make sense because you don&#39;t understand it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you an explanation, tell me if you understand it:</p>

<p>The way we know whether or not a star is being orbited by planets is by observing it&#39;s motion. Hence if a star is wobbling in its rotation, it&#39;s pulling on an object that is also pulling back.</p>

<p>Same thing happens with the moon. When the earth pulls on the moon, the moon pulls back. This causes the earth to: you guessed it, wobble </p>

<p>Here are a few links to explain it more: <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/tide-cause.htm">http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/tide-cause.htm</a></p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s one area is done, tides.
Globe earth can explain tides, flat earth can&#39;t</p>

<p>Let&#39;s move onto: lunar eclipse </p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> Not a scientist, I just wanted to see if I can answer this question in a way that makes intuitive sense.</p>

<p><strong>Why don&#39;t we feel the Moon&#39;s gravity, if it can cause the tides?</strong></p>

<p>The gravitational pull of the moon actually <em>does</em> act on us, but it&#39;s so small that we&#39;d never notice it. Let&#39;s calculate the actual amount of force in terms of m/s<sup>2.</sup> I&#39;ve approximated some numbers just for simplicity&#39;s sake.</p>

<p>The Earth&#39;s gravity exerts a force of 9.8 m/s and has a radius of 6,370KM. If we were in a typical &quot;medium earth orbit&quot;, we&#39;d be about 20,000KM from the surface, or 26,370KM from Earth&#39;s center of gravity. Since gravity follows the square root law, that means we&#39;d experience about 1/16th the force of gravity at that particular orbit. Here&#39;s the actual formula:</p>

<pre><code>g1 / g2 = (r2 / r1)^2
</code></pre>

<p>Filling in the values (g2 being the force of gravity at 26,370KM):</p>

<pre><code>9.8 / g2 = (26370 / 6370)^2
</code></pre>

<p>Solving the right side of the equation gives us:</p>

<pre><code>9.8 / g2 = 17.13
</code></pre>

<p>And then solving for g2:</p>

<pre><code>g2 = 1.75 m/s
</code></pre>

<p>Does this still make sense so far?</p>

<p>Okay, now the moon, meanwhile, has a surface gravity of 1.6 m/s<sup>2,</sup> and a radius of 1080KM, and is approximately 240,000KM from Earth. We can use that same formula to plug in that distance and get the amount of force, in m/s<sup>2,</sup> the moon&#39;s gravity exerts on the surface:</p>

<pre><code>r1 = Distance from the moon&#39;s surface to it&#39;s center of mass (1080KM)

r2 = Distance from the Earth&#39;s surface to the moon&#39;s center of mass (241,080KM)

g1 = Force of the moon&#39;s gravity on the surface of the moon ( 1.6m/s^2 )

g2 = Force of the moon&#39;s gravity on the surface of the Earth
</code></pre>

<p>Plugging in those values gives us this:</p>

<pre><code>1.62 / g2 = (241080 / 1080)^2
</code></pre>

<p>So, solving the right side, just like last time:</p>

<pre><code>1.62 / g2 = 49828.16
</code></pre>

<p>And solving for g2:</p>

<pre><code>g2 = 0.0000325
</code></pre>

<p>So, at the surface of the Earth, the average force the moon&#39;s gravity exerts is about <strong>0.03%</strong> Earth&#39;s gravity. And the difference caused by the tides would be a tiny fraction of that since the total distance from the Earth&#39;s surface to the moon changes by 13,000KM (to find the difference do the same calculations as above but with 247,450 instead of 241,080 and subtract from the original).</p>

<p><strong>Part 2: Why can it create the tides if it&#39;s so weak compared to the Earth&#39;s gravity?</strong></p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, the reason comes down to a fairly obvious behavior of fluids to seek a state of equilibrium (someone else please correct me if I&#39;m using the wrong term here, I may be). This is why you can hold water in a glass sideways if you swing it around, why siphoning works, etc...water is attempting to find the equilibrium between the forces acting on it.</p>

<p>The force exerted by the moon, compared to the Earth, is incredibly tiny, but not zero. So the difference between high and low tide is also incredibly tiny, but not zero. Staring at it from the shore, it looks like a lot, but the average depth of the ocean is almost 4KM, something like 10 empire state buildings. It&#39;s a minuscule difference.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think I can possibly do the calculations for tide levels by hand, since fluid dynamics is insanely complex.</p>

<p>My god, this post was way, way longer than I originally intended it to be. I&#39;m going to go watch TV now.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> So after my post this afternoon, it got me curious about how tide levels are predicted and I looked some stuff up after dinner. I was right about calculating tide levels being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_tides#Laplace.27s_tidal_equations">way too f&#39;ing complex</a> for me to do by hand, but there are various organizations around the world that release Tide Tables or Tide Charts that predict future tide levels based on:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The position of the sun and moon (since the sun contributes to tides as well, just not as much as the moon)</p></li>
<li><p>Historical tide levels based on direct observation</p></li>
<li><p>The geography of the seafloor in the area</p></li>
<li><p>The predicted atmospheric conditions at the time (I&#39;m assuming barometric pressure, since low pressure zones are what creates hurricane storm surges)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Since this is new information to me, I&#39;ll have to read and digest it before I can try and come up with a good summary of it. I&#39;ll try and get back to you in the near future.</p>
