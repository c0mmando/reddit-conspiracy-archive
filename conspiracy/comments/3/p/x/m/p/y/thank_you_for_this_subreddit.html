It really started for me when I read about voting machines possibly being rigged in the 2012 election.  I applaud all of the posters here for trying to get through the bullshit that we are being fed by the media and government agencies.  I know I am not the only one to have their eyes opened and hopefully more and more people will come to their senses through the efforts of the people here. Keep fighting the good fight. </p>

To make you feel like a very small minority, and to push you to just give in and join the herd.  Our herd is growing with every day that passes.  It&#39;s only a matter of time before their game is over for good.  This is why they are behaving so aggressively.

<p>At some point, they will stop calling it a conspiracy and face the reality that it&#39;s by-and-large &quot;alternative history&quot; verified as factual.</p>

<p>Also, they&#39;ll eventually discover that there&#39;s no such thing as tinfoil, there never was--that it&#39;s been aluminum all this time, and surprisingly, it <em>does in fact block electromagnetic radiation</em>.</p>
