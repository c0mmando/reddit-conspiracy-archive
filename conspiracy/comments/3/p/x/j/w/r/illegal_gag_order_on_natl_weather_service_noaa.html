        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;The power structure is beginning to panic as the public wakes up to the criminal climate engineering insanity. The growing police state is completely out of control and becoming unimaginably blatant with their actions. In recent weeks Washington has placed &quot;gag orders&quot; on the following agency employees, &quot;The National Weather Service&quot;, the &quot;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&quot;, and the &quot;US Department of Commerce&quot;. This is a massive red flag that should trigger alarm bells everywhere. </p>

<p>Bill Hopkins, the executive vice president for the National Weather Service employees organization (NWSEO) said this:</p>

<p>“As a taxpayer, I find it highly disturbing that a government agency continues to push gag orders to hide how they operate. This is the work of the American government, owned by the American public, and should be open to the American public.”</p>

<p>Jeff Ruch, the executive director &quot;PEER&quot; (Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility) said this about the &quot;gag orders&quot;.</p>

<p>“The National Weather Service is about the last place where national security-style secrecy rules need to be enforced,” Ruch noted that the broad scope of the gag orders put much of what goes on inside the agency under wraps.  “Everyone is free to talk about the weather except for the people working inside the National Weather Service. Go figure.”</p>

<p>Some time ago I personally spoke to an NOAA scientist that said &quot;we all know it is going on (climate engineering) but we are afraid to speak out, we have no first amendment protection&quot;. The new &quot;gag order&quot; is a further muzzling of the NWS and NOAA. It is likely there are many in the National Weather Service and NOAA that have had enough of lying about what is really going on in our skies.&quot;</p>

<p>What do you know about <a href="https://youtu.be/2S_qCV8kFPo">geoengineering</a>? I <a href="https://youtu.be/7_M2tOQyTFY">posted this video</a> a bit back, and if you look at Dane Wigington&#39;s channel, he has <a href="https://youtu.be/daGuPLXVunQ">numerous experts</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/RE-SttQah9o">talking about</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/SSi9vFo7bk4">this very subject</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/_E4os3TMHhg">what they have to say</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/ekUhYkK7wc4">is important</a>. The current geoengineering projects seem to be putting compounds filled with metal particulates (aluminum, strontium, and barium are the most prominent ones that have been found in water and soil tests) into our atmosphere.   <a href="http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/links-to-geoengineering-patents/">Here are a list of patents relating to geoengineering</a> (<a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US7645326">this patent in particular is very interesting</a>).</p>

We must understand that our government is <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/weather-warfare-beware-the-us-military-s-experiments-with-climatic-warfare/7561">currently quite able</a> to <a href="https://youtu.be/l0z7JOxQaO0">control</a> the <a href="http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/air-force-bombshell-admits-they-can-control-weather-haarp/">weather</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Others [terrorists] are engaging even in an eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves… So there are plenty of ingenious minds out there that are at work finding ways in which they can wreak terror upon other nations…It&#39;s real, and that&#39;s the reason why we have to intensify our [counterterrorism] efforts. <a href="http://www.cheniere.org/correspondence/022501.htm">Source</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>As far as <a href="https://youtu.be/4Ew05sRDAcU?t=17m15s">climate change goes</a> (the whole video is worthwhile, but I linked the most pertinent part), it is apparent that what we as human beings <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radiation_management#Cloud_seeding">are doing</a> on this planet is affecting the way the earth behaves. Perhaps they are geoengineering for some sort of good, but it is seemingly affecting peoples&#39; health and is very concerning to others, including myself as I have chronic health problems that have only gotten worse as the years go on (I&#39;m only 26). More than anything, it is my belief that this issue is the number one most dire situation that needs to be dealt with concerning government corruption as it is affecting <em>every single one of us</em> due to it being the <em>air we breathe every day.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is causing chronic health problems. how many people do <em>you</em> know with some kind of allergy? have you noticed that it&#39;s getting worse? i don&#39;t have allergies, however, at times i may get a &#39;cough&#39; when i&#39;m outside, also noticed on a nice warm day in the car, suddenly my passenger &amp; i both realize how &quot;tired&quot; we felt,  i started yawing, wth? the tiredness did go away but i thought it strange, that we both experienced this at the same time.</p>

<p>edit: i really believe that messing with nature has only made it worse; it would make sense to stop putting chemicals in the environment &amp; allowing the earth to &#39;heal&#39;, as i&#39;m sure <em>mother earth</em> is tired as hell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed with all of that. I am experiencing excessive fatigue as of late (I have fibromyalgia syndrome, but this is much worse than usual), and just today, the spraying was undeniable and extensive. I had to be out for a physical therapy appointment, and once I got home, I went to lay down for a small nap and didn&#39;t wake up for 6 hours. My chest has also felt extremely tight for years now, and I never knew why...I have asthma and have had it since I was young, but this is a <em>different</em> feeling. People are getting sicker, and the weather is getting more volatile...Mother Earth is trying to fix itself, but we are just not letting her. It makes me irrationally angry sometimes. Thank you for your input on this.</p>
