       No one will admit it out in public, the majority of people will never know. And if you think that Libyan regression is bad, you should have seen Syria before and after the civil war. Turned from developed country to stone age in three years.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the months leading up to the UN resolution that allowed the US and its allies to send troops into Libya, Muammar al-Gaddafi was openly advocating the creation of a new currency that would rival the United States dollar and the Euro. Gaddafi called upon African and Muslim nations to join an alliance that would make this new currency, the gold dinar, their primary form of money and foreign exchange. They would sell oil and other resources to the US and the rest of the world only for gold dinars. Along with the uprising in Libya, international news channels on August/September 2011 brought several stories about Muammar Gaddafi's introduction of golden dinar[6] within his "gold-for-oil plan" [7] to possibly trade Libya oil on international markets.

       This was the PRIMARY real reason he was removed. Creating a sound money supply that competed with the west is absolutely unacceptable. He was also gonna start financing loans to African Nations that weren't outrageous like current world bank/IMF extortion rackets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trick is always the same in the third world:
1. Give a third world nation a loan they cannot afford. 
2. All the loan money goes to select corrupt officials, and to benefit western corps in the country. 
3. Country inevitably defaults, then the IMF and World Bank force them to hand over land, resource rights, etc etc. 
4. Repeat.

       Agreed. Even more so than the typical economic hit man scheme, Libya creating another currency could have upset the the petrodollar system, whereby all oil sold by KSA (and maybe others) is required to be denominated in US dollars.

       I remember reading one of his popular speeches, and thinking, man this guy doesn't sound at all like what the media is making him out to be like, it sounded like he loved his country and people. But then again that's the tune of all politicians, and then they do the opposite, at least a good majority of them. 
But I have the feeling the same thing is being done to Assad now as they did to gaddafi then.

       What we have to do is use this lesson to not fall for further propaganda where a leader of a country or its government is being harshly criticized all the time. Especially the ones in the Middle East. I'm specifically talking about Turkey and Erdogan here. I see a lot of people trash-talking Erdogan around the internet and I wonder to myself.. do they not see that they are busy trying to destabilize the whole region? Or do they purposely ignoring it? We saw what happened to Saddam Hussein and Muammar Ghadaffi, both powerful leaders who's credibility were utterly destroyed in the media and in people's minds because of it. And then what happened? They were both executed and their countries turned into chaos and corruption. Now we look back and see how it was all part of an agenda. How can you not take your lesson from these events and think forward and realize that the same thing, is being done to countries like Iran and Turkey?

 This isn't capitalism vs socialism. This is a monarchy.
