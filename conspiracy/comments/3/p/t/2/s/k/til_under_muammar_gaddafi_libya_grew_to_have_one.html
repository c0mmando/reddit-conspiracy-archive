<p>The following are quoted from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/world/africa/qaddafi-killed-as-hometown-falls-to-libyan-rebels.html">NYTimes article</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Life expectancy, which averaged 51 years in 1969, is now over 74. [in 2009, life expectancy in Libya 77.3; in US 78.1; <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/world/statistics/life-expectancy-country-2009.html">source</a>]</p></li>
<li><p>Literacy leapt to 88 percent. </p></li>
<li><p>Per capita annual income grew to above $12,000 in recent years, though the figure is markedly lower than that found in many oil-rich countries. [5th highest in all Africa. wiki african gdp 2010:    &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita%22">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita&quot;</a>]</p></li>
<li><p>Colonel Qaddafi was a 27-year-old junior officer when he led the bloodless coup that deposed Libya’s monarch in 1969. </p></li>
<li><p>Colonel Qaddafi also introduced Orwellian revolutionary committees in every neighborhood to purge the country of the ideologically unsound, calling it “people power.” </p></li>
<li><p>Colonel Qaddafi said women were not equal to men, but he exhibited them as a symbol of the success of the Libyan revolution. [Women were likely to wear Western-style clothing. Seen driving, shopping, or travelling without husbands or male companions. Child brides were banned, minimum legal age to marry placed at 18. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Libya">wiki womens rights libya</a>]</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Just food for thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the months leading up to the UN resolution that allowed the US and its allies to send troops into Libya, Muammar al-Gaddafi was openly advocating the creation of a new currency that would rival the United States dollar and the Euro. Gaddafi called upon African and Muslim nations to join an alliance that would make this new currency, the gold dinar, their primary form of money and foreign exchange. They would sell oil and other resources to the US and the rest of the world only for gold dinars. Along with the uprising in Libya, international news channels on August/September 2011 brought several stories about Muammar Gaddafi&#39;s introduction of golden dinar[6] within his &quot;gold-for-oil plan&quot; [7] to possibly trade Libya oil on international markets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was the PRIMARY real reason he was removed. Creating a sound money supply that competed with the west is absolutely unacceptable. He was also gonna start financing loans to African Nations that weren&#39;t outrageous like current world bank/IMF extortion rackets. </p>

<p>The trick is always the same in the third world:
1. Give a third world nation a loan they cannot afford. 
2. All the loan money goes to select corrupt officials, and to benefit western corps in the country. 
3. Country inevitably defaults, then the IMF and World Bank force them to hand over land, resource rights, etc etc. 
4. Repeat. </p>

<p>Everyone should read about economic hit men. </p>

But then again that&#39;s the tune of all politicians, and then they do the opposite, at least a good majority of them. 
But I have the feeling the same thing is being done to Assad now as they did to gaddafi then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What we have to do is use this lesson to not fall for further propaganda where a leader of a country or its government is being harshly criticized all the time. Especially the ones in the Middle East. I&#39;m specifically talking about Turkey and Erdogan here. I see a lot of people trash-talking Erdogan around the internet and I wonder to myself.. do they not see that they are busy trying to destabilize the whole region? Or do they purposely ignoring it? We saw what happened to Saddam Hussein and Muammar Ghadaffi, both powerful leaders who&#39;s credibility were utterly destroyed in the media and in people&#39;s minds because of it. And then what happened? They were both executed and their countries turned into chaos and corruption. Now we look back and see how it was all part of an agenda. How can you not take your lesson from these events and think forward and realize that the same thing, is being done to countries like Iran and Turkey?</p>
