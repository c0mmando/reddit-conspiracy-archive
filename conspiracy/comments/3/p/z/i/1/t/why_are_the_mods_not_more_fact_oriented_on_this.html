<p>In the example of 9/11, I&#39;d want to know what EXACTLY happened to the towers, where the thermite was placed, rather than believing that 9/11 was conducted by terrorists, because there is no scientific EVIDENCE OR FACT behind the official story, but there is evidence pointing otherwise. </p>

<p>I am personally skeptical about 99.99% of the stuff that gets posted here but how could a mod properly call BS on these subjects when the people who post seem to be so convinced that they are true, and they often come packed with a mountain of counter-arguments and pseudo-science to help back up their position.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like Art Bell and his position that he will never turn away callers no matter how outlandish they might seem.. He just does his best to keep the ship floating and for the sake of entertainment he has no desire to try and steer it or dictate where it&#39;s going.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I definitely agree with that, I suppose it&#39;s hard, it&#39;s just wild how many people can be on board for something ie Engineers for 9/11 in finding information and seeking genuine truth, and then you&#39;e just got groups intent on spooking eachother with sensational nonsense and fish stories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because you aren&#39;t interested in specific content doesn&#39;t mean this can&#39;t be a meeting place for individuals seeking that content.</p>

<p>It seems kind of egotistical to say that your specific interests are more valid than another individuals. Especially when both of you discuss your content in a forum designated for fringe discussions.</p>

<p>As much as I personally do not like certain subjects being discussed on this forum I also believe that censoring specific subjects is a slippery slope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I apologize if it seems that way, I don&#39;t mean things relevant to me, I just mean current events in politics or relevant to things currently. </p>

<p>The UFO thing is a small example, and hardly the issue, it&#39;s when people bring in alternative media with quotes and information that is essentially just some guys&#39; blog. This sub is for CONSPIRACY as a whole, but that doesn&#39;t mean that we can&#39;t employ a scientific level of scrutiny with the information that gets posted here.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just bitching, it&#39;s just I hate wasting my time with some posts. You realize what you&#39;re reading is bullshit and then you question the authors&#39; motives, like why would some fully functioning adult get off to making up some political jargon for viewership? It&#39;s like making a fetish of politics, it&#39;s so cancerous. </p>

<p>And why would the guy who read it in turn take it as fact and post it here, I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just baffling to me, I&#39;m sorry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I just hoped the community would be more interested in finding answers to things. It seems as though all of you are more intent on turning at your own, and picking your own fantasy story to accept. I can&#39;t tell if I am not conveying my point accurately, or if there is just a lot of unnecessary bullheadedness going on. </p>

<p>In the example of 9/11, I&#39;d want to know what EXACTLY happened to the towers, where the thermite was placed, rather than believing that 9/11 was conducted by terrorists, because there is no scientific EVIDENCE OR FACT behind the official story, but there is evidence pointing otherwise. </p>
