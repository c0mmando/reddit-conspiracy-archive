       WTC 7 was destroyed by debris. You really seem to be underestimating how tall the world trade center was,The debris spread far. And is it really that far fetched to think that having burning debris falling on your roof would probably start a bit of a fire?

       That's not what NIST and the US government reported. They called it "thermal expansion".
      </p>
      <p>
       Asymmetric damage (your debris argument) doesn't cause symmetric collapse, as happened with WTC7.  The government spent 7 years trying to come up with an explanation and failed. The data used in the models is "classified" because their explanation is bullshit.

       NIST and the US govt. say that fire alone brought the building down.

       So let me recap this thread for you:
1- Ask to be proven something about a controversial topic.
2- Insult the persons trying to inform you.
3- refuse to comment on and/or even look at requested evidence.
4- loose interest in the topic and change the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you are no troll you say? well this surely doesn't make you look very good.

       9/11 does matter for at least one reason: it's been the excuse used to turn the US into a police state. It's also a lesson in how a tiny, elite  group can lie to tens of millions of people and those tens of millions will believe it out of fear and ignorance.

       Well..Yeah. Osama admitted that the 9/11 attacks were to put the US into constant war so that it eventually bankrupted itself. The only reason this war is still going is because of fear created by the attacks and also because the US wants oil.

       I am quick to assume you are a troll because of your close minded reluctance to examine the fact poking you in the eye BEFORE you go into a childish name calling rant.

       [edit] and for the record, I dont even disagree with you, there WOULD be debris and fire, but it is scientifically known and generally understood that fire doesn't make building collapse the way it did on that day. There is a whole association of architects and engineer asking for an investigation. Like I said earlier do your research.

       I'm not asking for proof that it didn't happen. I'm saying that a plane flew into a building wich caused the building to blow up. I don't see why you have to inject explosives and shit. You'd think the giant commercial airliner flying into the side of a building would be enough to blow it up. Oh,And you're asking for proof that the plane flew into the building? That's..Odd.

       No, I'm simply stating that you gave a completely outrageous demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'm make this statement of something I saw on the news, now prove me wrong". You're only repeating something else you heard someone else say. Give it a little bit more effort and maybe you'll get a little bore attention instead of being tossed out like some jackass you just made yourself out to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I never said one way or another my specific train of thought about 9/11. You're twisting words around to suit your desires or wants. Which is also why this post wouldn't  even go anywhere.

       So, that was long. In short, NEADS had 3 minutes to respond to flight 77 prior to it crashing into the Pentagon. This is due to the confusion of the unfolding events and a very incomplete picture shared in fragments between multiple FAA locations and levels of authority, poor communication between the FAA and NEADS and the inability to rapidly understand and respond to the scope and type of threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The military is geared primarily towards external threats by other nations. It is ready and waiting for missile strikes, incoming aircraft, submarines, etc. It is not meant for domestic counter-terrorism, and while the Air Force is included in hijacking response plans, prior to 9/11 that meant tailing a hijacked aircraft from 5 miles back as it flew peacefully to its destined airport. Additionally, following the end of the Cold War, the AF's alert and response capabilities were diminished. On 9/11 there were only 2 rapid response fighters in the region, which were sent to intercept flight 11 and stayed in a holding pattern off of Long Island.

       Very weak arguments.

       By 9:03, it was known that 77 had its transponder turned off, and that two more planes had already crashed into twin towers.

       Now add In tat there is another official backstory, that there was concidentally a drill of the exact same scenario going on, and they thought this was the drill.  Well, which implausible official explanation is it?

       It was generally known that flight 175 had crashed at 9:03, however NEADS didn't know until 9:08. It was known by the FAA that flight 77 was missing sometime prior to 9:08. However the specific FAA location responsible for tracking 77 was not aware of the hijackings of 11 &amp; 175 and their use as suicide weapons. Consequently they treated it as a possible crash, wasted precious minutes searching for it in the wrong direction, and failed to give NEADS adequate warning. What warning was given was given too late, and was given to NEADS, which is based out of Rome, NY, and to the Secret Service. The Pentagon was not informed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because information is available doesn't mean that it immediately permeates throughout an organization or that it reaches the right people. When dealing with multiple layers of bureaucracy and multiple bureaucracies, actually paying attention to what was known, by who, and when matters. When dealing with an unfolding situation of indeterminate nature and scope, errors quickly accumulate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should the Pentagon have been informed and should they have scrambled fighters in their defense? Absolutely. However the Pentagon was not directly responsible for managing the situation, and there doesn't seem to have been anyone who suspected it as a possible target. Nor have I seen any indication that the Pentagon had air defences to activate. Without fighter protection it was just another building.

       This is incorrect. NORAD was running a multi-part series of exercises which included several hijacking scenarios. Planned for 9/11 was a Russian bomber attack over Alaska, as well as a hijacking exercise which was to take place ~1 hour after the actual hijacking's occurred. However that hijacking scenario involves asylum seekers heading for Cuba. On September 9th there was a scenario involving an attack on NYC with an airliner by blowing up the plane and raining debris down on the city. There were no hijacking exercises which match up with the events of 9/11.
