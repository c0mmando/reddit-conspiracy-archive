<p>For example washington post and politico and the dailybeast which are all pro clinton and jeb and all are doing it. Its gotten to be a huge problem because they are manipulating r/politics. They make the message they want to send be in the headline so it gets quoted directly on reddit r/politics and read by all  even if the evidence in the story itself is very faint. (usually they include a very unflattering photo chosen to make Trump or Sanders look ridiculous right nexto the redit headline.) </p>

<p>These news outlet employees are all active on reddit. Some of them are probably mods. And many of them work for the JEB and Hillary campaigns and have embedded themselves in reddit infrastructure. So they want the message to be negative things about Trump and Bernie so they do it through the article titles which must be quoted directly on r/politics. This is how mods and those pro wall street pro JEB And Hillary organizations are working reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are not writing directly to reddit. Sometimes when we narrow our own experience to a focal point we easily delude ourselves that the entire world shares the same focus. Reddit is a tiny drop in the pool of US opinion and the news orgs you cite have much greater readership than the small number who browse particular reddit subs.</p>

<p>They are, of course, choosing headlines purposefully, but let&#39;s keep it in perspective.</p>

<p>All the media is extremely aware of reddit and target it to get traffic to their websites.</p>

<p>Reddit is one of the largest referral feeders sites on the internet.if you dont know that then research it.</p>

<p>That is neither here nor there. This just means that people click on the link to go to the article. These are redditors - the same people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. If a vast majority of traffic finds the site through reddit, where you find it from has a huge impact on its meaning. This is even true from one sub to the next. Two subs could post the same article and headline and have two different connotations due to the general mindset of the average readers in that sub.</p>

<p>Hell, the reddit viewership is majority net denizens without social contact, and likely stuck almost exclusively on reddit. Hence the sound chamber that typifies the site.</p>
