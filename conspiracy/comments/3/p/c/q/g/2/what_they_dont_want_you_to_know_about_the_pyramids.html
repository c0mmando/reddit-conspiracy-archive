<hr/>

<p>Graham Hancock, Robert Bauval, and Nassim Haramein all present extensive evidence against the history we have been taught brainwashed with, and what those in power do NOT want you to ever know about! Did you know that pretty much EVERYTHING we have EVER been taught at school about The Pyramids is incorrect and wrong!?? Did you know, for instance, that not ONE mummy was found in any of the Pyramid’s? Did you know that, even in today’s modern age, with all our high tech machines and state of the art technology, there is no way we could ever reproduce even one of those amazingly beautiful structures. </p>

<p>Several leading researchers believe that the truth about the pyramids has been hidden away from us for thousands upon thousands years by those in power and control us. They believe we have ALL been lied to and that the history books need to be completely re-written!! In the below intriguing videos, Graham Hancock, Robert Bauval and Nassim Haramein present their extensive evidence to the world! Hancock’s explains how Egyptologists claim that the pyramids were built around the year 2500 B.C. but his own research proves that they may be much older and perhaps even 12,000 years old. And we’re still asking questions: “Who built these pyramids? Why is Orion’s Belt so significant in the alignment of The Great Pyramids? Might the creators be from another planet and does the alignment with the stars give us clues as to when they might return?” All questions that we ALL want to know more about, I think you will agree. Graham Hancock,Robert Bauval, and Nassim Haramein all present extensive evidence against the history we have been taught brainwashed with, and what those in power do NOT want you to ever know about! At some time in the very near future, our school textbooks will need to be completely rewritten in truth and complete honesty and not filled with propaganda, lies and agendas. Researchers such as Hancock, Haramein, Robert Bauval, Michael Cremo and others have exposed the truths that academia fails to explain.</p>

<p>One good example, is in Graham Hancock’s book, The Message of the Sphinx: A Quest for the Hidden Legacy of Mankind, he explains clearly exactly how Egyptologists claim that the pyramids were built around the year 2500 B.C. Hancock’s research exposes deep erosion patterns on the sides of the Sphinx that were caused by 1,000 years of heavy rain. The last time Egypt saw these types of ‘severe’ conditions was at the end of the last ice age, approximately 10,000-9,000 B.C.. This means that the Sphinx might be at the very least more than 12,000 years old (versus what we’ve been taught – only 4500 years). The Pyramids in my personal opinion were created from the influence of Higher Intelligent beings, perhaps not from this world or this Dimension…even with all of today’s leading technology we, the Human Race, STILL do not know how these magnificent structures from around the world come about!? (Doesn’t seem quite right to us guys here at U.I.P). There really is something mesmerizing about the Pyramids and even though you have the idiotic scum ISIS threatening to destroy them (this would cause violence around the world beyond belief!) </p>

<p>I am sure that we can all pretty much agree that these superb works of construction pickles all of our brains…..perhaps one day, whoever created these superb structures, they will appear and introduce themselves to the world! (here’s hoping!?). These are the questions we NEED the answers too: Who really built these pyramids? Why is Orion’s Belt so significant in the alignment of these pyramids? Are the pyramids some sort of time table of alignment for when the creators will return to this planet? Is the erosion on the side of the Sphinx a geological warning of a 12,500 year cycle of planetary cleansing? It is believed that Atlantis existed over 10,000 years ago.</p>

<p>Is it possible that some major event that led to the demise of Atlantis is responsible for the erosion patterns on the side of the the Sphinx? What we do know is that the history we have been taught is skewed ( via Ufointernationalproject.com ).</p>

<p>Why is Orion’s Belt so significant in the alignment of The Great Pyramids?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alnitak, the leftmost star in Orion&#39;s belt (as viewed from Earth) is about 750 ly away. Mintaka, the rightmost star is about 660 ly away. Alnilam, the middle star, is about 1300 ly away.</p>

<p>Why, then, would an alien civilization with the capability to travel 500-1000 light years leave an ambiguous &quot;clue&quot; that points to a two stars that exist half way to a third one?</p>

<p>The answer, of course, is that <em>if</em> the pyramids are aligned to represent the shape of Orion, it&#39;s because the ancient people that built the pyramids thought Orion was neat, not because space aliens told them to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did you know that, even in today’s modern age, with all our high tech machines and state of the art technology, there is no way we could ever reproduce even one of those amazingly beautiful structures. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this line drives me fucking crazy. We could build the pyramids with more precision today, using modern technology. It&#39;s completely retarded to suggest otherwise.</p>

<p>We have computer controlled cranes that can lift 7000 tons 180m in the air with insane precision. We have designed unfathomably complex machines (like the LHC) that make the so-called &quot;designs&quot; of the pyramids look like a stack of saltines.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give credit to the ancient peoples that neatly stacked a bunch of rocks together using technologies that were available to them, but the pyramids are nothing compared to capabilities of modern construction.</p>

<p>The only thing we lack today is the <em>political</em> power to build things like the pyramids. There is no technological hurdle.</p>
