    <div class="md"><p>a little anecdotal history.</p>

<p>fifteen to twenty or so years ago, there was a news snippet on BBC Radio Four, early one morning about multiple arrests surrounding child pornography and some website, British cops raided and seized the computers at some UK online porn site, got list of customers via their CC etc.</p>

<p>news article on that very early morning mentioned professions of arrested persons who were customers of said company, judges, police,lawyers etc etc, long list of claimed professions and trades of arrested peoples.</p>

<p>then the story died, no further follow ups.</p>

<p>MI5 and Special Branch had a new list of willing perps/chums who would do whatever they were told to avoid exposure and ruin.</p>

<p>and a second anecdote to illustrate the established corruption over there in the UK, the same early news show and story that never gets a follow up (same era), the one about the South/Central American drug cartel dude who had a TV setup in his Heathrow police station cell room, he needed a mains extension cord to power it, so they left the cell door open... he vanished from the cell/station/UK, no arrests for corruption or whatever at Heathrow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My favorite: &quot;they probably migrated the server and didn&#39;t do it right.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, when you Migrate a server, you&#39;re copying from one server to another, then after testing, deleting the contents of the old (really simplifying it here).</p>

<p>So, when you migrate, <em>you still have the data on the old server.</em></p>

<p>Well, you do until you delete it anyway. So for this fuck up to happen, they&#39;d need to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Have absolutely no RAID redundancy at all (does this <em>ever</em> happen on hosted space? Fuck no).</p></li>
<li><p>Transfer the data but really not transfer the data (not sure how that works).</p></li>
<li><p>Test absolutely nothing and delete everything, /noprompt.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Fitting a cancel through the eye of a needle has a higher probability.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually it was a software bug. Testimonies submitted through a Web Form were not saved properly -  and it was only data submitted between two particular dates about one or two weeks apart.  I&#39;m a software developer and this happens all too easy.  Not to mention that hosting services will do regular backups of critical data -  deleting it all and claiming it was an accident would be very difficult.  People have been asked to resubmit their testimonies. </p>

<p>This site is just jumping on the bandwagon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, so I am just pissed off about these pedo&#39;s getting away with their crap as anyone else can be, however that articles headline is misleading.  Read the article and you will see that &#39;the entire database&#39; was not deleted, but that a problem with the form submittal code on their site caused any information submitted during a roughly 2 week period to be lost before entered into the database.</p>
