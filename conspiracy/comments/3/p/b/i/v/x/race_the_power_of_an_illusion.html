<blockquote>
<p><em>The division of the world&#39;s peoples into distinct groups - &quot;red,&quot; &quot;black,&quot; &quot;white&quot; or &quot;yellow&quot; peoples - has became so deeply imbedded in our psyches, so widely accepted, many would promptly dismiss as crazy any suggestion of its falsity. Yet, that&#39;s exactly what this provocative, new three-hour series by California Newsreel claims. Race - The Power of an Illusion questions the very idea of race as biology, suggesting that a belief in race is no more sound than believing that the sun revolves around the earth.</em></p>

<p>OK, but you are just swapping out the term &quot;race&quot; for the term &quot;ethnicity.&quot;</p>

<p>You can also group ethnicities into larger groups. Now, hmm, what would we call those larger groups? Hmm, maybe &quot;race&quot; - oh wait. Nevermind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Race is an ignorant use of language from the 19th century. Ethnicity is an actual thing. They are not interchangeable terms.</p>

<p>Care to point out where it mentions skin tone?</p>

<p>An ethnic group or ethnicity is a socially defined category of people who identify with each other based on common ancestral, social, cultural or national experience.</p>

<p>...
Social conceptions and groupings of races vary over time, involving folk taxonomies that define essential types of individuals based on perceived traits. Scientists consider biological essentialism obsolete, and generally discourage racial explanations for collective differentiation in both physical and behavioral traits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL - I get it.</p>

<p>These guys know that claiming to be &quot;against racism&quot; is like the easiest way to get agreement and internet points. I mean, everybody is &quot;against racism&quot; so it&#39;s an easy way to get people to agree with you. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like being &quot;against cancer&quot; or being &quot;against hate&quot; or &quot;pro-rainbows and puppy dogs.&quot;</p>

<p>So, of course, the idiotic notion that the &quot;elite&quot; or whatever brainwashes people into &quot;racism&quot; is supposed to be an easy way to get populism points. The Official Bad Guys - really, the only people you are allowed to criticize, are these nefarious and shadowy &quot;elites&quot; that no one can really define.</p>

<p>So these invisible &quot;elites&quot; are supposedly brainwashing people to be &quot;racist&quot; and no one would ever argue otherwise, except maybe a RACIST.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, I spoiled the fun, assuming that you would actually have a real point to make. First, it&#39;s like &quot;there&#39;s no such thing as race&quot; but then it&#39;s like &quot;well maybe there is a such thing as race but don&#39;t be a RACIST&quot; and then it&#39;s like &quot;the elites have brainwashed you to believe race exists except it doesn&#39;t unless you&#39;re a racist then it does.&quot;</p>

<p>LOL. It&#39;s like arguing with 5 year olds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a trait that has been indoctrinated into the masses by decades (if not centuries) of divide and conquer strategies.  Your giving into the &quot;it&#39;s just a universal trait!&quot; thinking doesn&#39;t make what I just stated any less correct.</p>

<p>And even if it <em>were</em> some sort of &quot;universal trait&quot; (which, again, it&#39;s not), racism is <em>never</em> anything that must somehow necessarily result from acknowledging any such differences.</p>

The existence or acknowledgment of race in no way whatsoever means that one has to take any such differentiation and stratify it toward any sort of racist extreme.</p>

<p>Um, no. Even BABIES are &quot;racist.&quot; &quot;Racism&quot; is natural, it&#39;s normal, in fact, you even see &quot;racism&quot; in the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, you people just don&#39;t make a lick of sense. First, it&#39;s &quot;race isn&#39;t real.&quot; But then it is real, because of genetics. But wait, it&#39;s really just propaganda from &quot;the elite&quot; or whatever to &quot;divide&quot; groups of people that have NEVER even been united.</p>

<p>You know what I think? I think the reality is that YOU are the ones that have been indoctrinated. The reality is &quot;the elites&quot; do NOTHING but preach against &quot;racism,&quot; say &quot;racism is bad.&quot;</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is &quot;anti-racism&quot; is exactly what the elites/government/mass media pushes.</p>

<p>The exact OPPOSITE of what you people claim.</p>

<p>What planet are you people living on?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, no.  Actually babies are not “racist”.  Doesn’t matter how hard you want to try to continue rationalizing your own racist ideals, but the opposite is actually the case.</p>

<p>Reading the rest of what you posted, it’s <em>really</em> obvious that you’re simply not even thinking straight.  I don’t even know if you really have the capacity for it at this point - you seem so far gone off the deep end.</p>

<p>The really sad thing about all this is that you people who advocate racist ideologies are actually the very ones that contribute to the type of manipulation that ensure that YOU YOURSELVES remain manipulated and disadvantaged.  It’s like…you don’t even understand the deep irony of that.  smh</p>

<p>The extreme level of ignorance you show is pitiful and sad.  I can&#39;t even get angry at you.  I just shake my head in sadness for how ignorant some of you are.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t even seem to know what the word &quot;ignorant&quot; means. Hint: it doesn&#39;t mean &quot;someone who disagrees with me.&quot;</p>

<p>Really, try to be honest with yourself. Does the government promote &quot;racism&quot; or &quot;anti-racism?&quot;</p>

<p>Is it legal, or illegal, to discriminate racially in hiring?</p>

<p>Do public schools teach that racism is good, or bad?</p>

<p>So your idea that &quot;the elites&quot; or whoever &quot;brainwash people into racism&quot; is just plain wrong, now isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Really, try to be honest with yourself. You know I&#39;m right, you&#39;re just having cognitive dissonance because of your indoctrination.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>racism is never anything that must somehow necessarily result from acknowledging any such differences.</p>

<p>Eating being necessary, as but one example, in no way necessarily means that one somehow has to therefore become some sort of uncontrolled, compulsive glutton as a result. The existence or acknowledgment of race in no way whatsoever means that one has to take any such differentiation and stratify it toward any sort of racist extreme.</p>

<p>I understand that part of being on this &quot;planet of ignorance&quot; involves dealing with certain types that are just extremely closed minded and that&#39;s all there is to it.  It doesn&#39;t make your existence any less repugnant an abomination, however.</p>

<p>Can you even DEFINE &quot;racist extreme?&quot; First you say race doesn&#39;t exist. Then, you say it does. Make up your mind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>extremely closed minded</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, can you see how you are being extremely closed minded? Answer the question - do the &quot;elites&quot; teach &quot;racism&quot; or &quot;anti-racism?&quot;</p>

<p>You know the answer is that the government, the corporate media, the schools, big business, both political parties - ALL - ALL of them - are 100% united &quot;against racism.&quot;</p>

<p>But you are trying very hard to make the opposite case - which you know, if you were honest with yourself - is not true.</p>
