        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">48</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-10-17 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/PhilosopherofFreedom.html">PhilosopherofFreedom</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Warning: Use Ad-block before going to the link (&quot;bestreams.net&quot; sites; be ready to close pop-ups or find a different link to this episode)  </p>

<p>Bill Maher had 1 message to repeat over and over throughout the show: &quot;If you can&#39;t get the fish - EAT THE CHICKEN!&quot; - This is Bill&#39;s version of the &quot;Push the Agenda regardless of what the people want&quot;.  </p>

<p>CNN and other Media polls showed that &quot;people&quot; like Bernie -- yet the Establishment Media ran Headlines for the Debate stubbornly declaring: Hillary Clinton Wins!  Conveniently ignoring their own polls.  </p>

<p>The Establishment is pushing Hillary like a con-artist pushes members of a crowd to get in on the &quot;cup game&quot;.  </p>

<p>&quot;Sanders can&#39;t get elected - if you can&#39;t get the Fish, eat the chicken!&quot; At one point Bill said it with so much force he was out of breath and scowling at his own audience - there were a few reports that horns began surfacing from beneath his hair plugs.  (About 26:12-26:25 in the episode)</p>

<p><strong>Then at 27:40 of the video</strong>, one of the Bernie/Hillary Shill guests tried to explain that Bernie does have common ground with even some Tea Party type of Republicans:  </p>

<p>The War on Drugs<br/>
The Criminal Justice System (non-violent people in prison)<br/>
The &quot;crazy, out-of-control NSA Surveillance system...&quot;  </p>

<p>Then she said: &quot;Bernie Sanders said something quite radical: On Snowden he said he helped educate us, but he said let&#39;s ---&quot;  </p>

<p>The microphone cuts out - you can still see her mouth the word:<br/>
&quot;<strong>Abolish</strong>&quot;  </p>

<p>Suddenly the video is edited and moved forward to bill talking about Trump and Bernie on a different topic.  </p>

<p>I youtube&#39;d &quot;Bernie Sanders debate abolish&quot; and the first link is a TYT vid: &quot;Bernie Sanders wants to Abolish Private Prisons&quot;  --</p>

<p>I&#39;m going through Bernie&#39;s debate answers now listening for what he would &quot;abolish&quot; --  </p>

<p>Media motto: If we don&#39;t air it, if we don&#39;t say it -- it never happened.  </p>

<p>Does anyone question that Media &amp; Government have MERGED and today operate as a single entity ?  </p>

<p>The Government may have written a law whereby it allowed itself to Push Propaganda on The People --- But how can the News misrepresent itself to its consumers ?  Any small business that misrepresented itself or its product to its consumer would be subject to legal action.  </p>

<p>Mainstream Free Press is toast and now the TPP is taking aim at the Internet.  </p>

<p>Godspeed.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s well-known in Hollywood and Washington the two have fucked, repeatedly. Maybe not now, but in the past. </p>

<p>It was such an open secret that the stand-in characters for them in the book &quot;World War Z&quot; are actually fucking in the celebrity compound when it&#39;s breached by the zombies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fish/chicken thing was, to me, blatantly obvious shilling/priming the audience. Democrats aren&#39;t going to not vote just because Sanders isn&#39;t the nominee, and Bill knows that. He&#39;s trying to influence the viewer by implying that Bernie isn&#39;t going to get the nomination, trying to get people more comfortable with Robo-Cunt. Nobody aside from man-hating feminazis has any passion in support of Hillary. If the DNC tries to force Hillary as the nominee though, I&#39;m voting for Trump. Fuck the chicken instead of fish bullshit, it&#39;s more like &quot;if you can&#39;t get an edible meal, eat the dogshit and smile and don&#39;t you bitch about the taste, peasant&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve found links from different sites, different hosts and sources - i even found a subtitle file --- and even in the subtitles it cuts off. Here are frame numbers and timecodes:  </p>
