       Warning: Use Ad-block before going to the link ("bestreams.net" sites; be ready to close pop-ups or find a different link to this episode)
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill Maher had 1 message to repeat over and over throughout the show: "If you can't get the fish - EAT THE CHICKEN!" - This is Bill's version of the "Push the Agenda regardless of what the people want".
      </p>
      <p>
       CNN and other Media polls showed that "people" like Bernie -- yet the Establishment Media ran Headlines for the Debate stubbornly declaring: Hillary Clinton Wins!  Conveniently ignoring their own polls.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Establishment is pushing Hillary like a con-artist pushes members of a crowd to get in on the "cup game".
      </p>
      <p>
       "Sanders can't get elected - if you can't get the Fish, eat the chicken!" At one point Bill said it with so much force he was out of breath and scowling at his own audience - there were a few reports that horns began surfacing from beneath his hair plugs.  (About 26:12-26:25 in the episode)
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Then at 27:40 of the video
       </strong>
       , one of the Bernie/Hillary Shill guests tried to explain that Bernie does have common ground with even some Tea Party type of Republicans:
      </p>
      <p>
       The War on Drugs
       <br/>
       The Criminal Justice System (non-violent people in prison)
       <br/>
       The "crazy, out-of-control NSA Surveillance system..."
      </p>
      <p>
       Then she said: "Bernie Sanders said something quite radical: On Snowden he said he helped educate us, but he said let's ---"
      </p>
      <p>
       The microphone cuts out - you can still see her mouth the word:
       <br/>
       "
       <strong>
        Abolish
       </strong>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       Suddenly the video is edited and moved forward to bill talking about Trump and Bernie on a different topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I youtube'd "Bernie Sanders debate abolish" and the first link is a TYT vid: "Bernie Sanders wants to Abolish Private Prisons"  --
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going through Bernie's debate answers now listening for what he would "abolish" --
      </p>
      <p>
       Media motto: If we don't air it, if we don't say it -- it never happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone question that Media &amp; Government have MERGED and today operate as a single entity ?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Government may have written a law whereby it allowed itself to Push Propaganda on The People --- But how can the News misrepresent itself to its consumers ?  Any small business that misrepresented itself or its product to its consumer would be subject to legal action.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainstream Free Press is toast and now the TPP is taking aim at the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Godspeed.

       Bill maher is just the left wing version of Bill O'Reilly.  Full of opinion and short on facts.  I was done after he went off on the 9-11 truth movement.

       Maher left wing, lol. Has the compass been so skewed that he is considered left? He certainly does not come of as left for someone not from the US. Rather right wing to be honest. (not as batshit crazy rightwing as O'Reilly but few venture that far)

       It's well-known in Hollywood and Washington the two have fucked, repeatedly. Maybe not now, but in the past.

       The fish/chicken thing was, to me, blatantly obvious shilling/priming the audience. Democrats aren't going to not vote just because Sanders isn't the nominee, and Bill knows that. He's trying to influence the viewer by implying that Bernie isn't going to get the nomination, trying to get people more comfortable with Robo-Cunt. Nobody aside from man-hating feminazis has any passion in support of Hillary. If the DNC tries to force Hillary as the nominee though, I'm voting for Trump. Fuck the chicken instead of fish bullshit, it's more like "if you can't get an edible meal, eat the dogshit and smile and don't you bitch about the taste, peasant"

       I like how Bill Maher said he supported Sanders but Sanders could not answer the question given to him. Sander just keep repeating his slogan like a puppet on a string.
