        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why would you have to outlaw an idea?  </p>

<p>Yesterday I happened upon an hour long presentation by David Cole from the early 90s which details his travels to WW2 German &quot;death camps&quot; and presents his findings about if there is actually any hard evidence to support the &quot;Holocaust Theory&quot;, that Jews were targeted for annihilation and slaughtered en masse.  </p>

<p>Then I heard a very recent podcast interview with him where he explains that people hated him for sharing his evidence and opinions. Random people beat him up and eventually the Israeli Anti-Defamation League put out a $25,000 Hit on him.  He learned of it and agreed to go dark - to stop sharing his ideas and change his identity - he became David Stein for 10-15 years and worked in the Republican party until an angry girlfriend outted him as David Cole.  </p>

<p>This link takes you to the part of the podcast interview where he explains just how far the German Government is willing to go, using FORCE to silence an idea it says &quot;is not true.&quot;  For instance, if caught and brought to trial, the defendant <strong>CANNOT EVEN ARGUE</strong> that he is telling the truth and present evidence.  He only has 2 options:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Claim insanity or<br/></li>
<li>Confess and beg leniency from the dark-age-style Government.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>The Loch Ness Monster is fake.<br/>
Flying spaghetti Monster is fake.  </p>

<p>Odd that there are no laws for <em>other</em> fake ideas.  Only THIS idea that the Holocaust actually happened as western history books describe - for which there is not much, if any, hard evidence.  </p>

<p>Here is a more complete lead-up to his very interesting comparison between a Celebrity Murder Attempt &amp; a Citizen who DARES to share an unpopular opinion:  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying WW2 prison camps never happened...  </p>

<p>I&#39;m questioning the idea that the Germans thirsted for the blood of jews like movie vampires - and that they set up camps for the purpose of murder and they killed as many of them as they could - as quickly as they could.  THAT is the story of the Holocaust Theory - and that is what I think deserves an Intelligence-Squared style of debate -  </p>

<p>I want in-depth analysis from all sides.  </p>

<p>David Cole presents depth from a side that history books in the west SHUN outright and now certain governments OUTLAW the questioning of their version of history -- it&#39;s ludicrous and straight out of 1984.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thing is, the only way you can really dispute the Holocaust is by assuming an antisemitic mindset.  Unless you take it for granted that multiple generations of European Jews agreed to lie, to extract confessions through torture, to forge documents and physical evidence, etc., you can&#39;t really question the narrative.</p>
