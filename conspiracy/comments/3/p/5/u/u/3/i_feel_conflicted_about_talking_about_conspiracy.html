       Over the years I have read &amp; heard many theories.. I've checked into them and found facts that back them up too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really want to share them with people... But is it the right or smart thing to do...? (What I want more then anything is to do something about it)
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like if they are true... these are the people in charge of our government... is it really the right thing to tell other countries about these things by posting it on the internet... Is this the right way to go about making positive change...?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, my question is... should I just go ahead and share conspiracy theories willy nilly..... that I believe are backed up by facts... Could I get in trouble?
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone have experiences from sharing conspiracy theories? or is it no big deal to share this...
      </p>
      <p>
       p.s. I'm talking about conspiracy theories based in the U.S. &amp; England
      </p>
      <p>
       Also i'm talking about sharing anonymously on reddit/the internet....

       Imagine if more and more people would do this. Suddenly you would start hearing more and more stories of people having a guy at work who is a conspiracy theorist. If these keep piling up and up I believe at one point the stigma will keep getting weaker and more people may be convinced to look into conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is wishful thinking on my part but I'd like it if it would turn out this way. If more people would stop being scared of being singled out or being called names for having an interest in conspiracies it would get more normalized. But I recognize it's a challenging thing to do. I wish we can get at that point one day though.

       I agree... 
It just seems common sence to question things that effect our lives, and our family and friends lives.. It shouldn't be a negative thing to be concerned. And want to know the truth.

       I'm a college student and freely discuss a variety of subjects, including conspiracies, with my friends and some people I interned with.  There doesn't seem to be a social stigma in my experience.  Is this different with older generations?

       Yes i think there is a social stigma with older generations. I've always been interested in knowing the truth... but talking about it in social, especially professional, settings is usually frowned upon. Its a hit or a miss really.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do think more people are starting to see that time has changed. And we should take the time to find out facts. And question the intentions of our government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean just compare the speeches of great men like Martin Luther kings I have a dream speech, August 28, 1963. To speeches from leaders today. There intentions sound completely different.... There hearts do not sound like there in the right place. Everything now has an agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so completely obvious there's manipulation going on... people are more commonly questioning our government.

       I started a new job and I'm not bringing up the conspiracy talk anytime soon. All these guys do is talk Football, (remember the commercial "real men don't small talk.")
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like any news source shouldn't be taken seriously if they're not willing to call 9/11 an Inside Job. Anyone who's worldview doesn't involve a shadow government is hardly relate-able.

       I probably will ask the guys if they believe... after Football season

       For one, most of those other countries also know these things about US govt. Two, we must NEVER be afraid to talk Truth. The more people wake up and put pressure on govt the better chance we have that things may actually change for the better.

       Don't take away your own freedom of speech. You shouldn't hide behind the things you fear losing-- they are also worth sacrificing for, in order to have a world worth living in.

       I definitly agree with that. But I wish I knew the most positive way to go about making positive change. I don't think pointing yourself out by posting conspiracy theories is the right way to go about it. Our government needs to go back to it's roots. Back to what our country was based on. The people have become idiots as consumers to make corporate Giants money (who are leading this country).... positive change definitly needs to happen.... But how?

       I would say don't run your mouth about things you aren't pretty well educated about. A lot of people talk about this stuff to seem smarter than they are-- like they know something no one else does. Everyone hates that guy. I say work on yourself, your family, your immediate community... let things ripple outward.
       <br/>
       I wouldn't go around saying people are idiots. I know some very wise, very smart people who have some very naive beliefs. It's just that life is very busy and the rabbit hole is so time consuming that it's either a job or a hobby to fully understand it.
       <br/>
       I don't have any good solutions, though.

       Thanks, this is what I was wondering... But now I feel like it's a bad idea to post "conspiracy theories".... Do you think they could use this tactic if you're posting on reddit anonymously?

       Update: I didn't really know what to get out of this question. I guess I just wanted to get some opinions from like minded people... I think I got some good opinions. Thanks

       This smells like prime bait. The questions. So friendly and innocent. Just wanting a little advice..I'm afraid..hold me, internet. What should I do? Do you ever? Should I? Can I? 
Oh brother.
