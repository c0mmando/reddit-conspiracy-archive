And the document JEB SIGNED saying he thought a new Pearl Harbir Attack on the USA was needed for his group to acheive their world wide goals.</p>

<p>The Bush White House ignored even more warnings about September 11 than we thought, according to journalist Kurt Eichenwald, who has a column in the NYT and a new book out today.</p>

<p>We already knew about the presidential brief from Aug. 6, 2001 that was titled &quot;Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.‚Äù The White House has shown that this declassified document was primarily a history of Al Qaeda, not a warning of imminent attack.</p>

<p>But there were other briefings, some seen by Eichenwald, that did warn of an imminent attack.</p>

<p>On May 1 the CIA said that a terrorist group in the U.S. was planning an attack.</p>

<p>On June 22 it warned that this attack was &quot;imminent.&quot;</p>

<p>On June 29 the brief warned of near-term attacks with &quot;dramatic consequences&quot; including major casualties.</p>

<p>On July 1, the briefing said that the terrorist attack had been delayed but &quot;will occur soon.&quot;</p>

<p>On July 24, the president was told again that the attack had been delayed but would occur within months. </p>

<p>These and other similar warnings were ignored by the White House. The Neocons in charge insisted that the threat was instead a coordinated diversion meant to distract attention from Saddam Hussein, according to Eichenwald. This opinion frustrated the intelligence community, who saw the theory as totally illogical.</p>

<p>WARNINGS THAT THE DANGER WOULD COME FROM THE AIR</p>

<p>BRITAIN, WARNING #1: Al-Qaeda is planning to use aircraft in &quot;unconventional ways&quot;, &quot;possibly as flying bombs&quot;</p>

<p>1999 (C): MI6, the British intelligence agency, gives a secret report to liaison staff at the US embassy in London. The reports states that al-Qaeda has plans to use &quot;commercial aircraft&quot; in &quot;unconventional ways&quot;, &quot;possibly as flying bombs.&quot; [Sunday Times, 6/9/02]</p>

<p>BRITAIN, WARNING #3: An Al-Qaeda attack will involve multiple hijackings</p>

<p>Early August 2001 (C): Britain gives the US another warning about an al-Qaeda attack. The previous British warning (see July 16, 2001) was vague as to method, but this warning specifies multiple airplane hijackings. This warning is included in Bush&#39;s briefing on August 6. [Sunday Herald, 5/19/02]</p>

<p>CAYMAN ISLANDS, WARNING #2: Three al-Qaeda agents are part of a plot &quot;organizing a major terrorist act against the US via an airline or airlines&quot;</p>

<p>August 29, 2001: Three men from either Pakistan or Afghanistan living in the Cayman Islands are briefly arrested in June 2001 for discussing hijacking attacks in New York City (see June 4, 2001). On this day, a Cayman Islands radio station receives an unsigned letter claiming these same three men are agents of bin Laden. The anonymous author warns that they &quot;are organizing a major terrorist act against the US via an airline or airlines.&quot; The letter is forwarded to a Cayman government official but no action is taken until after 9/11 and it isn&#39;t known when the US is informed. Many criminals and/or businesses use the Cayman Islands as a safe, no tax, no questions asked haven to keep their money. The author of the letter meets with the FBI shortly after 9/11, and claims his information was a &quot;premonition of sorts.&quot; The three men are later arrested. Its unclear what has happened to them since their arrest. [Miami Herald, 9/20/01, Los Angeles Times, 9/20/01, MSNBC, 9/23/01] FTW</p>

<p>EGYPT, WARNING #1: An undercover agent learns 20 al-Qaeda agents are in the US, four have received flight training</p>

<p>Late July 2001 (D): CBS later has a brief mention in a long story on another topic: &quot;Just days after Atta return[s] to the US from Spain, Egyptian intelligence in Cairo says it received a report from one of its operatives in Afghanistan that 20 al-Qaeda members had slipped into the US and four of them had received flight training on Cessnas. To the Egyptians, pilots of small planes didn&#39;t sound terribly alarming, but they [pass] on the message to the CIA anyway, fully expecting Washington to request information. The request never [comes].&quot; [CBS, 10/9/02] This appears to be one of several accurate Egyptian warnings based on informants (see June 13, 2001 and August 30, 2001). Could Egypt have known the names of some or all of the hijackers? Given FBI agent Ken Williams&#39; memo about flight schools a short time before (see July 10, 2001), shouldn&#39;t the US have investigated this closely instead of completely ignoring it?</p>

<p>GERMANY: Terrorists will use airplanes as weapons to attack &quot;American and Israeli symbols&quot;</p>

<p>June 2001: German intelligence warns the CIA, Britain&#39;s MI6, and Israel&#39;s Mossad that Middle Eastern terrorists are planning to hijack commercial aircraft to use as weapons to attack &quot;American and Israeli symbols, which stand out.&quot; A later article quotes unnamed German intelligence sources who state the information was coming from Echelon surveillance technology, and that British intelligence had access to the same warnings. However, there were other informational sources, including specific information and hints given to, but not reported by, Western and Near Eastern news media six months before 9/11. [Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 9/11/01, Washington Post, 9/14/01, Fox News, 5/17/02] FTW</p>

<p>ITALY: Muslims warn of an attack on the US and Britain using hijacked airplanes as weapons</p>

<p>September 7, 2001: Father Jean-Marie Benjamin is told at a wedding in Todi, Italy of a plot to attack the US and Britain using hijacked airplanes as weapons. He isn&#39;t told time or place specifics. He immediately passes what he knows to a judge and several politicians. He states: &quot;Although I am friendly with many Muslims, I wondered why they were telling me, specifically. I felt it my duty to inform the Italian government.&quot; Benjamin has been called &quot;one of the West&#39;s most knowledgeable experts on the Muslim world.&quot; Two days after 9/11, he meets with the Italian Foreign Minister on this topic. He says he learned the attack on Britain failed at the last minute. [Zenit, 9/16/01] He has not revealed who told him this information, but could it have been a member of the al-Qaeda cell in Milan (see August 12, 2000 and January 24, 2001), which appears to have helped with the 9/11 attacks?</p>

<p>JORDAN: A major attack using aircraft is planned inside the US</p>

<p>Late summer 2001: Jordanian intelligence (the GID) makes a communications intercept deemed so important that King Abdullah&#39;s men relay it to Washington, probably through the CIA station in Amman. To make doubly sure the message gets through it is passed through an Arab intermediary to a German intelligence agent. The message states that a major attack, code named The Big Wedding, is planned inside the US and that aircraft will be used. &quot;When it became clear that the information was embarrassing to Bush Administration officials and congressmen who at first denied that there had been any such warnings before September 11, senior Jordanian officials backed away from their earlier confirmations.&quot; Christian Science Monitor calls the story &quot;confidently authenticated&quot; even though Jordan has backed away from it. [International Herald Tribune, 5/21/02, Christian Science Monitor, 5/23/02] FTW</p>

<p>RUSSIA: Russian intelligence clearly warns the US several times that 25 or so terrorists, including suicide pilots, will attack the US, targeting &quot;important buildings like the Pentagon&quot;</p>

<p>August 2001 (D): Russian President Putin warns the US that suicide pilots are training for attacks on US targets. [Fox News, 5/17/02] The head of Russian intelligence also later states, &quot;We had clearly warned them&quot; on several occasions, but they &quot;did not pay the necessary attention.&quot; [Agence France-Presse, 9/16/01] A Russian newspaper on September 12, 2001 claims that &quot;Russian Intelligence agents know the organizers and executors of these terrorist attacks. More than that, Moscow warned Washington about preparation to these actions a couple of weeks before they happened.&quot; Interestingly, the article claims that at least two of the terrorists were Muslim radicals from Uzbekistan. [Izvestia, 9/12/01, (the story currently on the Izvestia web site has been edited to delete a key paragraph, the link is to a translation of the original article from From the Wilderness)] FTW</p>

<p>OTHER WARNINGS</p>

<p>AFGHANISTAN: Al-Qaeda is planning an imminent &quot;huge attack&quot; inside the US that will kill thousands</p>

<p>Taliban Foreign Minister
Wakil Muttawakil.</p>

<p>Late July 2001: The Taliban Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil learns that bin Laden is planning a &quot;huge attack&quot; on targets inside America. The attack is imminent, and will kill thousands. He learns this from Tahir Yildash, leader of the rebel Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), which is allied with al-Qaeda at the time. Muttawakil sends an emissary to pass this information on to the US consul general, and another US official, &quot;possibly from the intelligence services,&quot; also attends the meeting. The message is not taken very seriously; one source blames this on &quot;warning fatigue&quot; from too many warnings. Also, supposedly the emissary was from the Foreign Ministry, but didn&#39;t say the message came from Muttawakil himself. The emissary then takes the message to the Kabul offices of UNSMA, the political wing of the UN. They also fail to take the warning seriously. [Independent, 9/7/02, Reuters, 9/7/02] Isn&#39;t it ironic the US destroyed the Taliban, who tried to warn them of the attacks?</p>

<p>ARGENTINA: A major terrorist attack is planned against either the US, Argentina, or France</p>

<p>Late July 2001 (C): Argentina&#39;s Jewish community receives warnings of a major terrorist attack against either the United States, Argentina or France from &quot;a foreign intelligence source.&quot; The warning was then relayed to the Argentine security authorities. It was agreed to keep the warning secret in order to avoid panic while reinforcing security at Jewish sites in the country. Says a Jewish leader, &quot;It was a concrete warning that an attack of major proportion would take place, and it came from a reliable intelligence source. And I understand the Americans were told about it.&quot; Argentina has a large Jewish community that has been bombed in the past, and has been an area of al-Qaeda activity. [Forward, 5/31/02]</p>

<p>BRITAIN, WARNING #2: Al-Qaeda is the &quot;final stages&quot; of a very serious attack on a Western country</p>

<p>July 16, 2001: British spy agencies send a report to British Prime Minister Tony Blair and other top officials warning that al-Qaeda is in &quot;the final stages&quot; of preparing a terrorist attack in the West. The prediction is &quot;based on intelligence gleaned not just from MI6 and GCHQ but also from US agencies, including the CIA and the National Security Agency,&quot; which cooperate with the British. &quot;The contents of the July 16 warning would have been passed to the Americans, Whitehall sources confirmed.&quot; The report states there is &quot;an acute awareness&quot; that the attack is &quot;a very serious threat.&quot; [London Times, 6/14/02] This information could be from or in addition to a warning based on surveillance of al-Qaeda prisoner Khalid al-Fawwaz (see August 21, 2001). [Fox News, 5/17/02]</p>

<p>CAYMAN ISLANDS, WARNING #1:</p>

<p>June 4, 2001: At some point in 2000, three men claiming to be Afghans but using Pakistani passports enter the Cayman Islands, possibly illegally. [Miami Herald, 9/20/01] In late 2000, Cayman and British investigators begin a yearlong probe of these men which lasts until 9/11. [Los Angeles Times, 9/20/01] They are overheard discussing hijacking attacks in New York City. On this day, they are taken into custody, questioned and released some time later. This information is forwarded to US intelligence. [Fox News, 5/17/02] In late August, a letter to a Cayman radio station will allege these same men are agents of bin Laden &quot;organizing a major terrorist act against the US via an airline or airlines&quot; (see August 29, 2001).</p>

<p>EGYPT, WARNING #2: Al-Qaeda is in the advanced stages of a &quot;significant operation&quot; probably within the US</p>

<p>August 30-September 4, 2001: According to Egyptian President Hasni Mubarak, Egyptian intelligence warns American officials that bin Laden&#39;s network is in the advanced stages of executing a significant operation against an American target, probably within the US. [AP, 12/7/01, New York Times, 6/4/02] He says he learned this information from an agent working inside al-Qaeda. US officials deny receiving any such warning from Egypt. [ABC News, 6/4/02]</p>

<p>FRANCE: An echo of Israel&#39;s warning of a major assault on the US</p>

<p>Late August 2001 (D): French intelligence gives a general terrorist warning to the US; apparently its contents echo an Israeli warning from earlier in the month (see Mid-August 2001). [Fox News, 5/17/02]</p>

<p>INDIA: Missed opportunity with White House attack warning</p>

<p>July 2001 (B): India gives the US general intelligence on possible terror attacks; details are not known. US government officials later confirm that Indian intelligence had information &quot;that two Islamist radicals with ties to Osama bin Laden were discussing an attack on the White House,&quot; but apparently this particular information is not given to the US until two days after 9/11. [Fox News, 5/17/02]</p>

<p>ISRAEL, WARNING #1: 50 to 200 al-Qaeda terrorists are inside the US and planning an imminent &quot;major assault on the US&quot; aimed at a &quot;large scale target&quot;</p>

<p>August 8-15, 2001: At some point between these dates, Israel warns the US that an al-Qaeda attack is imminent. [Fox News, 5/17/02] Two high ranking agents from the Mossad come to Washington and warn the FBI and CIA that from 50 to 200 terrorists have slipped into the US and are planning &quot;a major assault on the United States.&quot; They say indications point to a &quot;large scale target&quot;, and that Americans would be &quot;very vulnerable.&quot; They add there could be Iraqi connections to the al-Qaeda attack. [Telegraph, 9/16/01, Los Angeles Times, 9/20/01, Ottawa Citizen, 9/17/01] The Los Angeles Times later retracts the story after a CIA spokesman says, &quot;There was no such warning. Allegations that there was are complete and utter nonsense.&quot; [Los Angeles Times, 9/21/01]  In light of later revelations of a Mossad spy ring trailing numerous Muslim terrorists in the US, it is easy to see that Mossad would have known this info. Could this be later disinformation by the Mossad to spin the spy ring story and blame Iraq for 9/11, or it is another smoking gun showing extensive US foreknowledge?</p>

<p>ISRAEL, WARNING #2: Israel gives the US a list of 19 terrorists inside the US planning an imminent attack, the list names at least four of the hijackers, including Mohamed Atta</p>

<p>August 23, 2001: According to German newspapers, the Mossad gives the CIA a list of terrorists living in the US and say that they appear to be planning to carry out an attack in the near future. It is unknown if these are the 19 9/11 hijackers or if the number is a coincidence. However, four names on the list are known and are names of the 9/11 hijackers: Nawaf Alhazmi, Khalid Almihdhar, Marwan Alshehhi, and Mohamed Atta. [Die Zeit, 10/1/02, Der Spiegel, 10/1/02, BBC, 10/2/02, Haaretz, 10/3/02] The Mossad appears to have learned about this through its &quot;art student&quot; spy ring (see for instance, March 5, 2002). Yet apparently this warning and list are not treated as particularly urgent by the CIA and also not passed on to the FBI. It&#39;s not clear if this warning influenced the adding of Alhazmi and Almihdhar to a terrorism watch list on this same day, and if so, why only those two. [Der Spiegel, 10/1/02] Israel has denied that there were any Mossad agents in the US. [Haaretz, 10/3/02] The US has denied knowing about Atta before 9/11, despite other media reports to the contrary (see January-May 2000).</p>

<p>MOROCCO: Al-Qaeda is planning large scale operations in New York City in the fall of 2001, possibly targeting the World Trade Center</p>

<p>August 2001 (C): The French magazine Maximale and the Moroccan newspaper al-Ittihad al-Ichtiraki later simultaneously report that a Moroccan agent named Hassan Dabou had penetrated al-Qaeda to the point of getting close to bin Laden by this time. Dabou claims he learns that bin Laden is &quot;very disappointed&quot; that the 1993 bombing had not toppled the WTC, and plans &quot;large scale operations in New York in the summer or fall of 2001.&quot; Dabou is called to the US to report this information directly, and in so doing blows his cover, losing his ability to gather more intelligence. The International Herald Tribune later calls the story &quot;not proved beyond a doubt&quot; but intriguing, and asks the CIA to confirm or deny, which it has not done. [Agence France Presse, 11/22/01, International Herald Tribune, 5/21/02, London Times, 6/12/02] FTW</p>

<p>UNNAMED PERSIAN GULF NATION: Former CIA agent warned of a &quot;spectacular terrorist operation&quot; to take place shortly</p>

<p>Robert Baer [ABC]</p>

<p>August 2001 (G): Former CIA agent Robert Baer (see December 1997 and January 23, 2002) is advising a prince in a Persian Gulf royal family, when a military associate of this prince passes information to him about a &quot;spectacular terrorist operation&quot; that will take place shortly. He is also given a computer record of around 600 secret al-Qaeda operatives in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The list includes 10 names that will be placed on the FBI&#39;s most wanted terrorists list after 9/11. He is also given evidence that a Saudi merchant family had funded the USS Cole bombing (see October 12, 2000), and that the Yemeni government is covering up information related to that bombing. At the military officer&#39;s request, he offers all this information to the Saudi Arabian government. But an aide to the Saudi defense minister, Prince Sultan, refuses to look at the list or to pass the names on (Sultan is later sued for his complicity in the 9/11 plot, see August 15, 2002). Baer also passes the information on to a senior CIA official and the CIA&#39;s Counter-Terrorism Center, but there is no response or action. Large sections of Baer&#39;s book are blacked out, having been censored by the CIA. [Financial Times, 1/12/02, See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA&#39;s War on Terrorism, Robert Baer, 2/02, pp. 270-271, Breakdown: How America&#39;s Intelligence Failures Led to September 11, Bill Gertz, pp. 55-58]</p>

<hr/>

<p>One warning should have been enough to take precautions. Ignoring so many warnings from so many governments - can that be explained as mere incompetence? Where is the outrage, and the investigation? The typical US government response has been to ignore mention of these warnings or say they were lies. On October 17, 2002, CIA Director Tenet claimed, the only warnings &quot;where there was a geographic context, either explicit or implicit, [they] appeared to point abroad, especially to the Middle East.&quot; [Congressional Intelligence Committee, 10/17/02] On May 16, 2002, National Security Advisor Rice stated to the press: &quot;I don&#39;t think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the World Trade Center, take another one and slam it into the Pentagon, that they would try to use an airplane as a missile.&quot; She added that &quot;even in retrospect&quot; there was &quot;nothing&quot; to suggest that. [White House, 5/16/02] On June 7, 2002, President Bush stated, &quot;Based on everything I&#39;ve seen, I do not believe anyone could have prevented the horror of September the 11th.&quot; [Sydney Morning Herald, 6/8/02]</p>

<p>Either the Bush Administration is lying, or most of America&#39;s close allies are. Why hasn&#39;t Congress investigated if these foreign intelligence claims are true or not? Why hasn&#39;t a single mainstream media article connected all these dots? In July 2001, Italy prevented a similar al-Qaeda air attack targeting a world summit by positioning antiaircraft guns, readying fighters, and closing off local airspace. [BBC, 7/18/01, CNN, 7/18/01, Los Angeles Times, 9/27/01] The 9/11 attacks could have easily been prevented in the same manner, if some of these foreign warnings were heeded and basic defensive precautions taken.</p>
