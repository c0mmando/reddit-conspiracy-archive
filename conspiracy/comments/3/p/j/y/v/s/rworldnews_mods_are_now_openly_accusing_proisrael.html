        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Worldnews Mods have finally seen the light and are now openly accusing pro-Israel posters of brigading. Here is the evidence I have collected over several days on the worldnews and israel subreddits.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/FYKuA">https://archive.is/FYKuA</a></p>

<p>WorldNews Mod #1 in a private message to a pro-Israel poster</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please let the users at <a href="/r/Israel">/r/Israel</a> know about this development and kindly ask them to limit flooding our queue with a story in the attempt to get it visibility in the future. Removing those posts which conveyed the same topic only delayed our ability to research and survey the story to catch these developments. Inundating our modmail with the same basic query has also made it quite difficult to even see your modmail here. <strong>These actions in response to the post made on <a href="/r/Israel">/r/Israel</a> are textbook brigading, and the matter has been referred to the admins.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mod #1 again</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/wTwsH">https://archive.is/wTwsH</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whoever is downvoting a user is completely anonymous to everyone except the admins and it cannot be viewed the same as a shill accusation when <strong>vote brigading has increasingly become a problem in I/P threads.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/JY9gD">https://archive.is/JY9gD</a></p>

<p>Here Mod #2 openly begs posters to notify admins of brigading on the Worldnews subreddit on a coincidentally brigaded thread.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mods have no ability to fight against or combat brigading or vote manipulation. Only the admins have the data and information to address such issues. We do try to work with them to combat instances where it is suspected, but it is not easy and the admins aren&#39;t always available to help. If you do suspect brigading or vote manipulation, it is best to send the evidence you find straight to the admins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Pro-Israel posters have not been happy that brigade activities are being openly exposed. They have resorted to smear campaigns like waiving the anti-Semitic card (what a surprise) and claiming they are banned from Worldnews when they are not, see below</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/ZLyeF">https://archive.is/ZLyeF</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mods have a strict anti-Israel agenda. I once decided to try and talk to them. Just mentioning palestinian terror attacks against israelis got them to message me that I&#39;m &#39;a jewish religious fanatic that wants palestinian blood&#39;. Even though I&#39;m an atheist, support a 2 state solution and oppose violence.</p>

<p>possibly. doesn&#39;t matter, I&#39;m permabanned from worldnews. Banned personally by their head mod.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mod #3 responds</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi, you are not banned from worldnews and from what I can see have never been. What makes you think you are?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I left the best for last.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/PaGQ0">https://archive.is/PaGQ0</a></p>

<p>In this thread, a notorious pro-Israel poster who is unhappy he has just been banned from worldnews by his own admission because of his racist comments makes this chilling remark.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;If there&#39;ll be pressure on the admins in regards to how worldnews is managed, maybe we&#39;ll see change.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chilling indeed.</p>

<p>They&#39;re all over every site where politics is discussed, trying to force their views onto people. It&#39;s an organised effort at mass propaganda, Nazi style. It started with just the 9/11 threads, but now it seems to have expanded into all areas of politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been debating these issues for over 20 years - since back in the days when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">USNET</a> was a &quot;thing&quot; - in fact, damn near the <em>only</em> place where threaded discussions were held.</p>

<p>Fucking wild west of the internet.</p>

<p>Yeah, I archived/saved a few of these (mostly veiled) threats, just for kicks, but most I just laughed at. Angry words from impotent asshats. I&#39;d have to do some serious digging to dredge them up. The most recent that I recall is some jerk threatening to put a &quot;curse&quot; on me - which, of course, sounds ridiculous, at least until you consider that Prime Ministers Yitzak Rabin and Ariel Sharon were both the objects of similar ritualistic &quot;curses&quot; shortly before they met their untimely demise:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsa_diNura#Recent_usage">Pulsa diNura</a></strong></p>

<p>So that which may seem ludicrous to you and I may be totally serious to the &quot;cursor&quot;.</p>

<p>Anyway, the countless hours spent in such discussions have been VERY educational: They lie, I check the facts, and learn. </p>

<p>Wash... rinse... repeat.</p>

<p>History is an interesting study, to be sure, and the heated discussions in which I&#39;ve engaged have driven me to research, and by that I have learned many fascinating facts that I would likely have never learned elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Here&#39;s a little snippet that a quick search of my files turned up - from my days on FARK.COM (same user name).</p>

<p>Exactly. Like many things, but especially this conflict, the devil is in the details.</p>

<p>I remember it being around 2006 or 2007 when I really first began seriously questioning the role of the United States in the war on terror, and it was more or less drawn out of me by questioning the logic neo-conservatives were using to justify it - researching those claims, hearing others, researching those.</p>

<p>The Israel / Palestine conflict is truly fascinating as to the multi-faceted nature of the propaganda, misinformation, misdirection, history, and the way the conflict is framed and reframed, and the way that propaganda is so embedded in our establishment.</p>

<p>What sources and authors do you use? My two favorites are Norman Finkelstein and Jeff Halper. </p>

<p>That depends on what is being discussed. </p>

<p>Regarding politics, history etc, I&#39;ve learned from experience that the first trick in the bag is to attack the source, so I try to avoid using any author or cite that can be brushed off as &quot;biased&quot;. When possible, I go straight to the horse&#39;s mouth with verifiable quotes from political, religious, or other prominent figures, or cite news articles in &quot;respected&quot; publications, or historians who are considered above reproach, such as Salo Baron or Martin Gilbert.</p>

<p>For insights into the religious/cultural mindsets, I agree with <a href="/u/arggabargga">/u/arggabargga</a> that Israel Shahak&#39;s works are fascinating, especially the book he recommended. Excerpts from some of his works can be found <strong><a href="http://www.mailstar.net/shahak2.html">here</a></strong> (<a href="https://archive.is/CJaVl">archived here</a>). Some of the quotes of the Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson at the above link are particularly interesting.</p>

<p>Another great read to gain a better understanding of the foundations on which the  cultural and religious mindset rests can be found in this excellent and evolving essay by Dr. John Hartung, MD, PhD:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://strugglesforexistence.com/?p=article_p&amp;amp;id=13">LOVE THY NEIGHBOR: The evolution of in-group morality</a></strong></p>

<p>Read the abstract and the <em>Authors Note</em> for starters. </p>

<p>Many more that I could mention, but these I would highly recommend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to say that it&#39;s about time the mods stood up to this. The pro-Israel brigades are so blatant and so obvious that it would be impossible for them to be ignored. The fact that they are using <a href="/r/Israel">/r/Israel</a> as a rallying point for their activities is beyond brazen.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://archive.is/Xg6tP">Here is a link</a></strong> to an archived <a href="/r/Israel">/r/Israel</a> thread that I saved several months ago where they were complaining about their inability to make headway in <a href="/r/worldpolitics">/r/worldpolitics</a>, and openly admitted to <em>&quot;shilling&quot;</em> in <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>.</p>

<p>A mod of <a href="/r/Israel">/r/Israel</a> commented:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s really no reason to care about this. It&#39;s a nice little hole that [redacted] and his ilk can go and spew their hatred against Jews er... I mean * Zionists* <strong>without spilling over to the big subs too much</strong>. I mean, there&#39;s like 4 or 5 regular submitters and commenters, all of which have a burning seething hatred towards certain minorities...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And another user added: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>Stick to &quot;shilling&quot; on worldnews</strong>, worldpolitics is a lost case.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you wonder how bad the brigading and manipulation really is in <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, simply go to ANY thread discussing Israel/Palestine issues, and have a look. Read the vote score BEFORE you read the comment - in most cases, highly upvoted comments will be <em>pro-Israel</em>, while comments that are critical or even skeptical of Israeli policy will be downvoted into oblivion.</p>

<p>Another tactic they use is to hover in the &quot;New&quot; queue, carfully monitoring for Israel-related stories. Those that they feel will create sympathy for Israel, or show them in a positive light will be upvoted immediately, while any submission that might reflect negatively on Israel will be downvoted onto the dustbins. </p>

<p>For example, when the news broke on June 22nd that the <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=UN+both+israel+and+palestine+war+crimes&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8">UN found evidence that both Israel and Gaza may have committed war crimes</a></strong> in the Gaza war of 2014, it was headline news in every major paper in the Western world, but stories on this issue  never made it to the main page of <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> in spite of it being it was submitted over a dozen times. The downvote brigades killed it in the New queue.</p>

<p>I understand why the pro-Israel crowd goes to the trouble of forming organized groups to raid Reddit. Hell, I don&#39;t even BLAME them for doing it: To them <strong>the propaganda war IS WAR</strong>, and they have a LOT riding on Israel being viewed by the public in as positive a light as possible.</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t understand is how the mods <em>and especially the ADMINS</em> let them get away with it. The admins can see who is voting for what in the threads, they could quickly detect patterns and, the offenders being identified, shadowban.</p>

<p>So, what say you, Reddit Administrators? Isn&#39;t it about time that you clamped down on this obvious abuse?</p>

Maybe something to do with the IDF killing children amongst the new uprising of violence and all the articles, videos, and the anti Israel comments surrounding them has sent them into over drive. They showed their hand and its so obvious no one can ignore it now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is great and somewhat hilarious as i was wondering why i never saw &quot;the notorious pro-israeli&quot; (won&#39;t name him) comments on worldnews anymore.</p>

<p>So i just checked his profile and turns out he&#39;s now migrated to history, israel and syriancivilwar and his last worldnews comments where 5 days ago.</p>

<p>While also being active on militaryporn and eli5 if it&#39;s about I/P.</p>

<p>Took a while for him to get banned on worldnews, especially since reddit seems to ignore their own available numbers, let alone how many times he used to comment but his average of 885 comment karma <em>per week during 3 years</em> of which most are made on worldnews.</p>

<p>But hey, one account banned doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s not posting there anymore.</p>

<p>However it&#39;s a start by the mods, and i&#39;m sure it aint easy for them with the limited tools at hand.</p>

<p>Read the top quote from a worldnews mod <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3pjyvs/rworldnews_mods_are_now_openly_accusing_proisrael/">at the top of this thread</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please let the users at <a href="/r/Israel">/r/Israel</a> know about this development and kindly <strong>ask them to limit flooding our queue with a story in the attempt to get it visibility</strong> in the future. Removing those posts which conveyed the same topic only delayed our ability to research and survey the story to catch these developments. <strong>Inundating our modmail with the same basic query has also made it quite difficult to even see your modmail here. These actions in response to the post made on <a href="/r/Israel">/r/Israel</a> are textbook brigading, and the matter has been referred to the admins.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently the Worldnews mods are sick and tired of the brigading and flooding the modmail by these clowns. Their bullshit creates chaos, and catering to sniveling and whining makes for unnecessary and tedious work.  </p>

<p>It would seem that the stickied post is their answer to these problems - at least for the moment.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter, you see they &quot;interpret&quot; statements to mean the exact opposite of what you actually said.</p>

<p>So if you were to say, &quot;Israel should stop genociding Palestinians&quot; they will &quot;interpret&quot; that to mean &quot;kill all the joooz!&quot;</p>

<p>If an Iranian leader were to say &quot;One day the Zionist regime will pass from the pages of time&quot; they will &quot;interpret&quot; that to mean &quot;kill all the joooz!&quot;</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t even trying to be honest or have an open debate - it&#39;s merely slander. You can see it in Zionist supremacist subs like <a href="/r/isrconspiracyracist">/r/isrconspiracyracist</a> all the time.</p>

<p>What sources and authors do you use?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That depends on what is being discussed. </p>

<p>Regarding politics, history etc, I&#39;ve learned from experience that the first trick in the bag is to attack the source, so I try to avoid using any author or cite that can be brushed off as &quot;biased&quot;. When possible, I go straight to the horse&#39;s mouth with verifiable quotes from political, religious, or other prominent figures, or cite news articles in &quot;respected&quot; publications, or historians who are considered above reproach, such as Salo Baron or Martin Gilbert.</p>

<p>For insights into the religious/cultural mindsets, I agree with <a href="/u/arggabargga">/u/arggabargga</a> that Israel Shahak&#39;s works are fascinating, especially the book he recommended. Excerpts from some of his works can be found <strong><a href="http://www.mailstar.net/shahak2.html">here</a></strong> (<a href="https://archive.is/CJaVl">archived here</a>). Some of the quotes of the Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson at the above link are particularly interesting.</p>

<p>Another great read to gain a better understanding of the foundations on which the  cultural and religious mindset rests can be found in this excellent and evolving essay by Dr. John Hartung, MD, PhD:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://strugglesforexistence.com/?p=article_p&amp;amp;id=13">LOVE THY NEIGHBOR: The evolution of in-group morality</a></strong></p>

<p>Read the abstract and the <em>Authors Note</em> for starters. </p>

<p>Many more that I could mention, but these I would highly recommend.</p>
