       I’m Dark Journalist,  an independent reporter and filmmaker, my video show adds a new twist to Alternative Media. I’m happy to answer any questions you may have on subjects such as Black Budget Economy, The Breakaway Civilization/Secret Space Program and UFO Secrecy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think in this crucial time we need a whole new way to look at the world and the levels of disinformation in our media institutions. I call this new approach “Dark Journalism” and feel it’s crucial we discover the truth and achieve transparency from the ruling elite in our culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ll be hosting The Secret Space Program Conference on the weekend of October 31st in Austin, Texas with Jim Marrs, Linda Moulton Howe, Joseph Farrell, Catherine Austin Fitts and others...
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m interested to hear what you think about these topics and maybe together we’ll come up with some inspiring answers.

       It wasn't just me!  It's because the only posts you seem to make are accusing anyone and everything of being a limited hangout.  It's like a kid who just figured out the meaning of a fancy new buzzword and overuses it constantly.  Anyways you should take all the downvotes you get as a sign that maybe you should try mentioning something other than LIMTED HANGOUT CONTROLLED OPPOSITION HURR DURR.

       That's interesting. All the evidence in my opinion points to something that is much bigger than a military black project. However, with the MILAB programs we can see that there is a great interest in using the phenomena for various experiments, mind control or otherwise, and the military interest should make us look very closely at UFOs.

       "In the morning of April 14, 1561, at daybreak, between 4 and 5 a.m., a dreadful apparition occurred on the sun, and then this was seen in Nuremberg in the city, before the gates and in the country – by many men and women. At first there appeared in the middle of the sun two blood-red semi-circular arcs, just like the moon in its last quarter. And in the sun, above and below and on both sides, the color was blood, there stood a round ball of partly dull, partly black ferrous color. Likewise there stood on both sides and as a torus about the sun such blood-red ones and other balls in large number, about three in a line and four in a square, also some alone. In between these globes there were visible a few blood-red crosses, between which there were blood-red strips, becoming thicker to the rear and in the front malleable like the rods of reed-grass, which were intermingled, among them two big rods, one on the right, the other to the left, and within the small and big rods there were three, also four and more globes. These all started to fight among themselves, so that the globes, which were first in the sun, flew out to the ones standing on both sides, thereafter, the globes standing outside the sun, in the small and large rods, flew into the sun. Besides the globes flew back and forth among themselves and fought vehemently with each other for over an hour. And when the conflict in and again out of the sun was most intense, they became fatigued to such an extent that they all, as said above, fell from the sun down upon the earth ‘as if they all burned’ and they then wasted away on the earth with immense smoke. After all this there was something like a black spear, very long and thick, sighted; the shaft pointed to the east, the point pointed west. Whatever such signs mean, God alone knows. Although we have seen, shortly one after another, many kinds of signs on the heaven, which are sent to us by the almighty God, to bring us to repentance, we still are, unfortunately, so ungrateful that we despise such high signs and miracles of God. Or we speak of them with ridicule and discard them to the wind, in order that God may send us a frightening punishment on account of our ungratefulness. After all, the God-fearing will by no means discard these signs, but will take it to heart as a warning of their merciful Father in heaven, will mend their lives and faithfully beg God, that He may avert His wrath, including the well-deserved punishment, on us, so that we may temporarily here and perpetually there, live as his children. For it, may God grant us his help, Amen. By Hanns Glaser, letter-painter of Nurnberg

       Oh, but you were at +1 when I saw your post, and now it's still +1 upvote. Who downvoted you?

       And I'm also the type to not take anything at face value. It's important to have discussion of all sorts of theory &amp; facts, and not just become sheep or drones to follow the herd.

       That is going to be one of the most important issues in the next decade. There are some interesting options arising, bitcoin etc, however I like something that can't be shut off with the press of a button. So all the digital wallet directions are something we need to avoid.

       What are you referring to? Bitcoin surely can not be shut down with the press of a button. It is decentralized for that very reason. Bitcoin goes down only when the internet itself goes down.

       Okay thats great. We have 0 chance of having a p2p decentralized global currency without the internet. I get that the internet is not infallible its just a nul argument. If the internet goes down we have no chance of having a currency that is outside of governmental control and global.

       What is so great about a digital currency?  Decentralized is a misnomer, since a bank can just purchase a little or as much of the currency and create fake boom &amp; bust cycles as if it were any currency.  Historically, this is how all other non-debt based currencies have fallen.  The only infallible currency is time.

       You lost me with historically... You cant use history to predict what will happen with bitcoin because there has never been a currency even remotely similar. Ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course, banks, wealthy individuals, hell even governments could try and manipulate the bitcoin markets. For all we know its already happening. It doesn't matter and it sure as shit doesn't make bitcoin centralized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin is decentralized in the sense that no central authority controls the amount of bitcoins that are created AND no central authority can control how you spend them AND no central authority can seize them as you can literally store a billion dollars in your brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Arguably the 2 most important aspects are the incentives that miners have to honestly maintain the network and the mathematically predictable inflation of the number of bitcoins. The miners are the ones securing the transactions on the blockchain(open ledger). They are rewarded newly "minted" bitcoins for the service as well as the transactions fees on the specific block they mined. At first it was 50 bitcoins every block (every 8 minutes) now it is 25 bitcoins every block. The number will continue to half over time until a small amount of bitcoin is being "minted". Once 21 million bitcoin has been mined, the miners only incentive will be the transaction fees on each block.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the idea perfect? No of course not, but bitcoin is open source and p2p and can adapt. Can we use history to predict if it will succeed? No of course not because nothing has ever or could ever have existed like bitcoin before the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope my explanation intrigued you enough to research yourself because I can hardly do the idea justice. Generally speaking cash is king and bitcoin and other currencies like it are digital cash.

       Yes I understand crypto-currencies very well, and it's actually nothing terribly new.  In conspiracy circles the talk of a coming digital currency has been around for decades.  There are plenty of others, like carbon credits, doge coin, etc, etc.  It's just a currency in digital form.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mechanism the currency is controlled (inflation) is by simulating a natural resource (such as Gold) so it can't be over inflated.  So, were at 14 million coins out of 21 million and growth has been

        somewhat linear
       </a>
       .  Since manipulation can occur, I must assume it does.  There's been plenty of fuckery reported, from the falling of gox, to agents stealing coins, to massive underground transfers, etc, etc.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        bitcoin and other currencies like it are digital cash.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Actually, no it's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the public ledger is a neat idea but it removes the ability to for anonymous transfers.  This actually kills the 'cash deal' since someone with enough computing power &amp; access to the physical network (N$A) could actually figure out the actual transfer endpoints.  Remember, a cashless digital currency is actually what the banks want since every single transaction could (in theory) be taxed (by a world bank, for instance).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it doesn't happen this way now, but after enough of these scammy online wallets &amp; transfer systems fall (stealing coins ad nauseum), eventually people will cry for some regulation.  A nice world bank will step in and save everyone from the nasty thieves...and tada, new world order complete.

       There are plenty of others like it? And you list Doge coin? Well no shit there are copies of bitcoin. There are hundreds if not thousands now. Which just makes it that much easier for hashing power to jump ship if bitcoin itself was ever fully corrupted by the "new world order". My point was there was nothing like it before the bitcoin white paper and that is undeniably true.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes it can be digital cash, there are competing currencies that are based on a far more anonymous ledger system than bitcoins.

       Your argument about the transparency of the blockchain works both ways too. If the NWO is able to monitor all the activity, so can we. You think the elites are going to want the global population knowing exactly where and what their wealth is going towards?

       I like to think the internet is an fundamental part of their plan, the only apparatus that provides a far reaching information medium, serves both surveillance and propaganda, realtime (an ip as mark of the beast if you will). I don't think they can just give it up, they will try to enforce their rule on it, but the network's requirements are such that the only technical solution, packet commutation, prevents most of it if not all. They might shut it down eventually for lack of a solution, but it's going to be an insanely hard decision for them. Also the private world, if not concentrated to fuck at the time, might have a word or two to say in the matter, billions have been invested in the internet...

       I think that there is no one who can give a good official explanation of why the moon missions were stopped and NASA, which is now being cut to pre-lunar levels of funding, is basically a shell of what it once was. It was going to carry a nation's vision into the stars. What we got instead were strange explanations of budgetary reasons for ending those missions. That's completely false! We had in fact built the next two sets of ships when they were cancelled. This transfer of the power of NASA to what we see now as private hands, SpaceX, Bigelow, and now Google buying DARPA funded Boston Dynamics, who basically make killer robots for the military, is an astonishing transfer of American power and wealth to unaccountable corporate hands! Very dangerous situation in the long term.

        Well I don't believe it was faked. I do think that they found evidence of a base up there that was not constructed by any known country here on earth. I found it interesting that there are so many anomalies about the moon landings that even the Russians have decided recently to reinvestigate what happened. From films of the landings disappearing to conflicting stories of what technology was being used, I think we can see the roots of the Secret Space Program in the Apollo missions!

       I think there is now a movement to get these 22 pages of documents that relate to Saudi involvement. If they can be revealed we may find some important links in there that could open an investigation. Whether or not we believe the Saudis were a player. The normal commissions that are set up on these topics, like the Warren Commission and 9/11 commission would just be a whitewash so I think a panel of neutral parties from within society should lead such an effort.

       There are compelling stories about Mossad knowledge of the attacks beforehand. I find the work of Peter Dale Scott pertinent on this, I do feel that it is what he calls a 'Deep State Event' so very hard to pin one group, but more of a coalescence of interests. Certainly the official story is bunk... Here is the episode on this with Professor Scott:

       Well I didn't suggest that it was only the Saudi's, but there are definite links if you research it. I recommend the work of Peter Dale Scott who I interviewed on the Deep State:

      <pre><code>The Saudi's did it, the evidence  is overwhelming. There is zero evidence that the U.S. intelligence community had any knowledge at all. The Saudi's had military service men training at U.S. air force bases in Florida. The lloyds of London lawsuit had photos of Mohamed Atta  driving into the gated community where a Saudi prince lived just a few days before the attack. They had photos of the hijackers in Arizona getting flying lessons and in California. This is the same evidence that was confiscated by the Bush administration and the former Senator Bob Graham has been demanding for 13 years.There is no evidence that Israel had any hand in it. Not real evidence. Circumstantial evidence maybe, and hyperbole, but nothing that could be taken to court. Also there are no aliens. This is such none sense. How come, when there are now something like 6 billion cell phones in the world, of which most have  hd video cameras, there are no more UFO videos appearing? Where did they all go? It's a load of crap. it's called a cottage industry. It's easy to set up and easy to sell, and it can disappear over night. Check out the documentary "Mirage Men". Look at the Report from Iron Mountain.  Also there is no plan to exterminate half the worlds population or to kill off millions of people. Jim Marrs is a liar trying to sell a book. He has no special information. That notion is just stupid.  A lot of that hysteria comes from ignorance and fear, and the realization that for all that you or I know, it is a small fraction of all that could be known. Some people stumble across NSM 200 and flip out. They don't have the critical thinking skills to understand it. This guys site is just another one pushing questionable people, who all have books or subscription services to sell, to a willing nutter audience.  In short, he's lying to you. he doesn't know anymore than any of you and most of his interviewees are of a questionable nature.

       Go read the dossier from Lloyds of London. Saudi Arabia was issued the lawsuit on 9-11-2011, a Sunday night I believe. They paid up by Tuesday. The suit was dropped but Lloyds of London said they are withdrawing it but ANYONE who wishes to use their data to go after SA can use it. By that Friday Obama was in Saudi Arabia talking about the special relationship that the U.S. has with Saudi Arabia. Bob Graham was on the 9-11 commission, that night he was on NPR blasting the Bush administration about the missing evidence that Lloyds of London had. He has since spoken out about it in Paris, the same day the charlie hebdo attack took place. He also spoke out in other news papers. He has since had a visit by the FBI, they ransacked hi house and told him in no uncertain terms to stop bringing up S.A.'s connection to 9-11. That it was settled, and don't tell anyone about this visit. SO he called the NYT, LA Times and a few more papers right after that happened.  Nation state intelligence was behind it, there is NO EVIDENCE, real tangible evidence that Israel or Mossad took part or knew and you have to stick with EVIDENCE, not hyperbole or suspicion.

       In every event like this, you can find winners and losers. The theories put forth regarding Kroll, Silverstein, etc. are just that, theories. Not proof or evidence. Now, the Israeli spies that were posing as art students trying to get onto military bases and the ones that were dancing, obviously that points to Mossad. And  in really, nothing seems to go on in the middle east without Mossad knowing. There is also the Stratford hack info that shows that SA and Israel have been working together for ten years or so, their intelligence divisions. In Dec 2002 or 2003, Sen Graham of the 9-11 commission did an interview regarding 9-11. He said that they had significant evidence that multiple nation states were involved int he planning, financing and execution of 9-11, but he also said that the commission was getting resistance and things were being blocked, not allowed to be presented.  It certainly paints a picture that Israel had to at least know 9-11 was going to happen. But is there any real evidence that could be brought into a court of law that Israel was involved in 9-11? No. Is there real evidence SA was? Yes. Photos, the Sinjar Papers, the Lloyds of London report showing  The Red Crescent charity is a front to finance terrorist, that SA has been responsible for almost all the terrorist attack against the West. Even Bandar boasted to Putin when he was trying to get the U.S. to invade Syria that he controlled the Chechen terrorist, and he could guarantee there  would be no terrorist attacks during the Olympics if he went stayed out of the way. But the target, the symbol of the Global Regime of Economic Interdependence, that was meaningful. That was a message, and in fact the Sept 2001 issue of Foreign Affairs magazine, their cover story was crucial to understanding the next moves by the U.S. "Caspian Energy At The Crossroads" I believe was the cover story.

       Ok, sorry, i'll address them now.
      </p>
      <p>
       "So you are saying it wasn't Israel but was Saudi Arabia and the US knew nothing of it?"
      </p>
      <pre><code>  I have no evidence that anyone in the government knew about it. I have no credible evidence. There is circumstantial evidence and some things that are unbelievable, 
</code></pre>
      <p>
       but are you thinking of someone specific? If so whom? What evidence do you have that could prove your point, in court lets say.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your view is correct, do we then assume that the Twin Towers/Larry Silverstein's insurance policy were merely coincidental?
          That could be a coincidence, might not be. Between that and the trades that were done that day it does not seem like a coincidence, but again, how do you 
prove that in court? What eveidence would you be able to take to a prosecutor to have him arrested and imprisoned for having fore knowledge of an attack on the U.S.?
      </p>
      <pre><code>"Do we also assume it is coincidental that the security for the WTC is run by Kroll?"
</code></pre>
      <p>
       Again this is an interesting issue, but how do you PROVE anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Significant increase in espionage based arrests of Israeli agents in the US prior to 9/11?"
      </p>
      <p>
       That is again an interesting point and hard to put an exact answer on it unless you had someone in the government or intelligence 
community to leak or whistleblow about their actions there are any number of reasons why they could have been in the U.S. The ones acting like art students trying to get into 
the airforce bases, those I'd like to know what they were up to. But we never will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Delving into Ptech would take too much this early in the morning for me but again, another link which surely can't be purely coincidental?
      </p>
      <pre><code>    I've never heard of this PTech or read about it, so I don't know. I'll look it up. 
</code></pre>
      <p>
       "You have mentioned a lawsuit placed in Pennsylvania by Llyods of London. But that lawsuit was rescinded. If someone was free to go and use the data that had been submitted, 
why has that not happened? Why is that data now not in the public sphere?"

       Saudi Arabia and Israel did make gains. We eliminated one of their main enemies, Saddam. We have occupied, and will never leave Afghanistan for multiple reasons, and Iraq. Whose in the middle? Iran, the real target of all this. They have been the target since 1990. Encircle Iran, isolate them out of the oil market so that the western hegemony can control the price of oil for the next 50 years. Well, it was initially withdrawn because Saudi Arabia paid up. That's why they withdrew the suit.  We can prove that the Iraq war was pre-concieved.  If you look at that last report, the trilateral report #38, that is the blueprint for our activity in the middle east. It was initially presented at a meeting at the White House. It states to unilaterally disarm the middle east, specifically targeting Iraq first. That Foreign Affairs article, Caspian Oil at the crossroads, that specifically states Iraq as a target. That was the energy report that everyone was wondering about that Cheney was not releasing. It was written I believe at the James A Baker school of international studies out of Rice University. The policy is still in place to remove all nationalistic leaders in the Middle East and replace them with people that are friendly to the current regime. And to unilaterally disarm, the middle east of weapons of mass destruction as well as all conventional weapons. The countries targeted, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Afghanistan. What ones are left to do? Syria, and Iran. The impetus for Afghanistan  can be found in the 1999 hearing on the Silk Road strategy. There is a lot going on back then, tons of things having to do with oil in the Caspian basin and some laws about doing business with former soviet satellite states.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also looks like they are gearing up for when Bush takes office, the PR machine is starting roll to set up an attack on Iran. Russia will probably stop that though since they have security agreements with one another.

       It's a pretty good run down of the dollar/currency aspect of the wars. The real threat now is BRICS and the challenge that it will be against the current regime. Obama tried, in vain, to stop Iran from joining BRICS. The current and next wars are the whole continent of Africa. There is a race going on to take control of the natural resources there. Every major nation has troops there. The U.S.'s largest military footprint is now AFRICOM. Whenever there is a new natural resource found and a weak government, AFRICOM finds a threat. Currently, Cameroon, where Duke energy has contracts, Duke I believe also, along with Genie Energy have contracts with the oil find in the Golan Heights that spreads into...wait for it...Syria. The head of AFRICOM, Gen. Rodriguez, stated in an article in Parameters magazine,  that the purpose of AFRICOM is to make sure the "strategic natural resources make it to the market place".

       That's an excellent observation. I think there are high-points in research and surges in interest that happen in cycles.  This is a low stimulation period at present, but the subject matter is so volatile and unpredictable that a new era of UFO awareness could happen overnight. I always look at these periods as a time to drill down on potentially overlooked cases. I am working on a documentary about one now...

       I suppose that's fair. However, I have this strange feeling about ufology right now.  As a more seasoned conspiracy theorist, I solidly reject such cultural mainstays as the moon landing and even the Cold War itself. From my perspective, I don't see a lot of reason to accept ufology throughout the 50s, 60s, 70s, - this is due to how obviously it was allowed into the culture at a time when censorship was at it's height. It's not that I reject Ufology, per se, but I don't really know what to believe about it. I do accept that alien abduction is a very real phenomenon. But I can't even begin to embrace the concept of extra terrestrials and frankly I'm not sure I can really accept the concept of outer space, space travel, etc. I hope you're not too confused by my position. Does any of this resonate with you?

       Well I can appreciate that. It certainly has been the target of some serious intel disinformation programs over the years. My take on Ufology arising in the 50's is a little different from yours. No questions large scale sightings occurred and therefore major coverage. What these covert agencies did, and still do to this day, is spin the sightings as weather balloons, hoaxes etc. So there was an effort there to contain the situation, there was no way to not cover it in some fashion. They even had congressional hearings, the Condon Committee and programs like project blue book. All of this was a careful effort to convince average people that they were not seeing what they were seeing.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the time the 70's rolled around it was failing. Movies like Close Encounters and the zeitgeist of abduction encounters were creating the greatest amount of interest yet. What happened after that were more attempts at co-opting the subject. When we get to the period of Area 51 revelations, Bob Lazar etc., we see that the covert forces that wanted to keep a lid on UFOs were  losing the battle. I believe there was some real policy discussion about revealing some of the truth in deep circles of what is referred to as MJ12 forces.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then the events of 9/11 and Iraq War came along and the climate of fear that was created helped to diminish the cultural awareness of the phenomena. The advent of the internet and the subsequent growth in awareness has brought us up to a pivotal point on this topic yet again. So now we'll see how covert empire handles it.

       Watch a documentary called
       <em>
        Mirage Men
       </em>
       .  In it we see how government disinfo agents literally drove a man insane when he started asking too many questions about some things he was seeing in the skies over a military base near his house.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm with you man, it's my opinion that UFO's are almost entirely exotic human technology. TT Brown for example was doing work with electrogravitics 80 years ago, imagine how far that technology could have come in the time since.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also recommend Nick Cook's
       <em>
        The Hunt for Zero Point
       </em>
       and Dr. LaViolette's
       <em>
        Secrets of Antigravity Propulsion
       </em>
       .  Both of these books reach similar conclusions overall.

       Well Tesla is a fascinating study. I believe he had figured out everything we needed for a sustainable society that wouldn't need to rely on fossil fuels. He was suppressed, he was marginalized, and from the moment in his early years when Edison took advantage of him he was manipulated and taken advantaged of. Yet it was Tesla who discovered so many of the things that our modern world depends upon, like alternating current. The question is how great would our world be now with his wireless free energy that could beam energy the same way we beam wi-fi to smartphones now?

       He was so advanced we still have not caught up with his genius...

       I am watching it go on all around me and it is unnerving and growing. Many alternative sites are giving ground or going out of business because they relied on Google income for example. Now with the new developments around Google's 'Knowledge Vault' these sites will be even further marginalized as we enter the era of Orwell's Ministry of Truth. However, there are some of us who don't rely on Google for support, even if we use their products. Those sites developing new models will survive and thrive...!

       I do believe there were ancient advanced civilizations. I think they had the ability to mentally project technology in a way that is more fascinating than our current nuts and bolts approach. I believe that major efforts have been made to find the key to this ancient technology that was kept hidden for a good reason by those who possessed it and ultimately saw their civilization doomed by it. I believe those who possessed this knowledge would be considered 'Gods' to the general population. I don't think all of the ancient stories that deal with this are only referring to alien visitations. There are probably only a few that do, that's where shows like Ancient Aliens get it wrong. There was a superior human of the past who possessed advanced technology, but who were they?

       The issue I have is that any ancient advanced civilization would have naturally built massive cities spanning the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would have discovered steel and concrete just as we did, and used it as primary building materials for centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where are they? There are no 2 million year old pyramids, buried ancient cities with glass and steel, etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the moon? Humans will someday colonize it. If an ancient human race was as advanced as us they'd certainly have visited it. If they were more advanced they'd have likely colonized it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should see long-abandoned structures and signs of resource extraction... Yet there are none.
      </p>
      <p>
       I definitely buy the idea that humanity has had multiple "dark ages" where significant knowledge was lost that took hundreds of years to recover (for example, who the heck was mapping the Arctic before the pyramids were built?! See: maps that shouldn't exist).
      </p>
      <p>
       These "dark ages" have instilled this "those who came before knew more" idea into the common human mythos. I disagree however that at any point humans have been more advanced then we are now. There's just too many things missing.

       We can't reproduce the Great Pyramid's precision even with all of our modern technology. Certainly these cultures were advanced and possessed a kind of technology that has been forgotten through history. They handled stones weighing hundred of tons with the kind of ease that is hard to fathom. We can argue the point that they were more or less advanced than we are today technologically, but it's clear that they understood the connection between their technological achievement and their spiritual development better than we do at present.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my research, they were far advanced psychically . The legends of the Atlantean power stones suggest a technology that was connected to their intuitive abilities.

Doing so would be expensive yes (probably in the billions, depending on tech vs slave labor) but there's nothing technically challenging for 21st century mechanical/structural engineers about stacking large stone blocks high enough to produce a pyramid. Have you seen cranes? It would be easy. We routinely lift objects hundreds of times heavier/larger when producing aircraft carriers.

      <p>
       I wouldn't say ease, it likely involved series of long slopes and hundreds of humans in makeshift harnesses pulling them over logs. Hard yes, but not impossible when you have massive amounts of slave labor.

       The issue here is "research" seldom gets past the "stories read somewhere". We can't base theories off nothing more than rumor or suspicion. Heck, even the "Bermuda triangle" stuff has more to go on than that (ex: unknown phenominon aka lots of ships going missing in one area so you can set out to explore said area to search for anomalies, this is how the gas bubble situation was discovered).
      </p>
      <p>
       You HAVE to understand that any type of "alt" history/tech/etc community is going to attract two extremely destructive types of individuals in addition to the positive types:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Mentally unstable loony-bins that make stuff up on the fly or over time, some
       <em>
        fantastically
       </em>
       detailed that integrate other "known" things in attempts to "tie it all together" so the reader establishes connections with things they've already heard. This creates a false sense of credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Trolls. AKA ignorant 15 yr olds with nothing to do on the net that get off feeling superior by fooling people they see as crazy. Group 1 is honestly less "evil", since they're usually insane and actually believe their delusions. Group 2 is more insidious in that their goal is to sound as believable as possible to get off on their own perceived mental superiority.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't tell you the number of times I've heard things I've personally studied in-depth get twisted and manipulated to support some far-out notion that makes no sense. It's important to "guard your heart" so to speak and approach others, even those who appear genuine, with healthy skepticism and rationality.

       Well first, that is incorrect about the Great Pyramid, this in fact has been attempted many times since the seventies, including a Japanese construction experiment,  and always failed. The technique involved in the construction is beyond our understanding. I recommend the work of John Anthony West on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do suggest for this type of discussion that you go to my website
       <a href="http://www.DarkJournalist.com">
        www.DarkJournalist.com

       and watch the videos on these subjects and then comment on them. It makes for a more constructive exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see while I appreciate advice, trying to engage in a deep conversation with just a question and answer when you don't have the material to draw from that I cite will not work. For example, watch the latest interview with Graham Hancock I did recently. Then we'll have a foundation of facts you can work with:
       <a href="http://www.darkjournalist.com/s-hancock.php">
        http://www.darkjournalist.com/s-hancock.php
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure you'll agree that Graham is not a 'mentally-unstable loony, he is a seasoned researcher and author and investigative journalist who has traveled around the world and discovered that the version of history we are being presented with is not correct. I also recommend the  recent interview on Akhenaten and hidden history I did with Dr. Joseph P. Farrell:  I also don't think this Oxford Scholar will fall under the category of an ignorant 15 yr old.

       I summarily reject the notion that we could not build pyramids today.

      <p>
       We absolutely could, we could make them bigger if we wanted. Saying we haven't is NOT proof we couldn't, there's simply no reason to. It would take some eccentric billionaire wanting to waste his fortune to do it, but it could easily be done.

       Well I don't believe it was faked. I do think that they found evidence of a base up there that was not constructed by any known country here on earth. I found it interesting that there are so many anomalies about the moon landings that even the Russians have decided recently to reinvestigate what happened. From films of the landings disappearing to conflicting stories of what technology was being used, I think we can see the roots of the Secret Space Program in the Apollo missions!

      <p>
       There is no comparison for moon landing images in our daily lives. It is an alien environment. There's no atmosphere, no clouds or lighting modifiers. It's just the sandy glare of the moon landscape, the naked sunlight, and infinite black.

       Not to mention the limitations of film during that time, we didn't have HD Digital instant video back then.  I think the easiest way to make a skeptic of the moon landings into a believer is to educate them on how film worked back then.

       Unfortunately, you're wasting your time talking to metabolix. I
very dealt with him before, and he refused to even acknowledge spectroscopy as a valid science when introduced to it during a previous attempt to convince him the moon landings actually happened. He
       <em>

       to be well educated, but considering how relatively basic concepts seem to be well beyond him, I greatly doubt it.

       Well again, we know there were these stories of Kubrick shooting footage on a moon stage etc, but to me that could mean you need staged images because of what may be visible in the originals. I do like to refer to the work of an amazing remote viewer named Ingo Swann. Ingo worked in a very black project remote-viewing the moon and saw large scale bases and another civilization operating there. They were humanoid. Was this a breakaway civilization? Was it a set of hybrids? Well we have a lot of questions. Interesting thing was the program directors who got Ingo to remote view the moon didn't seem surprised that he was seeing what he was seeing. His impression was we were kicked off the moon. Interestingly enough, when I talked with Nuclear Physicist and UFO researcher Stanton Friedman, he said the same thing:

       If the belief is that we got "kicked" off the moon then private space should excite you.

       Elon musk is exactly the type to leak video from a moon probe or landing if anything sketchy was actually going on.

       Here is an excellent quote from a great astronaut Gordon Cooper in a letter to the UN: I believe that these extra-terrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this planet from other planets, which obviously are a little more technically advanced than we are here on earth. I feel that we need to have a top level, coordinated program to scientifically collect and analyze data from all over earth concerning any type of encounter, and to determine how best to interface with these visitors in a friendly fashion.

       Hah, that is the power-packed question and I love it. Let's see, There was a report before this recent floating city thing in China about a whole village disappearing, then reappearing, oddly enough it was in legitimate news sources for awhile (?). It reminds me very much of the Voronezh incident in Russia in 1989. I went back and found even a newscast from Nightline about it where they interviewed the Russian police chief. In that case a whole park full of people on a busy day witnessed a craft come down and aliens appear. At one point a young boy disappeared and reappeared before everyone's eyes! Later I went and found an interview with that same boy as an adult where he recalled the experience. Wow! Wait was the question...? Hah Blue beam, well this idea of a government planned invasion with holograms faking a UFO attack is discredited now. I think it would be too elaborate, however they would love to use the off-world cultures visiting as an enemy or threat we need protection from. In essence, they don't need to make it up as much as distort it...

       I'm going to look that up - that sounds incredible! Voronezh? I hadn't heard of that one. The Blue Beam thing does keep regaining traction every so often... perfect content for Dr Who as well then? 
I'm going to lean more towards dimensional aspects here!

       I enjoy your writings.
Do you have any theories regarding macrostructures: Great Pyramids, Mesoamerican pyramids, geoglyphs, Nazca Lines? If I could be more specific, are there theories involving usage of electricity, possibly similar to the UFO tech you have previously referenced?

       There was an unknown advanced technology involved in the creation of certain ancient marvels. There are suggestions that the technology could have involved sound. In a tantalizing answer to a question about the construction of the Great Pyramid from the great psychic Edgar Cayce we find this: "By the use of those forces in nature as make for iron to swim. Stone floats in the air in the same manner."

       I hold Edgar Cayce in very high regard. I thought that you might be interested to know (if you don't already) that there was another clairvoyant, with a story extremely similar to Cayce's (discovered the ability through hypnosis, the readings suggested moving to Va. Beach, etc). His name is Paul Solomon, and he talked about this technology as well. He has a few readings that mention this techonology, and some others on UFOs and ETs as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is one of his readings. It mentions  several things of interest such as the NWO, a formula for a free energy technology which would also allow us to float stones, revolutionize communication and travel, etc. He also mentions this in the context of the way the pyramids were built. Also interesting to note is that the formula, he says, has something to do with 6x6x6.
      </p>
      <p>
       The information of interest is on page 4 of the PDF.

       Interesting. Thanks for the reply. 
Follow-up if you have a chance. What theories could allow for such technology(ies) be kept secret for so long? And by secret, I also include the term 'lost' - not understood by us common folk on in an obvious way.

       This is an important question and gets us into ideas about geomancy and leylines. There is no question that there are power spots here on earth. From Sedona to Easter Island and Gizeh, there are these centers where energy currents seem to have their maximum impact on our consciousness. There is a great mystery to this that these ancient cultures knew and respected.

       This fascinating episode of the classic series In Search Of has some excellent information on Coral Castle which was a modern mystery constructed using these ancient methods:

       State secrecy is the biggest threat to our country, in its entire existence.  Red versus blue is a lie, both parties (in the US) are playing for the deep state where careers are forged and dynasties are born.  What can we possibly do, short of revolution, to set our people free?

       Well a revolution in ideas is what we are looking at. I agree that secrecy is the biggest threat, that can be a libertarian, or democratic or republican position and one thing this country should be able to rally around regardless of party distinction. So we can start by seeing through the media. The media is the ultimate pivot point for saving America from covert forces, in my opinion.

       Well this is a truly fascinating area of research, there is no question that there is an occult echo of these rites that have been performed for centuries in elite circles, the Nazis and Himmler did pick up on this. I think the way it comes down to us now is that the movement toward Transhumanism is actually the technological equivalent of conjuring this energy and spirit using special magical rites. The idea of transmutation of course, lead into gold etc. is an alchemical formula at the heart of these rites. But what is the transmutation of physical human identity, into a robotic, high-tech material representing? Too much to tackle completely here, but you've touched on one of my major pursuits...a little dose of it in here:

       Great question! Well there are some major signs that it was located near where the Bahamas are now off the Coast of Florida. We do have to imagine a continent so large that it stretched on one side to Mexico and on the other to the Pyrenees, so there is some range there that it occupied. From what I can gather using a wide variety of sources, the part near modern day Cuba was the center of activity, the London/New York City of its time.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are mysteries that point to Antarctica being advanced before being caught in a pole shift. This could have been another major culture, we have heard of a different land called MU in the pacific and these Lemurians were also advanced, so there are questions about where they fled to...

       That's the Piri Reis map that was authored by a Turkish admiral in 1513, interestingly enough he claimed to have copied it from older source maps contained in monasteries, so who knows how old it really is...?

       Yeah, it's the Piri Reise map. It's amazing how old the map is, but how accurate the details are. 
In the map it showed what Antarctica used to look like, with land and grass and all that. It wasn't always a continent of snow and ice.
      </p>
      <p>
       My speculation is that the common myths of Atlantis is that it was submerged under water. Well... Ice is water. There are tons of ancient civilizations who were visited by humanoids claiming to have sailed from a far away place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know, it isn't the best theory, but it's neat to think about.

       Hi Daniel thank you for joining us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think that break-away civilisation has anything to do with the possiblity that the elite (as suggested by Bill Cooper) are aware of impending environmental cataclysm and collapse of the biosphere? Do you lend any support to the claims that black tech has/is being used to ensure the survival of the Human race, away from Earth as a direct result of climate change and a possible run away green house event?

       Yes, I think the Breakaway people are all about contingency plans. They realize the amount of environmental damage to the planet that has happened and they are also aware of trends, like a pole shift, that are coming down the pike at some point in our future. Cooper in this sense was ahead of his time. But I would go further and say that we may be looking at a group within this elite that controls the UFO technology and at this point doesn't have to answer to anyone. So I don't even see them having a formal government role...

       What about the deep underground military bases we read about, that researchers such as Richard Sauder have looked into. Do you have any thoughts or information on their purpose?

       I respect Sauder's work and we have touched base on his research. I think they are extensive and relate to this breakaway idea. I believe that they got their start during the Cold War in the US, however the Nazis were perhaps the most obsessed with underground complexes. The development of the super weapons and torsion experiments like the Nazi Bell were carried out in facilities like that. It appears the underground work is related to maintaining global power and keeping developments hidden from the public. Of course they are being built with public funds...

       Total bunk! Sorry, it has issues. I never really say that about too many things, but in this case we are really getting hustled. I have a theme in Dark Journalism called 'Third Force' and I would consider this Flat Earth theory to fall into this. I will quote myself here: Pattern 3 I call “Third Force,” and here is an example in some classic disinformation stories:
      </p>
      <p>
       “ No planes used in 9/11!” This bizarre claim actually gets some traction and serves to discredit the plausible Pattern 2 stories, such as the planes were remote controlled etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The driver shot JFK.” This is another absurd piece of disinfo that attempts to discredit legitimate Pattern 2 research, such as evidence of an extensive assassin team firing from the front.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third Force stories are there in the media, placed by intel sources who are masters of obfuscation and deflection. 
Third force allows the hollow media to emerge appearing as the sane, balanced arbiter of the real information you need to know and taints Pattern 2 research and claims with a brush of the lunatic or conspiratorial.
      </p>
      <p>
       This method is so successful on the human psyche because the public mind needs buffers to understand the world. When an important piece of information comes forward that shatters a ‘normal’ paradigm, then a person may actually start to awaken to the greater reality they are living within. But with that comes a fear of change also, if something can come forward and nudge that person back into complacenecy most of the time they will accept it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third Force is a steady flow of sometimes ludicrous or indeed repulsive accents added to the main alternative picture that emerges when the official story starts to show its own failings. If we don’t understand this mechanism we will find it impossible to reason out what is happening in our world. If we understand it on the other hand, it loses much of it’s hypnotic sway.

       hm. I disagree with your application of this framework to flat earth theory. I agree there is plenty of disinfo out there. tho the no planes used isn't so obviously incorrect because I agree it is very likely not commercial planes that were used. tho possible they were still military planes painted up. it's not an entirely invalid train of thought to ask - what did fly into the towers - is it not what we were told?
      </p>
      <p>
       I 'll tell you what I think is for sure disinfo - and that is that nukes were used in 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway - I'm of the opinion that you gotta let the evidence speak for itself - as outrageous a claim may be - I might ignore and say it sounds impossible -  but I never label it as a certifiable lie - until I've heard them out. the evidence for flat earth is amazingly sound. not saying they are right beyond all doubt, but they are right to demonstrate - globe earth is not a given and has never been proven and flat makes more sense with our given knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you assume it's disinfo without hearing them out - I can't respect that.

       Well certainly it was created after World War II with the National Security Act and the creation of the CIA. This allowed for a number of things to be carried out that wouldn't be legal beforehand. So, and this is a big subject to cover here, basically after the Nazi's lost power in Germany and we defeated Japan in 1945, there were large amounts of funds and treasure that formed a basis for a kind of World endowment and this black budget system just grew and grew. Its greatest moment may have been the Financial Coup of 2008 markets!

       There are so many interesting things on this. I do feel that they have not shared its true purpose (or risks). I have had some inside sources that I trust tell me that it was set up to defend against something. I find that disturbing. There were a few scientists when it first came out who led the equivalent of scientific protests because of the potential dangers involved, like how certain byproducts of the collisions called 'strangelets' formed elements hostile to matter. In any case an interview I have coming up with Joseph P. Farrell does addess this and his upcoming presentation at the Secret Space Program Conference is the one to look for on this:

       This is an excellent and difficult question, hah. I think in terms of cases, The Phoenix Lights case ranks as the most important modern case because a whole city and its Governor witnessed it. There is a case I am doing a documentary on from October 13th, 2010 that is largely forgotten, yet I would say it perhaps is the most important case of this era.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are important encounter cases of course, like the Allagash Incident and the Betty Hill abduction case. I think the Voronezh case in Russia is one of the most bizarre and powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of my favorite researchers, Wendelle Stevens, has passed away,
his guerrilla documentary on the subject is amazing:

       Well the alternative media doesn't have the resources of the major media companies. There are a lot of flaws in many of the regular shows out there that are in the alt category. I feel that it's crucial to understand the news that we get through the media on three levels: - The Official story - Good Research/Conspiracy Theory - Junk Conspiracy or 'Third Force' activity.

       What are your thoughts on some of the recent strange looking objects on Mars by the "rovers", which NASA has refused to comment on?

       I think there is a history of NASA scrubbing images that reflect activity by some other culture operating on these planets. We have a great deal of testimony relating to that. I think what we're seeing in these rover pictures are teasers that can be explained away. I do feel however, that some of the things coming out now, like this new development of an astronomer pointing out what he said was an alien complex blocking out the view of stars in another galaxy was very interesting indeed and probably unscripted...

       It is one star about 1400 light years away. It is KIC 8462852 if you want to read the limited current information. Obviously this is in our galaxy not another one.

       Is there any info that you have regarding the nature of the spacecrafts used by the "Breakaway civilization" is it possible that it could be mercury contained in a gyroscopic device surrounded by iron generators creating a manipulatable magnetic field through the control of the gyroscopic motion of the device containing the mercury?

       You sound like you know a good deal about it. Of course mercury was mentioned as far back as the Vimanas described in ancient indian texts. I would say that some kind of combination of reverse engineered ET craft and Nazi developments at the end of the war has given them a technology so far beyond our own we can't even fathom the details...yet. I would point you to this episode for more on that:

       Thanks for all your contributions to getting the real info out!  I really appreciate the Breakaway Civilization theory and believe the foundations that it could have happened. I'm getting hung up on the old 'What physical evidence is there out in the world right now' question (something I use to reign me back into demanding proof].   What's the best current tangible evidence for a group of people currently 'Breaking away' from society?

       Thank you! I appreciate that. If we understand the term Breakaway Civilization in this context we can get somewhere with it: Science obviously depends on building scientific breakthroughs off of each other. If discoveries are held back, then the group that has made the advance is breaking away from the rest of us. The best evidence is the UFO phenomena! It doesn't conform to any of the rules of aerodynamics that we know of and can pop in and rule our skies at any time. Then pop back out. So, either that's humans using an advanced technology, or it's off-world visitors. In any case, whoever knows about it, has access to it, has re-engineered it and is flying it, is part of a Breakaway Civilization. So, you and I are in one Civilization, they are in a different one and far advanced, technically, not spiritually however...

       Yes! I think that we are looking at a large infrastructure being built underground here on earth. And a major effort to develop similar biosphere developments on other planets. I think this work has proceeded in secret since the sixties. And if someone asks me a question about how JFK and his assassination fits into the Secret Space Program idea I can really lay out some interesting points...This interview I did with Watergate Lawyer Douglas Caddy can give us some clues:

       You ever watch SG-SG-1? I forget the planet, but the inhabitants live underground because of a world war that made the surface uninhabitable. The militarized government people wear uniforms crossed between nazi-era Germany and upper US brass. I see the dumbs as this habitation. It's funny in a sobering way.

       He is a Plasma/Nuclear scientist. On Oct 16th, He release 12 sample Plasma power unit/blueprint to ambassadors and representatives.  He gives world government 10 days to reach peace treaty. If not, this unit will be open sourced. It means anyone on this planet would be energy independent. I have a lot of materials to prove he is legit.

       Would you mind to do a show with him? I am on their group list! It is gonna be mind boggling! It is not only conspiracy but lots hidden news that he was the behind source (for the good part). For example, He taught TEPCO how to clean nuclear waste water. You won't find that in English. I managed to find bits and pieces in Japanese.

       I think that the work of Richard Sauder holds true is this area. We have been hearing about them for years. It certainly is not hypothetical, we of course built many of them during the cold war, so, readapting them for purposes of creating an underground megapolis is totally viable and not even a conspiracy frankly!

       I believe they have a basis in truth. Dulce is an ideal location for a variety of reasons, the tribal lands tie-in, remote location etc, and what they tell us is that there are experiments going on. If we imagine that there are off-world cultures operating here, like Greye etc. we can imagine that either in collaboration with them or in a process of learning about them we have secret test facilities set up to do that. These facilities would be operating completely in the shadows with no transparency at all!

       It's the idea that the Axis powers looted a lot of the world's gold during WW2. Japan supposedly stored a lot of it in underground vaults throughout (a lot in the Philippines). This gold is used to back the "global collateral accounts" with astronomical amounts over which there a lot of fighting within elite circles. It is connected to various hugely denominated "bearer bonds" being discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of this information comes from David Wilcock.

       It is said to be the Japanese gold treasure from looting Asia in WW2, which  the US confiscated after surrender. Actually the amounts of gold reported are enormous, and what i heard never have been given back to their owners.

       Ah this is Yamashita's gold, fascinating subject. Interesting side note, the person who was said to be running the torture/interrogation of the Yamashita's driver was none other than Major General Edward Lansdale who also worked for the CIA. Now Landsdale also showed up in pictures and was identified by some of his retired military colleagues in Dealey Plaza after the JFK Assassination. He is pictured walking by the so called 'Tramps' who were taken into custody after being found in railways cars behind the Texas School Book Depository. They were dressed in good clothes with good haircuts, not very tramp-like at all. They were released that afternoon. Lansdale's presence at both of these events for me is a small window into how the deep state operates.

       Some good stuff in here. What I can say is that in 1963 President Kennedy was removed by forces that form a deep state utilizing elements of intelligence. His intentions to end the space race in favor of cooperation was one of the major factors. Anyone who looks into the assassination will find all sorts of unusual ties to NASA,  and the space program. We need to ask ourselves why these links exist?
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, former nazi Walter Dornberger, who was in charge of Hitler's V2 rocket program before we converted him to work with us,  was a directing officer at Bell Aerospace corporation. He was responsible of the assignment of a young engineer named Michael Paine to Bell Helicopter, a subsidiary located in Fort Worth, Texas.
Paine and his wife would be the hosts to the Oswalds when they returned from Russia. All of the evidence that was used to link Oswald to the assassination came from the Paine household, including the faked backyard photos. That is some deep connection there.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is more on this in my documentary -  Agent Oswald: The CIA Patsy.

       I am very late to the party, but maybe you are still here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was wondering what your thoughts were on the Mandela Effect. Being a "dark journalist" there's no doubt you have heard of it, but I just want to know your opinions about what it could mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, there is 100% something happening because I remember Looney Tunes being Looney Toons, I watched hundreds/thousands of episodes. I also remember Berenstain Bears being BerenSTEIN Bears and in Star Wars, Vader says "Luke, I am your father" instead of "No, I am your father".
      </p>
      <p>
       I also remember Gandalf saying something other than "Fly you fools". A lot of people seem to remember it being "Run you fools".
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of weird stuff, and this for me is the biggest mindfuck ever, because you don't just forget this stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, while I'm here I have another question. Where are all the satellites? Have you ever tried to look for a picture of one? Someone asked me this before and I dug around for hours without finding ANYTHING on the supposedly thousands of satellites orbiting Earth.

       No.... Why did you have to do this to me?
      </p>
      <p>
       It IS Looney Toons. It's not up for debate. I remember that beyond any shadow of doubt. Looney "Tunes" doesn't even make sense. And it totally was the Bearenstein Bears.
      </p>
      <p>
       This legitimately makes me question my sanity somewhat. I don't like all the Matrix comparisons that get thrown around, but this definitely makes me feel like I'm living in some sort of simulation where reality is just made up on the fly. There's no evidence to support that it ever was Looney Toons but I KNOW it was. This is a seemingly insignificant thing, but I feel very lost in this moment.

       let's assume some actual secret ultra super elite existed and was controlling the world. if you have an opinion on these things what do you think their ultimate grand vision / end game would be?

      <p>
       That is the question: who are the forces that are controlling our world and what is it that they are trying to do? This is a major question that takes a lot of research and experience to understand. In my interviews on the Dark Journalist show, I try bring forward the people and ideas I believe come closest to the truth. I do feel that these super elite covert forces are trying to centralize and control through technology at the moment. If they can make the technology that we use everyday give them the data they need to manipulate us and harvest our time and energy, then they are one step closer to their goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why it is paramount that we bring transparency to what is happening is areas like NSA spying, financial manipulation, GMOs, False Flags, UFOs and other topics. Because if we can see the centralization pattern emerging and understand what it means then that's how we'll get the answer to your question.

       Interesting stuff for sure. I've heard a lot about Reich's work from Kenn Thomas who is quite the student of his material. I find Reich's sightings during his travels very interesting indeed. I need to study the concept of Orgone energy a bit more before I can offer anything constructive about it.

       What do you know about the "bearer bonds scandals" in recent years (where fake bonds in incredibly high denominations have been discovered all over the world) and do you think it's related at all to the idea of a breakaway civilization?  If so, can you elaborate on how you think it may be related or who you think may be involved?

       Yes, excellent question, as the Bearer Bonds scandal may in fact be the funding corridor for the Breakaway Civilization. There is the strange fact that at a certain point in the 1980s you could walk into the fed and purchase a buyer bond. This gets complicated, but in my opinion it had to be about the best money laundering mechanism available. I think we had the Nazi loot factor at the end of the war that caused the shadowy financial network to look for specialized monetary instruments. I learned a great deal of this from Dr. Joseph P. Farrell's work and a wonderful book called 'Trading with the Enemy' by Charles Higham. If we had more time we'd drink coffee and talk for hours about this. Important question there. Here is the Farrell episode:

       Well you see I can imagine NASA coming out and claiming a microbe type of life exists. They recently came forward about water on Mars, etc. But the advanced off-world culture there, whose secret serves them so well, they will never willingly give up that knowledge.

       Well let's keep in mind that although we think of NASA as a civilian space agency in actuality it is under the control of the military. The military is one of the most secretive groups and would never give up information they found strategically valuable. So, the question becomes: is it strategically valuable to release that information?

       It's convoluted, but certainly there was a pressure on the political side to invade Syria. When the false Chem weapons story was exposed it took the air out of the balloon with the help of the independent media. In fact I would say it was alt media that stood the forces of war down during that period and they slinked away temporarily. From what I understand, somehow the only objective we have is the removal of Assad. Nothing sways us from this. So we need to ask ourselves this question: why do these forces in the Deep State want to remove Assad so badly?

       Dark Journalism is a new way of looking at the whole spectrum of the implications of a story that comes to us in the media. It observes 3 levels or types of stories: - Official Story - Independent research story (often called the conspiracy theory) - Junk Conspiracy or 'Third Force' stories planted by intelligence agencies to discredit the second type and reinforce the first type. In other words if I say to you the financial crash was just some greedy bad actors in the financial sphere, that's the official story, if I say research shows that the crash was planned, that's the independent story, if I say actually they used the money to build FEMA camps to round up your neighbors, that's the Junk conspiracy often planted by Third Force actors. These patterns operate over and over again in the mainstream media. If you can see them operate, you'll have the key to Dark Journalism.

       Hah really no, not at all. Regular journalism hugs number one and only promotes number three to destroy number 2. JFK, 9/11, the Financial Crash of 2008, the media was complicit with the deep forces behind these events...

       Well thank you for a wonderful and hard question haha! I really love them all and find they each have different aspects. I think that Former Watergate Lawyer Douglas Caddy coming out and revealing for the first time that CIA super-spy E. Howard Hunt told him JFK was assassinated over wanting to reveal the 'Alien Presence' is it.  You really couldn't ask for a better show as a journalist. Here we have a historical figure, telling us about other major events in history. Even Coast to Coast AM picked up on this special episode. This is the link to that one:

       I do believe there are elements of the deep state trying to figure out how they can instigate a war for profit in the near future. The ISIL phenomena has something to do with it as do these tensions we see with Russia, Ukraine etc. I believe however, that the world's appetite for war is waning and it will take a major move to talk us into that.

       And on how long does the Breakaway Civilization think they can keep a monopoly on the advanced technology, I think they believe they can keep it up forever. There is a great debate about whether or not 3D Printing falls into this category of exotic reveals or not. I'm trying to do some deep research on that...

       This is a great question. I think the Fourth Reich did have a base there. In a conversation I had with Richard Alan Miller he mentioned to me that in his black project involvement he was sent to Antarctica to investigate a Nazi base that appeared to have been destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, Byrd, in my opinion encountered an off-world culture that put on quite a display of UFO tech in his travels there.

       Well there's an example I couldn't eliminate in my America 2020 video with Former Assistant Housing Secretary Catherine Austin Fitts at 1 hour and 47 minutes in. As we are discussing the CFR a mechanical voice comes in and just says 'slave.'

       I have had interference on a few major episodes that I worked to eliminate. The targeting was only successful is frying one episode so far. One quick point is that I'm quite technically adept on the tech I'm using so I know the difference between technical difficulties and interference.

       that's pretty intriguing. ever found out where the interference was coming from? i wonder what they're trying to achieve by doing that. that example seems kinda minor compared to what the m.i.b. are capable of. perhaps they are trying to intimidate you.

       Well you've got the technology down better than I would, hah. I think what is interesting is that there was a recent hearing where the commander of the Strategic Command, Admiral Cecil Haney, testified: “we’ve seen very disturbing trends in space, particularly from nation states like China, as well as Russia, who have been public about their counterspace endeavors and ambitions.” I think it's pretty obvious that with China, Russia and now India in the space picture, the chances for the militarization of space are growing. I also think they are trying to protect certain discoveries that have been made that will show real evidence of off-world cultures operating in space.

       I have a question about the secret space program. In the series Cosmic Disclosure, David Gorde(I think that is his name) mentioned that there are several different breakaway civilizations, and that some of them want full disclosure to the people on Earth. He mentions that what we learn is dependent on which group comes out on top. I was wondering if there is any information pertaining to which of these groups is likely to come out on top. Sorry if that is too vague. I didn't want to go back and re-watch the video before posting the question.

       Hi DJ, Hopefully I'm not too late with this AMA. There is a huge movement of flat earthers at this moment. At first when I thought it was a joke but to my horror the idea is rife. No matter how much logic, mathematics or astronomy science, nothing budges their belief. It feels like its some kind of psyop to discredit the truth movement.... what are your thoughts on this?

       Hi Dark Journalist Daniel Liszt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just thought you might wanna know something right in front of our eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel or, "is ra el" and sometimes said as the "israelite" which breaks down to this: "is-ra-el-ite" or "is ra elite". See that "elite" there on the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       An elite is a small group of powerful people, such as an oligarchy, that controls a disproportionate amount of wealth or political power in society. This group holds a superior position among the ordinary people and exercises greater privilege than the rest of the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't that interesting.

       Hi Daniel....
I was curious if you could touch upon the occult aspects of this breakaway civilization material. Do you think that there is an overt reason for our exposure to this material? I ask because it is often thought that the elites want to wipe us out, so why indoctrinate us into their mindset? Thanks.

       When will the Dark Journalists stop focusing on the 9/11 obvious such as controlled demolition and instead start focusing on the WHO did it. The real perps...or is it still after 14 years to scary a subject to touch?

       Jimmy didn't ask you to tell us who did it, instead he wondered when you will
       <em>
        start focusing

       on who did it. It's a legitimate thing to bring up, as we already know for over a decade now that it was a false flag event.

       I listened to the whole thing today. I gotta say I'm genuinely impressed at the various things being brought up. I was highly surprised to hear Dr Judy Wood's analysis being brought up. 
This was a very good interview.
That said, and I don't mean this in a discreditting way, although a bit disappointing, but the "Who did it" was basically boiled down to Cheney, Rumsfeld etcetera in this interview. When people wonder about who did these attacks they are surely aware that Cheney and Rumsfeld had huge parts in this, but they are not the master masterminds. Everyone can safely assume that. They might have been the 'assassins' so to speak but what people want to know is who hired these assassins?

       I recently watched the 10/24/11 presentation Dr Judy Wood gave at New Horizons (in the UK) concerning secret energy applications deployed by the US govt. (

       Well first I'd say that Judy's work is stellar and as innovative as it comes. The evidence that there were advanced technologies utilized in that tragedy that are reminiscent of Tesla's work or some of the discoveries of the 'Hutchison effect' are beyond doubt. I think that the Phoenix Lights, although it's in a different category, is the public demonstration of a powerful advanced technology that doesn't fit into our modern paradigm, but there it is. We need to understand what is happening in the use of these advanced technologies to gain a greater view and transparency of the powers operating in our world. That's why I decided to become a Dark Journalist.

       hm. I disagree with your application of this framework to flat earth theory. I agree there is plenty of disinfo out there. tho the no planes used isn't so obviously incorrect because I agree it is very likely not commercial planes that were used. tho possible they were still military planes painted up. it's not an entirely invalid train of thought to ask - what did fly into the towers - is it not what we were told?
      </p>
      <p>
       I 'll tell you what I think is for sure disinfo - and that is that nukes were used in 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway - I'm of the opinion that you gotta let the evidence speak for itself - as outrageous a claim may be - I might ignore and say it sounds impossible -  but I never label it as a certifiable lie - until I've heard them out. the evidence for flat earth is amazingly sound. not saying they are right beyond all doubt, but they are right to demonstrate - globe earth is not a given and has never been proven and flat makes more sense with our given knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you assume it's disinfo without hearing them out - I can't respect that.

       There are compelling stories about Mossad knowledge of the attacks beforehand. I find the work of Peter Dale Scott pertinent on this, I do feel that it is what he calls a 'Deep State Event' so very hard to pin one group, but more of a coalescence of interests. Certainly the official story is bunk... Here is the episode on this with Professor Scott:

       Hah, that is the power-packed question and I love it. Let's see, There was a report before this recent floating city thing in China about a whole village disappearing, then reappearing, oddly enough it was in legitimate news sources for awhile (?). It reminds me very much of the Voronezh incident in Russia in 1989. I went back and found even a newscast from Nightline about it where they interviewed the Russian police chief. In that case a whole park full of people on a busy day witnessed a craft come down and aliens appear. At one point a young boy disappeared and reappeared before everyone's eyes! Later I went and found an interview with that same boy as an adult where he recalled the experience. Wow! Wait was the question...? Hah Blue beam, well this idea of a government planned invasion with holograms faking a UFO attack is discredited now. I think it would be too elaborate, however they would love to use the off-world cultures visiting as an enemy or threat we need protection from. In essence, they don't need to make it up as much as distort it...

       I'm going to look that up - that sounds incredible! Voronezh? I hadn't heard of that one. The Blue Beam thing does keep regaining traction every so often... perfect content for Dr Who as well then? 
I'm going to lean more towards dimensional aspects here!

       We can't reproduce the Great Pyramid's precision even with all of our modern technology. Certainly these cultures were advanced and possessed a kind of technology that has been forgotten through history. They handled stones weighing hundred of tons with the kind of ease that is hard to fathom. We can argue the point that they were more or less advanced than we are today technologically, but it's clear that they understood the connection between their technological achievement and their spiritual development better than we do at present.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my research, they were far advanced psychically . The legends of the Atlantean power stones suggest a technology that was connected to their intuitive abilities.
