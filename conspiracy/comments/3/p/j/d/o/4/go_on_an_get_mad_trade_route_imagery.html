    <div class="md"><p>explain this to me about the globe earth: </p>

<p>the earth spins on an axis. this means if you are standing at the equator you are making a 24,900 mile rotation in 24 hours. therefore you are moving just a bit faster than 1000 miles an hour while standing still. you never feel this movement because the rotation is constant. constant speed feels like nothing it&#39;s only acceleration and deceleration we feel. great. all good. </p>

<p>but if you are standing very near the south pole the distance you spin in a day could be as slight as only a ~few miles an hour. because you are very near the axis you have a much smaller circle to travel in so you travel a much smaller distance by standing still - than somebody standing at the equator, but you never feel your own motion so long as you stay near the south pole because the spin of the earth is constant. </p>

<p>however - when you travel - from say alaska to central america - in addition to the acceleration of your airplane - standing still -- -is a difference of ~800 miles an hour.  which far exceeds what the human body can withstand in acceleration in a day. you have to accelerate beyond speeds the human body can survive over the course of a day when you travel from far south to the equator, and vice versa if we live on a globe spinning on an axis. </p>

<p>how do you explain that people do not experience incredible physical trauma or death making this journey?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not know.  flat earth model doesn&#39;t necessarily alter or dictate shape of other celestial bodies. however it does necessitate that both moon and sun are much much closer than previously thought - and are circling above earth. - the sun like a lightbulb illuminating a (~1/4) of earth area direct underneath it&#39;s path -  and reaching indirectly to 1/2 - as it circles. (giving everybody (as is observable)  ~ the sunlight we all get. )diagrams show it better than my words. </p>

<p>however -- I&#39;ve been wondering if both earth and moon are more circular - illuminations on a dome-like surface/substance above us. and less so spheres, </p>

<p>as for the other planets -- I have even less theory. but I do think assuming only what we can see in space is all that is there -  is like looking at a forest at night and saying the fireflies are all there is, or looking at the ocean in moonlight and saying the white caps float on their own - and there is nothing below -- we don&#39;t know how to illuminate/ see the sky yet, imho. I know nasa will tell you otherwise - that the sun is illuminating what there is and that&#39;s how we know what there is and isn&#39;t - but I no longer buy what they are saying - after really really thinking about it. -- this does not at all mean they are hiding aliens - whatever, that&#39;s not what I think . I just think they are lying about even knowing/going. and there is still way more than we realize to discover </p>

    <div class="md"><p>we can not see that far. that is the explanation offered by the flat earth theory that I have read and i think it makes a lot of sense. there is a limit to how far the eye can see. what we thin of as the other hemisphere and the sky above that land is too far for us to see, </p>

<p>you might say - but we see stars and planets much farther away, but actually the argument given for that by accepted science is that we do not see them at their true distance - we see the light that has traveled to us and reaches a distance we are e capable of seeing. ( I don&#39;t even know if I believe that about stars because if the light is really traveling to us I don&#39;t see why it doesn&#39;t travel all the way and make little lights on the dark ground on a moonless night - but anyway) </p>

<p>the eye can&#39;t see that far - is the best I&#39;ve got. perhaps there is an even better explanation, for why we can&#39;t see the southern hemisphere sky from up north. - as there are a lot of potential explanations. but I don&#39;t know what they are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol there are a lot of potential explanations?  It&#39;s just too far!?  you are seriously underestimating the power of modern optics.  I can take a sharp photo of the andromeda galaxy with my dslr and a 300mm lens (which isn&#39;t even that much reach), but I can&#39;t take a photo of the southern cross because &quot;It&#39;s too far!?&quot;  Asking why stars don&#39;t make little lights on the ground is like asking why your flashlight doesn&#39;t illuminate the dark side of the moon, and furthermore, go out and look at the reflection of the stars in a lake.  Plenty of light makes it to our surface from the stars.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t got the answer to your photography question. it&#39;s not my area of expertise, perhaps the atmosphere effects our vision horizontally more than it does upwards. </p>

<p>either way -- re: piloting - when you fly an airplane do you correct for curvature  - and for varying speeds of spin of the earth when you fly north and south?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>and yes, our vision is more affected when looking horizontally through the atmosphere.  however, its not like these stars are stationary.  We have known for centuries that they spin overhead and process through different parts of the night sky depending on the time of year.</p>

<p>You are very right that looking foolish only matters if you care.  I just get angry that this idea is spreading so fast because it is so easily proven false, and i feel that it is being used to discredit the entire conspiracy community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never stated otherwise, yeah - I fully admit this is all a guess. I genuinely do not know - or believe I know what the shape of the earth is. However - I see what appear to me to be impossibilities about the globe model and flat looks like a better model - I&#39;m also sure the flat model is still super crude compared to what there really is to fully understand. But I see problems with the globe model. Problems that I have not been able to solve yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>your point?  are you saying that is why you can&#39;t produce this photo?  The reason you can&#39;t take this photo is because the southern cross is below the horizon when in the northern hemisphere.  It has nothing to do with optics.  I am a proficient photographer and pilot...not sure you want to go there with this</p>
