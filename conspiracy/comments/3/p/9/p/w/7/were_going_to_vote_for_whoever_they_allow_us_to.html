    <div class="md"><p>My pet theory is once in office, the &quot;real&quot; powers that be stop by and explain to our recently elected exactly what will happen to them if they don&#39;t do what they&#39;re told... I can even picture them throwing out something about the Kennedy family and reminding them of family and friends.</p>

<p>I would imagine that the &quot;power&quot; also explains just how whoever was elected got to be elected, and that they can play ball or be disgraced, or dead, or both, or worse.</p>

<p>Force and violence... an effective tool since the Hittites took over the cotton crops.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is rich enough to where he might be able to tell the rich people who really run this country to stick it in their butts.</p>

<p>Rand Paul is intelligent enough to figure out a way to tell them to kiss off when they come to him (after he&#39;s elected) and read him the riot act; &quot;this is why we made sure you were hired - because you are going to do this, and this, and this...&quot; (or we&#39;ll kill you and your family and your name will be a national disgrace from now on)...</p>

<p>Don&#39;t think the people who really run this country do it by the friendship method, do you?</p>

<p>Violence, coercion, threat of death to them and their families... age old tactics that work really well... even here in the &quot;enlightened&quot; ages.</p>
