       They want to believe in the good old days... they want to think that life in America doesn't have a dark black shadow ghosting everything and making a joke of our history and Constitution... they want to think that everything is as it appears and that life goes on like a 50's family show.

       Correct. Even if you did manage to vote some legitimate change in, they'd be corrupted within a month. Remember how quickly Obama changed after the first inauguration.

       My pet theory is once in office, the "real" powers that be stop by and explain to our recently elected exactly what will happen to them if they don't do what they're told... I can even picture them throwing out something about the Kennedy family and reminding them of family and friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would imagine that the "power" also explains just how whoever was elected got to be elected, and that they can play ball or be disgraced, or dead, or both, or worse.

       Trump is rich enough to where he might be able to tell the rich people who really run this country to stick it in their butts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rand Paul is intelligent enough to figure out a way to tell them to kiss off when they come to him (after he's elected) and read him the riot act; "this is why we made sure you were hired - because you are going to do this, and this, and this..." (or we'll kill you and your family and your name will be a national disgrace from now on)...
      </p>

       Don't think the people who really run this country do it by the friendship method, do you?

       Violence, coercion, threat of death to them and their families... age old tactics that work really well... even here in the "enlightened" ages.

       Exactley, its a game to convince the public using phshcological tactics that the whole thing is by the people, of the people. The reality is that the whole system is run by special interests for special interests and it would be better if the people turned away from the whole dam thing and started focusing on community driven stuff. Don't give this beast any energy, its on its way out.

       "They've" done away with a lot of the Constitution claiming "the founding fathers didn't realize what would happen in the future and so could never have anticipated ______________" (which is hogwash because they understood perfectly), but one of the few things they're having problems getting rid of is the vote... They've even skewed it as much as they can with this bullshit "electoral college", but they STILL need us to vote.
