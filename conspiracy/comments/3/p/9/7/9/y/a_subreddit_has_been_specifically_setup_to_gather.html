       That sub is based on an association fallacy. Some racist people post here, therefore the subreddit is racist. That's just idiotic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I thought you were referring to Canary Mission, which is dedicated to keeping people who were involved in anti-Israel activism from obtaining jobs by "exposing them." This theme has popped up more than once.

       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3dsifv/a_user_has_inflitrated_and_exposed_a_prozionist/">
        From the Israeli operation targetting /r/worldnews:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Additionally, if you see any obvious anti-israel users. Lookup their username in Google or check their comment history and see if you can find any contact information at all, including their email address or social media sites and please send them over to me.
       </p>
       <p>
        You will be paid and additional $5 per email/contact info if it's clearly identifiable from their Reddit username.

       It's not a healthy way to do things. This promotes an aggression towards an opinion and warrants an attack in one way or another because you disagree with what someone has to say. It's wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people see negative publicity for this sub else where on reddit , their curiosity brings them here and the actual posts making it to the top of the front page here make them stay. When it is obvious people are being censored in other parts it is wildly discussed here with posts gaining a lot of attention and discussion from all points of view.

       Let them cast a bad name it only brings people here to answer for themselves: no r/conspiracy is not racist.

       No, the reason the sub exists at all is the frequency, heavily upvoted and repetition of racist and
       <em>
        in particular

       Antisemitic posts on this sub.

       I submit that this sub, as with many anti-government discussion groups, is being used by Stormcunt to disinfo and recruit.

       It's the frequency and upvoted nature of those racist posts which would seem to indicate you're being played.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the posts were not so regular or so heavily upvoted (often in double digits) then you might have a point but they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's either that a lot of
       <strong>
        individual
       </strong>
       posters submit and upvote racist content and opinions OR that a small number of racist posters using sockpuppets are upvoting and submitting racist content and opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would prefer to believe that of the two choices I listed that the latter is true - that there are sockpuppets of a minority collective of racist posters who've infiltrated your sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       In either case there's a significant amount of racist content and opinion on this sub - enough to fill the submissions of
       <a href="/r/isconspiracyracist">
        /r/isconspiracyracist
       </a>
       daily.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're unsure of what I'm talking about go visit the sub and look for yourself.

       Again, this is about the frequency and regularly upvoted nature of said racist posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are not uncommon on this sub - they are a daily occurrence.
      </p>
      <p>
       These posts do indeed have a measurable impact on this sub.

       Despite your strange use of the word "input" I understand your meaning.  To answer you I would pose some salient questions:-
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aren't more
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       posters questioning the validity of these posts WITHIN this sub?  Is this not a sub about questioning the status quo?  Is this not a sub about questioning sources and using research to disprove statements?  Why are these posts just existing and not being regularly dealt with?  Why are your moderators not engaging with your users to ENCOURAGE the questioning of these posts?  Why is racist, upvoted content so easily measured on this sub?  Are many of your members just blindly upvoting it?

       The thread you're thinking of- the famous stormfront recruitment thread that referenced this subreddit- was actually written by a Jewish terrorist who pretended to be a high ranking member of Isis and was arrested by the FBI in Florida for sharing bomb making information online.

       His Isis Twitter name was austrailiwitness.

       nearly 40 times.

       In fact, I used to post my own comments there, but they banned me. That whiny little Jtrig bitch, ducky, then actually complained that he was banned from somewhere. It's as if these people have zero self-awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last time I was featured there, they posted my comment saying "hey don't ever say anything bad about Jews, that would be NAZI!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Now how did they "interpret" that? They "interpreted" that to mean "this guy wants to kill all the jews!"

       Duckvimes is very upset when I point out just how RACIST the Jewish community is.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, it's "RACIST" for a non-Jewish person to call a Jewish person "racist."
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's "anti-racist" for a Jewish person to call a non-Jewish person "racist."
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Because Jews are God's Chosen People and superior to "gentiles" - that's a mainstream opinion among Jews, especially in Israel.

       Let's open a dialog to try to help them realize what they are caught up in.  They are clearly reading this message right now.  If there is a dialog it will be here, not In the midst of their little circle jerk.

       Here's an easy way to tell if you're coming up against your own conditioning: if a topic about history, religion or politics comes up and it causes an emotional reaction in you rather than an intellectual response, it's most likely conditioning/programming.

       The emotional response is the programming's defense mechanism. If reason and the intellectual process can be stymied and the topic is kept in the emotional realm, no thought is occurring and the programming is maintained.

       I'm an artist, I'm a socialist, I sympathize with communists, I speak up for gay rights, the nazis shot and tortured people just like me also, it was not all jewish people.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I have the same authority as any Jewish person to talk about what we learned from world war II, and I say that the Jewish people are replicating the same actions of the nazis themselves against the palestinians and when necessary against americans to keep us writing the blank checks and as official allies even though we get nothing out of the deal.

       If you won't be racist the shills will try their best to paint you that way. It's a lose/lose scenario to post in a thread like this. The reality is that this hyper PC trend is just a system of control for simple minded people. You control thought by making people too afraid to speak their minds in fear of offending someone. It can be on anything from race, sex, religion, political stance, etc. People start to self-censor too afraid to discuss their beliefs in public. The reality is that peoples thoughts change and evolve through open discourse. The people TRULY offended by something should be for open debate and frequent conversations because that opens peoples minds. These shills are just trying to manipulate/control so they attack, call names, and polarize topics.

       I'm no fan of Israel, but even the phrase "some jew lawyer" is rude and shows your hostility toward Jewish Americans just because they are Jewish or had ancestors who were. And I believe I know more about "here" than you do. Since I have 160+K karma on

       Some jew lawyer is exactly representative who would take a case like the one you proposed. There is a reason for the jew lawyer stereotype, and far too often the jew, lawyer or not, lives up to that stereotype, even embodies it. Thats the way it is.

       Well then remove the post. Im sure you dont see the humor in acting like a jew lawyer when you get offended. Jews, the people born with the ability to find a loophole in a stopsign.  You arent helping the jew cause any.

       5-6 million jews AND communists, socialists, labor leaders, gays, artists and intellectuals were murdered by the nazi regime.

       Now jewish people use just about every nazi tool but gas chambers against the palestinians and if socialist artists like myself call them out on it, we get accused of being holocaust deniers and classical antisemites.

       Yes this, im an artist and a Democratic cultural libertarian socialist . I know sounds pretentious but ima keep adding shit till I get it right. People should give more recognition to those who suffer under a totalitarian regime or any government that starts to over step its bound for objectively evil behavior. It's difficult to bring up social issues I want to talk about without sounding like anti anyone. I'm not trying to be anti anyone I love humanity equally Why is it that these discussions can be being taken in such a way. meanwhile they cut funding for the arts and bomb innocent people over seas makes me sad.

       I'm not seeing the issue here. There
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       an anti-semitic element to this subreddit. Just as there are anti-muslim elements in other subreddits, which other people also point out. You are free to point them out as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trick in criticizing Israel's policies is to leave religion and ethnicity out of it. There are valid criticisms to be made, but it's hard to see them in this subreddit without it being presented through really questionable sources and a patina of code-language that ultimately boils down to "
       <em>
        tha joooooos
       </em>
       ".
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the costs of free speech (which is relative as reddit is ultimately a corporate entity) is that you may be called out for what you say, and a subreddit may be judged from outside for what its members say.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can then make an argument defending this subreddit, a few bad apples, etc. But they're making a compelling case in my eyes.

        The trick in criticizing Israel's policies is to leave religion and ethnicity out of it.

      <p>
       That's difficult since Israel uses religion and ethnicity as excuses for their actions.

       Bush Jr. and many politicians repeatedly use Christianity as a justification for everything from invading nations, to limiting civil liberties to cutting aid to the poor.  Those things are antithetical to Christianity but by your logic we should refer to them as the policies of Christianity, not of America.

       That well may be, and may be with regards to any other government or institution's policies, but critiques based on actions, hard data, and neutral facts will show an argument's merit and maturity level.

       It's perfectly acceptable to criticize the Jewish community. It's absolutely ok to point out negative generalizations about the Jewish community.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, Jewish people are
       <strong>
        just people
       </strong>
       - they are not Special Chosen Superhumans we're not allowed to criticize.

       Generalizations are how the brain works. By your definition, literally every single human being alive is "racist" - so that makes the entire concept meaningless.

       Humans certainly are prejudiced, it's what you do with knowing so that matters. Improve or surrender to base instinct?

       Jews are culturally an ethnic group of people whose members are also unified by a common religious background. Individually, obviously, they may personally change their religious views.

       You may be surprised to know that not everyone subscribes to your social and political beliefs. Your judgements about what is "improvement" and "baser instincts" are your own and there's no reason why anyone should agree with you.

       Again, that's conditioning. People, Americans especially, have been conditioned to be unable hear any critique of Israel without having an emotional reaction that resembles disgust or anger and they say to themselves, "Aw hell. They're blaming da joos" even when "da joos" aren't being blamed.

       Granted, there are a lot of knuckleheads that LIKE blaming someone, be it Jews/Muslims/Blacks/Republicans, etc. But Israel's had such an overarching hold on the American narrative for three generations or more that most Americans can no longer discern between honest criticism of Israel and "blaming da joos".

      </p>

       But now the mossad is neck deep in all the color revolutions ie libya and they are doing all manner of nasty tricks to get palestinians off the land the jewish settlers want, including reports of poisoning wells that have to be investigated, but since they just shoot children with sniper rifles regularly, I have to consider every allegation because their reputation at this point is very very bad.

       If that makes me anti-semitic, shrug.  I don't see any use for the term in the modern world, any more than we would use antimuslim or antichristian, with the same connotation.

       jewish people are profoundly antimuslim and antipalestinian, in a very racist way.  I'm not the one who colonized land that wasn't mine through dirty tricks and then uses more dirty tricks to keep expanding it even though tens of millions of people in the region hate them.

       i argue with myself whether to use jewish or israeli here, there were of course the peace rallies this weekend where some jewish and muslim people protested the war, and i would have stood with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       but how can i even refer to the israeli state and huge jewish support apparatus in the usa without sweeping generalizations?
      </p>
      <p>
       i find that the muslim jewish and christian religions contain within them the bad ideas that lead to permanent war, and that at the moment the jewish element is leading the charge to oblivion, but it's very difficult to talk about with the minefield of 'sweeping racist generalizations' you risk making.
      </p>
      <p>
       lately i've gotten tired of worrying most about the feelings of the few who manage to read the 'holy' books and end up with a message of peace, like aren't these apologists shielding those committing the atrocities?

       So because you've found examples of racism on a sub that literally anyone on earth can comment on, that means people who
       <em>

       like that are...being played? Huh?

       The thread you're thinking of- the famous stormfront recruitment thread that referenced this subreddit- was actually written by a Jewish terrorist who pretended to be a high ranking member of Isis and was arrested by the FBI in Florida for sharing bomb making information online.
      </p>
      <p>
       His Isis Twitter name was austrailiwitness.
