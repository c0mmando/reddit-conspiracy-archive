    <div class="md"><p>I like his message.  But honestly it could just be politician talk.  Say whatever it takes to get elected, and then become a puppet to the unelected bureaucracy that really runs the government.</p>

<p>Obama ran on ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, closing Guantanamo Bay, raising the minimum wage, and enacting renewable energy policies.  None of those things have happened.  And he just announced that the war in Afghanistan, which he previously said had ended, will be continued indefinitely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wouldn&#39;t the next president also face the same issues?  Unfulfilled campaign promises being blocked by Congress?</p>

<p>Obamacare passed because it benefits the insurance companies.  It is not socialized health care like the rest of the world.  Obamacare forces everyone to have health insurance, or face penalties if they do not.  The health care plans offered through Obamacare are very expensive, and offer very poor coverage.  Health care is still very expensive in America, and most poor people feel shut out from access to health care (particularly mental health care).  Nothing has fundamentally changed about health care in America as a result of Obamacare.</p>

<p>Obamacare was also deeply rooted in &quot;Romneycare.&quot;  If you remember, Mitt Romney was Obama&#39;s opponent in 2012.  Mitt Romney also criticized Obamacare, because it was politically unpopular, but in reality, he was the author of Obamacare.  It&#39;s all a very silly game.</p>
