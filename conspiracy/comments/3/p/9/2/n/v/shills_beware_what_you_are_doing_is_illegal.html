       <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-shilling.htm">
        Shilling is an often illegal practice used in many different fields to engage the interest of a crowd. A shill is a person who has associations with a person offering an idea, or a product, and the practice dates back into antiquity. Usually the shill looks like an average person in the crowd, but his or her enthusiasm for the product, or the speech of a politician, plays on crowd psychology to elicit positive response from others.

       Clearly shills don't exist. They are the boogeyman for butt-hurt internet users just like gang-stalking doesn't exist because everyone who is gang-stalked is schizophrenic. Hope I cleared that up for you.

       I always ignore positive feedback and go straight to the negative. If there aren't many or their reasons are unimportant to me, then I know the product is alright.
If however there are lots of negatives that make sense, no amount of positives can make me buy anything.

       Lawsuits do not dictate what is legal and what is not. They're predicted on damages. Not legality. Losing a lawsuit doesn't mean you're a criminal, nor can it result in being incarcerated. See the civil lawsuit which found OJ Simpson liable for the two murders he was criminally acquitted for. They proved he murdered two people, in that civil lawsuit. All he had to do was pay the families damages.

       You can accuse me of being motivated by jealousy. Why am I not allowed to point out that by dismissing dissenters as shills, this sub is deliberately drawing a line between those who belong (those who agree with a particular theory), and those who don't?

       Drawing a line? Someone is just pointing out facts so others can understand what is happening. We need to remember that everyone is not on the same level of knowledge and understanding of the online world along with the deception that happens within it. Life is a consistent learning process.

       It's simple: Emotions. People who cannot accept others organically disagree with them are emotionally attached to their theories and ideas. Which is all well and good - passion isn't a bad thing - it's just not at all scientific or evidence in the least.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I really don't understand is how people can't realize that if the purpose of a shill is to derail a topic towards their own ends, then the number one thing they can do to achieve that is (ironically) call someone a shill and write their ideas off entirely, without inspection or consideration. The best is when they preach about the free exchange of ideas while simultaneously ignoring any they deem to have come from a "shill".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a pure ad hominem attack. It serves to do nothing but derail a conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not arguing shills don't exist. What I'm arguing is that it's irrelevant. If their argument stands up to reason and evidence, what does it matter where it came from? If it doesn't, then their argument can be shown to be flawed, regardless of their paycheck.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shill stands on the argument, the argument doesn't stand on the shill. Just like anyone else. Knock the argument out, not the shill. Address the argument in debates, not the person.

       Wouldn't a shill be able to manipulate the votes? That means they can hide opinions, or make idiotic opinions appear to be the consensus, which does actually convince some people if they are crowd followers. They probably tweak the votes a bit so as not to be very obvious (I know you're probably going to ask "but why aren't my comments upvoted to a thousand then?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Totally irrelevant, huh? What's the point of saying it's irrelevant? Why are you apologizing for public relations?

       Also, wouldn't a shill be skilled in the art of deceiving people using logical fallacies? Why are you pro logical fallacy?

       Personally I do look at downvoted comments. I don't see them as being censored.

      <p>
       I usually don't downvote people, particularly not with the intent of hiding their comments, only for rudeness or poor logic.

       What I do find interesting is this idea of this sub being populated with shills, of it being brigaded, just because people are expressing their dissent.

       Of course it seems really strange to you. Conspiracists thrive on coincidences and connections regardless of evidence.
