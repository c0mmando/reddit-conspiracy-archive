<p>More cases:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/technology/internet/15lift.html?_r=1&amp;emc=eta1">Lifestyle Lift, a cosmetic surgery company, reached a settlement with the State of New York over its attempts to fake positive consumer reviews on the Web. The company had ordered employees to pretend they were satisfied customers and write glowing reviews of its face-lift procedure on Web sites</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-shilling.htm">Shilling is an often illegal practice used in many different fields to engage the interest of a crowd. A shill is a person who has associations with a person offering an idea, or a product, and the practice dates back into antiquity. Usually the shill looks like an average person in the crowd, but his or her enthusiasm for the product, or the speech of a politician, plays on crowd psychology to elicit positive response from others.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s simple: Emotions. People who cannot accept others organically disagree with them are emotionally attached to their theories and ideas. Which is all well and good - passion isn&#39;t a bad thing - it&#39;s just not at all scientific or evidence in the least. </p>

<p>What I really don&#39;t understand is how people can&#39;t realize that if the purpose of a shill is to derail a topic towards their own ends, then the number one thing they can do to achieve that is (ironically) call someone a shill and write their ideas off entirely, without inspection or consideration. The best is when they preach about the free exchange of ideas while simultaneously ignoring any they deem to have come from a &quot;shill&quot;. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a pure ad hominem attack. It serves to do nothing but derail a conversation. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing shills don&#39;t exist. What I&#39;m arguing is that it&#39;s irrelevant. If their argument stands up to reason and evidence, what does it matter where it came from? If it doesn&#39;t, then their argument can be shown to be flawed, regardless of their paycheck. </p>

<p>The shill stands on the argument, the argument doesn&#39;t stand on the shill. Just like anyone else. Knock the argument out, not the shill. Address the argument in debates, not the person.</p>

That means they can hide opinions, or make idiotic opinions appear to be the consensus, which does actually convince some people if they are crowd followers.

<p>Totally irrelevant, huh? What&#39;s the point of saying it&#39;s irrelevant? Why are you apologizing for public relations? </p>

We need to remember that everyone is not on the same level of knowledge and understanding of the online world along with the deception that happens within it. Life is a consistent learning process. </p>
