    <div class="md"><p>Who watches tv still? It is like quitting smoking but there is a host of other stuff to do. Will I watch a movie or show 3-5 times a week? Yes but I also go days without even really wanting too. </p>

<p>I have went periods in my past that did not have a tv due to whatever reasons and it was a big deal to people around me for some reason. </p>

<p>And the longer I go without being consumed by television the more I see how it really does control the mass population indirectly or on purpose. Leaning way more to on purpose though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most effective parts of MK-Ultra were very boring - propaganda, control of press, pornography (did you know that Playboy and Penthouse were CIA fronts, and in fact the famous Playboy mansion was used to video tape people, like MLK, having sex with prostitutes to use as blackmail?) and the like.</p>

<p>The exotic stuff, the drugs, torture, &quot;brainwashing&quot; etc., were far less effective.</p>

<p>The best way to control someone&#39;s mind is to control the culture. That Television box in your living room is the best brainwashing device ever created.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Brainwashing&quot; and propaganda are the same thing.</p>

<p>I think that the LSD experiments either backfired or we may have, at least partially, misunderstood them. This is about mind control in the same way that the Catholic Church is about mind control. It&#39;s about constructing a reality beyond that which we can see, touch, taste, hear, and smell. The experiments may have backfired in the sense that we now have the whole &quot;New Age&quot; movement, which got a huge boost from LSD and offers an alternate reality different to that intended or we may have misunderstood and that was one of the aims of the program in the first place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a great blogger at anolen.com that has, unfortunately, turned off her blog in order to write a book. She was very informed about the history of CIA and their various nefarious schemes and was one of my absolute favorite blogs. It&#39;s from her that I got the concept that propaganda was the real meat of the MK-Ultra program and the exotic stuff was mostly a failure or at the least of very limited effectiveness.</p>

<p>The LSD stuff I&#39;ve written about quite extensively, see here:</p>

Photonics, optogenetics, accoustics, sonogenetics, and magnetic resonance programming. </p>

<p>These sciences can be used to induce, both invasively and non-invasively, many biological and psychological responses in living bodies, as vague as tiredness and queasiness, and as specific as the perception of specific musical notes or the recollection of memories which were not actually real, but were the biochemical response to the externally applied waveforms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>2 words that encompass it all: PERCEPTION MANAGEMENT. </p>

<p>On a large scale: mass media brain-washing through gate keeping, high-jacking the narrative, spin, NLP and reitterations i.e. repeating the same over and over until the lie becomes an adopted truth. There&#39;s absolutely no way of escaping this principle unless you retreat from society completely, which is, for most of us, an unbearable situation for long periods of time since we&#39;re biologically programmed to be social and curious animals. </p>

<p>On an individual level: driving a person completely paranoid with subtle changes at first, more obvious ones later on to add to the effect. When a person is tethering on the verge of a full-blown psychotic break, that&#39;s when they take over the individual and turn him into a manchurian candidate, a psychiatric patient or a suicide. The term &#39;suicided&#39; is like the analogy of a frog being slowly boiled alive. If it has to go faster, they&#39;ll just hound them until they have an accident, like lady Diana f.e. </p>

<p>Those techniques in East-Germany were often used by the Stasi already 50 years ago. It&#39;s coined by the term &quot;Zersetzung&quot; which means &quot;the undermining&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media is doing a fine job of satanic/self-destructive commands</p>

<p>I used to listen to the Weeknd when he was underground. I noticed that it encouraged my reckless behavior. I reached a point where I disgusted myself, and could not listen to his music anymore.</p>

<p>4 years later, he is #1
His lyrics are mindless self indulgence of sex, drugs, apathy, and sin. In his The Hills video, he wrecks his car while singing &quot;when I am fucked up, that is the real me&quot; and enters a mansion a la a ritual house, with red lighting. He meets the house master who appears to be an old creepy looking illuminati pet </p>

<p>All the new pop artists are satanic or make satanic references :A$AP mob, Travis Scott, Young Thug, Flosstradamus even has the pyramid alluding to the illuminati</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like conditioning the populace. These symbols are real and planned. It&#39;s no coincidence anymore, and neither is it some new trend as others would like to believe. We have to wonder why pretty much every mainstream celebrity does the whole one eye thing, the triangles, why? Many singers mention selling their soul to get successful (bob Dylan, Katy perry, Kanye west, lady gaga to name a few).</p>

<p>The minds behind this want the world to inherit the saying &quot;do what thou will&quot;, mindless self indulgence as you mention. Chaos is desired. They want to sexualize children, turn them into synthetic puppets like Miley, Britney, Lindsey, kardashians, etc. Mainstream media is MK Ultra on a global scale.</p>

<p>Also happy cake day!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a theory that the Weeknd&#39;s last three videos &amp; popular songs, in a different order I think, were purposely trying to shed light on Hollywood exploitation, specifically exploitation of minors (you can fill in the blanks here). If that&#39;s the case than, his music should be examined from a different angle. (Think this was on voat)</p>

<p>i now pay more attention to commercials when i watch tv. when i do watch MSM news, i also take notice of words used AND i always look at their eyes (but&#39;s that&#39;s just me doing my <em>tin foil</em> hat thing).</p>

<p>commercials: they&#39;re not very long, but i really listen to the message &amp; try to see if i find any &quot;symbols&quot;, note the body language. the obvious: pharm. ads; always list a ridiculous long list of side effects. </p>

<p>news: if an &quot;event&quot; happens (shooting, terror alert, etc.) because they want to give the impression that whatever has occurred is a <em>national threat</em>.  i check different (news) channels, sometimes all channels have the same predominate color &amp; have the same script.</p>
