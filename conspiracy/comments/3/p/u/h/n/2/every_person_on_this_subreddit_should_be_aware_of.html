        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">578</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-10-23 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/magnora7.html">magnora7</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It was made law in 1932 to prevent another 1929 stock market crash, and yet was repealed in the 90s by banking interests. Basically, the Glass-Steagall act requires banks to lend to the public at rates close to the rates the Fed lends to the banks. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.wealthlift.com/images/articleimages/housing/us-monetary-policy-federal-reserve-after-credit-crunch-mortgage-crisis-foreclosures-great-recession-depression.gif">The Fed has been lending to the banks at 0% since the 2008 crisis.</a> If the Glass-Steagall act had not been repealed in the 90s by the big banks lobbying pressure, then the banks would be forced to lend to us at about 0.5% right now. We could have 0.5% interest on mortgages and student loans, and it would&#39;ve been like this for the last 7 years!</p>

<p>But instead, since the repeal, they can put all the money they get in to the stock market because it is more profitable for them. It has a better return than the loans, so they just put it in the stock market. This is why the stock market and financial economy are going up but the rest of the economy isn&#39;t doing so well since 2008. This is why loan rates are so inflated despite a depressed economy. No one gets a good rate on new money except the banks. This is the epitome of trickle-up economics, of consolidation and monopolization of power. </p>

<p>The money isn&#39;t being given cheaply to regular people, so it doesn&#39;t get the regular economy going. No one is more likely to spend their money immediately and infuse the economy than the poor and middle classes. Instead banks pool it up and store it away, because they&#39;re allowed to put your deposits and the money they get from the fed in the stock market. This also has a bad side effect that if there is a bank run, the banks might now have your money because it&#39;s all tied up in the stock market. Imagine if there&#39;s a stockmarket crash and <em>then</em> there&#39;s a bank run, now the bank is screwed! This is exactly what happened in 1929, and exactly why they made and passed this law. </p>

<p>Glass-steagall puts a wall of separation between regular deposit-and-loan banking and investment banking. With it repealed, the bankers can use the 0% interest money from the fed to make tons of money in the stock market, also creating a huge bubble in the process. A bubble that is likely to pop once the easy money stops. Which is why the Fed cannot raise interest rates without crashing the stock market. </p>

<p>In my opinion, we should be demanding the re-enactment of the Glass-Steagall Act. It was there for a reason, for the health of our economy and for the good of us everyday Americans. The banks got greedy, rewrote the laws for themselves, and now it&#39;s ruining so much of what America had going for it. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4bFhwBY.jpg">The fox is now guarding the henhouse</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Glass-Steagall act requires banks to lend to the public at rates close to the rates the Fed lends to the banks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/dereg-timeline-2009-07.pdf">One provision of the act,
named Regulation Q, placed limits on the interest rates banks could offer on deposits.</a></p>

<p>So it actually meant people received less interest on their accounts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>f the Glass-Steagall act had not been repealed in the 90s by the big banks lobbying pressure, then the banks would be forced to lend to us at about 0.5% right now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/mortgage-rates-now-below-even-lows-early-1950s-194417815.html">The NBER&#39;s data show that between July 1950 and February 1951, long-term rates averaged 4.08 percent.</a> So while GS was still in effect, rates were at 4%. Yet the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fed+discount+rate+graph&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;biw=1745&amp;amp;bih=881&amp;amp;site=webhp&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMIlbWpn8bXyAIVxm0mCh1bqAi-#imgrc=6ZTEd8jxmGF8cM%3A">Fed discount rate was 1.5%</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>But instead, since the repeal, they can put all the money they get in to the stock market because it is more profitable for them. It has a better return than the loans, so they just put it in the stock market. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fed discount window loans are overnight loans. They bolster reserves. They are not put in stocks. Besides, how does this statement make any sense? If there was a cap on loan rates, then the stock market would be more attractive. No cap on loans means loans can give a higher return so the stock market is less attractive.</p>

<p>GS would not have prevented the financial crisis. Almost all of the banks that fell were investment only banks.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308">Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and was liquidated, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became commercial banks, subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation.</a> On top of that, investment-only banks could not borrow from the Fed discount window until 2008, after the crisis was well underway. That change prevented more investment banks from collapsing.</p>

<p>So, what do you think <em>could have</em> stopped or stemmed the crisis of 2008? You seem fairly knowledgeable - what are some things we can <em>do now</em> in order to not have a repeat of 2008 and the associated frauds, misrepresentations, and miscommunications? </p>

<p>Edit: Here&#39;s a bit from a post by user Ambiguously_Ironic that deserves repeating (&quot;en masse&quot; an important factor), possibly: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The issue is that by repealing Glass-Steagall, commercial banks (which were historically relatively risk-averse) started acting like risky investment banks en masse. Unprecedented leveraging, unprecedented investments in risky securities, unprecedented corruption in the credit ratings agencies. I&#39;m not making the argument that Glass-Steagall would&#39;ve prevented the problems, but it certainly would have limited them to some extent. JP Morgan and Citigroup, two commercial banks, were both instrumental in causing the 2008 crisis through their involvement with toxic financial instruments - something that wouldn&#39;t have been possible had Glass-Steagall still been in place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I hear you. It really is a very complicated issue that is often-times simplified to erroneous or half-accurate conclusions (myself included). Much of it can be attributed to, I think, just human nature and the momentum associated with life in a modern, dynamic, highly-populous, technologically, and (possibly) capitalistic bent society. I still am of the opinion that there was some definite passing-of-the-buck and fore-knowledge of what was happening or going to happen. Hindsight is [somewhat] 20/20, of course, though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You bring up interesting points that chip away at the edges of what I&#39;m saying but don&#39;t really discount the key point. </p>

<p>I&#39;m looking at this graph that compares the fed rate to the 30-year mortgage rate, which is really the meat of what we are talking about here: <a href="http://www.doctorhousingbubble.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/30-year-fixed-mortgage-and-fed-funds-rate.png">http://www.doctorhousingbubble.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/30-year-fixed-mortgage-and-fed-funds-rate.png</a></p>

<p>And here&#39;s the last few years to tack on to the end, keeping in mind the fed rate is stuck at 0% the whole duration this chart: <a href="https://media.ycharts.com/charts/2f8f2797ef46c5fa968561bcfdbed12f.png">https://media.ycharts.com/charts/2f8f2797ef46c5fa968561bcfdbed12f.png</a></p>

<p>So there&#39;s clearly a correlation, and looking at the data it seems like the mean or rolling average of the blue line is diverging from the red line. If you look at it prior to the early 80s rates explosions, the average of the blue line is about the average of the red line, but after the 80s they take on different slopes, the red dropping faster than the blue. It can&#39;t be said that this is <em>all</em> because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_Legislation#Aftermath_of_repeal">gradual effective repeal of the glass-steagall act through the 90s</a> but it wouldn&#39;t be surprising to learn it plays a big part. </p>

<p>The fed money is supposed to be used for commercial banking, at least in part. The way the system is arranged now means that almost all fed money goes in to the financial investment economy, in to the stock market, instead of being loaned out to people. This hurts the general economy. Banks need to give out cheaper loans as a humanitarian, ethical, and moral responsibility to the community, and they need to be forced to do this through legislation. Not only is it good humanitarian sense, it&#39;s good economic and monetary sense as well. How can you have a consumer-based economy with no middle class? There is no reason for all this money creation to be pooled up in these upper echelons of the economy while the general economy dries up and withers from lack of liquidity. It is a nonsense policy, driven by greedy CEOs who are psychopaths/sociopaths more often than not. People who want to see their bottom line increase and don&#39;t give a damn about the hundreds of millions they&#39;re negatively affecting with their choices. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if Glass-Steagall would fix everything, but I think it would be a step in the right direction. There&#39;s a reason we had it for so many years. There&#39;s a reason it was slowly repealed as corporatism took over the American Government. There&#39;s a logical legal reason the economy is so lop-sided toward the financial sector and against the rest of us. And we need to figure out why, and we need to cry out for people to fix it once we do. And I think Glass-Steagall is a big part of that puzzle. </p>

<p>Long story short, the lower and middle classes need to get money. Either drop it out of a helicopter, institute unconditional universal basic income, or make loans cheap. Otherwise if the fed just keeps giving it to banks who put it in stocks, good luck getting the consumer-based economic engine running again with no fuel in it. You can&#39;t have a consumer economy when no one has money. It just doesn&#39;t work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a number of dynamics which you are missing in your analysis of the situation - the most important of which is what is known as the &quot;shape of the the yield curve&quot;.  Typically, the yield curve is what we call &quot;steep&quot; - meaning short term rates (like the fed funds overnight rate) are lower than long term rates.  The rate you would pay on a 1 year loan, for example, is lower than the rate on a 10 year loan.  When yield (or rate) curves are steep, this is usually a sign of a healthy economy, as the higher long term rates mean people are expecting robust economic growth into the future.  If you look closely at the chart you provided, you can actually see the spread between the fed funds and the 30 year fixed narrow, meaning a flat yield curve, before we head into recessions, as people become less certain of strong economic growth.</p>

<p>The next concept which is important is the idea of a <em>risk-free</em> and a <em>risky</em> investment. Borrowers such as fed member banks and the US government are, essentially, as safe as you can get, from a repayment sense.  The rates they pay for borrowing are referred to as <em>risk-free</em>.  Lending to a consumer, who may or may not pay it back, is risky.  Therefore, even for a loan of a similar length, a consumer would have to pay <em>more</em> for a loan due to this difference in risk, to make up for the higher probability of loss.</p>

<p>Combining these two ideas, and you will see why it is natural that a 30 year mortgage, made to a consumer, should have a higher rate than an overnight loan between two federal reserve member banks</p>

<p>Lastly, an explanation of what the fed funds effective rate actually is would be useful.  The fed funds effective rate is the rate at which fed member banks will lend <em>surplus</em> reserves to each other, as well as the rate at which the fed will lend to banks through the discount window to bolster their required reserves (reserves are the cash held to offset the demand deposits of a bank, legally defined by the reserve ratio).  Don&#39;t think of the fed funds rate as the funding cost of a bank to make a loan, as if a bank will borrow $100 from the fed at 0.25% and then lend to you at 6%, rather it is the rate it earns, or must pay, on its reserves at the federal reserve.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve demonstrated clearly that your key point is completely wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The way the system is arranged now means that almost all fed money goes in to the financial investment economy, in to the stock market, instead of being loaned out to people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not how it works at all. The banks are not putting any money from the Fed into stocks. <em>Overnight</em> loans are paid back within days.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Banks need to give out cheaper loans as a humanitarian, ethical, and moral responsibility to the community, and they need to be forced to do this through legislation. Not only is it good humanitarian sense, it&#39;s good economic and monetary sense as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is absolutely insane. Giving out loans at lower rates puts banks at more risk because they have less to protect themselves against loans defaulting. Forcing banks to give loans to people who shouldn&#39;t get them was part of the subprime loan crisis. Stop thinking with your feelings and think logically about how interest actually works. Extending loans to people who cannot afford them puts everybody at risk, the banks and the borrowers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha.  I&#39;m aware of the supreme court case friend.  Did you know that Ohio wasn&#39;t a state when the 16th amendment was ratified, which was where the president William Taft was born?  The constitution requires that presidents be naturally born citizens, how can you be a naturally born citizen if you weren&#39;t born in a recognized state?  And before you even mention the 1953 resolution to retroactively admit Ohio as of 1803, the constitution also says that Congress can make no ex post facto law, making this retroactive admission invalid.</p>

<p>Now, you&#39;re technically right that Congress could still tax income under the original constitution, but the 16th redefined &quot;income&quot; and also serves to justify the IRS and its income tax.  Were it to be repealed, it would perhaps be a huge victory for the people against those who misapply the income tax.  The 16th amendment is like the &quot;book cover&quot; that most people glance at without reading the rest of the book, it reinforces the idea that income tax is required by all people and that there&#39;s no way to avoid it.</p>

<p>If accepting the 16th shuts down any argument against the income tax from most of the public (and it does), then it seems logical that, were it to be repealed, it would open up a new debate about income tax and whether it&#39;s being implemented properly.  &quot;Wait, the 16th has been repealed but the IRS <em>still</em> wants income tax from me?  Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>The idea is not that income tax is legal regardless of the 16th amendment (because technically it is and was), the idea is that the 16th amendment&#39;s existence totally legitimizes the income tax and suggests that its applicability is limitless (or close to it), and that the IRS&#39;s jurisdiction is universal (or close to it).</p>

<p>Most people hear about the 16th amendment and never bother to look further - we need to reframe the debate in my opinion.</p>

<p>Did you know that&#39;s incorrect and irrelevant as 42 states ratified the amendment, when only 36 were required for adoption? Further, the official date of acceptance to the Union was in the 1800&#39;s when the borders and acceptance of the state constitution were ratified. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Congress didn&#39;t do so. From Baker v. Commissioner:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Petitioner&#39;s theory [that Ohio was not a state until 1953 and that the Sixteenth Amendment was not properly ratified] is based on the enactment of Pub. L. 204, ch. 337, 67 Stat. 407 (1953) relating to Ohio&#39;s Admission into the Union. As the legislative history of this Act makes clear, its purpose was to settle a burning debate as to the precise date upon which Ohio became one of the United States. S. Rept. No. 720 to accompany H.J. Res. 121 (Pub. L. 204), 82d Cong. 2d Sess. (1953). We have been cited to no authorities which indicate that Ohio became a state later than March 1, 1803, irrespective of Pub. L. 204.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Ohio&#39;s statehood wasn&#39;t in question for the period of ratification. Even if it was, there were far more than the required number of ratifying states.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 16th amendment is like the &quot;book cover&quot; that most people glance at without reading the rest of the book, it reinforces the idea that income tax is required by all people and that there&#39;s no way to avoid it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This also isn&#39;t true. Income tax existed prior to the income tax that we all know and love. The difference is whether a tax is levied directly or indirectly. The 16th establishes allotment for indirect apportionment of taxes. The fact that indirect apportionment of taxes impacts wages does not make income tax universal, (otherwise there&#39;d be no such thing as income tax exemption.)</p>

<p>edit: By the way, a natural born citizen can be born in a place other than a US state and still be a natural born citizen, for example: John McCain. As such, being born in a territory would endow natural born citizenship rights if said territory is included within the region providing citizenship, as Ohio was at the time.</p>

<p>Demonstrably false in both cases. The second benefits both the state and the people, in terms of common defense at a minimum. The 16th benefits both the state and the people as it funds the government that provides for the common defense, trade, and health and welfare. </p>

<p>Salient quote: On February 19, 1803, US President Thomas Jefferson signed an act of Congress that approved Ohio&#39;s boundaries and constitution. However, <strong>Congress had never passed a resolution formally admitting Ohio as the 17th state</strong>. The current custom of Congress declaring an official date of statehood did not begin until 1812, with Louisiana&#39;s admission as the 18th state. Although no formal resolution of admission was required, when the oversight was discovered in 1953, Ohio congressman George H. Bender introduced a bill in Congress to admit Ohio to the Union retroactive to March 1, 1803, the date on which the Ohio General Assembly first convened.</p>

<p>Your point?  If it was repealed they certainly would, and there are millions who do know what the 16th amendment is and are just a bit off in their understanding of what it&#39;s actually saying and not saying.</p>

<p>The massive waste of time, legal and financial resources, just to remove something that you think is meaningless. Why not just leave it alone?</p>

<p>Why does it exist at all though?  Why was it ratified in the first place?  That&#39;s what I&#39;m asking you.  There is obviously a reason, can you articulate what you think that reason is?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The second benefits both the state and the people, in terms of common defense at a minimum.</p>

<p>The second amendment specifically says, &quot;A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the <strong>right of the people</strong> to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.&quot;  Get it?  It was written for the <em>people</em>, not for the state.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 16th benefits both the state and the people as it funds the government that provides for the common defense, trade, and health and welfare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Common defense&quot; - like dropping bombs on civilians halfway around the world?  No thanks, I&#39;d rather not fund that with 30%+ of my income.</p>

<p>Articulate for me how you think the income tax benefits the people and why you think it&#39;s necessary.  Do you agree with the &quot;wars&quot; we&#39;ve been fighting that your income tax helps pay for?  Do you agree with the NSA spying on your communications that your income tax helps pay for?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree that the Federalist papers are not the constitution, which never defines &quot;natural-born citizen&quot;. And do you have a source for that claim anyway? Because I don&#39;t think that phrase is mentioned anywhere in the Federalist papers and a quick google search turned up nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You cannot claim to understand the intent of the Constitution without having familiarity with the Federalist Papers. This is basic civics. Source for the statement is Federalist Paper 68 which outlines the process of election, combined with the Constitution which directly uses the term, and multiple secondary sources which define the term, as in the various court challenges to citizenship of candidates. You can&#39;t use a single source to derive intent of a law, any law.</p>

<p>By the way, your earlier statement that &quot;natural born&quot; appears nowhere in the Constitution is false. </p>

<p>Article 2, Section 1,:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems pretty clear that it is indeed a term from the Constitution. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dude. Even your favorite source wikipedia will tell you as much.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I specifically asked you for a source that outweighs the case law on the topic. Wikipedia does not do as much. The case law is clear. If you&#39;re not familiar with it, withdraw and deliberate on your error. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, Congress had never passed a resolution formally admitting Ohio as the 17th state. The current custom of Congress declaring an official date of statehood did not begin until 1812, with Louisiana&#39;s admission as the 18th state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By your measure quoted above, none of the 13 original colonies are states if Ohio is not a state until 1953. So pick your poison.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why does it exist at all though? Why was it ratified in the first place? That&#39;s what I&#39;m asking you. There is obviously a reason, can you articulate what you think that reason is?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To address people like yourself who are too lazy to examine the case law. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The second amendment specifically says, &quot;A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.&quot; Get it? It was written for the people, not for the state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So are you claiming Constitutional literalism is the only correct interpretation? If so, forget about that whole illegal NSA spying thing as there&#39;s no literal right to privacy ensconced in the Constitution. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Common defense&quot; - like dropping bombs on civilians halfway around the world? No thanks, I&#39;d rather not fund that with 30%+ of my income.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should really dig into the facts rather than the rhetoric. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Articulate for me how you think the income tax benefits the people and why you think it&#39;s necessary. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, here&#39;s an easy to follow one: I like having an interstate highway system on which we can transport goods from state to state. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you agree with the &quot;wars&quot; we&#39;ve been fighting that your income tax helps pay for? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of them yes, some of them no. Then again, I&#39;m not the entirety of the US and as an adult I don&#39;t expect to always get my way. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you agree with the NSA spying on your communications that your income tax helps pay for?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of nuance I could bring to bear but you know, pearls before swine and all that. Besides, according to your method of interpretation there&#39;s no right to privacy in the Constitution.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m having trouble understanding how or why someone would support and defend the income tax.</p>

<p>Because the usefulness far outweighs the distaste of the ignorant.</p>

<p>My claim was that the term &quot;natural born citizen&quot; isn&#39;t defined in the constitution, and it isn&#39;t.  The term is mentioned but not defined - do you understand the difference?</p>

<p>Here, from wikipedia: &quot;The Constitution does not define the phrase natural-born citizen, and various opinions have been offered over time regarding its precise meaning.&quot;</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m claiming that the second amendment in no way benefits the state.  It isn&#39;t a complicated concept really, since it gives the <em>people</em> the right to bear arms and doesn&#39;t mention the state at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing in Glass-Steagle would have done anything like that. Banks always have and always will charge consumers more interest on money than it costs for them to acquire that money (either via the overnight fed borrowing rate you&#39;re referring to, which is only used to cover daily cash shortages, or preferably via deposits, which are much cheaper). 2% spread is considered the minimum to stay afloat/cover operating costs, and make a slim profit. You know, the reason loans exist. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is why loan rates are so inflated despite a depressed economy </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interest rates have been at historic lows basically non stop for the past 5 years. What do you think a low consumer rate looks like? 15 year mortgages are closing at 3.0%, and those are secured by collateral, and given to people with good credit, and steady income.  So, relative to that, what do you think a fair rate for student loans should be? Remember they are completely unsecured debt, given to people with no income and no credit history. </p>

<p>I&#39;m for bringing Glass-steagle back, but what you&#39;re talking about has nothing to do with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh geeze, you people are complete morons. As someone already pointed out, the fed funds rate of zero is the overnight rate at which banks can borrow. If you want to talk about mortgage rates (standard being a 30 year loan) or student loan (20 year loan), look at the rates on US treasurys. The 30 year is around 2.9% today, which means the US government, which is considered by many in the world to be a &quot;risk-free&quot; borrower, would have to pay 2.9% per year to borrow on a 30 year loan. Now, let&#39;s take your average person who wants to buy a house and has default risk, they have to borrow at a rate higher than that to compensate the banks for the risk that they don&#39;t pay. Saying you could borrow at 0.50% is ridiculous. The premium a bank charges to lend over the cost they pay to borrow those funds compensates them for the losses they take on defaults. Half a percent is no where near enough. </p>

<p>And even the idea that banks are plowing the money they borrow into the stock market is ludicrous. Look at a bank&#39;s balance sheet and you will see that most of their assets are in loans. Banks are required by federal regulators to make provisions for riskier holdings, so they are penalized for holding assets like stocks. They make more profit by charging you fees for using other banks&#39; ATMs or making overdrafts. </p>

<p>Yes, banks are motivated to make profits for their shareholders, but believing that they are blood-sucking lenders is silly. Our government is just as perverted as these public lenders.</p>

<p>The point is, if we separate commercial banking from investment banking, this forces the commercial banks to lend at more competitive rates to stay afloat.

    <div class="md"><p>One thing I want to clarify because I see it a lot.</p>

<p>People always say &quot;the Fed loans to banks&quot;, but the Fed <strong>is the banks</strong>.  It&#39;s owned by bankers, people with wealth and power.  There bankers essentially loan money to themselves when you boil it down.</p>

<p>Great post though and you&#39;re completely right, people just think the state of the economy and the level of debt is &quot;the way things are&quot; or that they were a natural progression or that we&#39;re &quot;still recovering from 2008&quot;.  We need to realize that all of this was <em>directly caused</em> by bankers, purposely, and that they are still reaping massive profits to this day while the rest of us suffer.</p>

<p>Listen to this fact: over <strong>95% of income gains</strong> since 2008 have gone to the top 1%, the same 1% who fucking caused the financial crisis in the first place with their greed and corruption.</p>

<p>Edit to add:  Also, there are literally hundreds of trillions of &quot;dollars&quot; in the derivative markets.  This is far in excess of the amount of money that even exists on the planet.  These are the markets we need to watch for, because if they start to go then it all goes with them.</p>

<p>True, the act allowed them to merge (pretty much know as the citi bank act) and this did allow commercial funds to flow into the stock  market.</p>

<p>But, we would not be getting loans at the fed funds rate, even before this, the banks assume risk in loans and there would be a spread.  Put another way, the current spread between fed funds rate and loans is exactly what the banks expect to get on stock returns, if it weren&#39;t the case; they would re-balance.</p>

<p>Of course, eff market hypothesis is bull shit, but you can&#39;t claim the banks would loan at EXACTLY the fed funds rate (which implies both 0 risk and 0 return), there is always a spread, even if they are forced to re-deploy the fed funds rate at loans rather than speculation</p>

<p>Are you illiterate? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_banking">Unlike commercial banks and retail banks, investment banks do not take deposits.</a></p>

<p>Here are the big failures that precipitated the crisis:</p>

<ul>
<li>New Century Financial Corporation - mortgage lender, no commercial deposits</li>
<li>American Home Mortgage Investment Corporation - same as above</li>
<li>Lehman - investment bank</li>
<li>Bear Stearns - investment bank</li>
<li>Countrywide - mortgage lender</li>
</ul>

<p>Your list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wells Fargo - didn&#39;t collapse, bought banks on verge of collapse</li>
<li>Bank of America - didn&#39;t collapse, bought Merrill Lynch, Countrywide</li>
<li>JP Morgan - didn&#39;t collapse, bought Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual</li>
<li>Wachovia was a holding company, not a bank itself. Its mortgage holdings failed</li>
</ul>

<p>The financial crisis was mitigated by commercial banks buying investment banks, which would have been illegal under GS. GS would have made the crisis worse.</p>

particularly, bank holding companies (BHCs) and investment banks. As we will
see, banks can engage in securities trading for only a very limited category of
securities—primarily government securities or those backed by the government—
but a BHC or an investment bank is not subject to these restrictions. A BHC is an
ordinary business corporation that controls a bank; it is not specially chartered like
a bank and not permitted to take deposits. Nor does a BHC have other attributes
of a bank, which include automatic access to the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) discount
window, participation in the nation’s payment system, and deposits insured by the
FDIC. In addition, BHCs are regulated by the Fed</a></p>

<p>You&#39;re helping to prove my point.</p>

<p>[Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo — two large banks with big investment banking arms — resisted taking government capital and arguably could have weathered the crisis without it.</p>

<p>Did U.S. investment banks create a shadow banking system and derivatives market outside the normal regulatory framework that encouraged sloppy lending and created what turned out to be toxic securities? You betcha.</p>

<p>And did regular banks make some of those bad loans and buy up some of those toxic securities? Yes, they did.</p>

<p>But that was as much a problem at the banks and investment banks that combined as those that remained independent. More significantly, the bulk of the money that flowed through the shadow banking system didn’t come from government-insured bank deposits. It came from money market funds, hedge funds, pension funds, insurance companies, foreign banks and foreign central banks. ](<a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2012/07/lets-shatter-myth-on-glass-steagall.html">http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2012/07/lets-shatter-myth-on-glass-steagall.html</a>)</p>

<p>The toxic securities and bad loans existed everywhere, in investment banks, mortgage lenders, and commercial banks. I never once claimed combo banks didn&#39;t own toxic securities. The crisis was <em>banks were collapsing</em>, and the banks that were collapsing were not affected by GS. Again, the most stable institutions were those that would have been <em>illegal</em> under GS. GS couldn&#39;t stop the crisis and it would have made it much worse.</p>

<p>Yep, there you go.  This is how commercial banks contributed to the crisis too, and they were allowed to do this because Glass-Steagall was repealed.  If GS existed, they wouldn&#39;t have been able to invest in any of those toxic securities and the issues would have been only with investment banks instead of with both.</p>

<p>You said commercial banks weren&#39;t involved in causing the collapse which is totally false, as you yourself have proven in your very own comment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The crisis was banks were collapsing, and the banks that were collapsing were not affected by GS.</p>

<p>Yes, and the banks collapsing was caused <em>in part</em> by commercial banks participating in investment markets full of toxic securities, as well as investment banks participating in these same markets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GS couldn&#39;t stop the crisis and it would have made it much worse.</p>

<p>How would stopping JP Morgan and Citigroup from investing in toxic securities have made the crisis &quot;much worse&quot;?  Please elaborate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The commercial combo banks helped mitigate the crisis.</p>

<p>After helping to cause it.</p>

<p>Why do you think they paid the government 10s of billions of dollars?  Why do you think they were being investigated for helping cause the crisis?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no bank in their right mind would loan you anything at fed fund rate.  Banks charge you interest based on how much principle asset you have, and your credit score, and the length term of the loan, and on the compeition of other banks.

And banks DO NOT borrow money from the fed.  It&#39;s cheaper to borrow from other banks or institutions at the overnight interbank money market than it is to borrow from the fed.  </p>

<p>Banks DO NOT NEED TO BORROW MONEY if their books are balanced and have reserves.   Some banks have more reserves than others, some banks need reserves, so they lend/borrow at the overnight interbank money market.  THe borrowing rate is set by the central bank fed reserve, the rate is called the fed fund rate.  </p>

<p>If you want to borrow from the Fed, you are borrowing from the discount rate, which is set HIGHER than the overnight fed fund rate.

<p>This is the epitome of trickle-up economics, of consolidation and monopolization of power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trickle up economics means you put money in at the bottom, and as the bottom spends it, the rich eventually also accrue wealth. It does not mean what you imply above. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The money isn&#39;t being given cheaply to regular people, so it doesn&#39;t get the regular economy going. No one is more likely to spend their money immediately and infuse the economy than the poor and middle classes. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which would be the goal of trickle up economics, but you say that isn&#39;t occurring...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, we should be demanding the re-enactment of the Glass-Steagall Act.</p>

<p>I agree with the point of your post, but the argument for the point leaves much to be desired.</p>

<p>Did you know that&#39;s incorrect and irrelevant as 42 states ratified the amendment, when only 36 were required for adoption?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is irrelevant if the president isn&#39;t a legal president.  As should be obvious, a president who holds office illegally can&#39;t sign any amendments into law.</p>

<p>None of the rest of your comment addresses the point of mine, which is that repealing the 16th would be a huge step in the right direction to make people aware of what the IRS is doing and to question whether or not the income tax is necessary and/or effective.</p>

<p>I am aware of what the 16th amendment does and of the fact that income tax was legal before it was ratified.  In fact, I said so in my previous comment.  But the overwhelming majority of Americans <em>do not know that</em>, they think the 16th amendment is what makes income tax necessary and legal.  If it was repealed, and people continued to have their income taxed, they would start asking a lot more questions - don&#39;t you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really need to go back to civics class. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The phrase &quot;Natural-born citizen&quot; isn&#39;t defined anywhere in the constitution so you should be clear that there is no set definition for what the term means. You obviously got that description from the opening paragraph of wikipedia and are quoting the more modern &quot;consensus&quot; that&#39;s only existed for the last decade or so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It comes from the Federalist Papers, which I&#39;d expect someone who wants to flog the Constitution would have at least a summary education on. Further, wikipedia, and I both get their definition from the same place: <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42097.pdf">http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42097.pdf</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>No it wasn&#39;t. Its boundaries and constitution were settled in 1803, but it was not a member of the union nor a formal state until 1953. Stop repeating this falsehood.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Give me a source that bears more legal weight than the sum total of all case law concerning the topic or stop calling it a falsehood because it suits your narrative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know, that&#39;s literally the point I&#39;m making - the majority of Americans have little understanding of tax law and thus they would begin to question the income tax if the 16th was repealed because most people think this amendment is what legitimizes it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The majority of Americans do not know what the 16th amendment is, let alone know that it is the basis on which federal income tax is predicated. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>By your own admission, repealing the 16th wouldn&#39;t affect anything as far as income tax is concerned. So what purpose does it serve? What would be the harm in repealing it if we can still be taxed anyway?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The massive waste of time, legal and financial resources, just to remove something that you think is meaningless. Why not just leave it alone? What purpose would a repeal serve seeing as just about no one knows or cares about the 16th?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The obvious difference is that the 16th benefits the state exclusively and the 2nd benefits the people exclusively. Can&#39;t really compare the two.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Demonstrably false in both cases. The second benefits both the state and the people, in terms of common defense at a minimum. The 16th benefits both the state and the people as it funds the government that provides for the common defense, trade, and health and welfare. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree that the Federalist papers are not the constitution, which never defines &quot;natural-born citizen&quot;.  And do you have a source for that claim anyway?  Because I don&#39;t think that phrase is mentioned anywhere in the Federalist papers and a quick google search turned up nothing.</p>

<p>Dude.  Even your favorite source wikipedia will tell you as much.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio#Statehood:_1803.E2.80.93present">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio#Statehood:_1803.E2.80.93present</a></p>

<p>Salient quote: On February 19, 1803, US President Thomas Jefferson signed an act of Congress that approved Ohio&#39;s boundaries and constitution. However, <strong>Congress had never passed a resolution formally admitting Ohio as the 17th state</strong>. The current custom of Congress declaring an official date of statehood did not begin until 1812, with Louisiana&#39;s admission as the 18th state. Although no formal resolution of admission was required, when the oversight was discovered in 1953, Ohio congressman George H. Bender introduced a bill in Congress to admit Ohio to the Union retroactive to March 1, 1803, the date on which the Ohio General Assembly first convened.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Your point?  If it was repealed they certainly would, and there are millions who do know what the 16th amendment is and are just a bit off in their understanding of what it&#39;s actually saying and not saying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The massive waste of time, legal and financial resources, just to remove something that you think is meaningless. Why not just leave it alone?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does it exist at all though?  Why was it ratified in the first place?  That&#39;s what I&#39;m asking you.  There is obviously a reason, can you articulate what you think that reason is?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The second benefits both the state and the people, in terms of common defense at a minimum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second amendment specifically says, &quot;A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the <strong>right of the people</strong> to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.&quot;  Get it?  It was written for the <em>people</em>, not for the state.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 16th benefits both the state and the people as it funds the government that provides for the common defense, trade, and health and welfare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Common defense&quot; - like dropping bombs on civilians halfway around the world?  No thanks, I&#39;d rather not fund that with 30%+ of my income.</p>

<p>Articulate for me how you think the income tax benefits the people and why you think it&#39;s necessary.  Do you agree with the &quot;wars&quot; we&#39;ve been fighting that your income tax helps pay for?  Do you agree with the NSA spying on your communications that your income tax helps pay for?</p>

<p>I&#39;m having trouble understanding how or why someone would support and defend the income tax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2007/200746/figure_1.gif">a good correlation between treasuries and Fed lending rates, </a> but you&#39;re talking as if these things are independent from each other.  </p>

<p>The point is, if we separate commercial banking from investment banking, this forces the commercial banks to lend at more competitive rates to stay afloat. Now they just stick all their money in the stock market and loans are too expensive because they can&#39;t compete with stock investments. </p>
