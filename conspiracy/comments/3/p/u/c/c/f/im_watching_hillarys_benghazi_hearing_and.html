       Yes, its normal for people to have pre-selected responses for situations like this, but how do you explain how she always had the correct response in front of her unless she also knew what the
       <em>
        order
       </em>
       of the questions would be?  she had an 11 hr long script in front of her, as evidence by her flipping the pages in sync with the next question.

       I get that,  but I watched her struggle to look genuine while reading a message of thanks off a piece of paper... Stopping every 4 words to make it less obvious that she's reciting something that should flow naturally if it were genuine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally every word that came out of her mouth seemed to be scripted.. I can understand cookieI cutter answers, but this was a step too far/creepy

       im sorry but thats news to me.  Call me crazy but i assumed that any question/answer session that lasts 10 hrs would have some small degree of a human factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       but if what you say is true, then were in total agreement.  The hearing last night was 10+ hours of scripted call and response.  im not speculating at all about further implications.  The spectacle alone of the damn thing is bothersome to me.

       I caight the excerpts cnn showed on their roku channel.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is noticed was the democrats spent all their time saying that it was a prosecution  instead of the democrat committee memebers actually taking the time to learn more to actually find things out that wpuld be helpful to the diplomatoc core in the future. Ironicly the democrats took up all their speaking time saying that, thus being guilty of the wasted opportunity they accused republicans of.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am no hillary hater on bengazi.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dislike her because she is a wallstreet puppet like bush.
My dislike is non partisan.
 But if youre going to have her there stopping crying about it being a prosecution and just ask some relevant questions to learn something in a none  prosecutorial way.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing i did learn is the the diplomats who died had gone to a cia saferoom in the annex which was designed to keep them secure. Howeve rthe safe room (rather unbeleivably to me)  did not seal the air and provide air so when the attackers lit the place up with deisel fuel they were not harmed or burned but had to evacuate becuase of the smoke.  They were then overcome with smoke as they tried to escape through the thick smoke oitside to tue roof with a cia guy leading the way. The cia guy wnet back through tje smoke to find the two diplomats and dragged one to the roof but couldnt find chris. Chris the main diplomate was later found by freindly libyans who took him to the hospital and the doctors tried to revive him for 2 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was relevant and important info.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again i am not  a hillqry hater on bengazi.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the committee clearly uncovered important info about it all and stil are. To say otherwise is silly. And theyhave 20 more witnesses.  Its stupid if they have spent 4 million for the democrats to then try to complakn while the main witness is there . You spent the money so now take the time to ask questions of the top level witness hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other interesting tjing was a committee member complained this was being invedtigated more than 9/11 was investigated. I agree. The lck of investigation into 9/11 was appalling. We all know why.  However i suggest that since they recognize that that they now actually do  REAL 9/11 investigation now that Bush and Cheney areout of office and can't hinder it.

       This is about the 10th time they've been over all this stuff.  I'm sure lessons learned were discussed long ago.  Now it's just a fishing expedition to try to find something embarrassing in her internal communications that they can use against her in the campaign.

       I dodnt follow it. As i said i dont care about hillary and this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did hear the chairman of the committee with his mohawk hair say that the witnesses they had called and the information the committee had suppeonaed had never ben examoneed previously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that right or wrong? i dont know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bit ithink hillary is doing what bush did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Delay investigation endlessly while refusing to answer questions saying it is under investigation so they cant talk  Then when they can no longer delay, claim that it is all old news and has already been asked and answered!  That seems like what hillary is doing now.
      </p>
      <p>
       But like i saidd i dont knowand dont really care.  I dont loke hillary beciase she is a wallstreeter and drig company minion and has bad judgement and has never effecticely gotten anything through congrsss like her helathcare debacle in tue 90's and she is not personable or a good leader.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont care what mshe did in bengazi.
.and i feel the same about jeb bush.

       I like sanders and trump who sremore alike than people think.

       I'll vote for Sanders in the primary, but he'll lose to Hillary.  I think she's going to be the next president, unless she has a heart attack, or the economy goes off a cliff in the next 12 months.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Trump has one or two good points (about a border fence, and about money in politics), but mostly he's a dangerous know-nothing.  He seems to think that tough talk can force other countries to do what we want.  He denies science on vaccines and climate change.  He has no experience in govt, so would make many elementary and expensive mistakes.  He's avoided being specific, which has been working for him so far, but most of the electorate will see him for what he is when we get further along in the process.

       It is inconceivable that someone as guilty as Hillary is on Benghazi would be able to survive 11 hours of genuine hard questioning by genuine political opponents so easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course, this patball questioning and sycophantic fawning we have been witnessing here show that this is not genuine, it is just theatre. The Republicans and Democrats are merely two branches of the same team - the Deep State, and it looks increasingly like Hillary is the Deep State's chosen puppet to replace Obama in 2016.

       That's how these hearings work. You give your questions to the person being questioned in advance so they can give complete answers.  The purpose isn't to trap her into saying something stupid, it's to get her on record with her answers.
      </p>

       The whole process could be conducted by email, the actual hearing is theater.

       This has been going for a long time.  I'm sure the talking points and facts on her side are well-established, and she has to be very careful about every word because any mis-statement will be pounced on.  She'd be a fool not to have prepared in advance and stuck to it as closely as possible.
