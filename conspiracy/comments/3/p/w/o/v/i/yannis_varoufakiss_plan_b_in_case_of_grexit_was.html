Hes currently being accused of high treason, but honestly how can you blame him for standing up for his country&#39;s well being?  If they shut down the banks, Yannis came up with a plan to keep the country from spiraling into all out riots... and for that he may be crucified in the media.</p>

<p>Some links on the matter:

<p>And on a final note, if you haven&#39;t heard any of yannis talks yet, you should check out his lecture &quot;the global minotaur&quot;.  Its a big eye opener toward the state of the american/world financial system.

    <div class="md"><p>First of all it is Yanis with one &quot;N&quot;. He insists on that. Second he is not being accused of anything, no real charges against him for anything at all. Third his &quot;hacking plan&quot; is way overblown for what it was (basically running a parallel currency after a Grexit and before a new Dracma). &quot;Hacking&quot; consisted in using Greek citizen SSNs to run a virtual currency. A Greek minister of finance cannot &quot;hack&quot; SSNs, the whole system is under his control already. </p>

<p>All in all an interesting idea but no conspiracies or other romantic plans. Just virtual thought experiments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They would have had to back into the imf because the greek government <em>doesnt</em> have access to those tax numbers.  That information is controlled by the troika, and yanis has admitted that he had a team of hackers capable of breaking into the EU Imf to steal the necessary tax numbers needed to set up the parallel system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL what a bunch of bollocks. Tax collection is done exclusively through the M.o.F. system and you have to use your SSN. So they do have a database with every tax payer&#39;s SSN, what is there to hack? From other ministries have SSNs for underage people. </p>

<p>The money does not go to the troika, the troika has access (maybe, not even sure about this) to the collection system but they definitely do not control it or take funds directly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>im only repeating what yanis has said.  If he could have just used SSNs then why would he admit to having a plan/ a need to hack into the imf??  According to yanis, he as greek misister of finance did not have access to any of that information, and would have needed to steal it for the plan to go forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He says a lot of things, not all of them make sense. Nobody really understood what he meant by that hacking quote, it was in the papers for weeks. It is still not clear. </p>

<p>He is a good guy but a terrible politician and he talks way too much. I voted for him but unfortunately he was a bad choice (still better than the rest of Syriza that are a bunch of retarded amateurs every bit as corrupt and inept as their predecessors).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i have a hard time believing that prospect magazine named him the worlds 2nd greatest thinker if he says a bunch of lies/ things that don&#39;t make sense.  </p>

<p>He talks alot because hes one of the worlds smartest economists.  </p>

<p>if a ship is sinking, it doesnt matter who the captain is... thats the position yanis was in.  But i commend him for formulating a plan that would keep Greece out of civil war if the bankers wanted it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bollocks. After the fact people can say whatever they want. The left platform that eventually became LAE and V had only wish thinking and when they played chicken with Europe they lost, hard. They only had Reddit level plans and the EU closed the banks. Tsipras folded because the alternative was so brutal that nobody in his right mind would accept it. There was no viable plan to bluff. There was no plan for a serious grexit from the Greek side. V and Syriza as a party were fucking AMATEURS and betrayed an entire country. Referendum says No (even the joke referendum that ass fundamentally unconstitutional) they make it to a yes. They call unnecessary elections fucking an already nonexistent economy. And they offer an unending stream of idiotic displays of Saddam level ceremonies. </p>
