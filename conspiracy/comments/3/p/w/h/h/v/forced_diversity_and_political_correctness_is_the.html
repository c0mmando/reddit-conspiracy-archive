       Diversity requires isolation of groups, otherwise we just will end up with a homogenized world and every connection to our human past will be erased.  Darwin claimed that we would destroy our great ape ancestors to further ourselves from them.  I fear we are destroying our ancient cultural remnants in the same fashion.

       This is what the progressives want to happen, its no secret, its just transhumanism.  We need to bring back tradition if we want diversity to survive more than 20-50 years.

       i think a lot of people are speaking from the american experience of diversity. in canada and many places, progressive means sharing a community with people who are different.

       America isn't the only place with this flavor of diversity, the EU actually has the worst of it right now.  There's no problem with people being different; the problem arises when immigration is encouraged on a ludicrous scale, it brings about culture shock and will almost allways result in violence.  Unfortunately, violence is probably the goal this time around rather than poor foresight being at fault.

       canada is actually unique in that regard. there was no campaign of genocide against natives. the government relocated all the natives to rural areas far from cities in order to ensure national ownership of resources. and then took all the kids and put them in schools intended to train them to integrate to colonial culture. it was arguably well meaning but now seen as deeply regrettable. canada basically halfasses it between destroying natives and preserving them. now there is a big focus on trying to integrate traditional native knowledge and ways of knowing with colonial sciences. their culture is really in a resurgent renaissance as money for culturally sensitive education has been flowing. some reserves are very wealthy and some plan and organize their communities according to traditional knowledge with the blessing of the government. same thing has happened with the Maori in NZ. also, an interesting point is that originally, before all this, natives and whites intermarried regularly. first couple chapters of this book go over diaries and other primary sources that talk about how the cultures mixed productively for personal security and status on both sides. many canadians have native genetics and don't even know it.

       “I do not agree that the dog in a manger has the final right to the manger even though he may have lain there for a very long time. I do not admit that right. I do not admit for instance, that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia. I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, has come in and taken their place.”

       Go check out the documentary the disappearing male.  In it there are Canadian native Americans who have been relocated to a camp where they have made their homes.  The Canadians then proceeded to build their chemical industry around the camp.  Now this camp has many more girls being born than boys at an alarming rate.  It is the endocrine disrupting chemicals which they are forced to live in by the Canadian government and industry.  They can either face ultimately their own extinction or leave the last of their land and immerse themselves into the system aka meat grinder.

        In his book Praktischer Idealismus (Practical Idealism), he wrote:

       <p>
        “The man of the future will be of mixed race. Today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space, time, and prejudice. The Eurasian-Negroid race of the future, similar in its appearance to the Ancient Egyptians, will replace the diversity of peoples with a diversity of individuals.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Instead of destroying European Jewry, Europe, against its own will, refined and educated this people into a future leader-nation through this artificial selection process. No wonder that this people, that escaped Ghetto-Prison, developed into a spiritual nobility of Europe. Therefore a gracious Providence provided Europe with a new race of nobility by the Grace of Spirit. This happened at the moment when Europe’s feudal aristocracy became dilapidated, and thanks to Jewish emancipation."

       Well yes and no.  There is much destruction to the ancient past through looting, war, cultural conflict (ex. Isis, North American mounds, pyramids, etc.).  But I was specifically talking about the damage to the living cultures.  We lose DNA, language, and information about their daily rituals.  Mainstream religions are a homogenized mess.

       i find our differences to be beautiful and unique.  It gives life flavor.  You sound like you want to create some super race.  localized diversity is key.  Independent cultures can act as buffers.  Dependence on a global economy will be catastrophic when something goes wrong.

       Look at your lawn and how it naturally wants to grow.  You will not only get grass, but, weeds, dead spots, and trees.  What do we do we spray weed killers, fertilizers, punch out those little plugs, bug killers, constantly cut it, rake it, cut branches off the trees and shrubs, and water it.  This is an unnatural Ecosystem and cannot survive without constant intervention.  Globalism is no different.  We intervene with Mother Nature and create an imbalance.  When we do this it creates more work.  Eventually work will become so cumbersome only technology will be able to keep up and humanity will be rendered obsolete.

       That's weak sauce. A wiki link with essentially, "and check the sources at the bottom."  This tells me that you likely haven't followed your own instruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said,  GrovyOne, forced integration in time creates homogeneity.  The universal wolf devours itself again.    Your own "source," again in time, defeats your argument.  Have a good one.  :)

       When we do not have sufficient answers as to who we are and are spoon fed some religious and historical lies, it degrades us and creates a hive society.  Man is much to intelligent for this lifestyle.  They ultimately want to dumb the population down in order for the centralized power to rule.  Man was born to be free and independent.  This behavior destroys diversity and autonomy.  We are biologically destroying ourselves as we ever increase our dependence on technology.
