<p><em>Unreal City,</em>
<em>Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,</em>
<em>A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,</em>
<em>I had not thought death had undone so many.</em></p>

<p>-T.S. Elliot, The Waste Land </p>

<p>If you were born before the Renaissance, would you miss concepts that hadn’t been invented yet? How would you even conceptualize ideas like ‘rationality’ and ‘science?’ Would you ever realize you were living in a ‘Dark Age?’</p>

<p>Perhaps some day people will look back on this era as the first time technology went too far. Or, when humanity was not yet mature enough to handle its own technical advances.</p>

<p>“Here’s a 2010’s man, class. Look at him staring at his phone. People back then didn’t know how damaging screen addiction could be. A whole generation of kids with ADHD and low testosterone, raised under a government that collected every email and text message. Poor things.”</p>

<p>I have no idea if we’re in a Dark Age or not, but I do know that I want culture off my back. I am done with having advertisements downloaded into my subconscious. I am tired of complaining about our political system - it’s become cliche. </p>

<p>Everything is fast and plastic wrapped and synthetic. America is a quick high that will get you hooked so fast you wont know what hit you. You’re not allowed anywhere near the Real. Don’t go to war for yourself - watch football. Don’t have a significant other - watch porn. Don’t learn how the universe works - go into debt and receive a degree. As Baudrillad said, mistake the signifier for the signified. Live one-step removed from reality. </p>

<p>A country with 700+ military bases abroad that brags about bringing democracy to the world. The world leader in obesity and mental illness that claims to have the best lifestyle. I don’t hate America, though, I’m really glad I live here. Most of the people I know have baggage, but are nice. </p>

<p><strong>What Can We Do?</strong></p>

<p>For one thing, we can stop trying to escape. It doesn’t work: not now, not ever. Even if you saw the best Netflix series <em>ever</em>, you’re still going back to the cubicle on Monday. Even if you said a really funny joke while you were three beers deep and a cute girl laughed and you won your fantasy football matchup on Sunday, you’re still going back to the cube. Theodore Adorno defined the whole landscape of 20th century critical theory when he stated, &quot;to be entertained is to give one’s consent.&quot;</p>

<p>I’m starting to be less entitled. Somewhere along the way I learned it was O.K. to not go all out. I learned to see Hillary Clinton as a grandma who cared about me. I learned that struggling was bad and everything is a joke. The feeling I experienced when my fantasy football team did well was definitely sexual and/or orgasmic in nature. which makes sense because our culture is largely based on jerking off. We gleefully masturbate to new iPhones and cars and Facebook likes. Marx was right to call it commodity fetishism. </p>

<p>The move to make is away from mass-produced cultural forms, and towards your own unique experience in the world. It doesn’t matter if you want to be a bee keeper in Montana, you can’t go wrong doing you. Become a five-star general in your own universe. Stop viewing life as a sappy Showtime movie, and instead approach it like a game. Start making strategic plays; even if your first move is to just put on some underwear, it will still feel good. </p>

<p><strong>Education</strong></p>

<p>The biggest obstacle most people have in breaking out of the matrix is lack of education. They were deprived of an education about what really matters and have been conditioned their whole lives to rely on other people - parents, teachers, professors, ‘officials’ - for information about how the world works. Folks, why would the people who run the show (whether it’s your parents in the household or the government in society) tell you exactly what they are doing?  </p>

<p>“O.K. Tommy, we’re sending you off to college so you can get the partying out of your system. Then, you’ll graduate in debt so you have to get a full time job as soon as possible. Luckily, that diploma really represents ‘can show up to work on time’ and ‘isn’t a criminal,’ so you should probably be able to find some work. Have fun!” </p>

<p>It’s not even a conspiracy- it’s right in front of your eyes - you just don’t want to look because it’s scary to come to different conclusions than other people. Begin to take back your life by obsessively studying the world around you. Use your own experiences to gauge what’s true - forget about what’s ‘normal.’ You’ll start to realize things like: </p>

<p>-Every society is a pyramid with certain people on top</p>

<p>-Every country is going to have some brainwashing</p>

<p>-Happiness is an individual thing. No institution or system can give it to you </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! We must build a new system by unplugging and starting our own. Non violent boycott of matrix life. People only want to stay in the  matrix and use the matrix to solve the matrix. That impossible. We must unplug and start a new.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to unplug but unfortunately my skill/trade exists in the digital world (3d graphics/games). I&#39;m afraid being away, even for a few years, the tech will progress and I will become outdated. Not sure what I can do.</p>

<p>Note: I have unplugged and lived in remote places in foreign countries for 6 months at a time, several times, and it&#39;s great, but eventually I plug back in to make money again and because I can&#39;t afford visas and travelling forever :( The countries I&#39;ve stayed in are developing nations so it feels like things are getting better for them, and everyone is working hard and lots of community. It is sometimes easier to see &quot;their version of brainwashing&quot; so I can avoid it more. </p>

<p>Whenever I return to America, some of the culture &amp; cities do indeed remind of a wasteland :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I hear ya man. I did the same thing but only for 6 months once. Ive been to developing nations too and it really is a different version and it seem more natural in many ways. The matrix in the west, esp the U.S., seems so image based and unnatural. Its about your image not avtually you/reality. Makes sense though because everything is based of endless credit debt that doesn&#39;t even exist. The whole system doesn&#39;t reflect real value. Our only value is money, partly because you really need money in the usa since workers rights didnt get as far from a movement standpoint then europe.</p>

<p>I think im getting to a point where I might head to a developing nation and just be in community and also try and promote change throughout while being there. I dont think being in the usa matrix is a good place to set up a home base from. But it depends. You got to do what you got to do sometimes but Im starting to appreciate the life of something more than money. Living off the land, community, enjoying the day and not just working, not working for man but working for yourself. People in the USA just are tricked and cant perceive the beauty in that type of life. Its only in terms of material and status in the mainstream</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post! I surf. Something about being 150 yards from the shore with 5 foot walls of water that you get to ride has a way of putting things into perspective. I&#39;ve only been at it a little over a year but it is one of the things that allows me to be a 5 star general in my life. I get worked out, smashed by gallons of water, stung by jelly fish and it all makes me feel alive. Not some machine or a rebel. There is no where I&#39;d rather be then out in the water.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It should be understood that a huge machine is behind her. I contend that the three weirdos, other than Sanders and her, might as well be tenpins at the bowling alley. In fact the strategy is to run her and Sanders as Pres. and VP. The Democrats are using the opposite tactic as the republicans, focusing on these two. For their part, they&#39;re running a dozen plus assholes to give the impression that their side is more substantial with more. They head the whole apparatus up with the bright shiny pony, Trump, who will drop out after having drawn attention for over a year. I&#39;d just as soon put them all in a capsule and blast them into the sun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know.    I guess by that measure we could sit on grandpa Cheney&#39;s lap,   or go visit uncle Adolph who did it all for the love of the Homeland.</p>

<p>And yet,   these &quot;monsters&quot; are not of another kind than what we grew up with in first grade,   they are not mutants.    It is this human society we are living in that is spitting up these kinds of dregs.     Brittney Spears (&quot;Honestly, I think we should just trust our president in every decision that he makes and we should just support that, you know, and, um, be faithful in what happens.&quot; from CNN interview with Tucker Carlson 3 September 2003)
was fawning over Bush Jr. supporting his every move as he took the country on a hellish war expedition that still continues under our Noble Peace Prize winning Obummer.</p>

<p>There is a rather sublime realization to be had that what is playing out here is indeed both nurturing and monstrous.    We are drinking our mothers own blood as we suck on that tit.    And mothers are known to wipe out other families in order to supplement their own.</p>

<p>Most violent species are held in check by the limits in nature,   including humans till about 10,000 years ago.    Now we get to take down ourselves and everyone else at the same time.    Its kind of amazing we haven&#39;t already.    And maybe we won&#39;t,   or maybe nature will still put a checkmate on our present trajectory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No,  I don&#39;t think that particular trajectory is all that clear.    The three superpowers are not the ones who will launch a mutual suicide.    Probably will stay on the brink of it.     </p>

<p>We have had the same kind of wars going on now since WWII,   from Korea to now.    The only difference now is planning to control failed states through mercenary groups for a very long lasting conflict.   Don&#39;t want any more powerful dictators taking over in these disputed areas.    Keep them in chaos as long as possible.   But meanwhile,   the oil will flow.    Much more effort is now put into the mind control that lets these unnecessary wars happen.</p>

Ive been to developing nations too and it really is a different version and it seem more natural in many ways. The matrix in the west, esp the U.S., seems so image based and unnatural. Its about your image not avtually you/reality. Makes sense though because everything is based of endless credit debt that doesn&#39;t even exist. The whole system doesn&#39;t reflect real value. Our only value is money, partly because you really need money in the usa since workers rights didnt get as far from a movement standpoint then europe.</p>

<p>I think im getting to a point where I might head to a developing nation and just be in community and also try and promote change throughout while being there. I dont think being in the usa matrix is a good place to set up a home base from. But it depends. You got to do what you got to do sometimes but Im starting to appreciate the life of something more than money. Living off the land, community, enjoying the day and not just working, not working for man but working for yourself. People in the USA just are tricked and cant perceive the beauty in that type of life. Its only in terms of material and status in the mainstream</p>
