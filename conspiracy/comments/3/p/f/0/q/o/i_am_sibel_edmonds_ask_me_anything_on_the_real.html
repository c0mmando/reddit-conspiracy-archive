        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We have been singlehandedly covering The Real Dennis Hastert Scandal at Boiling Frogs Post. As we all know the complicit US media has been doing exactly the opposite: blacking out and censoring the real case together with all directly relevant facts and historical context. With this campaign we provide people with censored information and background on Hastert, FBI COINTELPRO II which began in 1996, and those with much at stake if the case were to proceed as a real case in courts.</p>

<p>What kind of pedophilic activities was Dennis Hastert engaged in during his years in the US Congress? Why the media Omission &amp; Blackout in Hastert’s proven criminal records while in Congress? Why the intentional censorship of the sources of Hastert’s $17 million wealth most of which accumulated while serving as a Congressman? Why no one is asking “The Judge” question? Come and join us in our campaign for truth in “The Real Hastert Case.”</p>

<p>You can find all facts and information on The Real Hastert Case here at BFP:

<p>One of your quotes on 9/11 has always struck a chord:</p>

<p>“And I would like to give an analogy – if you take the War on Drugs, imagine if they only went after street dealers and they refused to investigate the mid-level dealers or the drug lords. This is very similar.”</p>

<p>Could you shed light as to some of the &quot;drug lords&quot; you believe were involved with Operation 9/11? </p>

<p>Other than your own, which 5 to 10 books do you consider to be the best/most important in the realm of 9/11, politics, revisionist history, truth, etc.? </p>

<p>Yes. Same as his predecessor Bob Livingston. In fact he was made the Speaker due to his highly blackmail-able pedigree. I&#39;d say all the top-tier positions in US Congress (Chairmanship, Whip, etc.) are occupied by those who possess Hastert-like qualifications. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sibel, I&#39;m a huge fan of yours.  Your courage and dedication to truth are extremely contagious.  I found your analysis on the Boston Marathon Bombings to be extremely intelligent, coherent, and spot on. </p>

<p>I had a really bad feeling in my gut after hearing about this Dennis Hastert case, that there was much more to this story then the MSM was telling us.  The fact that the Speaker of the House could openly be paying blackmail to someone was disturbing to say the least.</p>

<p>My question to you is, why did the mainstream media even cover this to begin with, if the rabbit hole leads down so far?  Why wouldn&#39;t they just ignore it completely?  Also, you&#39;ve alleged that many other powerful people are involved in this, can you name some other names?</p>

<p>Lastly, do you think that this type of COINTELPRO II programs are still running to this date, blackmailing politicians, judges, and others to play ball?  Who do you think is the real power pulling these puppet politician&#39;s strings?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your kind words: greatly appreciated.
&quot;why did the mainstream media even cover this to begin with, if the rabbit hole leads down so far? Why wouldn&#39;t they just ignore it completely?&quot; They have almost done exactly that. As you can see, they have isolated the case to some trivial and long-ago ingredients. They have misdirected the public; for ex: not a single mentioning of Hastert&#39;s previous records, including the 2005 Vanity Fair expose, under-oath testimonies of witnesses, his Land Deal scandal ...</p>

<p>Also, you&#39;ve alleged that many other powerful people are involved in this, can you name some other names? Please refer to my &quot;State Secrets Gallery.&quot; In summery: all the major names from Chicago/Illinois politics + at least a dozen other representatives including: Dan Burton, Roy Blunt, Jan Schekowsky, Solarz ... And another dozen of appointed people: Perle, Feith, Grossman ...</p>

<p>&quot;do you think that this type of COINTELPRO II programs are still running to this date, blackmailing politicians, judges, and others to play ball?&quot; Absolutely; without a doubt. Without that control mechanism &#39;they&#39; will have chaos detrimental for absolute control. It is the only way to have, simultaneously, a so-called representative democracy, and, absolute authoritarianism. Ordinarily, it would be considered an &#39;Oxymoron,&#39; but with COINTELPRO they get to have it: An illusion of separation of powers, an illusion of representative government, as illusion of independent judiciary.</p>

<p>edit: via BFP-Sibel</p>

<hr/>

<p>First, it was not the FBI that started this. It started at some lower-tier Justice Department of IL.</p>

<p>My theory: the case was brought to the attention of some lower-tier good people within IL-Justice Department. As they pursued it, the case became &#39;bigger&#39; and &#39;hot.&#39; By the time the upper-level players and the FBI-DOJ got the whiff of it, it had gotten out of control (too many people knowing about it, paper trail, etc.). And at this time, all they could do: Contain the case and the situation. Which is exactly what they did. This way, with a plea deal, most facts still sealed, no trials, no discovery ... both sides can win, keep the &#39;real case&#39; under wrap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, based on Edmonds&#39; testimony and later remarks, it appears that the FBI was aware of Hastert&#39;s crimes for many years (and I am pretty sure Hastert&#39;s predilections and behavior was well-known to many, who all kept mum), so I find it hard to believe that the FBI suddenly caught &quot;whiff of it&quot; many years later and coincidentally right before elections.</p>

<p>Which tells you something about the difference between republicans and democrats. When democrats want a republican out of congress their own corruption is used to pressure them out. When the republicans want democrats out, they kill them, like Paul Wellstone, Mel Carnahan, and others, or try to kill them, like Daschle and Leahy with anthrax.</p>

They have to be because there&#39;s no way that an organization like the FBI or NSA <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> be aware of pedophile rings connected to the government.  Hoover had dossiers on all US politicians 50 years ago, I can only imagine how much info is kept today.  Perhaps Hastert is the fall guy for a larger group of people who were at risk of being indicted?</p>

<p>Here is the question: do people have to experience these things first-hand in order to react the way you did and do? For 5 years (93-to-97) I worked as CASA and investigated and represented dozens of sexually abused children ... But even prior to that experience I shuttered when I read or heard about such cases.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to say is this: why the majority doesn&#39;t shake violently when they read/hear about horrific torture cases, murdering of civilians through imperial wars, pedophile representatives ...?</p>

<p>No. If you trust what you&#39;re witnessing, experiencing or are being shown; go with your instincts. I&#39;m fully versed in <em>false claims</em> and hysterical events! </p>

<p>The numbing of society to report a child running naked in the street with blood streaming down his/her legs is shocking but that isn&#39;t just today... It was and is Global, going years long past, yesterday, today and tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>I was an advocate well before this. My sister was a victim but she was dismissed by my entire family, the police, the courts. </p>

<p>My guilt haunts me. I missed so many <em>tells</em> from her.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why... when they read/hear about horrific torture cases, murdering of civilians through imperial wars, pedophile 
representatives ...?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty boys, tea boys? All the rage these days, right? Nope! Lost a good friend from Iran, that spoke candidly about the rape of boys.  This was 1979. I do not know what happened to this man but he was there, as family, in very dark times. He spoke volumes that none of my Education ever prepared me for and he, in return agreed.</p>

<p>This is tough waters for me, my apology, late, please and thank you TLDNR...</p>

<p>It is so disgusting and repulsive to most people that they cannot or should not <em>entertain</em> these <em>violent torture</em> images! Cannot fathom an entire village of natives being rounded up, young and old, men and women and being <em>simply raped</em> and bile rises in my throat just typing that! </p>

<p>Watching American Politicians parading their wives on display to excuse their foibles? A Queen silencing a Princess? Hastert getting a pass? Sandusky and legends? The list is never ending really.</p>

<p>Sibel, you know, as well as I;  how high and how low these cretins plow the landscape, the slaughter will not stop unless and until people are made aware!</p>

<p>Watch out for your family, your friends, your neighbors. Be mindful, considerate, loving. </p>

<p>If your gut jolts or your short hairs prickle, call family, a friend! If it&#39;s a priest or pastor, Senator, Coach, Hollywood Actor, get your ducks in a row!</p>

<p>I&#39;m an unapologetic human. Thank You!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a GREAT question. I have been analyzing this angle for the last five months.</p>

<p>First, it was not the FBI that started this. It started at some lower-tier Justice Department of IL. </p>

<p>My theory: the case was brought to the attention of some lower-tier good people within IL-Justice Department. As they pursued it, the case became &#39;bigger&#39; and &#39;hot.&#39; By the time the upper-level players and the FBI-DOJ got the whiff of it, it had gotten out of control (too many people knowing about it, paper trail, etc.). And at this time, all they could do: Contain the case and the situation. Which is exactly what they did. This way, with a plea deal, most facts still sealed, no trials, no discovery ... both sides can win, keep the &#39;real case&#39; under wrap.</p>

<p>We know that CIA Director Richard Helms &quot;retired&quot; to become Ambassador to Iran during the Shah&#39;s reign of terror.</p>

<p>We know that CIA Director and VP candidate George H.W. Bush had a role in the October Surprise.</p>

<p>We know that the CIA has taken the unusual step of denying that Ahmadinejad was one of the hostage-takers in the Iran Hostage Crisis, despite being identified as a hostage taker by several of the hostages when Ahmadinejad became president.</p>

<p>We know that Oliver North established a secret network within Iran for the Iran-Contra weapons shipments.</p>

<p>Was this secret network within Iran a major goal of the Iran-Contra operations, or possibly the main goal?  Have we all overlooked the real operational objective of Iran-Contra?</p>

<p>With decades of CIA Directors and Neocons linked to affairs with Iran, including with the Islamist regime, why are we overlooking the mutual incentive held by the Neocons &amp; the Iranian hardliners to supply Iran with nuclear material or a nuclear weapon?</p>

<p>In other words, is the Iran Deal a Cheney trap?</p>

<p>1- Too many fronts: With Syria, Iraq, what&#39;s happening in Turkey, it has to wait.</p>

<p>2- Russia has been giving on other fronts (including Syria), but they consider Iran is an absolute &#39;no-no&#39; </p>

<p>3- It can be used by &#39;D&#39; party as some kind of a &#39;Obama-caused Peace&#39; bs. Count on it: they will play this card as we get closer to the 2016 elections.</p>

We need good journalists, <a href="http://www.nswbc.org/">whistleblowers</a>, and activists too publicize them and <a href="https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=sibel+edmonds+site:911blogger.com">spread their work</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Luke Ryland has been MIA in Australia. I have not heard from him.</p>

<p>Brad Friedman: hmmm. Let me put it this way, had the case and my reports were limited to Hastert (and some other Republicans), most likely we&#39;d see him covering the case. My emphasis on the fact that this operation touched both parties, my criticism of Obama/Democrats as well as the Republicans ... didn&#39;t sit right with many people who were supporters during the Bush administration, when things seemed a good ol partisan thing to do.</p>

<p>James Corbett: He is the best. I&#39;d say he&#39;s the most amazing outlet for news/analyses. </p>

<p>Abby Martin: Smart, informed and articulate (and of course beautiful). However, believe me or not, RT can be as bad as any US mainstream media. It has its own agenda, objectives, spin... I quit accepting invitations to their program about ... a year ago. Let them have David Letterman;-)</p>

<p>While I think I completely understand the skepticism of mainstream and even other alternative media, can you verbalize your rules or thought process for determining which you think provide useful information and which don&#39;t? Are there some that you think are mixed? Does funding in and of itself play into this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. There are several possibilities:</p>

<p>1- Several gov witnesses (FBI/DOJ) coming forward. They did it in 2005 with Vanity Fair expose on Hastert. But with media killing/covering-up the story, the likelihood is not looking good. One more reason to keep this campaign alive &amp; gain visibility for the case.</p>

<p>2- Other victims and their families can bring civil suit against Hastert. For that, they can depose me, and at least 5 other FBI insiders ... and can file request for documents under discovery ...</p>

<p>Again all this will be possible only if we counter the media blackout/censorship, and get this campaign visible.</p>

Could some banking cabal own/control the NSA? If not then who is ultimately in control of the United States? And could that entity also own all the five eye countries since their human rights policies/offenses are so similar? Doesn&#39;t the Hastert case prove our heads of state have been captured and our country has been hijacked? Sweeping the Hastert case under the rug because its revelations threaten our National Security is a crock because in reality it reveals that our National Security has been breached by the mo-fos with the broom! What a mind eff this all is!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In April 2004, Edmonds claimed she had provided information to the panel investigating the September 11 attacks in February that year. Although she started work shortly after 9/11 and worked for just over six months, she claimed knowledge of information circulating within the FBI during spring and summer of 2001. The session was closed and over three hours long, she said. Reportedly, she told the commission that in the FBI knew of a planned attack months away and the terrorists were in place. She stated, &quot;There was general information about the time-frame, about methods to be used but not specifically about how they would be used and about people being in place and who was ordering these sorts of terror attacks. There were other cities that were mentioned. Major cities with skyscrapers.&quot;[10] On the 26rd, a deposition of Edmonds was squashed under the state secrets privilege.[17]</p>

<p><strong>Can you please discuss this in a little more detail?</strong></p>

<p><strong>-------------</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On 1 February 2011, Edmonds published a story on her own website, adding details of events she described as taking place in April 2001. The account is of another translator&#39;s description of meetings with an Iranian informant months before 9/11, and FBI agents&#39; reaction to it:</p>

<p>Bin Laden’s group is planning a massive terrorist attack in the United States. The order has been issued. They are targeting major cities, big metropolitan cities; they think four or five cities; New York City, Chicago, Washington DC, and San Francisco; possibly Los Angeles or Las Vegas. They will use airplanes to carry out the attacks. They said that some of the individuals involved in carrying this out are already in the United States. They are here in the U.S.; living among us, and I believe some in US government already know about all of this.</p>

<p><strong>Could you please offer some insight into this for us as well?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Continued......</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>FBI contract linguist Sibel Edmonds re-translates 17 of the “hundreds” of wiretapped conversations that had been originally translated or reviewed by co-worker Melek Can Dickerson. [ANTI-WAR (.COM), 8/15/2005] She discovers that Dickerson marked as “not pertinent” every single file that included a reference to surveillance targets connected to the Turkish organizations with whom she had ties (see (November 2001)). One of those targets is a Turkish intelligence officer, who is a personal friend of Dickerson. Edmonds learns from the wiretaps that the officer had spies inside the US State Department and Pentagon seeking access to US military and intelligence secrets. [CBS, 10/27/2002] The wiretaps also reveal that the group is involved in arms and drug smuggling and is tied into a complex network of governmental and private figures in several countries. [UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL, 11/15/2005] Additionally, Edmonds identifies hundreds of other instances where Dickerson’s work obstructed investigations. For example, she learns from one conversation that a US State Department staffer agreed to accept $7,000 in cash from certain individuals in the American-Turkish Council (ATC) in exchange for information. </p>

<p>One wiretapped call discussed a payment to a Pentagon official, who seemed to be involved in weapons-procurement negotiations, while another suggested that Turkish doctoral students had been placed at US research institutions in order to obtain information about black market nuclear weapons. Edmonds also hears discussions about the laundering of drug smuggling profits, the selling of classified military technologies, and a scheme to secretly give Republican Congressman Dennis Hastert tens of thousands of dollars in exchange for political favors and information. She becomes convinced that the American-Turkish Council (ATC) is being used as a front for criminal activity. [ANTI-WAR (.COM), 7/1/2004; ANTI-WAR (.COM), 8/15/2005; VANITY FAIR, 9/2005]</p>

Surely if the dirt on Hastert is as scandalous as you say it is, it would be headline news!  I mean, he was the longest serving Speaker of the House in US history.  This is the sort of stuff that sells, why on earth would the media miss out on such an opportunity? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, the main thing that supports the limited hangout argument is that Snowden was working for Booz Allen Hamilton, which, let&#39;s get this straight: is both a &quot;private equity&quot; outfit (related to GHWB&#39;s Carlyle Group), and yet they had unfiltered, real-time access to NSA intercepts? To me, this is the real scandal that no one is talking about. And, to add weight to the argument, Snowden has not added further clarification to any possible economic espionage angle there might be to this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, the economic espionage is easy enough to guess, when you realize that many people in Congress have investments/ties to BAH and several other related firms, and then remember that Congress is also immune to SEC prosecution for insider trading. I wouldn&#39;t be shocked at all if this kind of thing (and much of what Snowden revealed) was set up as a real-time business and foreign government intercept so Congresscritters could simply turn a profit on all of that info.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Sibel,<br/>
Are there different criminal organizations that have close relations with the government? And have partially infiltrated the government?</p>

<p>The organizations that I can count are:<br/>
 - the drugs-mafia<br/>
 - (sex)slavery<br/>
 - pedophilia networks<br/>
 - weapon dealers<br/>
 - militairy industry<br/>
 - bankers<br/>
 - money white washers<br/>
 - corrupt traders<br/>
 - gladio and other secret military groups<br/>
 - oil companies and other resource extractors<br/>
 - lawyers / the corrupted law system<br/>
 - corrupt medicine dealers<br/>
 - corrupt scientists<br/>
 - secret military<br/>
 - the corrupted voting system<br/>
 - corrupt companies (pushing their monopoly)  </p>

<p>Many of them will have good relations with the military system, the CIA, the FBI, the NSA.</p>

<p>Is there one group that controls most of them, or are they working together on the basis of money, power, blackmail and addiction?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>.... &quot;partially infiltrated the government&quot;- I&#39;d say this, we can turn this on its head and look at it this way: Deep State-Gov penetrating certain criminal networks and forging partnerships with them. </p>

<p>To give you a real-life example: in 80s, Turkish government, released hundreds of their hard-core criminals (from serial killers to drug lords), trained them in Army camps, gave them &#39;missions,&#39; and used them (for decades) for many different operations: from false flag operations to assassinating viable oppositions and journalists to bringing in revenue (monetary).</p>

<p>You see what I&#39;m getting at? In this particular case you are looking at a criminal government using its governmental power/authority to penetrate, control and direct criminal enterprises.</p>

<p>1- The DOJ invoked the draconian &#39;State Secrets Privilege&#39; in my case.</p>

<p>2- The DOJ-FBI classified everything about me: including my languages, my degrees, my country of origin ... even date of birth. In 2004, Federal Judge Reggie Walton ruled for the government and declared everything about me &#39;Classified.&#39;</p>

<p>3- For the first time in US history DOJ invoked gag order on US congress via Retroactive Classification in my case. It is unconstitutional; illegal. Yet, congress did not challenge it. They abided by DOJ&#39;d illegal order.</p>

<p>Do you fear that at some point the informed public is going to pass out from political cynicism and combat fatigue from scandal after scandal? I feel like we&#39;ve been here before - only the corruption and pathology gets worse each time. I&#39;m completely appalled by the Hastert story, but I can&#39;t help but nod grimly and speculate whether a plea deal means that he got away with something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And thank &#39;you.&#39;</p>

<p>WE are looking at two different segments: </p>

<p>1-A small minority, those of us who are active/informed- very easy to end up with pessimism, cynicism and fatigue; exhaustion. On the other hand, we keep each other going. That&#39;s been the case with me. Each time I say &#39;enough already; can&#39;t do this any more,&#39; someone says something, does something, and restores my resolve to press on.</p>

<p>2-The Apathetic Majority: The most frightening reality facing us today. Saying this won&#39;t make me popular, but that&#39;s how I see it. It is not only top-to-bottom, but also bottom-up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a great deal of apathy, certainly, but among people who do pay attention there is a great deal of denial.  It&#39;s the Five Stages of Grief.  Some people can&#39;t seem to move beyond the &quot;denial&quot; stage and into step 2 which is &quot;anger&quot;. </p>

<p>The media and government exploit this in so many ways, not the least of which is the bogus &quot;election cycle&quot; which now seems to be near-permanent.  People happily let themselves get sucked into that reality show because they enjoy the illusion of thinking that either (a) the great New Prrson is actually going to change things and/or (b) we HAVE to keep the Evil Scumbags on the Other Side from winning. </p>

<p>One of the things most people are utterly clueless about -- and this is key -- is just how good the media/government manipulation industry is at leading people&#39;s minds!</p>

<p>I like to say they are the hand holding the laser pointer, and we are the cats.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been studying this obsessively since 2002, and it is getting better, but slowly.  More and more people, when they talk in private, have awakened to a great deal of the fakery in the world, but they won&#39;t talk about it publicly. </p>

<p>One thing the media/government does is lie to us about what &quot;we think&quot;.  And people for the most part still believe this!!  And feel they they are in some tiny minority or that they shouldn&#39;t mention what they think to others for fear of being ridiculed.  That is one of the biggest obstacles facing us now. </p>

<p>1)
-How much % of &quot;The Lone Gladio&quot; book could be considered to be identical to real life events?</p>

<p>-How much % could be considered fictional, but on line with what usually happens with this kind of people?</p>

<p>-And how much % would be completely fictional?</p>

<p>2) Which of the protagonists would/could be Hastert?</p>

<p>3) Do you plan to release the book translated to other languages?</p>

<p>You are one of the most inspiring, brave, authentic and funny persons alive, thanks for existing. Your media should be reaching much more people, I wish it grows. Just some ideas in case you read:</p>

<p>Please offer some alternative payments to PayPal and banks, you know they are part of the problem. The best way of criticizing (Omydiar/The Intercept, msm), is offering better solutions (Bitcoin/BoilingFrogsPost.com). You could accept payments very easy using some bitcoin service, like bitpay, coinbase or similar, you&#39;ll get them converted and deposited automatically in whatever account and currency</p>

<p>Please consider expanding your content to other languages. And that your website paying system does not take into consideration countries with sanctions, with very low income and painful currencies. I hope you come up with better ideas to grow, make your content reach as much as possible people, and finance.</p>

<p>And fix your sound if possible. In your Hastert audios, your mic picks up many mouth noises, clicks, salivating... It&#39;s nothing important nor disgusting, but you could try using a pop filter, using the mic from a longer distance, raising then your voice and recording at lower volumes...</p>

<p>No they are&#39;nt, this case is even on hastert&#39;s Wikipedia article.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In May 2015, Hastert was indicted on federal charges of structuring bank withdrawals to evade bank reporting requirements and then making false statements to federal investigators. Prosecutors said that the money was to compensate for and conceal deliberately unspecified misconduct by Hastert against an unnamed individual years earlier. Hastert pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>

<p>In June 2015, public accusations — but not legal charges — emerged that Hastert had sexually abused three students (including the aforementioned unnamed individual) when he was a teacher more than three decades earlier. In 2006, Hastert denied one such accusation, though there was no press coverage at the time. The latter accusation was reiterated publicly in 2015 by the sister of the alleged victim (who died in 1995), while the other abuse accusations were leaked. -<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hastert">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hastert</a></p>

Or the horrible things he was doing to other children while serving as speaker?  Because those are the things Sibel is claiming the MSM is blacking out.

<p>Who do you think controls (no names but ideas for us to research) all these people at the top and why do these powerful people have so much control over other people along with the media?

<p>They are great; sure. But, it takes two to tango. Why people have become so very apathetic? Why such a high level of moral ambiguity? </p>

<p>We all know it did not happen over night. We&#39;re looking at systematic indoctrination. It begins with challenging that; countering it. It is starting with our children: do we outsource their entire education/upbringing to the state-corporation partnership Inc? Or do we take responsibility and work towards countering that?</p>

And FOrgive me If it was already touched upon, or I&#39;m making a sophoric mistake, but have any of your Hastert investigations, or your previous works, touched on or revealed any information regarding the Franklin Financial (not familiar with the proper title) pedophilia scandal, of the early 80&#39;s?  And as a second component to that, why was the fbi so adamant about refusing to investigate that, at the time?  Again, many thanks for taking the time to do this, Aloha!</p>

I think we should have more sources of information actually to stay relevant in this sophisticated world. And I wish I could have a good command of Russian, for it&#39;s a huge country with many mass media outlets able to share some alternative vision of events. I also think that EU and US mass media are very good at manipulating our minds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have tried to work with my local &quot;Abolitionist&quot; group only to have someone say: </p>

<p>&quot;He&#39;s not being charged with the sexual crimes Kath and many cases end in plea deals.  The one person he was paying is better off with people not knowing his identity and the other person he is alleged to have committed a sexual crime against is dead.  This man&#39;s reputation is ruined and he will likely spend a year or two in jail for what he is pleading to.&quot;</p>

<p>I need full spinal fusion with a 10% chance it will help and have been on bed rest post surgery on 3 heart meds and stealth pain meds- I am doing the BEST I can, don&#39;t slam people for being inactive when I can&#39;t keep up with the pages you are on. </p>

<p>Thank you, dear.

<p>How about this: I&#39;ll be back around 8:00 p.m. (Pacific) and stay for another hour or two to answer questions. Will that work? Will we be able to line up a few moderators by then, you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dear Sibel,</p>

<p>IMHO the biggest case need to be considered, but yet ignored by most, because we have so many problems is geoengineering, disguised as globalwarming &amp; climatechange or saving the climate.</p>

<p>It is hard to understand for most people, because of missing basic knowledge about clouds, meteorology and thermik (german word for thermal activity).</p>

<p>The wars in Middle East are part of this war on on tropospheric water!</p>

<p>When You find time, please look at following blog posts, made by me. Some articles are bi- or multilangual, therefore the flags for selection.</p>
