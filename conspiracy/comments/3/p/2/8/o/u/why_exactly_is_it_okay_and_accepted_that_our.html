       I don't frequent this sub, but this happens to me so much. And yes, I will be turning off all features that might cause this to happen. But we should have to opt
       <em>
        in
       </em>
       to things like this, not opt out. There should also be more of a warning that this is happening.

       I've seen a good number of posts about this here and in other subs.  No one who was aware of it or those who commented seemed OK with it or to accept it.

       It's creepy, unwanted spying, no doubt.  Targeted advertising.  Google has been doing it for years and on-demand TV  started doing it with commercials a while ago.  People don't like it, but there it is.  What are they going to do short of not having a cellphone or a TV or using Bing?

       I've thought about this issue a bit... Whevever I'm trying to filter the sensationalism from reality I try to extrapolate a corresponding scenario as close to my own experience as I possibly can.

      <p>
       Now follow me here.. If I were an administrator or a politician or an illuminati or a fucking god and I could hear all your conversations and read all your mail... I just wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it because of benevolence, morality, altruism, or any other such nonsense.. I wouldn't do it because I just don't give a fuck about what anyone else says or thinks unless they're talking to me. Also, I can
       <em>
        barely

       I think the concern is just that they will target people of interest who they feel to be threats, either in terms of exposing secrets or of public organizing against the status quo.  The most the average Joe has to worry about is is a database somewhere knows he drinks bad beer, buys adult diapers and still speaks Greek to his parents.

       Maybe it is, and maybe it's important.. still don't care though. No matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to care about the silly shit egomaniacs and the high technopriests of the 21st century do to themselves and by proxy their followers (this includes you).

       It's all a big stupid fucking game. If you want to "win" the only thing you have to do is be relatively happy, well fed, and have friends you can trust and that trust you.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you fear the state the state wins. If you're scared of what they're doing or what they're capable of doing then you're already a slave to fear. Only when you are
       <strong>
        truly
       </strong>
       free from giving a fuck about the machinations of a psychopathic empire that feeds on fear can you be
       <strong>
        truly
       </strong>
       free.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this information and technology is a Gordian Knot that gets tighter as you pull. It's a rabbit hole with no bottom. Do not be your own worst enemy. Fear is the primary motivator of human beings in both thought and deed. Overcoming fear should be the primary objective for a thinking man in the 21st century.

       Do you mean the permissions most apps require when you install them? I completely agree,  the control we DONT have these days is astounding,  it would almost seem the powers that be want ALL of our private info,  ALL the time. Strange,  no?  True? Yes.

       I don't know why you're getting down voted.  I also got a brand new Android phone without Facebook preloaded on it.  actually,  it didn't come with any bloat ware at all.  it's the Galaxy core prime.  got it from Walmart for around 150,  and I use it with straight talk.  only 45/mo unlimited everything.  (no this is not an advert) just saw this guy being shot down for his truthful comments.

       The worst part is that this is from something we are paying for. Not like we can let them listen in if they pay - we pay and they listen anyway. Since we are the consumers we should have other options like set my shit on private. It makes me think there is a market for a device that we can control.

       Someone should lobby congress about this. The main problem of course is that we've all made companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter megarich and whatever legislation got put into Congress would probably go nowhere because of their professional lobbying staff.

       If you have an Android device, (will never own another apple product) you need to download D-Vasive Pro. Its 8 bones. It will lock all apps out of you microphone, camera, screenshots, wifi, bluetooth, and also has stingray protection, which is actually just airplane mode, but whatever. Its totally worth it. I would have paid fifty dollars for this app. I love you John McAfee! I combine this with textsecure for apple users they have a half ass version called signal 2.0 I think they keep changing the name. The apple version of course still allows them to take screen shots. Because apple is BIG BROTHER. You suck BTW! I also have D-central 1 which shows you how invasive these apps are and will help you keep them deleted, because these assholes like to sneak them back into your phone. For some odd reason I can't get rid of IMDb. It has nothing to do with anything its obviously a spying tool of some kind. Here is a log showing that when the camera is unlocked your phone takes pictures every ten minutes and sends them over your wifi. If there is no wifi then you are having your broadband stolen from you by these fuckheads and they should be made to pay for that shit. The government too, they are making us pay for their ability to spy on us. I just find this fucking god damn appalling. When is the god damn revolution gonna start already, cmon you lazy shit heals! haha

       I wish I had more info for you. I can just tell you that this happens to me pretty much every day I use my phone. Yesterday, I had a conversation with my sister at the kitchen table, and soon after, I got conversation-specific ads. Things that aren't vague - not like "cookie recipe" or "ways to cure the common cold" - we're talking specific things I had never seen ads for before. Things I'd never searched or talked about in an online/written space.
      </p>

       Edit: Also feel it necessary to say I do not have a Facebook account, or a Facebook app installed anywhere. It is something else.

       I do have a history of delusional thinking and paranoia. I am reasonable in that I'm willing to accept that what you're saying is possible. I'll talk to someone about it. Of course, I'm going to say that I don't believe it is delusions of self-reference, because I'm not the only one making this complaint. But I have an appointment set up for next week. Thanks for the advice.

       Been telling off those bitches for a while. It's been common knowledge for quite a bit, or at least a logical step in the technological evolution if you haven't seen the shit that's been distributed for the last few years.

       And it's not just for ad's. It's how the guv backdoors everyone. Forget the percentage of preloaded apps on androids and I phones, but most everything comes compromised.

       Wtf do your psychiatrists know about capabilities of the nsa.  If you're an overly paranoid person, its probably best you chill out and take solace in the fact that if you're not doing anything extremely wrong you have nothing to worry about... But that doesnt change the fact that they have the ability to listen and see almost everything.

       Spoken like a person that will eventually regret saying this. Eventually we are all going to be proclaimed domestic terrorist. Its about not being monetized or spied on because being a peeping Tom is unethical and in most all cases illegal. Do you like prancing naked in front of middle aged men? Because you are you know? If you see my post above it proves how many pictures are being taken of you. Also you are being listened to. We are literally carrying around NSA bugs everywhere we go. I promise you their are pictures of you masturbating in a government server somewhere, and you are telling this guy that you are ok with this. Maybe you should be seeing a psychiatrist?

       No bro, you totally got me wrong.  Im totally against this shit.  But, there are certain people who are predisposed (like a paranoid schizophrenic).  For these people, fretting about this stuff can literally ruin their lives.  All im saying is that if you're one of these people, its prob better to not dwell on this stuff and try to live a semblance of a normal life.

       That would not be a correct way to handle it. If a person doesn't want to be spied on they should take steps to cure the government of its sociopathic insurgency into our lives. You do that by locking down your phone. I have total peace of mind right now. It only costs 8 dollars.

       I think the concern is just that they will target people of interest who they feel to be threats, either in terms of exposing secrets or of public organizing against the status quo.  The most the average Joe has to worry about is is a database somewhere knows he drinks bad beer, buys adult diapers and still speaks Greek to his parents.

       Oh, don't worry, I will never use medication again. I am pretty darn stable these days, so much so that I'm willing to look further into this to make sure it's

       a symptom of something more serious. A little talking is beneficial every now and then for the highly functioning mentally ill. Hah.
