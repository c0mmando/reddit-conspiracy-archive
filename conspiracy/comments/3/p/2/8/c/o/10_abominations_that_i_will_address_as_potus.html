        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>10 Abominations that I will address:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Undeclared wars. The bankers have been using the blood and treasure of the hardworking American families for their oversea conquests. These people must be charged and face the death penalty for being complicit in mass murder.</p></li>
<li><p>Homeownership and college, two things that made up part of the American dream, have been bastardized through inflation. The Federal Government, TBTF Banks, Federal Reserve, and Wall Street have destroyed these dreams through interest rate manipulation and the expansion of easy credit. The people involved must be charged and face the death penalty for being complicit in financial genocide. </p></li>
<li><p>The healthcare system is a corporate monopoly that is defended and assisted by the Federal Government&#39;s tax collecting agency, the IRS. Our new healthcare system is a corporate monopoly designed to eliminate competitors and price-fix the system. The people involved must be charged and face the death penalty for being complicit to financial genocide and crimes against humanity. </p></li>
<li><p>The Federal Governments attempt to grab the guns away from law abiding citizens must end. Every citizen has the right to defend him or herself. If the President has his armed Secret Service and the Country has her nuclear weapons, then Mr. Smith must have the right to defend his castle and family. The people complicit in eroding the second amendment must be tried for treason.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;The issuing power of currency should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.&quot; Mr. Jefferson&#39;s fear has come true...the children have awoken homeless on the land their fathers conquered. The people involved with the Federal Reserve must be tried for treason and financial terrorism. They must face the death penalty for their crimes against humanity.</p></li>
<li><p>End the street Drug War on the common people, and fight the real drug battle against the pharmaceutical industrialists. The use of street drugs must be treated as a medical issue and all drugs legalized. End the war on drugs, stop CIA drug trafficking, put the drug lord out of business, and free the non-violent offenders. The biggest drug dealers are the players in the pharmaceutical industry who monopolize drug prices, sell their product through forced vaccinations and push mind alternating drugs to the mentally unstable. They must be tried for treason, financial terrorism, and crimes against humanity.</p></li>
<li><p>End the monopoly of the communication channels and their propaganda machine. Their propaganda have inspired the young men and woman to die as mercenaries overseas, their propaganda has motived the people to be mindless consumers to drive them into debt and servitude, their propaganda have successfully created an American zombie addicted to entertainment and comfort.</p></li>
<li><p>The religious institutions are corrupt and use the government as protection. They align with political agendas, they protect the child predators, and they use illegal accounting practices to enrich themselves and enslave their members. They have bastardized their message and taken advantage of something that should be sacred.</p></li>
<li><p>The public school system are now indoctrination centers used to push the agendas of billionaires. They must teach the trades, financial independence, and the STEM courses. The public school system is now a system that protects pensioners, enforces the lies of the government, and ensures our children are good employees, not business owners or leaders. </p></li>
<li><p>A new investigation into 9/11 must happen because the impacts of this mass murder event are still lingering on the local and international levels. Locally, our rescue men and woman continue to die from the toxic chemicals on that day.  They have demanded an investigation and aren&#39;t being heard. On the international level, that event lead to our conquest of the middle east and now we are on a collision course with Russia. The people involved must be tried for treason and face the death penalty for crimes against humanity.</p></li>

<p>I&#39;m a small business owner that works 100 hours a week to provide for my employees and their families, I&#39;m a father with a young son who wants the best for him, I&#39;m an American tired of waiting for another media/corporate sponsored candidate to rescue us, and I&#39;m tired of seeing other good folks too tired and hopeless to do the difficult tasks of standing up to the machine.</p>

<p>10 Abominations that I will address:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m gonna challenge you on some of these if you don&#39;t mind </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Homeownership and college, two things that made up part of the American dream, have been bastardized through inflation. The Federal Government, TBTF Banks, Federal Reserve, and Wall Street have destroyed these dreams through interest rate manipulation and the expansion of easy credit. The people involved must be charged and face the death penalty for being complicit in financial genocide. </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>What is financial genocide and who was involved and when was this made a crime and by whom?</p>

<p>Please be specific </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The healthcare system is a corporate monopoly that is defended and assisted by the Federal Government&#39;s tax collecting agency, the IRS. Our new healthcare system is a corporate monopoly designed to eliminate competitors and price-fix the system. The people involved must be charged and face the death penalty for being complicit to financial genocide and crimes against humanity. </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, what is financial he code and what crimes against humanity.
Please be specific; also ex-post facto laws are not constitutional so how would you address that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The issuing power of currency should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.&quot; Mr. Jefferson&#39;s fear has come true...the children have awoken homeless on the land their fathers conquered. The people involved with the Federal Reserve must be tried for treason and financial terrorism. They must face the death penalty for their crimes against humanity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same questions as above </p>

<p>Also when you say returned to the people: who is the people?</p>

<p>And what&#39;s wrong with the federal reserve?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>End the monopoly of the communication channels and their propaganda machine. Their propaganda have inspired the young men and woman to die as mercenaries overseas, their propaganda has motived the people to be mindless consumers to drive them into debt and servitude, their propaganda have successfully created an American zombie addicted to entertainment and comfort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How would you end this?</p>

<p>And what propaganda. Theirs 1000s of communication channels, it&#39;s not the channels fault that million prefer it </p>

<p>That&#39;s not a crime </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The public school system are now indoctrination centers used to push the agendas of billionaires. They must teach the trades, financial independence, and the STEM courses. The public school system is now a system that protects pensioners, enforces the lies of the government, and ensures our children are good employees, not business owners or leaders. </li>
</ol>

<p>So you believe someone in Washington knows better what kids in Kansas should e learning than the people in Kansas?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ll try to answer each question separately, as to avoid taking up too much space.  I’ll answer #1 first:</p>

<p>a.   Financial genocide is the widespread financial destruction of a group of people.  In this case, the victims are American citizens, taxpayers and primarily the poor and middle class.</p>

<p>b.   Culprits of student loan bubble: Many corporations and banks, supported through a variety of Federal laws since 1965, and shielded by the creation of a government corporation, Sallie Mae, which has been fully privatized since 2004. At one time, JP Morgan, US Bank, Citi and Bank of America were allowed to give out student loans fully backed and guaranteed by Sallie Mae through The Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFEL).  As a result, many of the loans were considered subprime.  That program has now ended. Since 2009/2010, Wells Fargo, Discover, NelNet, JP Morgan are the primary predators, but still operate under Sallie Mae’s system and powerful lobbying control.  As of 2014, more than 90% of student loans are government backed.  Corporate power have used elected people within the government as their protection, co-conspirators, and enablers.  Fascism.  </p>

<p>c.   You need victims for there to be a crime: Less than 50% of college students graduate, Americans are now $1.2 trillion in student loan debt that can’t be eliminated through bankruptcy, an estimated 23% of current student loan borrowers will never pay ($250 billion dollars the taxpayers must cover).  American tax payers and citizens are the victims.   </p>

<p>The home market has been manipulated in much of the same way as as the college bubble.  Many of the players are the same, the laws are different, but the outcome and purpose is the same.  </p>

<p>You haven&#39;t answered any others</p>

<blockquote>
<p>!Financial genocide is the widespread financial destruction of a group of people.  In this case, the victims are American citizens, taxpayers and primarily the poor and middle class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When was this made a crime, please be specific </p>

<p>First of all, making bad financial decisions is not a crime. So financial genocide doesn&#39;t exist</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Oh, so none of this is a crime. So you want to punish people for not committing a crime </p>

<blockquote>
<p>need victims for there to be a crime: Less than 50% of college students graduate, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not a crime and whose fault is that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Americans are now $1.2 trillion in student loan debt that can’t be eliminated through bankruptcy, an estimated 23% of current student loan borrowers will never pay ($250 billion dollars the taxpayers must cover).  American tax payers and citizens are the victims.   </p>

<p>None of  what you described is a crime </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, I had to just lol at this.</p>

<p>Because it seems as if you could have spent some time reading about the fed and gain and understanding of it, but you chose not. Don&#39;t worry I&#39;ll correct you where you are wrong </p>

<p>First, it&#39;s not a cabal.</p>

<p>Second: yes they are unelected and for good reasons, the fed is in charge  of Monetary policy, it needs to be based on sound economic understanding not the next election </p>

<p>Third: why would I have a problem with people making decisions based on sound economic policy, if you can present a recent fed decision you disagree with and why, and what you think the alternative would have been, I&#39;d like to hear it</p>

<p>Fourth: nope, nope, nope. They don&#39;t own nor do they print currency. Any sophomore business major could have told you this. You are thinking of the treasury</p>

<p>To increase money supply, the fed buys government bonds and vice verse and often times through open market transactions: they also set policy for banks such as reserve requirements etcc </p>

<p>Please actually read up on the subject matter </p>

<p>Please tell me how the fed creates money at thin air,I actually work in finance and accounting we&#39;d love to know how this works</p>

<p>What you think is creating money out of thin air: isn&#39;t so </p>

<p>Does the fed get audited? Does the fed publish its minutes? Does the fed release statements?
No transparency huh?</p>

<p>...lol.</p>

<p>Second: yes they are unelected and for good reasons, the fed is in charge of Monetary policy, it needs to be based on sound economic understanding not the next election</p>

<p>So you do agree that private, unelected bankers control the currency and policy surrounding the currency and profit off of this control?  And that we don&#39;t know their names?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Third: why would I have a problem with people making decisions based on sound economic policy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t understand why someone would have a problem with private bankers controlling the currency we all use and profiting off of every dollar printed?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if you can present a recent fed decision you disagree with and why, and what you think the alternative would have been, I&#39;d like to hear it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t support the $16 trillion given out interest free to both US and foreign governments and corporations during the height of the financial crisis of 2008.  My alternative would&#39;ve probably been to, ya know... not give this $16 trillion bailout to these entities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They don&#39;t own nor do they print currency</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tell me more about how the Fed, a private company, doesn&#39;t profit off of every <del>dollar</del> Federal Reserve Note printed.</p>

<p>How do you feel about every single dollar that&#39;s printed having debt attached to it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please tell me how the fed creates money at thin air</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you think &quot;open market operations&quot; are?  Tell me, where do you think the trillions of dollars of QE come from?  The Fed buys assets - but what is it buying those assets with?  What money is it using?  How does it expand the money supply?</p>

<p>...it hits a number on a keyboard and suddenly that money exists.</p>

<p>There&#39;s only been one ever GAO audit of the Fed done in history.  No complete audit has ever been done.  And the GAO audit itself showed that over $16 trillion (more than the US&#39;s GDP) had been given out to both US and foreign banks and corporations at 0 interest, almost none of which has been returned.</p>

<p>And of course the least transparent part of all: all of the shareholders are private and thus all of the individuals in control are not known to the public at all.</p>

<p>Lol: once again. No</p>

<p>They don&#39;t control currency, that&#39;s the treasury. They control monetary policy; there&#39;s a difference: please elaborate; where does this profit go?</p>

<p>And yes, we know the names of the governors of the federal reserve, the regional banks, and employees at the bank</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Again: they don&#39;t control treasury, they control monetary policy: I know it seems like the same thing, but it&#39;s not. That&#39;s why the tactics of the fed don&#39;t always work out, if they controlled currency, it would work out. </p>

<p>Please take a class, intermediate finance would help. Most business schools cover the fed in the first section of that class before you begin valuation </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Ok, and what do you think would have been the consequence of not enacting easing?</p>

<p>And please be very specific, how did they give out this money?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They don&#39;t own nor do they print currency</p>

<p>Tell me more about how the Fed, a private company, doesn&#39;t profit off of every <del>dollar</del> Federal Reserve Note printed.</p>

<p>Do they print currency: simple question? Yes or no?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you feel about every single dollar that&#39;s printed having debt attached to it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well who prints that money?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please tell me how the fed creates money at thin air</p>

<p>What do you think &quot;open market operations&quot; are?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know what they are, but you aren&#39;t answering the question: how does the fed print money out of thin air. Please be specific </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tell me, where do you think the trillions of dollars of QE come from?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again; you aren&#39;t answering the question, please be specific </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Fed buys assets - but what is it buying those assets with?  What money is it using?  How does it expand the money supply?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You aren&#39;t answering neither of these question, please answer them in specifics </p>

<blockquote>
<p>it hits a number on a keyboard and suddenly that money exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you support this assertion with actual evidence</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s only been one ever GAO audit of the Fed done in history.  No complete audit has ever been done.

</blockquote>

<p>What does a complete audit consist of? And why isn&#39;t the current audit, the latest one; not complete?</p>

<p>Yes I make good money. Not from the fed, I wouldn&#39;t mind working there though. It&#39;s w nice place to have on your resume: opens doors when you show experience from one of the hardest places to get a job at</p>

<p>Oh, is this you calling me a shill, because everyone who disagrees with you is a shill?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for the laughs today, </p>

<p>Thank you for showing you are incapable of making an actual argument supported by facts</p>

<p>I&#39;ll ask that one question again that I asked before: who prints money: the fed or treasury?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I defend anyone who is attacked due to dumb conspiracies from people who simply don&#39;t understand what they&#39;re talking about</p>

<p>You posted so many things about the fed which were just simply not true </p>

<p>What&#39;s a shame is that even when you are corrected, you maintain the same notions </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Question: do facts matter to you?</p>

<p>Does it matter to you that many of the stuff you said was simply false</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a degree in economics but your condescension is appreciated and very much expected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m glad; so then it you have the education, why is it that you stated the fed prints money when it&#39;s clearly the treasury who does?</p>

<p>As a born and bred Wiccan, I must ask, because either my google-fu is weak as hell, or it hasn&#39;t happened: What in the Hell have people of my faith ever done to others as a whole within the last 100 years worth your hate?</p>

<p>I live in Indiana, a heavily Christian-dominated state. Me and my kind are considered filth and vermin. We have done nothing to anybody, as far as I know. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The religious institutions are corrupt and use the government as protection. They align with political agendas, they protect the child predators, and they use illegal accounting practices to enrich themselves and enslave their members. They have bastardized their message and taken advantage of something that should be sacred.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please, by all means. Point out the last time you ever heard of a genuine Wiccan or other Pagan Brother/Sister ever going out for a bit of the old Ultra Violence, or looking to dine on veal vagina and tenderloin wang. Please, by all means show me some proof that persons whom I share a sincere and deeply held belief system in common have gone out and committed massive bank frauds or other financial crimes of media note. Please, by all means, point out to me where a Pagan has used The Law in a selfish manner and not to defend themselves from oppression from Judeo-Christian-Abrahamic faith systems. Please, by all means, show me a dangerous cult formed by genuine Pagans in modern history whom allegedly enslaved others to enrich themselves.</p>

<p>By all means, sir, show me a Pagan who has misused the gnosis granted to them by the Divine to take advantage of others.</p>

<p>Blessed Fucking Be.
