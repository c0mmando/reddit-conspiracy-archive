       Clearly, Lenin was wrong, as it was Communism, not Capitalism, that decayed. "Fascism" was merely a reaction to the mass murders and police states set up by Lenin and his cohorts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anytime you read someone using the term "fascist" to mean "bad" you're dealing with someone still in thrall to Communist propaganda from 100 years ago. It's rather pathetic.

       Folks, notice how it resorts to this silly name-calling and ad-hom: "vast ignorance in your thinking, making an ass out of yourself, so sad, little one."
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, we're dealing with someone who is quoting Lenin ... freaking Lenin ... approvingly, and seems to believe "fascism" means "bad things" - and doesn't even understand the actual relationship between capitalism and fascism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any one want to bet it couldn't even begin to describe the historical circumstances of Mussolini's Italy or Franco's Spain?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's ok to laugh now, since Communism is completely discredited and these looney-tunes aren't taken seriously outside of their Marxist student groups, but god help us if these nuts ever got power again. Remember what happened last time - hundreds of millions dead, gulaged, and oppressed.
      </p>

       Have no doubt they would be rounding people up for "ungoodthink" if they ever had the chance.

       No. It's just a pity how people don't have a clue what "fascism" really was. The USA and GB are nothing even close to "fascist" - they are internationalist, not nationalist, they are oligarchical, not populist, and they are imperialist, not inward-looking.
      </p>

       So, no, nothing even close to fascist.

       What?

      <p>
       Internationalism and nationalism are not an oxymoron.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump isn't a populist I have never seen a populist candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who says fascists are not imperialists, seems to me that Nazis had a pretty well defined wish for an empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only official definition of Fascism comes from Benito Mussolini, the founder of fascism, in which he outlines three principles of a fascist philosophy:
       <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fascism">
        2. "'Nothing outside the state'.
       </a>
       The country must grow and the implied goal of any fascist nation is to rule the world, and have every human submit to the government":
      </p>
      <p>
       For some reason me thinks you are not viewing this reasonably.

       Eh, I think it's fair to call Trump a "populist" - calling Trump a "fascist" would be stupid, though.

      <p>
       Most fascist movements were nationalist, not imperialist. Communism was, of course, the definition of imperialist. Remember, Stalin was considered a "traitor to Communism" for his idea of "socialism in one country" instead of a "world wide Communist revolution."

       The only official definition of Fascism comes from Benito Mussolini, the founder of fascism, in which he outlines three principles of a fascist philosophy: 2. "'Nothing outside the state'. The country must grow and the implied goal of any fascist nation is to rule the world, and have every human submit to the government":

       Do you have a source for that Mussolini quote? The "nothing outside the state" sounds right, but "the implied goal of any fascist nation is to rule the world" is something I don't remember reading.

       For instance, one of the links:

      <p>
       only has this part of the quote: "Nothing outside the state".
      </p>
      <p>
       It then "interprets" that to mean "The country must grow and the implied goal of any fascist nation is to rule the world, and have every human submit to the government." - which doesn't appear to be something that Mussolini actually said.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, can you clarify if that is an actual quote from Mussolini, or if that is just someone "interpreting" it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because "Nothing outside the state" does NOT imply "The country must grow and the implied goal of any fascist nation is to rule the world, and have every human submit to the government."
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: In fact, it doesn't appear that Mussolini said that, at all.

       Can you link to an actual quote of Mussolini writing/saying that? A google search on the quote leads to a bunch of sites without an actual quote.

       Interesting, then, that Italy and Spain - the two major examples of fascism (Hitler was his own special brand of something) were about the least imperialist of the Great Powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainly, the USA and the USSR were far more imperialist than either Germany or Italy and far more than Spain.

       I completely agree... It is like users comparing colonial and neocolonial conditions, calling them the same.  It is disingenuous, and takes the true brutality away from 'colonialism'.  Essentially, this deceitful form of comparison erases history, making abhorrent historical conditions seem equal to that of current conditions.  Further, this dishonest tool of contrast is often used to incite aggressive reactions against societal norms, and the human's that represent them.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       That kind of dishonest movement toward change is more dangerous than our current power structure.  The revolution must be honest and peaceful.  The truth stands as a minority.
