<p>They threatened to release Russian information in 2010 and after Moscow sent VERY SERIOUS threats to Wikileaks et al., they haven&#39;t said a <strong><em>SINGLE</em></strong> bad word about Russia since then. </p>

<p><a href="http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2028283,00.html">http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2028283,00.html</a></p>

<p><strong><em>Why did Wikileaks get cold feet????</em></strong></p>

<p>But Wikileaks will never hesitate to embarrass a NATO country. Pay attention to the subtlety of this. </p>

<p>WIKILEAKS even threatened Russia in 2010...What happened?!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/11/30/moscows-bid-to-blow-up-wikileaks-russians-play-by-different-rules.html">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/11/30/moscows-bid-to-blow-up-wikileaks-russians-play-by-different-rules.html</a></p>

<p><strong>SOMETHING CHANGED</strong></p>

<p><strong>Have you never wondered how/why Assange got a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Tomorrow">RT talksho</a>w</strong>? </p>

<p><em>After he spent his entire social capital threatening to expose Russian secret documents?</em></p>

<p><strong>You ever wonder how Assange had connections in Russia to house Snowden?</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/wikileaks-told-snowden-to-stay-in-russia-2014-5">http://www.businessinsider.com/wikileaks-told-snowden-to-stay-in-russia-2014-5</a></p>

<p>None of this seems suspicious to you?</p>

<p>Was Wikileaks started as a Russian OP? I say no.</p>

<p>Has it become one? I&#39;m starting to think it is. </p>

<p><strong>Even the KSA leaks are looking a little more suspicious even recently.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.newsbred.com/shia-sunni-angle-india-and-wikileaks">https://www.newsbred.com/shia-sunni-angle-india-and-wikileaks</a></p>

<p>Saudi Arabia is anti-Russian and aligned with Western interests. Iran is pro-Russia. Pay attention to the <strong><a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-10-16/saudi-arabia-s-oil-war-with-russia">Oil Price War</a></strong> going on now between Russia and KSA. Are you picking up on pattern yet?</p>

<p>I am NOT a fan of the Saudis...but in the realm of geopolitics, the Saudis are fans of the Western aims and its obvious Russia isn&#39;t toeing that line. </p>

<p><strong>Who leaked TPP?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Who is TPP not including? Russia and China.</strong></p>

<p>Is the pattern not getting more obvious now?</p>

<p><strong>Who leaked the Sony pictures files?</strong></p>

<p>Why was this even relevant for Wikileaks to reveal?</p>

<p>There is a clear and consistent anti-western tint here that needs to be investigated formally. </p>

<p><strong>Why the hell would WIKILEAKS post articles about how CIA spies travel?</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be perfectly honest, this is exactly the kind of explanation I&#39;d expect American interests to put forth.</p>

<p>Assange only focuses on NATO countries because they are the only ones that are <em>relevant to his product</em>, which is Wikileaks.</p>

<p>The thing about Snowden... I&#39;ve always thought that it was an interesting coincidence that the word &quot;snowden&quot; is often context-relevant to NSA-related places. Like &quot;snowden plaza&quot; and buildings on &quot;snowden drive&quot;.</p>

<p>His &#39;leaks&#39; weren&#39;t pioneering anything; they were confirmation. His net result was the American Freedom Act, which basically gave all the records to private companies. None of the activity stopped, or even remotely slowed down.</p>

<p>What is the hook here? Russia is not (and won&#39;t become) the West&#39;s new boogeyman. Why should people be concerned about this?</p>

<p>Bingo. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON">ECHELON</a> was revealed in the 80s. The time to &quot;riot&quot; was 20+ years ago. There were no real discoveries here. Similar to Manning...who&#39;s leaks were ACTUALLY damaging. Snowden&#39;s leaks are just embarrassing. </p>

<p>Well I think people need to understand that hegemony matters. Reddit has become complacent in many of them living in a world that isn&#39;t at the hands of more powerful nations.

<p>State Sponsored International Terrorism (see: Regime Change)?</p>

<p>It only matters in the sense that American Interests are affected; the American People&#39;s ability to see the cause for the effect is obfuscated by the media and &quot;the government&quot;. Joe Public isn&#39;t personally confronted with the result of Russia&#39;s actions (perhaps his stock portfolio is, but that&#39;s digression) and therefore any action that &quot;the government&quot; makes in a geopolitical sense that effects Russia will be for American Interests, which of course seldom coincides with Joe Public&#39;s interests. </p>

<p>So, to encapsulate into a truism: American Interests =/= Joe Public&#39;s interests. </p>

<p>I think the West does a fine job of doing this on its own.</p>

<p>I think this is an interesting statement. </p>

<p>Why should I be concerned about the motivations of those that leak information? Wouldn&#39;t the <em>actual leaked information</em> be of more concern? I&#39;m weary of anyone who would call these kinds of organizations into question for the simple reason that power corrupts. Organizations will move heaven and earth to make sure that damaging <em>truth</em> never sees the light of day, so its quite natural that their first instinct would be to destabilize these organizations in any way possible, including sowing the seeds of deceit by questioning the motivations of those who would engage in acts to reveal wrongdoings perpetrated by powerful organizations, revealings that put them into personal danger. Its clear that Wikileaks has received this treatment, just look at the widespread issues they&#39;ve had with donations, international legal b&#39;fuckery, and the vilification they get in the media.</p>

<p>Why question the motivations of any <strong>whistleblower</strong>? The act of them &quot;blowing the whistle&quot; is somehow more dangerous than the <em>ongoing criminal activity</em> the individual is trying to reveal?</p>

<p>The fact he didn&#39;t follow through on the Russia threat 5 years ago and his increasing ties to and development of a relationship with Russia signals to me that he&#39;s not totally unbiased </p>

<p>Why not? </p>

<p>Look. I don&#39;t know where you live, but if you want to pretend hegemony doesn&#39;t matter or that borders and geopolitics don&#39;t matter, then I think you&#39;re naive to the realities of the world. These massive forces are still at play trying to jockey for power and influence. Motives matter. </p>

<p>And to be honest, I don&#39;t see this as whistleblowing. The CIA&#39;s job is intelligence. Same as the SVR/FSB. </p>

<p>The point of the discussion there is that Wikileaks has been amazingly pissy about the Panama leaks. They turn(ed) pretty wird with their whole angle of the leaks.</p>

<p>I found your theory very intriguing! I suggest you update this with the reaction of the Panama leaks, and I am curious to see what other people think. Please send me a pm if you resubmit.</p>

<p>You HAVE to look at Wikileaks since 2010. They used to just be totally anti-establishment...now its just NATO/USA.</p>

<p>WIKILEAKS never did the hacking from what I understand, they we&#39;re just the showcase mechanism. </p>

<p>Sure. But a lot of their recent leaks have nothing to do with this. </p>

<p>Most of Snowdens recent links aren&#39;t even about surveillance anymore. But lets keep this focused on Assange/Wikileaks. </p>

<p>The Sony Leaks were a symbol that WIKILEAKS was focused more on being the international TMZ and less than a source of legitimate discussion. </p>

<p>Russia and China had serious documents on shadowy things...so where did all of this information disappear to? Did they forget to leak them? </p>

<p>They were talking a lot of big-bad-wolf talk...and nothing happened. <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/11/30/moscows-bid-to-blow-up-wikileaks-russians-play-by-different-rules.html">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/11/30/moscows-bid-to-blow-up-wikileaks-russians-play-by-different-rules.html</a></p>

<p>Spoken like someone who hasn&#39;t even been paying a bit of attention to what actually happened with Snowden. </p>

<p>He got a large haul of data. He gave this data to several news organizations, and requested that they leak it piecemeal. It&#39;s now up to them to publish what they want at their own pace. There are no recent Snowden leaks. There was one leak, and now the media is reporting it a bit at a time. </p>
