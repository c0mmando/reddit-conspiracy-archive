<p>To help stimulate urban renewal in Lower Manhattan, David Rockefeller suggested that the Port Authority build a World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan.[23]</p>

<p>Plans to build the World Trade Center were controversial. The site for the World Trade Center was the location of Radio Row, home to hundreds of commercial and industrial tenants, property owners, small businesses, and approximately 100 residents, many of whom fiercely resisted forced relocation.[69] A group of small businesses affected filed an injunction challenging the Port Authority&#39;s power of eminent domain.[70] The case made its way through the court system to the United States Supreme Court; the Court refused to accept the case.[71]</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_(1973-2001)">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_(1973-2001)</a></p>

<p>Private real estate developers and members of the Real Estate Board of New York, led by Empire State Building owner Lawrence A. Wien, expressed concerns about this much &quot;subsidized&quot; office space going on the open market, competing with the private sector when there was already a glut of vacancies.[72][73] The World Trade Center itself was not rented out completely until after 1979 and then only due to the fact that the complex&#39;s subsidy by the Port Authority made rents charged for its office space relatively cheaper than that of comparable office space in other buildings.[74] Others questioned whether the Port Authority should have taken on a project described by some as a &quot;mistaken social priority&quot;.[75]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After learning more about &quot;sacred&quot; geometry and its application my guess is that they needed those exact coordinates for some esoteric reason. The powers that were don&#39;t really care who or what is in their way. A couple hundred businesses and homes are nothing in the long run, sadly.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing this interesting information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were some dramatic scenes of the towers gone with the statue of liberty in the foreground.  My guess is they wanted the psychological affect of that as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I was thinking, very strange. Whether these things have true weight or not remains to be seen but the important thing is that the elite seems to believe in it and practice esoteric beliefs along with whatever other practices it might include</p>
