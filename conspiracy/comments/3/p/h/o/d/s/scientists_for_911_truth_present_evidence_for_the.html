<p>Organizing Committee:</p>

<p>Mark Basile, BS Chemical Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic</p>

<p>David S. Chandler, MS Mathematics, California Polytechnic University</p>

<p>Steven E. Jones, PhD Physics, Vanderbilt University</p>

<p>Frank Legge, PhD Chemistry, University of Western Australia</p>

<p>Coordinator:</p>

<p>John D. Wyndham, PhD Physics, Cambridge University</p>

<p>Purpose:</p>

<p>Our specific purpose is to collect, study, analyze, report on, and disseminate scientifically factual information and data on the events that took place on September 11, 2001 (9/11), and issues related to these events; to solicit public support for new, independent and scientific investigations of the events of 9/11; and to present, for scientific, educational, and civic purposes, a unified front of professional scientists who stand behind the emerging science of 9/11.</p>

<p>As scientists, we are committed to upholding the scientific method developed painstakingly over the past centuries, sometimes at great cost to personal reputation, circumstance, and freedom, and even to life itself.</p>

<p>Considering the tremendous impact, on decisions to go to war, of the official account of 9/11, and the many thousands of lives snuffed out by these wars and on 9/11 itself and thereafter, it behooves us, as representatives of the scientific tradition, to uphold that tradition with truth and honor by exposing the absurdity of the official story of 9/11 as seen from a scientific perspective.</p>

<p>It is probable that many of you, for reasons of time, political outlook, and personal inclination, or a desire not to question the government, have not yet closely examined the official story of what happened on September 11, 2001. To you and all those who seek a rational world through reason and truth-telling, we offer these pages.</p>

<p>Membership:</p>

<p>Scientists for 9/11 Truth includes both natural scientists and formal scientists (mathematicians, computer scientists, and systems scientists). For individual member statements, see Signatories.</p>

<p>Wars have ended, bastards got rich, and all the big players involved are well protected at this point. You don&#39;t do something this big without making damn sure any evidence pointing at you is destroyed or doesn&#39;t exists to being with. And without solid evidence there is no case, it&#39;s simply too big. People involved won&#39;t possibly talk, and even if someone did it would not matter without evidence.</p>

<p>Wake up, we live in a plutocracy masquerading as a democracy.</p>

<p>Then the people will hopefully wake up and see the corrupt government for what it truly is.  Every small bit counts for the eventual collapse and/or revolution, and this bit in particular is pretty big.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not supposed to change anything <em>yet</em>, in case you couldn&#39;t tell from my earlier comment.  But in some ways it has made a lot of people more speculative of the US government.  Heck, it&#39;s what turned any conspiracy theorists I know into conspiracy theorists, including myself.  The way to make change is by first changing minds, which it has helped with, even though nothing tangible is different.  For tangible change, we need to wait.</p>

<p>Nah, people care about that.  At least literally every person I&#39;ve spoken to about it has had something to say in response, and if they respond negatively I debunk them and raise it again.  Heck, it&#39;s all over the internet (at least in my circles).</p>

<p>Huh, TIL.  I really thought he did, but okay, and yeah I entirely agree that he really should have.  And yeah, I guess that&#39;s one of your points that are correct that <em>slightly</em> lessens the integrity of my point - something really should have happened.

<p>Bro, I take my metric from what actually happens, regardless of claims about how people feel about it.</p>

<p>People have been getting fucked and grinning about it for centuries. 9/11 was just another in a long list of examples. It isn&#39;t about exposing this or that government, or the illuminati, or the banking cartels, or whatever the fuck. The problem is us as a species. The most ruthless rule because they are the most ruthless. Nobody wants to challenge them, and if you do and you want to win, then the only way to do it is to become more ruthless than they are, thus bringing you right back to square one.</p>

<p>I agree. You&#39;ll have to forgive me, because I have become very cynical as a result of my own experiences. You are quite right of course. The human spirit in the face of disaster is not just a force equal to the one which keeps us in bondage, but it is the reason we are still here at all.</p>

<p>I think the purpose of this group, and any other group of professionals should not be to create their own narrative but rather simply disprove the claims and fraudulent science behind the official conspiracy theory. Which would open the doors for new investigations. </p>

<p>In terms of the official 9/11 commission report, they didn&#39;t even attempt to explain the literally impossible collapse of a 47 story building. A building that would have been the tallest building in half of America&#39;s cities.</p>

<p>A collapse that would have been the most investigated, most studied impossible collapse to ever occur in history - if it had of happened on any other day in history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, it is even more complicated. </p>

<p>In the very beginning, the word was that the jet fuel melted the steel structure. Experts said so and supporters of the official conspiracy theory said so and truthers always had to get this out of the way first in online debates. That went on for years. &quot;Why did the Twins fall?&quot; - &quot;Well, plane, duh. And then the jet fuel melted the steel.&quot; - &quot;But jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams.&quot; - &quot;Of course it can, you moron! Look at all these experts who said so. [quote expert 1, quote expert 2]. Also, why do you think all the steel melted? Look, this fireman says he saw pools of molten steel, this one too, this one says the girders pulled from the rubble were still dripping molten steel.&quot; So truthers patiently kept explaining that fuel-rich kerosene pool fires can&#39;t liquefy iron-carbon alloys until it sunk in, so often that faithers didn&#39;t want to hear it anymore and, anticipating the argument, blurted it out first to show how well-educated they were, and now it&#39;s a dank meme. If <a href="/u/ohboyohboyohboy">/u/ohboyohboyohboy</a> is interested, I&#39;ll be happy to provide a few sources for experts claiming that the steel melted from the Twin Tower fires, experts claiming that &quot;very high temperature&quot; softened the columns (viscoelastic buckling) and ten years later suddenly were of the opinion ANY steel temperature equal to or above 150 °C would suffice. </p>

<p>And if he&#39;s still interested after that, I&#39;ll see if I can&#39;t find a witness or two who said they saw pools of molten metal, steel dripping from molten steel, streams like lava etc in the rubble. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you see footage of building 7 collapsing, you always see it going all at once... Like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=877gr6xtQIc">this clip</a> from my home country. As the demolition expert says, this should be CD.</p>

<p>However if you take the <a href="https://youtu.be/JnLcUxV1dPo?t=1m34s">full footage</a> you see the penthouse collapsing a mere 8 seconds before the rest of the building follows. In the time between you can also see windows cracking.</p>

<p>Question for OP; have you seen the collapsing penthouse before?</p>

<p>Also have you also seen <a href="http://www.debunking911.com/Bankers.jpg">this picture</a> before?</p>

<p>Why do you think it is relevant, to prove that prove that WTC7 was NOT a controlled demolition?</p>

<p>WTC7 had 2.25 seconds of literal freefall, this is equivalent to approximately 8 stories of fall in which the falling section of the building encountered zero resistance. The collapse was complete in 6.5 seconds. Free-fall time in a vacuum, from Building 7&#39;s roof is 5.96 seconds</p>

<p>For any object to fall at gravitational acceleration, there can be nothing below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance. If there is anything below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance, then not all of the potential energy of the object would be converted to motion and so would not be found falling at gravitational acceleration (where did every single structural supporting columns go, instantly, at the exact same time?)</p>

<p>There&#39;s no exception to that rule, those are the conditions that must exist for gravitational acceleration to occur for the entirety of the duration of the time it occurs, this is basic Newtonian physical principles.</p>

<p>You either agree with this very basic concept, or you need to start making a case for a new realm of science that has never been witnessed before.</p>

<p>NIST and the 9/11 Faith Movement always try and bring up these points to obfuscate the obvious -- building 7 achieved free fall acceleration in the collapse for 2.25 seconds. This means all supports and columns were removed, on each floor, simultaneously. Fire cannot achieve this. Only demolition devices (explosives) can dismember a steel-fire-proofed high rise like this. Unfortunately, NIST did not even test for explosives, violating National Fire Protection investigation protocol. This is not okay, especially considering their report cannot be peer reviewed because the model data will not be released. This makes it invalid and a new independent investigation is required. </p>

<p>Here series of twenty-five provable points which clearly demonstrate that the reports produced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on the destruction of the World Trade Center (WTC) were unscientific and fraudulent. Therefore NIST itself – including its lead authors, Shyam Sunder and John Gross — should be investigated.</p>

<p>The research data is not hidden.

Answer: not a single one.</p>

<p>You clearly do not understand the peer review process if you are capable of presenting an author of the original research as their own peer reviewer. A long list of links is no substitute for independent verification of the original data and you really are desperately confused if you think someone like John Gross can offer that in this case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not research data, but some model elements.  AE911 has architects and engineers, right?  Well given that they feel they know enough to shit on the engineering community, they must know enough to re-create the few missing bits.</p>

<p>Why haven&#39;t they done this?</p>

<p>Why has AE911Truth not come up with a model that doesn&#39;t collapse?
Where&#39;s the beef?</p>

<p>They&#39;re all talk, no walk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, no credible researcher withholds &quot;model elements&quot; and then demands that their peers must reverse-engineer any part of their work in order to verify their research and reproduce their results. Why do I have to point this out again? It&#39;s just ridiculous. Withholding elements of a computer model is accurately also described as withholding data. </p>

<p>Not only have you demonstrated that you do not understand the peer review process by attempting to present John Gross as a peer reviewer of his own work, but you have demonstrated that you have no understanding of the scientific method by attempting to obfuscate the importance of falsificationism.</p>

<p>You have provided a huge list of links, not a single one of which purports to provide peer review of the unverified original research. Please indicate just one document in your big list that does so. You can&#39;t, can you? As I said, it&#39;s a laughable state of affairs -- or it would be, if it was a trivial matter.</p>

<p>So now you are reduced to repeating yourself and attempting to switch the argument to an attack on AE911 because the nature of the evidence you have presented is so easily understood to be pseudoscience. Please. AE911 has no responsibility for NIST&#39;s mockery of the scientific method. </p>

<p>That&#39;s all down to figures like Gross.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Regardless...</p>

<p>NIST refuse to release there data for independent validation, the only relevant documents that support their theory that fire brought down a steel framed building (first time in history, still to this day) <a href="http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">are classified for public safety</a>, they will not even release them to a <a href="http://cryptome.org/wtc-nist-wtc7-no.pdf">licensed NYC architect in regards a FOIA request</a></p>

<p>Why are they hiding this data? Likely because it is not based on any known science and engineering principles, if we have to go on what they have released so far, <a href="http://rememberbuilding7.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/NIST-collapse-model-building-7.jpg">a collapse model that bores no resemblance to the observed collapse</a> </p>

<p>Thus their findings cannot be replicated or falsified due to the withholding of data and so if anyone outside of NIST believes what they say, they believe it on pure faith. </p>

<h2><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/294k95/compilation_of_scientific_literature_that/">Compilation of Scientific Literature that Directly Cites to and Support&#39;s NIST&#39;s WTC 7 report&#39;s methodologies and conclusions</a></h2>

<p>First, many are not aware of this, but NIST&#39;s WTC 7 report has itself been independently peer reviewed by and published in the Journal of Structural Engineering, the ASCE&#39;s flagship publication and one of the oldest and most prestigious peer reviewed engineering journals in the world:  <a href="http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?286345">http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?286345</a></p>

<p>Second, NIST&#39;s findings re the collapse initiation of WTC 7 were all corroborated under oath by several preeminent experts (e.g., Guy Nordenson, Joseph P. Colaco, and Jose Torero) who independently created and analyzed their own collapse model at Edinburgh University: <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/a3c33b98-9cbf-4b82-b557-6088e207c8f6/1/doc/11-4403_complete_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/a3c33b98-9cbf-4b82-b557-6088e207c8f6/1/hilite/">http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/a3c33b98-9cbf-4b82-b557-6088e207c8f6/1/doc/11-4403_complete_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/a3c33b98-9cbf-4b82-b557-6088e207c8f6/1/hilite/</a></p>

<p>The testimony of those experts is of special salience because Aegis Insurance, the plaintiff that retained them, was liable for hundreds of millions of dollars could it not present the strongest possible case as to negligence on the part of 7 WTCo., Tishman, and other related parties.  In other words, it had every possible incentive to argue that there were controlled demolition devices used (which, if proven true, would far exceed the standard for negligence).  Yet it&#39;s experts simply confirmed what NIST had concluded re a fire-induced progressive collapse that initiated at column 79.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: Since there is no copyright on these materials, I&#39;m going to just post full text in the comments.</p>

<p>Third, there have been many, many peer reviewed engineering articles published that directly analyze, draw upon, and confirm or otherwise independently corroborate NIST&#39;s methodology and conclusions.  Here are links to those that I could find and review in about 3 hours of searching (remember, these are just the papers that include support for NIST&#39;s WTC 7 model; there are many, many more that only explicitly support NIST&#39;s WTC 1 &amp;amp; 2 collapse hypotheses):</p>

<p>Also notable is that, in my search for peer reviewed articles that cited to the NIST WTC 7 report, I could not find <em>a single</em> paper that was critical of NIST&#39;s methodologies or conclusions.  Not even one.</p>

<p>Fourth, there is not a single major professional engineering organization that has spoken out against the NIST report&#39;s conclusions and many that have explicitly endorsed it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitats explicitly endorsed NIST&#39;s WTC 7 findings: <a href="http://www.ctbuh.org/Publications/TechnicalGuides/CommentsonNISTWTC7/tabid/739/language/en-US/Default.aspx">http://www.ctbuh.org/Publications/TechnicalGuides/CommentsonNISTWTC7/tabid/739/language/en-US/Default.aspx</a></p></li>
<li><p>The AIA not only explicitly endorsed NIST&#39;s WTC 7 findings, <a href="http://911blogger.com/news/2009-08-22/letter-aia-president-richard-gage-aia">http://911blogger.com/news/2009-08-22/letter-aia-president-richard-gage-aia</a>, it explicitly rejected Richard Gage&#39;s contrary claims: <a href="http://www.architectmagazine.com/architecture/architects-shy-from-truther-conspiracy-theory_1.aspx">http://www.architectmagazine.com/architecture/architects-shy-from-truther-conspiracy-theory_1.aspx</a></p></li>
<li><p>The ICC has also accepted NIST&#39;s conclusions as valid and commenced debate on NIST&#39;s recommendations: <a href="http://www.iccsafe.org/cs/CTC/Pages/NIST-WorldTradeCenterRecommendations.aspx">http://www.iccsafe.org/cs/CTC/Pages/NIST-WorldTradeCenterRecommendations.aspx</a></p></li>
<li><p>Stanford&#39;s engineering department has also endorsed NIST&#39;s conclusions, <a href="https://blume.stanford.edu/content/collapse-performance-assessment-steel-framed-buildings-under-fires">https://blume.stanford.edu/content/collapse-performance-assessment-steel-framed-buildings-under-fires</a>, and engineers there continue to research based on NIST&#39;s findings: <a href="https://engineering.stanford.edu/news/stanford-engineers-study-911-lessons-how-help-buildings-withstand-threats">https://engineering.stanford.edu/news/stanford-engineers-study-911-lessons-how-help-buildings-withstand-threats</a></p></li>
<li><p>And many other prominent structural engineers and building code experts are on record explicitly endorsing NIST&#39;s conclusions: <a href="http://enr.construction.com/news/buildings/archives/080903.asp">http://enr.construction.com/news/buildings/archives/080903.asp</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>In short, the support for NIST&#39;s WTC 7 conclusions is incredibly extensive, robust, and nearly universal among actual structural engineers.  In contrast, there are ZERO peer reviewed critiques of NIST&#39;s WTC 7 report, ZERO PhD structural engineers on record supporting an alternative collapse hypothesis, and ZERO high-rise specialized structural engineers with any level of degree on record supporting an alternative hypothesis.  (For example, there are less than 50 members of ae911truth who claim to be structural engineers, none of them claim to be high-rise experts, none of them have PhDs, and less than half of them even have masters degrees: <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/signatures/ae.html.">http://www.ae911truth.org/signatures/ae.html.</a>)  The support for NIST&#39;s WTC 7 report&#39;s methodologies and conclusions is thus overwhelming among those qualified to truly evaluated it.  If that isn&#39;t a scientific consensus, I don&#39;t know what one is.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be ridiculous. Your first link to support this statement is to a document co-authored by John Gross, one of the authors of the NIST report. You clearly don&#39;t understand what peer review actually is.</p>

<p>the goal of this work is far from claiming to deal with the problem in its completeness, leaving aside discussions about the modeling of the resistive load to collapse, for example.

<blockquote>
<p><strong>By introducing a design parameter called collapse stability index that controls design against progressive collapse, it is found that conventional design of a tall building usually leads to an inherently unstable structure in the event of a progressive collapse.</strong> In a subsequent feasibility study in this paper, a heavy-duty metal-based honeycomb energy absorbing structure is proposed. Using a finite element analysis, it is demonstrated that the structure is capable of absorbing potential energy released in a tall building collapse. The added energy absorbing devices will only occupy a small percentage of the total floor space. By properly designing and installing such devices, a progressive collapse, should it happen in a tall building, may be arrested within a few floors, and hence, the building is inherently stable to the progressive collapse.</p>

<p>Truthers hate hearing this, but the 2.25 second free-fall only applies to the outer shell</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You topminds fail to understand basic physics.</p>

<p>The acceleration of gravity is nothing more than the rate at which the an object speed increases in free fall, neglecting air resistance. It causes an object to increase its speed to about 9.78m/s every second (usually abbreviated to 9.78 m/s2). It has small variations at each site on the planet, but in New York is 9.808 m/s2.</p>

<p>Isaac Newton showed that the acceleration of an object is governed by the mass of the object and the resultant force acting on it (Newton&#39;s Second Law: F = m x a). If the acceleration of a falling object is equal to the acceleration of gravity, then the resultant force is only the force of gravity.</p>

<p>In addition, Newton&#39;s Third Law tells us that when objects interact they exert equal and opposite forces between them. So as an object is falling if it exerts a force on objects in its path, the same objects will exert the same force, just in the opposite direction, i.e. upwards, which will decrease the acceleration of fall. If an object is observed in free fall we can safely conclude that nothing in its path exerts a breaking force and by Newton&#39;s Third Law the falling object can’t be colliding with any other object as well.</p>

<p>Usually when the top of a building collapses we expect to see the falling part hit the structure bellow exerting a considerable force. But is not what occurs in WTC 7 and we know this because the top of WTC 7 fell at freefall, not near free fall. It fell by almost 2.5 seconds at a rate of free fall, i.e., 9,808 m/s2. If the top had crushed the part bellow, this parts would have reacted with a strength of the same intensity but opposite that would have decreased the acceleration of falling block. As the fall has not decreased, we conclude that the interaction force was zero in both directions.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Regardless, you theory does not pass scrutiny, however, for four reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There is video footage showing both the north and west faces of the building. Both of these faces, along with the corners connecting to the south and east faces of the building, appear to remain stable and intact until the sudden onset of free fall.</p></li>
<li><p>The West Penthouse, and therefore the interior structure that supported it, did not fail until about a second before the onset of freefall. Therefore the interior of the building got no more than about half a story head start.[10]</p></li>
<li><p>Even though the smaller collapse of the East Penthouse brought about a brief period of window breakage, no further windows were broken until the onset of freefall, so it is not believable that total internal collapse was occurring.</p></li>
<li><p>The roiling clouds of debris that raced down the street, often likened to pyroclastic flow, did not occur until the visible collapse of the building. If the interior of the building had collapsed earlier, we would expect the flow of debris to have started earlier</p></li>

<p>Again, it&#39;s the outer shell that collapses.</p>

<p>Most of the inside of the building has already collapsed.  We know from the videos that the penthouse collapses way before the rest of the outer shell.</p>

<p>The outer shell falls at near free-fall acceleration until it meets the inner rubble 2.25 seconds later.  The reason is that it has almost no structural strength to stand up by itself.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not even talking about the clear public safety argument to allow independent experts to see exactly what allegedly caused the building to collapse: that is, in order to improve construction methods in the future.</p>

<p>No: what we are being asked to believe is that these files represent information so general in nature that it could be used to expose heretofore unknown weaknesses in other buildings, which could then be exploited to make them totally collapse. But at the same time we are being asked to believe that this information is so specific to the WTC7 building that it will not be apparent to any trained engineer what the building&#39;s weaknesses were without it, and therefore it must be classified.</p>

<p>NIST, it seems, really is trying to have its cake classified while eating it. A much more obvious reason for hiding this information -- that NIST wants to conceal drylabbing -- hardly needs to be mentioned.</p>

<p>But attempts shift the burden onto AE911 have absolutely no bearing on NIST&#39;s failure to adhere to the basic tenets of the scientific method by allowing its WTC7 model to be peer reviewed. That much must be obvious to you.</p>

<p>Are you really suggesting that the files NIST is hiding from independent analysis are so easily reverse-engineered by &quot;competent engineers&quot; that it was pointless for Patrick Gallagher to classify them?</p>

<p>Another bold claim that I am highly skeptical you are capable of supporting. If you can show that the complete datasets were made available to genuinely independent experts for the purposes of verification and peer review, please do so immediately. Do not once again link to documents authored by the authors of the original report and pretend they fulfill the criteria of peer review.</p>

<p>Ronald Brookman et al are by any definition independent experts, and their request to peer review NIST&#39;s research is by any analysis reasonable, given their professional qualifications and occupation.</p>

<p>Not only have you demonstrated that you do not understand the peer review process and the critical importance of falsificationism to the scientific method, but you have now demonstrated a failure to grasp the fundamental point that scientific consensus is not the arbiter of truth. Consensus is achieved after research is replicated, reproduced, tested and verified. Repeatedly. And this is what NIST will not allow.</p>

<p>Again, do you even understand the rationale NIST director Patrick Gallagher provided for classifying these files and preventing them from being verified? How many times do I have to point out that NIST&#39;s unscientific actions are not the responsibility of AE911?</p>

<p>Wrong.  They did release their data <em>to peers</em> for review.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s peer reviewed, that&#39;s why lots of scientists and engineers have examined, studied and used their data.  You&#39;re not a peer, sorry bro.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, they also released <em>almost all</em> of the model <em>to the public</em>: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nist-wtc7/source/browse/">here is the link the NIST ANSYS and LS-DYNA modeling files for WTC7</a></p>

<p>Interestingly, truthers haven&#39;t touched that data.  Why?  Isn&#39;t AE911 supposed to be architects and engineers, of which some structural engineers?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t they have the structural engineering software and know how to open the released files, analyze and criticize them, build upon them?</p>

<p>Also the blueprints, photographs etc. are available so they can come up with their own model as well.</p>

<p>They haven&#39;t done that, they are too busy with propaganda.</p>

<p>Firstly, not &quot;unaccounted for&quot;; just inadequately book-kept. Here&#39;s what he said: &quot;According to some estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions. We cannot share information from floor to floor in this building because it&#39;s stored on dozens of technological systems that are inaccessible or incompatible.&quot; That&#39;s the extent of it. Nobody, least of all Rumsfeld, ever suggested the money was missing. </p>

<p>Secondly, this was nothing new at all, and was public knowledge at least <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/29/local/me-6038">the previous year</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Defense Department&#39;s inspector general recently identified $6.9 trillion in accounting entries, but $2.3 trillion was not supported by adequate audit trails or sufficient evidence to determine its validity. Another $2 trillion worth of entries were not examined because of time constraints, and therefore, the inspector general was able to audit only $2.6 trillion of accounting entries in a $6.9-trillion pot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, why bother going to all the effort of demolishing a building - not least one far taller than any building ever taken down with explosives! - widely known and reported to be on the edge of collapse anyway?</p>

<p>None of the conspiracy theories make any sense. </p>
