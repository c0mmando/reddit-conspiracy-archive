        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This post will be long, I am a wall poster, this will be my last post as I am honestly tired of the trickery. </p>

<p>Yesterday a thread was posted about how <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is racist, this enlightened me, I&#39;ve been here trying to point out the fact that there is a history of what the term Jew means and how there are different groups that <strong>ARE NOT RELATED</strong>. I am in heaven, finally someone is pointing out the fact of that these out of context, mostly racist post are happening over and over. Who was this <strong>hero</strong>? This hero was none other than <a href="/u/duckvimes_">/u/duckvimes_</a> To my surprise after searching a few pages, I find that my username is mentioned in this archived thread.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/77x6R">https://archive.is/77x6R</a></p>

<p>Now while my post was a bit off that Abraham Lincoln was a Sephardi Jew (still not sure, google just sends me down a list of conspiracy websites), it doesn&#39;t take from the post one bit. The fact remains as stated by educated researchers from Israel themselves. Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews are not the same. **If you read both my post on there you will see the references cited and everything. When I went to ask why he made a comment that wasn&#39;t directed at anyone in particular, I got a comment that took almost 3000 words of context and summed it into one sentence read here,</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/isrconspiracyracist/comments/3kra9q/uttt_33333_in_light_of_the_zionist_terrorist/cw54sj9?context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/isrconspiracyracist/comments/3kra9q/uttt_33333_in_light_of_the_zionist_terrorist/cw54sj9?context=3</a></p>

<p>The part that got me was this,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which is absurd, because Lincoln was not Jewish and he wasn&#39;t &quot;fighting the white race&quot;, unless you&#39;re trying to defend slavery. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like what? I&#39;m black why the fuck would I try to defend slavery. I get called the N word everytime I log into call of duty bro. Get outta here with that noise.</p>

<p>So his last comment made me feel upset, I had gave this guy the knowledge bomb (like I do here to a lot of you simple folks) that European Jews are different from the Hebrew Jews they claim to be. He didn&#39;t seem at one bit interested in this, he simply said </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I already told you, the part you&#39;re quoting was not referring to anything you said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This I felt was a shrug of the shoulders, this guy who took all this time to set up a sub-reddit where he posts user previous post for racism, has one of the users critique him on the out of context content posted or so I thought, and he simply says, &quot;meh, get the fuck outta here&quot; basically. My hero meter on this guy shot down to like -9000... he had nothing to add, nothing to retort, why?</p>

<p>Posted By The Super Mod <a href="/u/duckvimes_">/u/duckvimes_</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And this is why I have absolutely no problems with the IDF shooting rock throwers. </p>

<p>How is that remotely the same? Not only does Hamas not make any effort to avoid civilian deaths, they actually praise the deliberate attacks on Israeli civilians. Hamas celebrates the deaths of Israeli civilians. I don&#39;t see the IDF saying &quot;WOOHOO WE KILLED THAT KID WHO WAS PLAYING BY AN AMMO DUMP!!!&quot;</p>

<p>So? That&#39;s not the IDF; those are lone extremists. Israel didn&#39;t sponsor, condone, or in any way support those attacks. </p>

<p>Step 6: launch rockets from playgrounds, store weapons in civilian houses. Step 7: cry &quot;genocide&quot; when Israel tries to defend itself. Every. Fucking. Time.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3opy0c/israeli_police_set_up_east_jerusalem_checkpoints/cvzk44b?context=3">https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3opy0c/israeli_police_set_up_east_jerusalem_checkpoints/cvzk44b?context=3</a></p>

<p>Hamas has a history of putting military targets next to civilians. Yes, the burden of proof is on you if you&#39;re going to claim that Israel was lying about there being a legitimate target. And I&#39;d love to know what you think really happened. Israel just bombed a woman and child for shits and giggles?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here I am even more confused, why does he state the term &quot;Jews&quot; so much when there are so many regulations that the real Jews (Hebrews, Darker Jews) have to go through that it makes them considered almost a second race In Israel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It helps if you actually know Amos_Quito and realize that he really does hate Jews, although he&#39;ll vehemently deny it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I know that (EXPLICIT) Amos_Quito is negative impact on life or w/e yall call em now a days because I called him out as well before, why does he try to group Jews so much in most of his comments. This made my head scratch even harder, a mod of Reddit openly stating his opinions on the Israel/Palestinian conflict like he doesn&#39;t have clout or something. That&#39;s like Donald Trump openly stating &quot;It&#39;s okay not to like black people&quot;. </p>

<p><strong>Further more, any real  Jew would know exactly why Palestinians are pissed off to point of terrorism. As history as taught us, Blacks, Jews and Muslims get along JUST FINE AND DANDY. IT WASN&#39;T UNTIL EUROPEANS STARTED GOING OVER THERE AND DECENTRALIZING THE MIDDLE EAST LIKE THEY DID TO AFRICA, SPAIN, AMERICA AND EVERY OTHER PLACE THEY TOUCH DID FIGHTING START HAPPENING.</strong></p>

<p>At this point I&#39;m baffled how I even started talking to this guy, this was worse than <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> this dude has sided with the European occupation of Israel, one of the MAIN roots of ALL problems in the middle east. Not only this but he has CLOUT, he is well known by MILLIONS of reddits users. The British Royal Crown that has went centuries from continent to continent conquering and enslaving or so my history books told me. <strong>Even in Israel it is apparent that REAL HEBREWS are treated like dirt compared to their Ashkenazi counterpart. They are treated just a finger tip better than the Palestinians, much like the blacks here in America compared to whites.</strong></p>

<p>I AM NO IN WAY SHAPE OR FORM A MUSLIM, BUT, I RESEARCH A LOT.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQiqUzVm6LY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQiqUzVm6LY</a></p>

<p>** THIS SEEMS TO BE A REOCCURRING PROBLEM THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE WORLD, IF YOU AREN&#39;T WHITE, YOU AREN&#39;T RIGHT.**</p>

<p>There are even REAL JEWS in America who oppose Israel, if someone has something to say about Jews in general that is racist, but for someone to directly be <strong>for</strong> Israel because of the sole reason it is a European occupied state given to EUROPEANS by the British Royal Crown (Also Europeans) a bit more than racist, almost fucking Stalin like.</p>

<p>as GOOGLE STATES after typing in &quot;when did the Balfour declaration happen&quot;</p>

<p><strong>2 November 1917
The Balfour Declaration (dated 2 November 1917) was a letter from the United Kingdom&#39;s Foreign Secretary Arthur James Balfour to Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild, a leader of the British Jewish community, for transmission to the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland.</strong></p>

<p>Which made me realize something, <a href="/u/duckvimes_">/u/duckvimes_</a> is well aware that Ashkenazi Jews (white EUROPEAN people) control Israel and has taken sides with the white power structure within Israel, much like whites have taken liking to their own white power structures within Britain and America. Instead of remaining unbiased and being a good person with all the clout he has, he uses it secretly to move discussion in his direction. While I dislike most of you who post these racist rhetoric subjects in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> by using the term &quot;JEW&quot; or simply just generalizing any race, I still feel there is hope to change you or change people who might effected by that rhetoric. There are others out there willing to continue this trivial fight but not I.</p>

<p>My opinion based on this mod&#39;s behavior is simply that, an opinion but a well thought out opinion. If he is going to act like everything is racist simply to push white supremacy, then fuck that, I&#39;ll call you myself, you anit nothing but a subliminal <strong>WHITE SUPREMACIST</strong>. I know the difference between real Jews and fake ones, I know who started that shit, I went to look it up and it wasn&#39;t on some conspiracy forum or website. It was directly from researchers WITHIN the borders of Israel itself. The history of Israel isn&#39;t centuries old, don&#39;t play stupid with me, I see you fiddling around with bots and running 20-30 sub-reddits at a time. You aren&#39;t stupid by a long shot. You know that I know you know what you are doing with your efforts. Shame on you for trying to Alex Jones me like that.</p>

<p>Also, I unsubscribed to your whack ass sub-reddit, the real hero&#39;s are the people down in the trenches, we&#39;re the ones leading the discussion in a different direction. You don&#39;t do anything but the same shit that user&#39;s like /Jack1000 and that Thox or w/e his name is do.</p>

<p>This will be my last and final post, I don&#39;t tend to start my own post because I don&#39;t have an agenda, I can simply fit in where I get in, but this was heavy on me so I had to speak on it. Please don&#39;t use my post for any of the follow, Jew,Black,Latino,Muslim,Chinese,Japanese or any other form of minority bashing. If you want to find the real evil in the world, look to your European leaders and ask those people why. </p>

<p>Peace out yall, I&#39;mma stick to <a href="/r/MMORPG">/r/MMORPG</a> and other normal stuff this conspiracy stuff is whack to me now, even the top people of Reddit are involved and at this point I&#39;m done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not Sephardi, Ashkenazi are Europeans. </p>

<p>Sephardi and any other real Jewish type that is darker featured like them, just like blacks are treated like second class citizens among the Europeans they share land with.</p>

<p>Who are Ashkenazic Jews?</p>

<p><strong>Ashkenazic Jews are the Jews of France, Germany, and Eastern Europe and their descendants.</strong> The adjective &quot;Ashkenazic&quot; and corresponding nouns, Ashkenazi (singular) and Ashkenazim (plural) are derived from the Hebrew word &quot;Ashkenaz,&quot; which is used to refer to Germany. Most American Jews today are Ashkenazim, descended from Jews who emigrated from <strong>Germany and Eastern Europe</strong> from the mid 1800s to the early 1900s. The pages in this site are written from the Ashkenazic Jewish perspective. </p>

<p><strong>Sephardic Jews are the Jews of Spain, Portugal, North Africa and the Middle East and their descendants.</strong> The adjective &quot;Sephardic&quot; and corresponding nouns Sephardi (singular) and Sephardim (plural) are derived from the Hebrew word &quot;Sepharad,&quot; which refers to Spain.</p>

<p>Sephardic Jews are often subdivided into Sephardim, from Spain and Portugal, and Mizrachim, from the <strong>Northern Africa</strong> and the Middle East. The word &quot;Mizrachi&quot; comes from the Hebrew word for Eastern. <strong>There is much overlap between the Sephardim and Mizrachim. Until the 1400s, the Iberian Peninsula, **North Africa and the Middle East were all controlled by Muslims, who generally allowed Jews to move freely throughout the region. It was under this relatively benevolent rule that Sephardic Judaism developed.</strong></p>

<p><strong>When the Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492,</strong> </p>

<p>many of them were absorbed into existing Mizrachi communities in Northern Africa and the Middle East.</p>

<p>Most of the early Jewish settlers of North America were Sephardic. The first Jewish congregation in North America, Shearith Israel, founded in what is now New York in 1684, was Sephardic and is still active. Philadelphia&#39;s first Jewish congregation, Congregation Mikveh Israel, founded in 1740, was also a Sephardic one, and is also still active.</p>

<p>In Israel, a little more than half of all Jews are Mizrachim, descended from Jews who have been in the land since ancient times or who were forced out of Arab countries after Israel was founded. Most of the rest are Ashkenazic, descended from Jews who came to the Holy Land (then controlled by the Ottoman Turks) instead of the United States in the late 1800s, or from Holocaust survivors, or from other immigrants who came at various times. About 1% of the Israeli population are the black Ethiopian Jews who fled during the brutal Ethiopian famine in the late 1980s and early 1990s. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/ashkseph.htm">http://www.jewfaq.org/ashkseph.htm</a></p>

<p>So why is it, that the Jews of who inhabited Africa along with my people are also treated like my people? Because we are Semites, unlike the European Jew. That is why. We are considered, waste compared to the Europeans (whites).</p>

<p><strong>What else happened in 1492?</strong></p>

<p>A European sailed the ocean blue, his name was Christopher Columbus, funny how right after real Hebrews were expelled from their own countries and areas, the next European expansion started right after. It would only a few years later, Indians (more dark skinned people) would be slaughtered and only 100 years later that the transatlantic slave trade would begin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems nobody is really interested in addressing the issue this post was made in the first place. So I guess I will just stop responding. I figured I wouldn&#39;t get certain users who usually post racist things on this post. Instead they are off spreading the same racist rhetoric in other threads or starting new ones. </p>

<p>Just to show you the world is about to witness the separation of the European Jews (Whites) from the Hebrew Jews (Moses). In a recent conference we have a European Jew saying that it wasn&#39;t Hitler, who wanted to do those things but Muslims, essentially trying to blame Muslims for the Holocaust.</p>

<p>More divide and conquer tactics but as I&#39;ve said previously, there will be no one who can hide when the light begins to shine..</p>

<p>EDIT: I want to mention that I don&#39;t know if Duckvimes_ is really a European supremacist and it might have been wrong on my part to call him out like this. He doesn&#39;t honestly seem to care, maybe my own biased feelings of Europeans conquering the world left and right is what pushed me to post this, I&#39;m not sure. When I read those comments, they instantly made him the opposition, because of his clout it angered me that he would say such things instead of remaining responsible in his position of power.</p>

<p>Since nobody is really trying approach the real subject at hand, nor is the person accused, I don&#39;t feel it necessary to continue this thread. Have a good one yall.</p>

<p>Exactly, when I was younger in my teen years I got into conspiracy, I thought I knew some shit, I started with watching all the devil crap &quot;blah blah blah&quot; thought all Jews were bad, etc, from listening to people like Alex Jones, Then when I when I turned about 20, I got more into politics, after getting into politics I started to see a reoccuring pattern based on racial ethniticy.</p>

<p>After Obama was elected, I noticed conspriacy took a huge racial turn, I was so proud that America was changing for the better, what made me question what I had learned was the fact that these same people who were talking negative about Jews, were now talking negative about blacks and <strong>THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT</strong>. </p>

<p>This made me want to research Judaism, what it was and what it meant to be Jewish, which led me to a plethora of information that these &quot;conspiracy&quot; theorist seem to leave out on purpose. I&#39;ve learned that many of the Republican party are directly related to the British Royal Crown, which means that, this is no secret it&#39;s well known on why Republicans sported the confederate flag, why the north and south had a war, why slavery existed more in the south than it did up north. ALL OF IT began to make sense. I had bascially been indoctrinated into a movement which involved NAZI rhetoric without even knowing it. </p>

<p>I had been looking at my own semetic brothers and sisters in a negative light, not knowing what it was I was lisenting to, this is why I look at people like ALEX JONES as a negative influence on the world. It&#39;s all racism, and many of the conspiracy theories are as well. I constantly think of how many teens who are easily swayed by the words and so called &quot;Wisdom&quot; of these people. <strong>If even I, a black teen could be swayed, there is no telling what some young white dude would feel from these people.</strong> That is why I make post in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, for those kids who can easily be subjected to such material and have no real &quot;pull-out&quot; method.</p>

<p>The internet is POWER and it can be a VERY DANGEROUS thing, information overload will have you gnawing at yourself. If we are going to research, we need to research with as open a mind as possible, point blank period. Closed research involves wathcing other people videos and simply replicating their thoughts and ideas, open research involves researching their thoughts/ideas and coming to your own. The more you know the better! Make sure to dig all sides of the hole people if you continue this conspiracy stuff, me, I&#39;m done with it. I got a lot of good information I can use towards business management and will be taking that along with me. I already knew the Elite of the white race were racist because I&#39;m black, no suprise there, I guess that is why conspiracy platform in general seems to be so predominatly white, rather than equal numbers from all races.</p>

<p>Also, thanks for the liteature suggestion, I&#39;ll take a look at them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah yes, more rhetoric, <strong>racist</strong> love this one, the famous &quot;HEY THE PARTIES ARE THE SAME AS THEY WERE 100&#39;s of years ago&quot;.</p>

<p>This is why I find <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> useless in it&#39;s nature. Everyone acts as if the new republican party didn&#39;t happen. Yes, Abe Lincoln was a Republican but his views are what today we as Americans would consider to be a <strong>LIBERAL OR DEMOCRAT</strong> Not only this but he DELIBERATELY TRIED TO CHANGE THE WAY AMERICAN MONEY WORKS. Which leads to the next point <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> seems to look over on purpose.</p>

<p>You have JFK and how he was assassinated from the republican party&#39;s leaders AKA BUSH family<strong>(Funny how they keep finding their way into the biggest events in the history of man kind)</strong> JFK was noted as going to be one the greatest presidents the world has ever seen, he too was assassinated while attempting to do the same thing that Abraham Lincoln was trying to do. One of the first noted New Liberals, who wanted equality and trying to expose the white supremacist European groups controlling the world with a parade of white supremacy. <strong>No doubt because of Nazis moving to America under more European guided alphabet letter organizations and project paperclip</strong> Who else was killed during the 60&#39;s? MLK and Malcolm X. People refer to the 1960&#39;s as the &quot;intervention&quot;, When both parties became separate enough to have different ideals unlike the years prior.</p>

<p>Who comes up next? President Jimmy Carter, a fair and just president who was literally scared to death because what the European secret societies did to JFK. Him being the first democrat after JFK that makes logical sense, In this case, the CIA. People call him a great president for the exact opposite reason they call someone like Bush a president. Meaning, he didn&#39;t really do anything but be President. He wasn&#39;t allowed to move because by the time he came into power, the CIA was ruling The United States with a tight chain guided by the royal crown.</p>

<p>Then you have Bill Clinton, once again a real down to earth dude, cool chill calm and collected. He wasn&#39;t scared of his enemies, he knew the great challenge he faced but he was a man of high caliber and still had the heart of youngin. Dude was literally voted out of office because he got a blow job, that&#39;s all they had on him, a blow job. Meanwhile, people across the world sleeping with woman after woman and felt that was okay. We literally tossed one of our best leaders America has had out of office because of sex, something the American population is more than comfortable with. This was easier because these European groups had (some still do like FOX) more power over the media back then. This was used later again when Bush JR got into office, spewing lie after lie in order to get us to war. The internet has archived so many lies from President Bush&#39;s mouth that it&#39;s just disgusting to watch. Since then, the media has been more equalized, opinions opinions, opinions. This leads us to our next democrat...</p>

<p>President Barack Obama, pretty much as been compared to all these people, the anomaly. Even for the President Of The United States Of America, racism exist. When I saw the way they treated Obama, I realized something, nothing I do in this world will ever matter, I will always be considered worthless in their eyes. Various website show the same racist efforts, of what most of the American population think of minorities no matter how high they rise.</p>

<p>This type of behavior never seems to end. I see these post all the time where the answer is right there in front of them, yet they purposely jump to blame minority groups or over look the truth on purpose because it goes completely against their own agenda. Again, if you have a problem with the American goverment, look to your European leaders, don&#39;t look to a single minority, we don&#39;t have the power, your people have had it for 1000&#39;s of years. The fact that minority is starting to progress and the stance of &quot;alternative news&quot; and some mainstream news have on it is a clear indication of the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, sadly white supremacy is the barrier of all wars.</p>

<p>Here is a little known fact, all human life forms on this planet are Jews from the Hebrew times except the European race. All wars stem from it, all poverty stems from it. You see, this barrier created by white supremacy is what has controlled the world for the past few 1000 years. An attempt to rebel against the natural order of things. This is the reason the statues in Egypt have their noses picked off deliberately to remove heritage, this is why so much white-washing happens. </p>

<p>These differences are noted when you realize black comes from white yet white is the one who continues the racist agenda.</p>

<p>The fact remains that black cannot turn white but white can turn black. This means that whites, physically have to extinct minorities through murder rather than the vice versa of simply eliminating all barriers (white supremacy, basically any type of racism) and minorities and whites mingle instead and have mixed babies. Which is a very peaceful alternative compared to the very obvious white supremacist method of bomb bomb bomb. By simply changing the psychology of the global consensus to each other regardless of race, one race can be achieved through peace. Instead of trying to further separate to the point of global war based on race and race alone, we should be trying to blend in with each other as much as possible.</p>

<p>Please remember racism only exist because it is taught, we must be strong for the future generations and teach them that differences are okay, and it&#39;s normal. This is one of the main reason why I think every school should be forced to have a quota to fill every slot with a certain demographic. It teaches kids to be around people of different races, thus helping kill off racial barriers. I thank my parents for sending me to a multi racial school, had I never got to witness a different perspective of life rather than just Detroit, there is no doubt in my mind I would have ended up a statistic.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is my opinion the more diverse and equal the world becomes, the more mixed babies happen. The more mixed babies happen, the less differences the humans 200 years from now will have. Thus creating the real global melting pot. One day, everyone will look a mixed or olive complexion and racial barriers will be non existent, returning to the original Hebrew narrative that existed during the time of the Egyptians. That is my take on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha, Irish, are Europeans who mingled with blacks, in the eyes of Europeans, they are a minority. Hence JFK being assassinated.
Blacks and Irish have a very special bond together.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QHYFXDGf4Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QHYFXDGf4Y</a></p>

<p>EDIT: Just wanted to post some context in case someone was actually interested in learning</p>

<p>Mountains, villages and scenic sites bear names like St. Anthony<code>s, Sweeney</code>s Well, Kinsale and Potato Hill.
Visitors<code>passports are stamped with a shamrock, and St. Patrick</code>s Day is a national holiday.
The island is filled with Sweeneys, Rileys, O`Briens and Kellys, blue-eyed Irish with skins in all shades of black and brown.
This is Montserrat, Emerald Isle of the Caribbean, where shared servitude forged a bond between blacks and whites that has endured for 400 years.</p>

<p>There is great respect for all colors here, said Dan Sweeney, whose African-Irish heritage shows in his brown skin and the red highlights in his black curly hair.
Here it is impossible to be racist when you know that somewhere in your background you have relatives that are white and Irish. There`d be less racial tension worldwide if people could relate to 
each other the way we do on Montserrat.</p>

<p>The role of the Irish on Montserrat is known to few in the United States, and even the people of Montserrat are sometimes fuzzy on the details.</p>

<p>Nearly 300 families of the 1,600 listed in the phone book have Irish surnames. Island historians say they are unsure of how many Irish Africans live on the island.</p>

<p>Cromwell`s <strong>British invaders shipped as many as 130,000 Irish to colonies in the Americas and the West Indies as slaves and indentured servants in the early 1600s, historians say.</strong> At least a thousand of them wound up on Montserrat, a British dependency 27 miles southwest of Antigua, toiling on sugar plantations with African slaves.
In the mid-1600s, a majority of the islanders were Irish, and many of 11,000 who live there now speak with a lilt descended from the Gaelic language.</p>

<p>Marriages among the Irish and African slaves and the mingling of their diverse heritages produced a unique culture where racism could never arise.
Hoping to learn more about Montserrat<code>s Irish connection, members of the South Florida chapter of the Irish American Unity Foundation flew to the island last week. They spent four days documenting the island</code>s history, intending to share their research with Irish Americans.</p>

<p>Too many Americans are ignorant about their Irish history, said the trip`s organizer, Marie Tierney Smith, of Miami, Florida president of the Irish American Unity Foundation.</p>

<p>They sing Danny Boy and drink green beer on St. Patrick`s Day, but they have no idea that the Irish were sold into slavery like the Africans.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t know why it&#39;s posting like that but here is the link to the actual article.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not getting this, are you asking personally or are you asking for a scholarly approach?</p>

<p>One would have to logically assume that because of the way racism is taught a young age, Europeans would look at Irish as a different kind than of their own. As mentioned in that article, in the early 1600&#39;s, Irish and Blacks were both enslaved by the <strong>British Royal Crown</strong>.</p>

<p>So through this movement came the differences of heritage, I.E. Europeans would know if you were Irish by simply looking at things like Last name, who your parents were, what they did for a living, family history and ETC. Much like how the Nazis, did the Jews, to the point people would be scared to mention their family names or who their mother and father&#39;s were because it could be used to trace back their families ancestry.</p>

<p>For darker minorities the same could apply but easier to assume because of the darker features, people would just assume they are not white. If you have a person who hates blacks for example, instead of having to go through such things like relying on family ancestry, skin is used in order to assume racial bias.</p>

<p>I think that is the best way I can put it in my opinion.</p>

<p>Also, did you just quote &quot;racism&quot; and finish that sentence with &quot;a thing&#39;? Not trying to accuse you but that was just silly lol.</p>

<p>Context: White supremacy is a system pushed by Europeans. Through this system power is granted to those who help push it regardless of their own race. There are people of all races who push White Supremacy because it is a system rather than a group of people. It can feed off the actions of everyone. This system has been in place for 1000&#39;s of years. As stated in my previous post, this system is called Zionism or as I like to call it &quot;Fake Zionism&quot;, because Zion was already a thing before the Europeans got to it, hence the correlation of people thinking &quot;fake Zionism&quot; is how connected to the real one. </p>

<p>The real Zionism is mentioned in famous songs by hip-hop bands like the Fugees (Lauryn Hill to be exact), which is short for &quot;Refugees&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I see that you caught my subtext.  I don&#39;t believe that &#39;racism&#39; is a real thing.  I believe that it is made up, and that what you call &#39;racism&#39; is nothing more than a ginned up way of describing the natural territorial instinct present in all mammals and indeed in most living things. </p>

<p>I mean, just look at the etymology of the word &#39;racism&#39;...it doesn&#39;t even exist before the early part of the 20th century, as a word or as a concept.  I believe it was created by some unknown group of social engineers as a mechanism to play different populations against each other in the same territory, as a means of social control.  I mean, we are in conspiracy, right?  Might as well lay it all out there and get crazy.  </p>

<p>Now, knowing that we are having an adult conversation here, and with the very evident fact that people have been really mean to each other, all throughout the history of humanity, can you honestly tell me that &#39;racism&#39; is distinguishable from any other sort of mistreatment that humans heap upon one another?  Realistically, about half the time, the groups that hate each other look identical to one another.  How is it any more or less acceptible if the two groups look different?  When a pack of dogs fight, are the white dogs &#39;racist&#39; for attacking the black dogs?  </p>

<p>Now, just because racism isn&#39;t real, doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t have any real life effects.  The tooth fairy is completely made up, but kids who believe the story even have actions associated with this entirely false concept, such as putting the money under the pillow.  &#39;Racism&#39; is the same way, ever since it was invented, it has taken on a life of its own.</p>

<p>&#39;Racism&#39; is just about the most retarded fucking thing I have ever heard of, and if it was eliminated tomorrow no one would even notice, except things would probably get a lot less complicated. </p>

<p>&#39;Racism&#39;, just like all the other &#39;isms&#39; out there, are nothing but mental prisons that keep us penned up like cattle so we are easier to deal with.  Make things complicated enough, and you get a society just like ours where everyone is too distracted and bedazzled to do anything truly meaningful or make any real changes.  We are all too busy worrying about &#39;racism&#39; and &#39;terrorism&#39; and &#39;rape culture&#39; and all our technology, because we are stupid like cattle and that is how you tame people.</p>

<p>This is logical since this was before the conquering of worlds within earth by European white supremacists. People knew their languages and their culture. Do you comprehend how many languages and cultures are completely destroyed due to European supremacy? Or will you just over look the fact that groups like the Africans we&#39;re told never to speak their language and ones that did were killed. That seems a bit silly to ignore. Done by social engineers? No. It was done because Europeans were slaughtering minorities world wide and someone said, <strong>&quot;we need to call this shit something&quot;.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Realistically, about half the time, the groups that hate each other look identical to one another.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not true, most of the racism stems from the British Empire and there divide and conquer tactics used against the minorities (darker featured people). This is why there is no war for when they first came to Africa, they gave guns to one group and spices to the other, told one group that they would get them land if they killed their brothers. Africans welcomed the European people with open arms, ultimately leading to the enslavement of said blacks. </p>

<p>Then came the British (European) economy which stopped trading on things like spices and they had already conquered lands once owned by Hebrew Jews (places like Spain). There was only one trade left that the Europeans wanted from Africa or any minority group, <strong>labor</strong>. Thus you have the option of sell your people or starve them, conquering at it&#39;s highest point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How is it any more or less acceptable if the two groups look different? When a pack of dogs fight, are the white dogs &#39;racist&#39; for attacking the black dogs?</p>

<p>You cannot compare dogs to humans, humans are separated in that our minds work differently. You can take a dog from it&#39;s home and it will forget it ever lived there instantly until it returns to the home to remember. A dog literally leaves it&#39;s memories at the place they were started. Not only this, but the human mind is much different in the aspect that humans can manifest their ideas a much higher level than dogs. I&#39;ve read no stories of dogs creating the nuclear bomb. Straw man tactics, <strong>you seemed to be trained.</strong></p>

<p>Ah, you want an a reaction. Okay, I&#39;ll give you one, in your world, racism doesn&#39;t exist. But in the world of minorities world wide it does. To say it doesn&#39;t means that you have been living under a rock all your life. To ignore racism, is to be racist because meanwhile you say it doesn&#39;t exist, it effects everyone else. If something can effect you, it is real. <strong>I&#39;m not talking about porch racism, I&#39;m not talking about racist jokes, I&#39;m not talking about saying &quot;hi&quot; to old white people and they give you that look because you&#39;re black. I&#39;m talking about being in positions of power and using actions and funding to push racism like white supremacy.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, as I&#39;ve already explained, racism only benefits whites. They are barriers to keep minorities and the majority of white people away from each other. They are based systematically. It is a real system, not a fake one. Controlled by the media (up until recently) these barriers were much stronger in the past. They are starting to weaken, even the once predominately white European countries are now having to take in minority groups. A grand change is taking place, a place that is very diverse and multi-cultural. These barriers are the reason there are different colored people all around the world. Before White supremacy, everyone looked the same. Naturally without racism, everyone would mingle based on personality rather than race. This would mean that most people in the world would be brown,tan or olive. This is not the case because white are separated from minorities systematically through white supremacy. The power structures of the world are controlled by Whites. Not Blacks, Not Jews, Not Latinos, Not Chinese, Not Arabs, Not Russians. Whites.</p>

<p>All of these logical simple thinking points and somehow you came to the conclusion that <strong>insert air quotes</strong> racism doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Of course, in any conflict, one side is going to prevail, and you seem to be playing the underdog just to be contrary, or to prove a point.  Maybe you are sheltered, I don&#39;t know.  You seem to have a lot of book learning, but little common sense.  Or maybe you are just trying to be intellectually militant.  Your way of thinking is the very reason we have &#39;vendettas&#39; and &#39;honor killings&#39; and all sorts of  atrocities, and I will tell you why:  you seem to think that minorities are these oppressed ciphers that you move and shift around like chess pieces for your little victim roles, but they are real people, just as imperfect and greedy and base as the whites that you impugn as oppressors. </p>

<p>At one time Egypt had a great civilization.  Then another time Greece.  Now just because the whites have created the best civilization in the world, we are guilty of a litany of evils that can never be repaid?  And I mean that, because &#39;racism&#39; is a game that never ends.  It&#39;s just a game.  And I see that you are heavily into it.  </p>

<p>You got it all wrong. If the minorities ran the world, things would be just as bad, if not worse, They would do the same thing that we did to them, genocide goes both ways.</p>

<p>Lies lies and more lies, minorities want to mix and mingle with whites, it&#39;s because of a white racist system put in place 1000&#39;s of years ago that whites simple hold on to hierarchy superiority complex. <strong>You&#39;ve seem to somehow grasped the knowledge of something that has never happened before</strong> because you know, Europeans have controlled the world for 1000&#39;s of years.</p>

<p>Posing me as a militant threat? Nice! <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> seems to be on the only place in the world where it&#39;s okay to bash minorities left and right but if a minority ever speaks on those atrocities or derails the current consensus of it&#39;s established racist rhetoric, they are militant or as you like to put it, &quot;racism doesn&#39;t exist&quot;.</p>

<p>But erm, that wasn&#39;t Greeks who created that, again showing you how much you don&#39;t know. Cyrus The Great King of Persia (now Iran) was the one who brought the world together. Through divide and conquer he was defeated by Alexander The Great, a <strong>European.</strong></p>

<p>You are essentially asking is that it&#39;s okay for you to mention racism against minorities but when minorities point out the racist act&#39;s &quot;racism doesn&#39;t exist&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not all minorities want to &#39;mix and mingle&#39;, matter of fact most of them don&#39;t want that and would kill any foreigner they saw if they had half a chance.  Most of your arguments are just grandiose fantasies of pastoral natives languishing in paradise, until the evil white men, or the british or whoever you keep changing it to whenever I mention other oppressed white races, came and brutally killed everyone.  Your noble savage garbage just doesn&#39;t cut it with me, pal. </p>

<p>Look, I hate the british just as much as the next guy, but like you said, they are having their time in the sun, and it will come to pass that some other group will come to dominate.  The only &#39;mixing and mingling&#39; a lot of minorities want to do is to share in the benefits and glories of modern civilization, and which you should all be kissing our ass for, by the way, instead of talking shit about whites.  White is alright. </p>

<p>I mean, white people already want to talk black, dance black, listen to black music, there is a black president, I mean what the fuck do you people want from us?  Do you want to slap us all in chains and treat us as badly as people 200 years ago were treated?  Would that make it better?  Or would you rather just let us alone to be white and create shit like penicillin and the internal combustion engine and all kinds of other shit?   </p>

<p>AHahahahahaha you found my mcdonalds thread.  It&#39;s hilarious, isn&#39;t it?  I mean, I love a good racist joke.  I am a student of transgressions, I enjoy all sorts of things that you might not approve of.  You gotta admit, it was a good one, wasn&#39;t it?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like racist jokes too they tend to be funny when used in the right context, but this joke was pointless, the topic of discussion was about the end of McDonald&#39;s. Yet, somehow you felt time to throw a racist comment into the mix when it had nothing to do with that race at all but a corporation. While I&#39;m in the least bit offended by these types of comments (built up tolerance because of the internet) there are far worse &quot;jokes&quot; mentioned here. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not calling you a racist, I&#39;m just saying what the whole &quot;racism&quot; doesn&#39;t exist thing is ludicrous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t ludicrous at all, it&#39;s how things really, actually work.  Words and concepts totally designed to be a mental prison and get you to think a certain way.  It&#39;s sort of like blinders on a horse, it keeps people busy in an endless roundabout of blame and hatred while the real bad guys get away with murder.</p>

<p>Matter of fact, I am also saying that it is probable that &#39;whites&#39; didn&#39;t kill the natives and indigenous people in droves and stole their land, it was more likely that disease wiped the natives out.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, once everyone is on the same page look at the same system and able to see the barrier that keeps us from forming into one (1). I fight for equality, the only way for equality to win is for the white supremacy system to be destroyed. Once the barriers are broken, the world will be free to move on in a positive direction.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know man, every history book my school gave me told me it was because of the Europeans. Even Disney told me this. I don&#39;t know what to tell you, we go into a conspiracy on it but that won&#39;t really lead us anywhere. Perhaps you should start your own thread and really get into the nooks and crannies of what happened, message me and I&#39;ll review your thoughts on it.</p>
