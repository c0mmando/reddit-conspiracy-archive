       My senior year of high school, and I decided to write my honors thesis paper on conspiracies! I have been around conspiracies my whole life, as my dad was a truther, and I like to educate myself and not be blind to reality like most of my peers!  All I need from you guys is sources and ideas!!! Of course the big ones like 9/11 and JFK will be a big part, but what about others? ISIS? Israel? Media? Books and Articles would be the best! But speeches and videos are a big help too! Thank you for helping me educate the misled!

       Hey OP since you wrote conspiracies as in plural I'll try to answer the question you asked...
      </p>
      <p>
       The public schooling conspiracy.
The banking conspiracy.
The religious conspiracy (pre and post historical)
The eugenics conspiracy.
The secret societies aka fraternity conspiracy.
You could include citations to prominent modern authorities and show their close ties to the same organizations and educational background to support your position. 
Psychology/psychiatry conspiracies as in their  origins and modern day implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as sources go I'd recommend the Corbet report, Henry Markow, and David icke for broad spectrum views and fairness in available content. You don't have to agree with your sources but try not to cherry pick as it could hinder your efforts. Also just going through this subs most popular posts and applying a few filters on the info will yield a large number of sources you can check out. Happy researching :)
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy to get spread out and seem incoherent due to the sheer depth and interconnectedness of all the conspiracy topics so hopefully your thesis statement is solid and will keep your thoughts in order. Good luck and could you post it when you're done? 
 I'd like to read what you come up with.

       I'd say start with mostly historical facts, and some lesser-known cases to make it interesting. It's better to use similar historical examples to give current theories more plausibility. If people have no idea that conspiracies happen all of the time, they are less likely to believe current theories. I'll give you a good start here:

       I would highly recommend writing your paper on historical facts and leaving out much Theory as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The following are all historical fact checkable events or programs.

      <p>
       The business plot, Smedley Butler.
Gulf of Tonkin.
Operation Northwoods.
MK ULTRA.
      </p>
      <p>
       That should get you started, good luck on the paper

       Hey Montrose,
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say you should pick your topics wisely and should spend much thought on how to introduce the topic. As we all know "conspiracies" from our daily lives. E.g. The boss wants you getting fired and it slips through to your colleagues. Or the little girls group decide to "hate" one of their peers, because of "enter ridiculous reason here". Or parents deciding for their kid on how it's future is supposed to play out ... It's after all the exact same relation you've got with state and inhabitant. At some point, they grow old enough to make their own decisions, but some parents just cling to their "powers".
      </p>
      <p>
       Found this in and old pile of scribbles of mine, maybe it's of some use to you:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Our perception of reality is biased. From a psychological perspective, we can only imagine and act upon which we have been subject to or what our individual minds have interpreted as what we call reality. It is a cognisant inference of objectively reproducible behaviour or activity.
       </li>
       <li>
        This means not just that we can perceive what is real by our five senses, but takes into consideration the process that manifests the thought of even the reality in which you are reading this, as a source of misconstruction and probable variance of one's personal apperception.
       </li>
       <li>
        Apprehended this, it is implied, that we as the human species fall for our personal world view constantly, in order to satisfy our basic needs and “get on with our lives". Occasionally our awareness is widened and our approach to reality is reinstated in a more versatile way. Like imagining a hypercube, that exists in the fourth dimension, as a third-dimensional object, it is virtually impossible to understand our established comprehension of our surroundings as an ultimate result of clarity of thought.
       </li>
       <li>
        We need not just to zoom out and change our perspective, but to expect a change in things we consider preliminary fixed. Even our deepest beliefs.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       As to the topic, I'd decide whether your teachers are gonna appreciate the stuff that is still too "hot" for many to handle today or whether it's better for you to stick with the topics that everyone already agreed upon, but simply aren't reported on by the MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also always good to travel back in time and show the skeptics some of the older propaganda, as it's a lot easier for them to see through the charade. You can always point out that it is ludicrous to believe that there are no secrets and no propaganda in our times.

       Not a good idea to talk about something that big. We're taught from birth that the Nazis are the ultimate evil, it's very hard to get people to question the holocaust, sometimes near impossible, people would just laugh at him.

       So, it's easier to question 9/11? Sincere question, I'm not Murican. No one cares about that here in Mexico, so I wouldn't know if it's that big of a deal.

       Yes, there are a lot of hard facts you can throw at it, and there's quite a few people questioning it nowadays in 'Murica.
      </p>
      <p>
       An entire building fell on its own (7) with nothing hitting it on the same day that the 2 main towers fell, there were no debris by the pentagon, and towers 1 and 2 fell at freefall speed. Any intelligent person, when shown those facts on video, will realize there's something up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, you really have to dig deep to find out the truth about ISIS, because you also have to know about the military industrial complex, and how there's tons of money to be made. You also have to know that this is able to happen because the media is completely controlled. It also makes it harder to understand because you have to realize that in order for this to happen you have to realize that the world is a terrible place, and most people don't want to come to such a realization, they'd rather live in their fantasy land.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 isn't an "easy" thing to get people to think about, it is, however, one of the easiest out of the "conspiracy theories".

       Alrighty, thank you very much for your lengthy answer. It sure seems a lot easier than the Holocaust, but I wouldn't know from my perspective. South of the border that's USA's problem , and the majority of people couldn't really care less about whether it was and inside job or not.

       Got my comments mixed up, thought you replied to another comment about ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       The holocaust is so ingrained in our minds, that it is almost impossible to break anyone away from that mindset. Compared to 9/11... 9/11 is like addition, while the holohoax is like advanced calculus. Even dumb people realize there's something up with 9/11, however in order to realize something was up with the holocaust you have to dig very deep and break free from years of history on WW2 in high school and middle school.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to realize something was up with 9/11, one just has to watch videos and use common sense. In order to realize something was up with the holocaust, one has to realize that there are people in control of the world, they have to realize that most world events are orchestrated, the media is under total control, how easy it is to get people to think a certain way, how faking an event such as the holocaust can create such an environment for a group of people (Jews) where they are free from almost all persecution due to them being able to point back at such an event and scream "ANTI-SEMITE" (even though no other religion gets a world like that?).
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot of reasons why the holocaust still can barely even be talked about on conspiracy forums, it's deep deep in the rabbit hole. The only reason 9/11 is so blown open is because of the internet, if there was internet in the 1940s we would not have believed that the holocaust was happening due to the sheer scale of it. Information was completely controlled back then, except for word of mouth, however word of mouth travels way way slower than information over the internet.

       I'm going to be honest here, it's probably not a good idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to be very smart to spread the word without freaking people out, doing it in a thesis will likely turn people away from conspiracies. I know this because I've been where you are now, and I made the same mistake, although not quite on the scale of a thesis.
      </p>
      <p>
       They may think "Hmm...Maybe" when you talk about 9/11 or JFK, but what if you start talking about ISIS and they're like "This guy is a fucking joke", then they will never even think about 9/11 and JFK, because of one thing you said that they strongly disliked.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone who has personally went to friends in the past with the truth, don't do it. Have a bubble for your personal life where you don't talk about the truth, it's a lot more healthy for you. Keep the truth online. IRL keep the conversation between you and people that openly move the conversation to those topics, and stick to those topics unless they want to deviate, and they hint that they want to deviate.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as most of us would like to take a sword and behead TPTB, it's not that easy, we have to be covert, or else we will end up doing harm to the truth movement more than helping it.

       I would find one particular subject, and really hone in on it. Consider your audience, and choose your topic accordingly. If I was you, I would probably focus on the financiers of Hitler's legacy. From Standard Oil, Coca-Cola, and Ford Motor Company, to persons such as Prescott Bush and George Herbert Walker, you could really nail down tangible facts, and point out the flaws in how textbooks account of history. Did the Nazi's lose WW2?

       Conspiracy theories are very much about playing Clue with incomplete information. They seem to work by setting up a false choice between the mainstream explanation and their own villains,  sowing doubt regarding mainstream explanations, and then distorting facts and finding tenuous connections in order to blame the conspiracist's favorite bad guys.

       When researching any conspiracy theory, do the actual legwork using independent sources to verify any claims. All too often sinister facts and startling coincidences only appear so because of biased presentation. Look up alternative explanations and debunkings (and debunking of debunkings). You'll likely even find other conspiracists arguing against particular claims in favor of their own.

       There are actual conspiracies, and some conspiracy theories attract scholarly investigation which is more worthy of consideration than the poorly researched propaganda that comprises the bulk of conspiracy media.

       This doesn't make sense. guy says he likes to educate himself and has been around conspiracy theories, but has no sources he could use? that doesn't add up. Sounds like someone is looking for links for nefarious purposes.

       Got my comments mixed up, thought you replied to another comment about ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       The holocaust is so ingrained in our minds, that it is almost impossible to break anyone away from that mindset. Compared to 9/11... 9/11 is like addition, while the holohoax is like advanced calculus. Even dumb people realize there's something up with 9/11, however in order to realize something was up with the holocaust you have to dig very deep and break free from years of history on WW2 in high school and middle school.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to realize something was up with 9/11, one just has to watch videos and use common sense. In order to realize something was up with the holocaust, one has to realize that there are people in control of the world, they have to realize that most world events are orchestrated, the media is under total control, how easy it is to get people to think a certain way, how faking an event such as the holocaust can create such an environment for a group of people (Jews) where they are free from almost all persecution due to them being able to point back at such an event and scream "ANTI-SEMITE" (even though no other religion gets a world like that?).
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot of reasons why the holocaust still can barely even be talked about on conspiracy forums, it's deep deep in the rabbit hole. The only reason 9/11 is so blown open is because of the internet, if there was internet in the 1940s we would not have believed that the holocaust was happening due to the sheer scale of it. Information was completely controlled back then, except for word of mouth, however word of mouth travels way way slower than information over the internet.
