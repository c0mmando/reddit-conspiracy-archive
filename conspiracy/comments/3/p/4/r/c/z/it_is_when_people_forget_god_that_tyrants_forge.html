       I'm not sure what your ideas on religion or God are; as for myself, in this context I don't feel my view's are relevant.  Rather, I submitted this quote [in it's entirety] because it is from one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.

       The Founding Fathers' ideals and accomplishments are often venerated, perhaps rightfully so.  Regardless, a faith in God was integral to their movement.  I feel this is an interesting point, and is conspicuously missing when citing aspects of the American Revolution.

       Because our founding fathers feared religion more than they revered God.  Jefferson was an avid blasphemer.  Washington gave up going to church in protest.  Neither appeared to be atheist, though Jefferson was often accused of it by rivals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the faith aspect is heavily portrayed by some (at least in Texas), and may be a more regional exclusion rather than nationwide.

       Going to church and singing hymns has nothing to do with God or religion. Those that think so have never actually tried to understand the belief that they claim to have.

       There are many quotes from multiple founding fathers regarding the dangers of a powerful organized religion.  And Washington did stop going after a lifetime of Anglican/Episcopalian membership.  I didn't say he gave up his faith, but rather his association with the religion.

       I was demonstrating that I did know the difference between attending church and having faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jefferson is the only one of the Founding Fathers one could reasonably assume to be atheist, but it is just as likely that he enjoyed blasphemy just for the sake of angering large institutions (as there was not a political entity of any kind he didn't try to take down a peg).  Either way, I would argue that it was not central to Jefferson's principals.  It is possible that is the case with Madison as well, as the two were very close in views, though I am still learning more about Madison.

       The majority seemed to be Deists, believing in some form of higher power, but having broken with Christianity for various reasons.

       Didn't think what?  Also, my previous comment being downvoted is the kind of shit I was talking about earlier.  It is on topic, allows for the possibility of multiple interpretations, was respectful, and provided relevant information.  If someone wants proof of any of the claims I made there, I will gladly provide it, but don't just downvote something because it conflicts with your existing perceptions.

       This is the fucking conspiracy thread.  It should be embracing new information that counters "common knowledge."

       EDIT: This was downvoted when all it said was "didn't think what?" which was an extremely valid response to the above post.

       Have you ever heard of oil wars?  They've been a big thing for awhile.

       Have you ever heard of opium wars?  That's happening too.

       Again, the original point of this submission is to point out the American Revolution and the Founding Fathers couldn't have occurred without a faith in God, it was primary to their aim.  This fact is often 'omitted' by users today.

       Personally, I feel that we are being sold this idea of religious wars happening so that we hopefully don't find out that the wars are really being fought for resources, drugs, and land. Even though people were taught (or used to be taught) that most wars in history were over material wealth, they choose to believe modern wars are being fought for ideological reasons. It's a bunch of bollocks.

       I definitely feel that this is the case in Yemen.  All of the early attacks were over resource areas or involved huge ransoms.  Additionally, both the President and the main "rebel" group were both Zaidi Shia.  Now that Saudi and Iran are heavily involved, it has become more Sunni vs Shia, but that was not the initial case.

        this news story

       more relevant:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        They tell of an experiment which “claims to be able to make Christians no longer believe in God and make Britons open their arms to migrants.” How’s it done? “Using a technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation” researchers can “safely shut down certain groups of neurones” in the brain.
       </p>
       <p>
        It seems to have worked. Volunteers were coaxed into having their brains zapped by giant magnets. And, lo! “Belief in God was reduced almost by a third, while participants became 28.5 per cent less bothered by immigration numbers.”

       So completely untrue.  We all have a Creator.  We are not here right now, talking to each other over the internet by a complete and incredible mistake.  We all have a purpose and plan.  I do agree with you that religion has been used to enslave populations, but God is absolutely not a fabrication by the elites.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't need elites, or religion to communicate with my Creator.  To say it's a fabrication, is to say that we're all here by a complete and utter mistake, which is just not reality.

       I'm sorry you feel I am, "downvoting every opinion that doesn't glorify faith".  As a result of this, it seems you view this dialogue as scored with bias...  Obviously, your comments have been unfairly scored;

        your ideas are brilliant, they should be upvoted and number one right?

      </p>

       What is much more likely, is my suggestions are sapient, and being upvoted for their merit.

       You have absolutely no way to prove that the OP has been downvoting every comment they disagree with, and you seem to be ignoring that other users are in here, also downvoting some comments because those comments have less than zero as their score, which requires more than one downvote.
