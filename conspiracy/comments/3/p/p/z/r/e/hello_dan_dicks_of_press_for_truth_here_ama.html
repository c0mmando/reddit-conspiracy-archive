    <div class="md"><p>In the wake of 911 my friend Steven Davies had the incredible foresight to begin archiving news footage as he saw it. He amassed hundreds and hundreds of hours of footage that we (mostly him) painstakingly watched and sourced. On top of that my friend Bryan Law (who edited our recut) is a genius when it comes to locating archived footage from various open sources...here&#39;s one we use all the time <a href="https://archive.org/details/prelinger">https://archive.org/details/prelinger</a> Maybe you&#39;ll find some gold nuggets there yourself ;) Hope this helps   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dan, thanks for joining us here today.  I first heard of you during the Boston Marathon Bombings, and your video about your conversation with the Tsarnaev aunt, great work.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on the Marathon Bombings in regards to Russian involvement / foreknowledge of the attacks?  </p>

<p>Also, I have seen some pretty convincing evidence that some people faked their injuries there, do you think the entire thing is a hoax?</p>
</div>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks FreedomIsYouAndMe I&#39;m glad you liked it. In regards to your first question, as I understand it it was revealed by the fbi that Russian intelligence warned the US of at least one of the Tsarnaev boys... however the cia ignored this (because he was already one of their operatives) and therefore the US likely had foreknowledge of the attacks and in fact Russian Intelligence may still know a lot about what actually happened that day that is yet to be reveled (I&#39;m speculating on that)
for more info on that I&#39;d recommend checking out this boilingfrogs post eyeopener report <a href="http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2013/04/23/the-eyeopener-sibel-edmonds-on-the-boston-bombing-the-us-roots-of-chechen-terrorism/">http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2013/04/23/the-eyeopener-sibel-edmonds-on-the-boston-bombing-the-us-roots-of-chechen-terrorism/</a> 
In regards to your second question, no I do not think that the entire thing was a hoax. I have yet to see credible convincing evidence that would suggest so (I&#39;m certainly willing to look at what you&#39;ve found or may have discovered so feel free to pm me some links and I&#39;ll check it out)     </p>

I can&#39;t understand how anyone can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuHY140KigY">French Fries With Gravy</a> and think that this was a real event.

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I think the &quot;Bauman&quot; site was faked, frankly the photographic evidence proves it was. But the 2nd, cafe site with video of Tsarnev leaving the scene then the bomb going off looks real enough. Why one fake one real? This I do not know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could be.  There&#39;s not as much photographic evidence as there is for the Bauman scene, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0-kRTLyIZI">watch this</a> and look at the mannerisms and reactions of the FBI agents on the scene.  They just look guilty IMO. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah not much there really the scene looks much more real with debris and realistic blood splashes etc. More importantly the explosion in the cctv looks way way more realistic than the Bauman flashbang. As for the other points, smiling in a situation like that isnt unusual, hes glad of the help no doubt plus relieved to be alive. I know I&#39;ve lmao after a bad bike accident, just happy to be in one piece. The agents look shifty but you will find agents etc dont like media, or getting filmed, as once they have been it limits the missions they get and could expose past or present missions. Getting your face on the tv evening news or frontpages is a bad career move.</p>

It&#39;s so refreshing to see someone explain the truth in such a straight forward manner instead of dancing around the Israel truth like some drunk chick at Mardi Gras. I&#39;m glad I was introduced to you through this AMA. I&#39;m also glad that my question didn&#39;t get the  Bitchy attitude response like yesterday but, instead was answered intelligently.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes people in BC are generally happy about the coming legalization of cannabis, as they should be because it&#39;s as we all know a ridiculous law. But I know for a fact that the growers in BC are NOT happy at all and are going to get screwed big time over this! (unless we fight back). The farmers out here are the ones who created the globally recognized BC Bud brand! They slaved away at creating the best possible genetics! They care for and create and provide medicine for over 40,000 Canadian Patients. They are the true hero&#39;s of the cannabis world and the Trudeau government is poised to swoop in and scoop up an entire industry turning my friends into criminals over night so that his corporate fatcat insiders get all the licences to produce all of the cannabis in Canada effectively whipping out the &quot;mom and pops&quot; so to speak who built this industry. 
So in a nutshell it&#39;ll better for the average consumer of cannabis but it&#39;s a potential nightmare for the current industry leaders.    </p>

There are two features that are currently on my table which I&#39;m interested in and may or may not do...one on the legalization of cannabis in Canada and one on &quot;whatever happened to Galts Gulch Chilie&quot; Both are interesting.

Is it possible that also some go missing on their own accord? Absolutely as well!

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you NewTruthOrder, your kind words are greatly appreciated :) 
It&#39;s getting only slightly more difficult now because of being recognized but nothing I can&#39;t handle or get around ;) 
It does keep happening though :/ Here you can hear the guy (while I was confronting Bilderberg in Copenhagen) saying &quot;dan we know who you are and we know what you do&quot;! at 7:01 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGOPjx4yOGE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGOPjx4yOGE</a> or when this guy recognizes me and says &quot;you&#39;re a big ass! You were at the hotel Interlapen&quot; at :37 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8ebdziesI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8ebdziesI</a>
When we were lining up interviews with Bilderberg members and other elitists for my film &quot;United We Fall&quot; we purposefully left my name out of all of those emails...however we had an interview lined up with Thomas d&#39;Aquino (then ceo of the CCCE)...my associate who was to conduct the interview drove all the way to Ottawa only to be cancelled on last minute with reason givin: &quot;we did some research and found out that you are working with a guy named Dan Dicks who made a film called The Nation&#39;s Deathbed and so therefore we are no longer interested in doing the interview.&quot;</p>

<p>But other than that it hasn&#39;t been too bad. I&#39;m saving the shaving of my beard for when I&#39;ll really need it ;) lol </p>

One more question: where do you see the alternative media going? What do you think about a big international network of independent journalists on the ground that report back to a central group who reports what they find. Feel like we need to go to the next level. Where do u think its going?</p>

The problems I&#39;ve found with any centralized group of that nature is that arguments always arise as to what or who should and should&#39;t be covered...Yes we need to network and work together but I think it&#39;s healthier to have billions of individual journalists who answer to no one rather than any kind of a collective </p>

In my wrap up video called &quot;The Democracy Deception&quot; I mention how running on an anti democratic platform with the intention of using that platform to spread messages of Liberty (much like Ron Paul did in the US) is good political action anyone who is optimistic about the system can do....Having said that, I&#39;ve always felt that global non compliance is where it&#39;s at! It&#39;s possible to not be a part of the banking system by removing yourself from it for example...that&#39;s something everyone can do on an individual level and I like the idea of taking that idea all the way to global non compliance when people finally just admit that they don&#39;t want to be a part of the system anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the kind comments! I&#39;d say the top 3 political issues (or conspiracies) that Canadians need to be vigilant of in this first year under the Trudeau regime are:
1. &quot;Humanitarian missions&quot; in the middle east! Canadians were weary of Harper marching into war but they will gladly march right on in under Trudeau&#39;s watch if they&#39;re convinced once again that it&#39;s for humanitarian purposes.<br/>
2. The legalization of cannabis. I have been tracking this for years and have always warned with glee that cannabis will be the gateway to liberty! But we can&#39;t allow &quot;marijuana inc.&quot; to destroy this already functioning billion dollar Canadian industry.
3. Coercion to Godlessness through political correctness! I think the PC police under Trudeau&#39;s watch will usher in an erra of Canadian debauchery like we&#39;ve never seen before. we need to be vigilant of all these things moving forward!  </p>

<p>There were conflicting reports about who found his body, what he&#39;d been reading, if where or when an autopsy had been done and what it concluded.  There are also claims that the Pope was holding a piece of paper in his hand when he died that named high-ranking members of the Vatican who were also freemasons, and that this piece of paper was destroyed after his death - this was never investigated by the Vatican.</p>

<p>I think those P2 boys, like Roberto Calvi, could probably shed some light on what happened that night.</p>

<p>Edit: By the way, there&#39;s a book called <em>In God&#39;s Name</em> that outlines evidence of a conspiracy to murder the pope if you haven&#39;t read it - you&#39;d probably find it interesting to read.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a child actor...in fact I&#39;m incredibly surprised that the people on the internet who claim that I&#39;m a crisis actor and that I&#39;m not who I say I am haven&#39;t discovered (because their research is terrible) that that&#39;s what I did for a living for many many years! 
I acted from age 4 to about 12 in movies, commercials, tv shows etc. It was an amazing part of my childhood that I loved and am grateful for! Here&#39;s a small taste of some of the commercials if you want a laugh lol <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKIKcxoYwbM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKIKcxoYwbM</a>  </p>

<p>Around the time that I was &quot;waking up&quot; in the late 90&#39;s/early 2000 I was working at sunrise records when I discovered that Actra members can make anywhere from $22 to $75 an hour sometimes just to do background work!!
I looked it up and Actra had me listed as a &quot;retired&quot; member, but I paid a small fee to reinstate it and just like that I was making a couple hundred bucks a day to sit around on film sets (there is a lot of waiting in extra work). So it was perfect...I could work on PFT stuff all day while sitting around on set, plus I could always turn down any gig I wanted when something was going on (like confronting politicians or something)....I did that right up until just after the G20 in Toronto and I&#39;ve gone full time with pft and I haven&#39;t done anything like that since about 2011. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Much like CJFE (Canadian Journalists for Free Speech), and other smoke screen civil liberties outlets and organizations, PressForTruth also ignores and never touches on the subject of Canada&#39;s draconian prosecution of bloggers critical of Israel, like <a href="http://politicalprisoner.ca/">Mark Marek</a> or <a href="http://www.radicalpress.com/">Arthur Topham</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks jacks1000!
The short answer is one does not make much money on documentaries at all anymore! At least not in the niche I&#39;m in!
I probably could have made a lot more money off of my films over the years if I didn&#39;t release them all right away for free on youtube! But for me the documentaries were never about making money, it was always just about getting the info out there! 
You can potentially make money off of a good film by going the festival route and by trying to get distribution deals but that would require that I don&#39;t release it for free on youtube which for me I feel is just not an option! 
In fact the last film I worked on is called &quot;Of The Land&quot; about GMO&#39;s ...however my partners in that did not want to release it for free on youtube and so for that reason I backed out of the project, wished them the best and instead just focused on continuing to produce free content for my viewers. </p>

Why do you think that most American &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; want to return to a gold standard or free market money... whereas in Canada, many of the &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; just want the Bank of Canada to print more fiat money to fund an even bigger government? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the difference lies in the fact that in America the central bank (Fed) is owned by private corporations whereas here in Canada our central bank was nationalized under Lyon Mackenzie King and therefore the &quot;awake&quot; Canadians are under the illusion that because of this &quot;we&quot; own the bank and therefore we can use the bank to restore the nation...But like you elude to and what I agree with is that printing money from nothing is bad even if it has no interest attached to it!

    <div class="md"><p>When I first became aware of him I thought he was pretty good, I really liked his humor and style however I must admit that I was weary of him in the beginning...but then he contacted me to meet up with me for the G20 and when I met him we really hit it off and got along great and we became friends...his flip flopping of opinions on 911 threw me off just as much as it did everyone else and we slowly lost contact after that...we&#39;ve spoken a few times over the years but I don&#39;t see much from him (because I unsubscribed from his channel) 
I made this video to explain my views on what was going on with him when he turned his back on the truth movement: go to 4:50 of this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6EL6ANSmK4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6EL6ANSmK4</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most danger I&#39;ve encountered while doing what I do was when I received death threats over the phone...I won&#39;t get into the details but the police ended up getting involved and the individual was monitored after that and forced to leave me alone...that was years ago but my guard is cautiously up. For serious projects or conversations we&#39;ll sometimes stay away from texts or emails and only communicate encrypted or in person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No not really...we made that doc the best it could possibly be. It was the G20 and actually I never was detained! I came extremely close a number of times, in fact it&#39;s practically a miracle that I wasn&#39;t! </p>
