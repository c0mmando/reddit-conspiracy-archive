       In the wake of 911 my friend Steven Davies had the incredible foresight to begin archiving news footage as he saw it. He amassed hundreds and hundreds of hours of footage that we (mostly him) painstakingly watched and sourced. On top of that my friend Bryan Law (who edited our recut) is a genius when it comes to locating archived footage from various open sources...here's one we use all the time

       Dan, thanks for joining us here today.  I first heard of you during the Boston Marathon Bombings, and your video about your conversation with the Tsarnaev aunt, great work.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are your thoughts on the Marathon Bombings in regards to Russian involvement / foreknowledge of the attacks?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I have seen some pretty convincing evidence that some people faked their injuries there, do you think the entire thing is a hoax?

       Thanks FreedomIsYouAndMe I'm glad you liked it. In regards to your first question, as I understand it it was revealed by the fbi that Russian intelligence warned the US of at least one of the Tsarnaev boys... however the cia ignored this (because he was already one of their operatives) and therefore the US likely had foreknowledge of the attacks and in fact Russian Intelligence may still know a lot about what actually happened that day that is yet to be reveled (I'm speculating on that)
for more info on that I'd recommend checking out this boilingfrogs post eyeopener report
       <a href="http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2013/04/23/the-eyeopener-sibel-edmonds-on-the-boston-bombing-the-us-roots-of-chechen-terrorism/">

       </a>
       In regards to your second question, no I do not think that the entire thing was a hoax. I have yet to see credible convincing evidence that would suggest so (I'm certainly willing to look at what you've found or may have discovered so feel free to pm me some links and I'll check it out)

       Personally I think the "Bauman" site was faked, frankly the photographic evidence proves it was. But the 2nd, cafe site with video of Tsarnev leaving the scene then the bomb going off looks real enough. Why one fake one real? This I do not know.

       It could be.  There's not as much photographic evidence as there is for the Bauman scene, but

        watch this
       </a>
       and look at the mannerisms and reactions of the FBI agents on the scene.  They just look guilty IMO.

       Yeah not much there really the scene looks much more real with debris and realistic blood splashes etc. More importantly the explosion in the cctv looks way way more realistic than the Bauman flashbang. As for the other points, smiling in a situation like that isnt unusual, hes glad of the help no doubt plus relieved to be alive. I know I've lmao after a bad bike accident, just happy to be in one piece. The agents look shifty but you will find agents etc dont like media, or getting filmed, as once they have been it limits the missions they get and could expose past or present missions. Getting your face on the tv evening news or frontpages is a bad career move.

       Why do you suppose it is after 14 years, that the Truth movement, investigative journalists and researchers of 9/11 seem very reluctant or even refuse to investigate and focus on WHO the real perpetrators of 9/11 are still to this day?  Is this a dangerous place to go?

       I can't speak for others but I think who, why and how are all equally important questions that must be answered. There are researchers out there who do get into "who" they've uncovered as being involved (like with this interview I did not long ago
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPTVA_MBf5g">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPTVA_MBf5g

       Dude. Dan. That was a perfect interview with Anthony James Hall. It's so refreshing to see someone explain the truth in such a straight forward manner instead of dancing around the Israel truth like some drunk chick at Mardi Gras. I'm glad I was introduced to you through this AMA. I'm also glad that my question didn't get the  Bitchy attitude response like yesterday but, instead was answered intelligently. Much respect!

       The most danger I've encountered while doing what I do was when I received death threats over the phone...I won't get into the details but the police ended up getting involved and the individual was monitored after that and forced to leave me alone...that was years ago but my guard is cautiously up. For serious projects or conversations we'll sometimes stay away from texts or emails and only communicate encrypted or in person.

       Yes people in BC are generally happy about the coming legalization of cannabis, as they should be because it's as we all know a ridiculous law. But I know for a fact that the growers in BC are NOT happy at all and are going to get screwed big time over this! (unless we fight back). The farmers out here are the ones who created the globally recognized BC Bud brand! They slaved away at creating the best possible genetics! They care for and create and provide medicine for over 40,000 Canadian Patients. They are the true hero's of the cannabis world and the Trudeau government is poised to swoop in and scoop up an entire industry turning my friends into criminals over night so that his corporate fatcat insiders get all the licences to produce all of the cannabis in Canada effectively whipping out the "mom and pops" so to speak who built this industry. 
So in a nutshell it'll better for the average consumer of cannabis but it's a potential nightmare for the current industry leaders.

       Here's my response to a similar question:
There are two features that are currently on my table which I'm interested in and may or may not do...one on the legalization of cannabis in Canada and one on "whatever happened to Galts Gulch Chilie" Both are interesting. I'm more passionate about the cannabis issue but I know that a lot of people are also very interested to get to the bottom of what happened in Chile as well

       The missing aboriginal women is definitely something that appears to have happened and answers are not being provided! Whether or not two or more people conspired together to do this I'm not sure...Is it possible that abductions took place that involved sex trade rings and other ritual uses? Absolutely! Is it possible that also some go missing on their own accord? Absolutely as well!
It's something that we'll definitely continue to pay attention to! Here's a video where I talk a bit about that

Had a question:being you have and guys like Luke Rudcowski been around for a while now and exposed important information, is it getting harder to get access to these people in positions of power? Are press credentials harder to come by? Do they not recognize you guys now or do they just not take you guys serious?

       Thank you NewTruthOrder, your kind words are greatly appreciated :) 
It's getting only slightly more difficult now because of being recognized but nothing I can't handle or get around ;) 
It does keep happening though :/ Here you can hear the guy (while I was confronting Bilderberg in Copenhagen) saying "dan we know who you are and we know what you do"! at 7:01
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGOPjx4yOGE">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGOPjx4yOGE
       </a>
       or when this guy recognizes me and says "you're a big ass! You were at the hotel Interlapen" at :37

       When we were lining up interviews with Bilderberg members and other elitists for my film "United We Fall" we purposefully left my name out of all of those emails...however we had an interview lined up with Thomas d'Aquino (then ceo of the CCCE)...my associate who was to conduct the interview drove all the way to Ottawa only to be cancelled on last minute with reason givin: "we did some research and found out that you are working with a guy named Dan Dicks who made a film called The Nation's Deathbed and so therefore we are no longer interested in doing the interview."
      </p>
      <p>
       But other than that it hasn't been too bad. I'm saving the shaving of my beard for when I'll really need it ;) lol

       Nice. I hope you keep getting in there because i do believe that this is where alternative media is going if they are for real. We need to get in there and be the press. One more question: where do you see the alternative media going? What do you think about a big international network of independent journalists on the ground that report back to a central group who reports what they find. Feel like we need to go to the next level. Where do u think its going?

       I think there are big exciting things instore for the future of alt media! I just joined a new network called talknetwork.com that I think will be a refreshing change from some of the other big networks out there that we all know of. 
The problems I've found with any centralized group of that nature is that arguments always arise as to what or who should and should't be covered...Yes we need to network and work together but I think it's healthier to have billions of individual journalists who answer to no one rather than any kind of a collective

       It's pretty bad when you only read the Corporate Press so you can criticize their vacuous coverage.  To an extent reddit was allowing readers to be the gatekeepers by up/down voting articles--then the mods began their long list of rules.

       Great job!  Love your stuff with James Corbett.  I see in your series "The ____  Deception" you basically express your lack of hope in all the candidates running for office.  I find that to be a bit pessimistic and wonder what your advice for political action would be under the current circumstances.

       Thanks so much for the kind comments Orangutan it's much appreciated! In my wrap up video called "The Democracy Deception" I mention how running on an anti democratic platform with the intention of using that platform to spread messages of Liberty (much like Ron Paul did in the US) is good political action anyone who is optimistic about the system can do....Having said that, I've always felt that global non compliance is where it's at! It's possible to not be a part of the banking system by removing yourself from it for example...that's something everyone can do on an individual level and I like the idea of taking that idea all the way to global non compliance when people finally just admit that they don't want to be a part of the system anymore.

       Does it frighten you to look at the sheer evil past at some of the people you confront? I would think a violent past would equal a violent future as well. Are you ever intimidated by them?

       No I'm never intimidated by them but yes I can definitely sense the sheer evil energy that emits from some of them...a perfect example is in this video where I confront the head of Goldman Sachs Peter Sutherland...He has with him a young new Bilderberg member whom I suspect was being tested to see if he's worthy of being welcomed into the inner circle so to speak...notice the difference in their demeanor and you'll hopefully see what I'm talking about

       Yeah all the time. I'm usually kind of nervous off the top of just about every interview I've done. 
But every time I'm nervous about something, I know that it's going to result in something great! 
So I still get nervous, but now it's also mixed with the excitement of knowing that I'm nervous because good stuff is on the way!

       Thanks for the kind comments! I'd say the top 3 political issues (or conspiracies) that Canadians need to be vigilant of in this first year under the Trudeau regime are:
1. "Humanitarian missions" in the middle east! Canadians were weary of Harper marching into war but they will gladly march right on in under Trudeau's watch if they're convinced once again that it's for humanitarian purposes.
       <br/>
       2. The legalization of cannabis. I have been tracking this for years and have always warned with glee that cannabis will be the gateway to liberty! But we can't allow "marijuana inc." to destroy this already functioning billion dollar Canadian industry.
3. Coercion to Godlessness through political correctness! I think the PC police under Trudeau's watch will usher in an erra of Canadian debauchery like we've never seen before. we need to be vigilant of all these things moving forward!

       Which political labels would you identify yourself with?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you vote lately? To who?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just curious, normally when you criticize with such passion, it's because you know there are better options. For example, Corbett tends towards anarchism as the solution. What would be your solutions?

       I don't like to identify with any political labels really, but if I had to I'd say I'm more of a voluntarist with anarchocapitalist tendencies :p 
No I did not vote, in fact I have never voted.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as solutions go, I can honestly say that for me even voluntarism is not the be all and end all...One area where James and I differ and something that I can say that I do identify with is that I am a Christian...not so much in the current sense of the word which has been completely bastardized! But in the sense that I have a one on one personal relationship with my creator...but I think our solutions are essentially the same...expose corruption and wickedness in high places to all the people of the world in order to eventually aid in overthrowing the entire system!

       Cool, I hope you will volunteer to overthrow the catholic church too, Jesus woud do it :-) it's too full of paedophiles and fascists to fix it. Joan Paul I death is fascinating, it's said he ordered to investigate the money laundering with the church related banks. World secret services, CIA, gladio false flag bombings, arms, fascists, mafia, billions from narcotics, bankers and church all together

       And how many days had John Paul I served before his sudden death?  33 - classic masonic signature if he was in fact murdered.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were conflicting reports about who found his body, what he'd been reading, if where or when an autopsy had been done and what it concluded.  There are also claims that the Pope was holding a piece of paper in his hand when he died that named high-ranking members of the Vatican who were also freemasons, and that this piece of paper was destroyed after his death - this was never investigated by the Vatican.
      </p>

       I think those P2 boys, like Roberto Calvi, could probably shed some light on what happened that night.

       Edit: By the way, there's a book called
       <em>
        In God's Name
       </em>
       that outlines evidence of a conspiracy to murder the pope if you haven't read it - you'd probably find it interesting to read.

       I was a child actor...in fact I'm incredibly surprised that the people on the internet who claim that I'm a crisis actor and that I'm not who I say I am haven't discovered (because their research is terrible) that that's what I did for a living for many many years! 
I acted from age 4 to about 12 in movies, commercials, tv shows etc. It was an amazing part of my childhood that I loved and am grateful for! Here's a small taste of some of the commercials if you want a laugh lol

       Around the time that I was "waking up" in the late 90's/early 2000 I was working at sunrise records when I discovered that Actra members can make anywhere from $22 to $75 an hour sometimes just to do background work!!
I looked it up and Actra had me listed as a "retired" member, but I paid a small fee to reinstate it and just like that I was making a couple hundred bucks a day to sit around on film sets (there is a lot of waiting in extra work). So it was perfect...I could work on PFT stuff all day while sitting around on set, plus I could always turn down any gig I wanted when something was going on (like confronting politicians or something)....I did that right up until just after the G20 in Toronto and I've gone full time with pft and I haven't done anything like that since about 2011.

       The crises actor claim has also come in the form of dozens if not hundreds of youtube comments claiming that I'm an actor sent by the state...sigh...these people think everything is a hoax and that I'm a shill for not exposing it all.

       If it makes you feel any better I've been accused of being a Nazi, a Zionist, a 1%er, a shill, a government agent from 4 different countries (seperate accusations) and lastly... a NWO secret agent.

       Much like CJFE (Canadian Journalists for Free Speech), and other smoke screen civil liberties outlets and organizations, PressForTruth also ignores and never touches on the subject of Canada's draconian prosecution of bloggers critical of Israel, like
       <a href="http://politicalprisoner.ca/">
        Mark Marek
       </a>
       or
       <a href="http://www.radicalpress.com/">

       . Why is that? Does PressForTruth follow the same philosophy of not defending speech and expression that's not politically correct?

       When I first became aware of him I thought he was pretty good, I really liked his humor and style however I must admit that I was weary of him in the beginning...but then he contacted me to meet up with me for the G20 and when I met him we really hit it off and got along great and we became friends...his flip flopping of opinions on 911 threw me off just as much as it did everyone else and we slowly lost contact after that...we've spoken a few times over the years but I don't see much from him (because I unsubscribed from his channel) 
I made this video to explain my views on what was going on with him when he turned his back on the truth movement: go to 4:50 of this video

       The Bank of Canada was intended to be used by Canadians for Canadians when it was nationalized. However ever since 1974 the Boc began to borrow from foreign interests at interest! Some Canadians aside from us here at pft who have been covering this are William Krehm and Ann Emmett of COMER

       There are two features that are currently on my table which I'm interested in and may or may not do...one on the legalization of cannabis in Canada and one on "whatever happened to Galts Gulch Chilie"
Both are interesting. I'm more passionate about the cannabis issue but I know that a lot of people are also very interested to get to the bottom of what happened in Chile as well

       Thanks jacks1000!
The short answer is one does not make much money on documentaries at all anymore! At least not in the niche I'm in!
I probably could have made a lot more money off of my films over the years if I didn't release them all right away for free on youtube! But for me the documentaries were never about making money, it was always just about getting the info out there! 
You can potentially make money off of a good film by going the festival route and by trying to get distribution deals but that would require that I don't release it for free on youtube which for me I feel is just not an option! 
In fact the last film I worked on is called "Of The Land" about GMO's ...however my partners in that did not want to release it for free on youtube and so for that reason I backed out of the project, wished them the best and instead just focused on continuing to produce free content for my viewers.

       Is it true that there is a requirement that a demolition plan must be submitted when building skyscrapers in NYC? If so, would it be possible to via a FOIA request get hold of the official demolition plan for WTC 1 and 2?

       Hi Dan. Why do you think that most American "conspiracy theorists" want to return to a gold standard or free market money... whereas in Canada, many of the "conspiracy theorists" just want the Bank of Canada to print more fiat money to fund an even bigger government?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think that even the Canadians who are awake to the New World Order do not really tend to advocate for libertarian principles like they do in the United States?

       I think the difference lies in the fact that in America the central bank (Fed) is owned by private corporations whereas here in Canada our central bank was nationalized under Lyon Mackenzie King and therefore the "awake" Canadians are under the illusion that because of this "we" own the bank and therefore we can use the bank to restore the nation...But like you elude to and what I agree with is that printing money from nothing is bad even if it has no interest attached to it! I get into the topic of your question in this interview I did with economist Bill Still filmmaker behind the money masters

       Thank you so much I can't tell you how much I appreciate that! For the 30th I'd like to line up Lauren Southern to talk about how she recently got kicked out by police of the LA slut walk (and also about a current case she's covering involving twitter). I'll also have James Even Pilato joining me for the first time. But nothing is confirmed yet! I'll be speaking with Jeff Berwick again soon and we've got a few other potentials in mind as well. Is there anyone you think I should definitely try to get?

       When I first became aware of him I thought he was pretty good, I really liked his humor and style however I must admit that I was weary of him in the beginning...but then he contacted me to meet up with me for the G20 and when I met him we really hit it off and got along great and we became friends...his flip flopping of opinions on 911 threw me off just as much as it did everyone else and we slowly lost contact after that...we've spoken a few times over the years but I don't see much from him (because I unsubscribed from his channel) 
I made this video to explain my views on what was going on with him when he turned his back on the truth movement: go to 4:50 of this video

       The most danger I've encountered while doing what I do was when I received death threats over the phone...I won't get into the details but the police ended up getting involved and the individual was monitored after that and forced to leave me alone...that was years ago but my guard is cautiously up. For serious projects or conversations we'll sometimes stay away from texts or emails and only communicate encrypted or in person.
