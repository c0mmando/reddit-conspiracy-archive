       I used to think it was about the money, but not anymore. They don't need more money. The mantra about money rules the world and how money is the root of all evil is distraction. It's not about the money, it's about making a point.

       occult practices were often practiced to bring prosperity.. If you buy this sort of thing, maybe this film is showing off how much they've mastered the craft.

       It's pretty amazing to go back and watch films from the 70-80s like Godfather etc. where you can really go hours without seeing a ton of "sublime" images being bombarded to your frontal lobe. It's pretty amazing actually. I'm not saying these films didn't have their own psyop / conditioning agendas, but compared to today's "filmmakers" and the amount of symbols they slop in, they truly saturate their media with these symbols/agendas.

       Videogames have the same problem man. I can't remember the last game I played that somehow didn't feature a single eye (all-seeing eye, eye of horus) somewhere. Sometimes hidden, sometimes blatantly in your face.

       I'm a Freemason, and one of the things I did, and almost all new Freemasons do, is went absolutely overboard looking for all the symbols in mass media, once I joined! I loved looking for square and compasses rings (Aliens) and black and white tiled floors (The Matrix) but after a while, I realized that these were just empty symbols used for no more a Masonic reason than to further the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cameron made one of his background characters in Aliens a Freemason because he thought it gave him some depth as a character, but there's nothing Masonic at all about the film.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Matrix used some Masonic symbolism because it's the only initiatory tradition that most Westerners are familiar with, but its message really was more Hindu/Vedic/Buddhist than Western.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so easy to identify the history of symbols, but is the history why someone uses a symbol or does it just make a cool background? Or does it just act as an empty cultural nod? Sure, with the wave of silly "triangles = Illuminati confirmed" nonsense, you'll see a lot of filmmakers dropping really crazy triangles in their films because it's an easy shoot-out to the culture without violating any copyrights.
      </p>
      <p>
       But sometimes a triangle is just a triangle, and sometimes a story about the fight between good and evil is just a story about the fight between good and evil. Go enjoy Star Wars and stop worrying about what it might "mean".

       I see you're trying to downplay it. I haven't done enough research about the effects of symbols on the human mind or psyche but one thing I do know is that they let you know that it all fits with their agenda and it's also done promotionally. They let you know who is behind it or express they follow that line of deep seated ideas the satanic cabals are following. Whether the person who put that there has absolute knowledge about the subject or not.
Now if you're truly interested on why a simple logo has actual significance I'd suggest you start reading the articles on
       <a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/">
        http://vigilantcitizen.com/

      </p>
      <p>
       He does a great job on exposing the symbolism we see in popular media and their meaning or agenda behind it.
It's not an empty cultural nod when the symbols are
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       over the place in movies, games, music videos, award shows, performances and concerts. At one point you have to stop and think whether this is all innocent nods and winks or background decorations or if there is something sinister behind it. 
Just because you and I are aware of this doesn't mean the masses are. The masses watches and listens to these things without having a clue what they mean. Most of them don't even realize they are there.

       No, I'm trying to be realistic. I know filmmakers and authors and they don't put symbolism in their works because some nefarious overlords told them to. They do it because they are conveying some specific element of the story they want to tell.

       My computer is an HP. HP? That's obviously a reference to occultist, H.P. Blavatsky!
      </p>
      <p>
       My phone is an "android" and in Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, he described a future where we couldn't tell simulated humans from the real thing!
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm in a room with a picture based on the Triangle Shirt Fire. Triangles!
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, there are symbols everywhere you want to find them. the real question is... are they relevant? Or are you just stroking your confirmation bias?
