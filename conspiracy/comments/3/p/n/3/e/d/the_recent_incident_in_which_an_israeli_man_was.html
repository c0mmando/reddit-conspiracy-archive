       The incident ostensibly involved a Jewish Israeli settler (Avram Hasano) whose car was apparently hit by Palestinian rock-throwers in Hebron. The sequence of images show Hasano after he has parked his red van across the highway, got out of his vehicle and is in the process of smashing (or threatening) other vehicles in "revenge" with a large stick. It is unclear why he is doing this. There are no images of the rock throwers who supposedly damaged his car.
      </p>
      <p>
       The images (from multiple media sources) are taken from different locations, so that we can conclude there were at least two photographers. He attacks a truck and then falls underneath it, although none of the shots show him actually under a wheel. Hasano supposedly died from his injuries. The unnamed Palestinian driver drove off and handed himself in to the Palestinian authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: There is no blood/gore in these images, however, in the unlikely event that this incident was not a staged hoax, then images 10/11/12 could show a man who is either injured or dead.

        Image 11 - Possible Injury warning. At this point the wheel appears to have run over him, and reversed, breaking his leg, as his left foot is in an impossible position. This is the only image that appears to show the truck moving.

       I gotta agree with the OP, something is contrived about the images.  And, as a point of reference, In 2 separate instances, I have been run over by a car, and gotten up and walked away (once with the car stopping on top of me.)  Further, I, too, won't deny the validity that a dead body is very likely in some of those pictures, but "stage-city" Israel strikes again.

       Looks pretty real to me.  A truck rolled over him.  The injuries are internal.  You can see the clearances next to the wheel in a before pic.. then him under the truck.. no way that large man could fit under there without his body being crushed.

       Also, blur in a moving object is all based on shutter speed.  Any DSLR, or any camera with adjustable shutter speed or sport mode, could make a moving object look completely still.
