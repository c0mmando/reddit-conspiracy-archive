       This question comes after a great deal of self-introspection. While I don’t agree with many conspiracies featured here and other conspiracy forums (flat earth for example), I do believe there are powers in this world that attempt to shape our lives. For example, we now KNOW from data leaked by Wikileaks and Snowden that a great deal of information is collected, analyzed, and shared by the ruling elite. This is used to manipulate our future as well as our present. However, why does a typical
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       guy/gal care? There are several reasons why I think wasting time on this is folly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, most of you are too poor and unimportant to be even affected by conspiracies. Regardless of who becomes president, your reality will rarely change. If aliens are found, you will not be the ones going to vacations to their planets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, the masses don’t care. If you think they ever will, you are deluding yourself. You, in a personal or social capacity, are too insignificant to bring about any change. Most people are either content with their lives or far too trapped in the system to even wish for change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thirdly, it’s clearly draining. Researching events and finding links between them takes time and effort. The things you find are generally depressing and when you face social criticism to expose your results, they are casually dismissed by most people. In the social ladder, conspiracy “nuts” are ranked just above insane people. It is truly a sad life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see countless reasons why engaging in exposing conspiracies is maddening and very few reasons for why it’s a valid pursuit. So why do you do it? Has a conspiracy affected you in real world? If yes, how? Did that motivate you to enter this community?

       You are making a whole load of assumptions that I don't feel like tackling one by one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, my life may be sad in the eyes of those people that like to believe their government always has the best intention while clearly showing it doesn't. The population of the West has such a thick veil in front of their eyes that they will criticize let's say Iran for capturing a journalist that might have been a spy all the while at the time of the capture the U.S. had 21 journalist in indefinite detention at Guantanamo bay.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just really happy I don't have to swallow the big juicy loads that our governments are putting out on an hourly basis. I don't think that makes me have a sad life.

       A typical american office worker, who they themselves didn't go to war, may have had a parent or relative go to war.

       Having a parent killed in WW2 or even come home with PTSD can really hurt the family.

       Then there's the 'smaller' wars like what's going on at the moment in the middle east. That office worker could have a friend or brother harmed overseas.

       I can't tell you how a war will affect a typical American office worker but I will tell you about a conspiracy that will affect every American. The conspiracy is about the FED, the money owners of America. This group is privately owned. It's shares are 100% owned by private banks. By law we are only allowed to know of half the board members. The other half we are simply not allowed to know. You don't know half the people that practically owns the monetary system in the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
       This group of crooks has made sure the U.S. is a sinking ship that is very close to being unsavable. The gist of it is that after the 2008 crash the FED decided it was a good idea not to only bailout all the poor banks that were supposedly too big to fail but also pay the banks interest on money kept by the banks. This is what made the great depression "great"; as one board member states in the FOMC minutes of August 2009 (might be wrong about the month). So what's happening even though you're told that the economy is getting in shape again is that the gap between deposits and loans is growing. The last numbers showed this gap at around 2.4 trillion. This is money that should be going into circulation by lending of the big banks. But the FED is giving them 6% interest on the money they keep, so they keep it. This is killing entrepreneurship in the U.S. Now more businesses are closing than opening because the banks are not lending.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FED is (like any government) a business; it has to balance it's books. The money they're giving out has to be balanced so they buy up investments. You can guess which assets the FED decided to buy to balance its spending. Yep all those mortgage packages that caused the economic collapse of 2008. They're screwed and so is America. The FED could easily fix the gap by reverting their policies. However this would mean having to sell there assets, but they can't because they're absolutely worthless, it's thin air.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a theory this is happening right now in the States. And there is a lot more to this than what I can write about but here's a very well researched video on the current state of affairs:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt377DV2BKs">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt377DV2BKs
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you hear people about this theft of money out of the hands of American people into the hands of bankers? Barely. Is it conspiracy? Absolutely. Does this affect you? Yes. Your currency will soon be more valuable as wallpaper just as it was in Germany in the 20's and 30's.

       I think this thread emphasizes a very legitimate point.
Why are we hellbent on investing time on things we cannot change instead of on the things we can change? Why are we truth seekers confined to small forums on the corners of the internet instead of actually trying to instigate a mass awakening?

       Because we can change a lot of the conspiracies identified here. And have, too. Behaviors as seemingly unimportant as changing purchasing habits or writing a congress critter can actually, in bulk, induce positive change in our world.

       This is a feeble attempt to control the dissent and at the very least it's the perspective of someone that's dumb enough to believe the powers that be have the interest of, we the people, in mind.

       Every move made by the powers that be enslave us a little bit more. You deserve your enslavement for not having spine enough to recognize it and speak up about it. This is how change begins, it will not be realized in a month, it will take years, if not decades because there's so many intellectually lazy people like you.

       Not sure what income has to do with being affected by government policies.

       Glad my income wasn't more I guess.  Sure would have hated being affected by that whole 9/11 thing, and the resulting police state.  When I go to the airport and they tell me to take my shoes off, I just show them my checkstub, and explain that these policies don't affect me, because I don't make enough. /s

       It's very foolish to believe you know everyone's net worth and career here. For one thing, being aware of the world around you and, specifically, conspiracies involving corporations and governments can really, really supercharge your investment portfolio.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, the poor or middle class are always the most affected by conspiracies, especially medical and military conspiracies. Understanding what's going on helps folks avoid the pitfallls and helps them help friends and family members who may be victims or may be on their way to becoming victims.

       But it's fun to speculate about. Why shouldn't people do what we were born to do - think and question and ponder and philosophize and create? Would you have everyone be a slave? Sure sounds like it - but even slaves think, question, ponder, philosophize - and create.

       This is in no way true. I talk with people in the real world all the time - "normals" actually "out-conspiracy" me on the regular. Because they are experiencing these things and they want to avoid the traps laid for them by those who engage in these conspiracies.

       It's not draining. Doesn't learning and finding connections energize you? If not, why not? It's not depressing to find a connection and then figure out how to avoid falling within its trap. It's not depressing to share knowledge with others. I do get casually dismissed by friends and family sometimes, but then they go about their lives, encounter exactly what I told them, experience it on their own, learn about it on their own, and then eventually come back and say, "I hate to tell you, you were right."

       I don't care anymore. This subreddit is purely for entertainment.
      </p>
      <p>
       So very few are interested in fostering ideas in this place. They want to call names and belittle anyone. Yet they all want to bitch when reddit says nope. As if they have any right to say otherwise when they don't have stake in the leadership of this site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone wants to bitch about shit they can't change but can keep occupied on. Like the whole of 9/11/01 as if anything will change from what we were told. Nothing will change the story. In the official capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet other things we could are not talked about. Like school lunches. How many parents in here have been to eat lunch with their kids? I have three times and its appealing. Everything is processed food now. Ain't one thing made anymore at my kids school.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is something we could alter. Yet people would rather talk about shit in Syria cause that's what is on TV. Everyone here is so distracted.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have kids go to an HSA meeting. That is something else that needs to be changed. Just not important and talked about in here.
