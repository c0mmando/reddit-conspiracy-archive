        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This question comes after a great deal of self-introspection. While I don’t agree with many conspiracies featured here and other conspiracy forums (flat earth for example), I do believe there are powers in this world that attempt to shape our lives. For example, we now KNOW from data leaked by Wikileaks and Snowden that a great deal of information is collected, analyzed, and shared by the ruling elite. This is used to manipulate our future as well as our present. However, why does a typical <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> guy/gal care? There are several reasons why I think wasting time on this is folly. </p>

<p>Firstly, most of you are too poor and unimportant to be even affected by conspiracies. Regardless of who becomes president, your reality will rarely change. If aliens are found, you will not be the ones going to vacations to their planets. </p>

<p>Secondly, the masses don’t care. If you think they ever will, you are deluding yourself. You, in a personal or social capacity, are too insignificant to bring about any change. Most people are either content with their lives or far too trapped in the system to even wish for change. </p>

<p>Thirdly, it’s clearly draining. Researching events and finding links between them takes time and effort. The things you find are generally depressing and when you face social criticism to expose your results, they are casually dismissed by most people. In the social ladder, conspiracy “nuts” are ranked just above insane people. It is truly a sad life.</p>

<p>I see countless reasons why engaging in exposing conspiracies is maddening and very few reasons for why it’s a valid pursuit. So why do you do it? Has a conspiracy affected you in real world? If yes, how? Did that motivate you to enter this community? </p>

<p>Anyway, my life may be sad in the eyes of those people that like to believe their government always has the best intention while clearly showing it doesn&#39;t. The population of the West has such a thick veil in front of their eyes that they will criticize let&#39;s say Iran for capturing a journalist that might have been a spy all the while at the time of the capture the U.S. had 21 journalist in indefinite detention at Guantanamo bay. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just really happy I don&#39;t have to swallow the big juicy loads that our governments are putting out on an hourly basis. I don&#39;t think that makes me have a sad life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t tell you how a war will affect a typical American office worker but I will tell you about a conspiracy that will affect every American. The conspiracy is about the FED, the money owners of America. This group is privately owned. It&#39;s shares are 100% owned by private banks. By law we are only allowed to know of half the board members. The other half we are simply not allowed to know. You don&#39;t know half the people that practically owns the monetary system in the U.S.</p>

<p>This group of crooks has made sure the U.S. is a sinking ship that is very close to being unsavable. The gist of it is that after the 2008 crash the FED decided it was a good idea not to only bailout all the poor banks that were supposedly too big to fail but also pay the banks interest on money kept by the banks. This is what made the great depression &quot;great&quot;; as one board member states in the FOMC minutes of August 2009 (might be wrong about the month). So what&#39;s happening even though you&#39;re told that the economy is getting in shape again is that the gap between deposits and loans is growing. The last numbers showed this gap at around 2.4 trillion. This is money that should be going into circulation by lending of the big banks. But the FED is giving them 6% interest on the money they keep, so they keep it. This is killing entrepreneurship in the U.S. Now more businesses are closing than opening because the banks are not lending.</p>

<p>The FED is (like any government) a business; it has to balance it&#39;s books. The money they&#39;re giving out has to be balanced so they buy up investments. You can guess which assets the FED decided to buy to balance its spending. Yep all those mortgage packages that caused the economic collapse of 2008. They&#39;re screwed and so is America. The FED could easily fix the gap by reverting their policies. However this would mean having to sell there assets, but they can&#39;t because they&#39;re absolutely worthless, it&#39;s thin air. </p>

<p>This is not a theory this is happening right now in the States. And there is a lot more to this than what I can write about but here&#39;s a very well researched video on the current state of affairs: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt377DV2BKs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt377DV2BKs</a></p>

<p>Do you hear people about this theft of money out of the hands of American people into the hands of bankers? Barely. Is it conspiracy? Absolutely. Does this affect you? Yes. Your currency will soon be more valuable as wallpaper just as it was in Germany in the 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How much savings do you have?
A typical american&#39;s saving rate till the <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/02/02/heres-how-much-the-typical-american-saved-last-yea.aspx">age of 44 is less than a few percent</a>. Most people don&#39;t have cash lying around. What happens when money becomes worthless?</p>

<ul>
<li>You still go to job, do work and get money.</li>
<li>You still have assets (your house, your jewellery, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>How are you worse off? In fact, with the sky high student loans and other loans, I will say worthless money is actually better for you.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very foolish to believe you know everyone&#39;s net worth and career here. For one thing, being aware of the world around you and, specifically, conspiracies involving corporations and governments can really, really supercharge your investment portfolio.</p>

<p>That said, the poor or middle class are always the most affected by conspiracies, especially medical and military conspiracies.

<p>This is in no way true. I talk with people in the real world all the time - &quot;normals&quot; actually &quot;out-conspiracy&quot; me on the regular. Because they are experiencing these things and they want to avoid the traps laid for them by those who engage in these conspiracies.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not draining. Doesn&#39;t learning and finding connections energize you? If not, why not? It&#39;s not depressing to find a connection and then figure out how to avoid falling within its trap. It&#39;s not depressing to share knowledge with others. I do get casually dismissed by friends and family sometimes, but then they go about their lives, encounter exactly what I told them, experience it on their own, learn about it on their own, and then eventually come back and say, &quot;I hate to tell you, you were right.&quot;</p>

<p>Not in my experience. The media may try to tell you that&#39;s the way it is, but I assure you, it is not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is truly a sad life.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not. I&#39;m pretty blessed, and very grateful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t care anymore. This subreddit is purely for entertainment. </p>

<p>So very few are interested in fostering ideas in this place. They want to call names and belittle anyone. Yet they all want to bitch when reddit says nope. As if they have any right to say otherwise when they don&#39;t have stake in the leadership of this site. </p>

<p>Everyone wants to bitch about shit they can&#39;t change but can keep occupied on. Like the whole of 9/11/01 as if anything will change from what we were told. Nothing will change the story. In the official capacity.</p>

<p>Yet other things we could are not talked about. Like school lunches. How many parents in here have been to eat lunch with their kids? I have three times and its appealing. Everything is processed food now. Ain&#39;t one thing made anymore at my kids school.</p>

<p>That is something we could alter. Yet people would rather talk about shit in Syria cause that&#39;s what is on TV. Everyone here is so distracted. </p>

<p>If you have kids go to an HSA meeting. That is something else that needs to be changed. Just not important and talked about in here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t.</p>

<p>This is strictly entertainment.</p>

<p>After 9/11, I realized how dumb Americans were so now this is my entertainment when my wife is watching TV.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>LOL - it&#39;s hilarious that this comment is marked as &quot;controversial&quot; - people care enough about this throw-away comment to vote it up, or down.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s &quot;controversial&quot; because I mentioned my wife - it looks like some people got really angry realizing that not everyone who posts here is a 30 year old virgin in their moms basement, so they are lashing out like little kids.</p>

<p>that&#39;s really sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Judging from your posting history, your wife was watching tv for at least 7 straight hours prior to this post.  </p>

<p>Edit: strike that, I went further.  Your posts continue for 15 seemingly uninterrupted hours.  Your wife- is she a... heavy woman, would you say?</p>
