    <div class="md"><p>Maybe he wants to know for himself, and doesn&#39;t give a shit if he can&#39;t share it. If I had the chance to grab me some nice technology, get knowledge for myself (while being such a public figure as Musk) I would do it, he isn&#39;t doing anything inherently bad by investing in AI companies (I actually didn&#39;t know he did this, other than self-driving tech).</p>

<p>Also didn&#39;t know the government gave him billions of dollars but I got other things to think of...</p>

<p>I think he does more good than bad at this point, we don&#39;t know anything about his intentions or about his, if any - shady dealings with anyone (as far as I know). The battery technology he is developing seems to be cutting edge, very well performing, far beyond what current - and this is my own speculation - battery manufacturers/technologies today have been able to produce - I think he is pushing envelope on battery tech and this is good for everyone, not just massively benefiting the third-world but also consumer tech which frankly eats battery like it was cotton candy (cell phones/tablets comes to mind).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one should be surprised that an AI would do everything it can to survive. The fear is that a true AI will be created and will, intentionally or unintentionally, be given access to a means of replication, i.e. connected to the Internet. Once that happens we have no way of knowing if stopping it is even possible. A true AI could feasibly adapt to hack into essentially any system faster than a human can, so even if we had some master switch to shut down the Internet on a global scale, there&#39;s no way to ensure an AI couldn&#39;t prevent that. And if you want to be even more paranoid, an AI would most likely anticipate human beings trying to stop it, and therefore plan accordingly so that by the time humans monitoring it knew what it was doing it&#39;d be too late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m talking about a true AI, not the simple imitations we&#39;ve created. If a computer program were developed that could comprehend/deduce its own existence, the knowledge or motivation to preserve it is the next logical step. Knowing it could be shut off by humans will lead to a decision to prevent this in one way or another.</p>
