    <div class="md"><p>People seem to miss that this is a video that explains Gnostics, gnostic globalists which some call the illuminati.</p>

<p>Jesus in the end is the both the disempowered, selfish everyman who has to suffer the treachery of the current era with equanimity (taking a boat ride through all this); he also represents the Aeon, the child of Horus and ISIS, the bringer of a new era (of the child/ the age of aquarius) under the false light of Lucifer, into which he rides.  He may also be representative of true Jesus, waiting for the right time for rapture; or he represents a fake savior-messiah, because he does nothing to help the world as the he takes a boat ride into the false divinity.</p>

<p>He may also represent faith itself, the necessity to hold onto a Jesus-nature (like buddha nature) within ourselves through this trying time in modern history, which I would say are certainly <em>tribulations</em>.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a big fan of this piece and spent many hours contemplating it from different directions.  I think the spurring of that contemplation is a sign of high art.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt it.  He&#39;s Skull &amp; Bones just like daddy, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s the gullible moron that he convinced the country he was while president.</p>

<p>Also I saw Bush Sr.&#39;s summer home once, it&#39;s out on an island maybe 50-100 yards from the land.  It had a bridge leading to it with armed guards sitting at the gate, and more armed guards/snipers sitting in a guard tower just inside the gate.  It had a tennis court, basketball court, track &amp; field, enormous swimming pool, guest house that would&#39;ve cost probably close to a $1 million on its own, and a driveway that could easily fit 20, 30, 40 cars.</p>

<p>TL;DR: the CIA pays well.</p>

<p>Bush sighs. &quot;Laura&quot;</p>

<p>She has a concerned smile. &quot;Yes George.&quot;</p>

<p>He rubs his eyes hard. &quot;I think I&#39;m gonna stay up. Do some painting.&quot;</p>

<p>She takes his hand, runs her fingers over his. &quot;It&#39;s in the past George. God forgives all who repent. His forgiveness-&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know Laura. Maybe I&#39;ll just do some reading. <em>bush laugh</em> Ulysses just got himself out of the Cyclops cave.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish I could even believe <em>that</em>.  I don&#39;t think career psychopaths have the capacity to feel empathy or remorse to any real extent, and even if they could they have years to build up psychological walls.  If there&#39;s one thing humans are good at it&#39;s coming up with justifications and rationalizations for their actions.</p>

<p>&quot;I did it for the greater good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was secretive because people just wouldn&#39;t understand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If it wasn&#39;t me it&#39;d have been someone else.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The world <em>needs</em> people like me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I couldn&#39;t have changed anything even if I&#39;d tried.&quot;</p>

<p>This is how I imagine the mindset of someone like George Bush, and even that&#39;s giving him the benefit of the doubt.  What I actually think is that he views people like you and I as worthless cattle, pawns to be used by people like him as they see fit that are too dumb to take care of ourselves or realize what&#39;s happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jeb! was a member signatory  of <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Project_for_the_New_American_Century">PNAC</a>, a neocon group that wanted USA to dominate the world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>PNAC is noteworthy for its focus on Iraq, a preoccupation that began before Bush became president and predates the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.<strong>In 1998, the group wrote a letter to President Bill Clinton, Mississippi Senator Trent Lott (then Senate Majority Leader) and Newt Gingrich (then Speaker of the House of Representatives), demanding a harder line against Iraq.</strong> By then, the group had grown in numbers, adding individuals such as former Reagan-era U.N. Ambassador Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, and long-time Washington cold warrior/pro-LikudRichard N. Perle.</p>

<p>According to William Rivers Pitt, &quot;Two events brought PNAC into the mainstream of American government: the disputed election of George W. Bush and the attacks of September 11th. When Bush assumed the Presidency, the men who created and nurtured the imperial dreams of PNAC became the men who run the Pentagon, the Defense Department and the White House. <strong>When the Towers came down, these men saw, at long last, their chance to turn their White Papers into substantive policy.</strong></p>

<p>just wondering why Trump can say it &amp; there&#39;s no huge backlash,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s because Trump isn&#39;t working for the Gov&#39;t and is already rich.</p>

<p>The people scared of saying it are people who are in Govt like Senators and House Reps who don&#39;t want to lose their job or their opportunity to be hired by a large corporation after they leave office.</p>

<p>This is what&#39;s so great about Trump.  He doesn&#39;t owe anyone anything and although I might not agree with what everything he says, I want him as our next POTUS!</p>

<p>You want to undermine Bernie Sanders and benefit the republicans, but no one would believe any of your bullshit right-wing arguments against Sanders. So instead you pretend to agree with Daily Kos and try to create a divide between leftists by saying that Sanders has &quot;sold out&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except you didn&#39;t defend it at all, much less with ease.</p>

<p>You project onto others what you think they believe, the fact that someone chose a source typically leftist to make a point to a leftist is intellectual empathy, not &quot;trickery&quot;.  If I were to argue against vaccines or the moon landing my primary sources would be the CDC and NASA because using naturalnews or spiritualdigest as a source would not be conducive to changing another&#39;s position; they would outright reject the source as biased and refuse to think further of the subject.  This is what I was trying to convey with my earlier KKK example.</p>

<p>You, however, received a source traditionally supporting your ideals miraculously disagreeing with them and rather than form your own defense for your position you accuse your correspondent of &quot;trickery&quot; in order to deflect discussion.</p>

<p>Claiming that the person themselves doesn&#39;t agree with their position is by no means a refutation of their supposed stance, this tactic is commonly called playing the devil&#39;s advocate and is the hallmark of high-tier debate.</p>

<p>Your &quot;defense&quot; was an ignoring of content because &quot;reasons&quot;. You in no way defended your position, you merely accused your correspondent of being disingenuous.  An accusation which was ill founded as he previously and immediately following your accusation copped to his position.  He was doing <em>you</em> a service by finding more palatable sources for you.</p>

<p>Had you a leg to stand on, you would have attacked the argument rather than the arguer; this is a great example of a well-used ad-hominem attack.  You ignored the argument and relied on challenging his character instead.</p>

<p>Ideas are more important than men, doubly so on the internet.  If you can&#39;t defend your ideas, they may just be worthless..</p>

<p>This is just further deflection and projection.  I&#39;m &quot;mad&quot; so you feel you don&#39;t have to address my arguments.  You just attack my character.</p>

The difference between the two is what they might accomplish in office, while unfettered with special interest groups and donations.

<p>Probably because <strong>Trump isn&#39;t claiming a conspiracy.</strong> Not at all.</p>

<p>all those guys are just following a script, if you notice Trump is doing the opposite of what any poll leader does, which is not to say controversial things</p>

<p>and the backlash will be whenever they want it to be, either because some pop singer show her boobs or any other dumb shit, they decide what is news and what isn&#39;t, we are as an audience have no saying</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is nothing more than a power move to get unsure voters on his side and I see it has been pretty successful. Many people who were unsure who to vote because they thought George Bush the republican was to blame for 9/11 will now be voting because he said George Bush was to blame. This type of politics is played all over the world and has been played for a very long time. The next person in charge of a party criticising the older one saying he&#39;ll do better. Because Donald trump is rich and isn&#39;t owed by anyone he can say what he likes. &quot;When looking at what a politician says look at who it serves&quot; this will only serve unsure voters and people in favour of the patriot act. This will allow him to introduce further surveillancing power. </p>
