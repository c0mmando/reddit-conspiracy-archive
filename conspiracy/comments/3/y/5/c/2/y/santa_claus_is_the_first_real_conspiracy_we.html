       I PM'd rockran and called him/her out on his/her user account only replying to /conspiracy and I accused him/her of being a shill and this was rockran's response:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I don't really use this account for much beyond
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        stuff, generally space-related since that's a personal interest. Other sciency stuff too, sometimes, like GMO stuff or 9/11 thermite, and I'm sure I've talked about vaccines at some point?
       </p>
       <p>
        As for getting paid, my NWO Illuminati masters are pretty stingy on my monthly shekels, so I get extra from the NSA's secret MKUltra-controlled Bilderbergers. It adds up! :P
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This guy/gal has multiple accounts for different agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although he/she tries to bring in MKUltra and all that other bullshit into this to try and make light of the subject, I'm thinking rockran is a shill of some sort.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel he's something like
       <a href="https://archive.is/PoUMo">
        CaptainObviousMC
       </a>
       which I PM'd rockran that's what I felt about him/her and that's how I got that response.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  My bad, it was that other shill Roarian, not Rockran but I think they're the same person anyways.

       Look, if you can't see why it might be pertinent to separate fiery discussions with Muslims from the rest, you haven't been paying attention. Odds are it's fine - but a little extra anonymity doesn't hurt. I figured
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       of all subreddits would understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a Christian, so I hardly see the need to play one on tv. But I guess if some Christian wants to debate me, this account is fine for that kind of thing. Unless they're Army of God or JW, in which case I will run the hell away.

       For the longest time I gave everybody on this sub the benefit of a doubt - but the shilling after a while becomes obvious. The same usernames fighting the same agendas typically using abuse, etc. The really good ones are a little harder to spot, because they usually use the 80/20 rule - 80% truth and 20% disinfo. But their achilles heel is that they keep using the same combination of truth and lies and thus can be spotted after a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have just to keep in mind what Lenin said - the best way to control the opposition is to be the opposition (not that I'm a Lenin fan btw). In fact the shilling can be useful to us Goyim, because after a period of observation you can tell what their agenda and pressure points are which can reveal what the TPTB are thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm waiting to see what happens to that recent Stanley Kubrick confession video that came out a few weeks ago. Yes, there is some circumstantial stuff on that video that can't be explained and I myself was ready to dismiss it, but instead of using this their the advantage, the usual moonhoax conspiros heavily suppressed it (Jay Weidner, etc.) - which got my attention. Indeed, while the family has 'rubbished' it - they haven't taken any legal action for impersonation (which is easy to do when you have a video of the impersonation). Funny thing was one aggressive shill challenged me to prove that impersonation was actually illegal. I'm glad he did - because I dug up the law (NY state) and showed that impersonation (without permission) for a benefit is illegal - and clearly the filmmaker has benefited because he got funding for the interview.

       Because impersonation (for benefit) is illegal - wouldn't you think his estate would sue? I know I would. I guess so you can say it doesn't matter at this moment because it's not viral or anything. But years and years of rumors caused by that video will take a toll on that estate of his - at least reputation wise. I figured an easy legal injunction or cease/desist would shut this down immediately. Yet they have not done anything yet.

       Yes, but what would make a NY state law applicable? Is the entity that created the video even in New York? I can't have you charged for breaking a Chinese law. Can you establish a tangible benefit? Is that benefit at a cost to an estate's worth? Would that even matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not portraying a dead person is legally crossing a line is always a matter of dispute. Many estates have tried to sue and failed (think every single biopic portrayal that didn't involve the decedent's estate). Generally they fail or take a small settlement to get them out of a film producer's hair.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to your interpretation every biopic that ever portrayed a person in a negative light is illegal.

       You're going to have a huge uphill battle establishing that portraying a dead public figure is illegal and that it isn't covered under fair use, parody, first amendment.

       I would agree if he is being portrayed. There are no credits or anything else to indicate that this is a portrayal. This is wholly being sold as it actually being him. Can't imagine his estate would be cool with that.

       Controlled opposition to any ideas or rumors that might be getting popular that may not paint an entity in a good light, these entities could be govts (both local and foreign, specifically an middle eastern country bordering the Mediterranean) or private individuals (like political candidates). Basically some rich person or powerbase pays people to monitor social media and push their own agenda or most like just sow disinformation (typically by mixing truth with lies). Is there documented proof? No, not yet (of course this would be complete black budget within govts). But as explained earlier in the thread, they can be spotted based on repeated patterns of behavior.

       is excellent for them because it sort of funnels such anti- establishment ideas into one place that can monitored and shilled. But like I explained earlier, over a period of time, shilling becomes easier to spot - and can even be used to decipher what the TPTB are thinking. It's an information battle.

       Yeah, no, not all social media. Anything that massive would strictly impossible to hide. When you go on that kind of territory, the kind thinking it is more likely to have millions of people keeping a secret that huge rather than believing that it's just an unlikely theory, it is a very direct proof that you went full paranoia.

       The idea isn't to change a commentor's opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The goal of the shill is to derail the commentor from gaining traction and having a popular opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       And since most users don't change their filters, once a comment is downvoted past -4, then the comment gets buried.  What happens next are all the mindless bandwagoners start piling on the downvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I've said, it's not paranoia.  I've provided a link where a user admits to what they do and I along with countless Redditors have been derailed by these shills.

       This theory would work for reddit (downvotes resulting in hiding). Redditors are only a minority of people in any country. So as I said : a very expensive method with very limited potential results.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now actual results : troll comments get downvoted pretty effectively on reddit, meaning even worse actual results.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally : you are displaying the perfect irrational conspiracy believer behavior. You choose to believe that there's a giant secret network unknown to the whole world, whose role is to troll people into derailing discussions to prevent said discussions to have an impact,
       <strong>

       Did you read a good portion of what CaptainObviousMC had to say in that link I provided?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, according to CaptainObviousMC, it's very expensive to have paid shills sway the opinion the way they want but CaptainObviousMC does state that it is very effective.

       Maybe I am, Maybe I'm not but I've been in many situations where the Redditor I'm going back and forth would try and start a flame war and on 3 occasions, it seemed like I was talking to a bot becasuse their responses made no sense and were totally out of context to what we were talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can attribute that to paranoia all you want but it's something you would easily dismiss if it hasn't happened to you and I'm going to assume that it isn't going to happen to you since it looks like you think conspiracies are bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I've learned to take my flame wars private but you know what?  These assholes take screenshots and then post it for other Redditors to see?   The only reason to do this is to try and gain support instead of going mono-a-mono.

       How can you say that with the brief exchanges we've had?  You have no idea what my ideaology is unless you're a stalker and have been monitoring my activities this whole time but I doubt that.

      <p>
       One thing about me is that I've learned that anything is possible and everything has a bullshit element.  It's up to me to get the info and make the best educated decisions based on what I know, but that doesn't mean that what I think is concrete.  If I'm proven wrong, I'll freely admit it and correct myself, in which I've done many times.

       Posts like that are created with that very specific goal : troll gullible people like you. The author is probably from 4chan. I've been on threads or communities like this, where you target gullible people and toy with them. Conspiracy people are actually the ones able to trust anything, so you're the best audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've been in situations with dumb people. Your conclusion, again I need to say it for you to realize it, is that the cause is a secret worlwide organization whose goal is to troll people away from important matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'll take that theory. Tell me, who's behind the shilling on PCmasterrace ? On heroesofthestorm ? Who's paying user679 to post dumb things and troll on
       <a href="/r/kniting">
        /r/kniting
       </a>
       ? Obama ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, I'll come back to what should be the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       moto : possible is not likely. I've said it's possible. I've also said it is extremely unlikely, and that with zero argument or proof to back it up, the only sane action is to dismiss it.

       But you trust the word of a stranger on the internet that provided no proof or argument. So yes, you trust shit. And that's actually the right word: "shit". I've described this, and this has

       Now this is deviating alot from what we were discussing. I never said all conspiracies are dumb. Some are actually valid, and what it takes to tell the 1% true from the 99% bullshit is what you're showing a lack of: the ability to analyze the proofs and arguments provided. The shilling conspiracy has none. Nothing else to see here. Also, if you actually believe the moon landings is a debate, you should consider that you are way too easily manipulated by conspiracy bullshit.

       Alrighty then. I'm lazy. You are not. You investigated, and found nothing, else you'd shove it down the throat to anyone disbelieving, and furthermore, if you found anything, it'd be on display on every media. Conspiracies that prove to be true are largely relayed by the media, Snowden says hello, and he's not an isolated example. So again: you have nothing.

       That's a fallacy. Everybody in their right mind would explain every fucking detail if it was actually anywhere near being true. The "I don't have time to explain" fallacy doesn't work. Either you have proofs and/or arguments, or you don't.

       At first I thought you were just ignorant and young so I couldn't blame you much since you still have a lot of time to realize how stupid you sound, but now you're just coming off as pathetic. Typing words on the Internet doesn't mean anything. If you want people to ever take you seriously then you need to learn rhetoric and apart of that is not calling people names like a child when you can't think of anything else to say.

       Nope, not harmless. That's a form of mental conditioning. The child will become much more prone to magical thinking, which can lead him to believing in something entirely stupid when he's older. Think various scam schemes, superstitions, religions, lots of topics on this sub and so on. Why would you want to do this to a child?

       I know several people who aren't stupid but still believe in an adult version of Santa. Some of them were brought up with this belief (which explains a lot), some were not. All of them were taught Santa is real at some point. It's extremely difficult for me to understand how a person without any serious mental health issues would come to believing in religious gods, but the Santa thing would explain a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I'm lacking a control group of people who were never forced into believing divine entities exist while in childhood, so this observation is not really scientific.

       If the kid actually believes he's Bruce Wayne (to a point his parents are worried), he will probably be diagnosed with a severe psychosis. But pretending for a while and then switching back is different. When I launch Fallout, I pretend to be a badass roaming the wastelands and oneshotting Deathclaws. In dialogs, I act the way I think the protagonist would act (for example, the real me would never do lots of things Badass me does, from killing people left and right to touching the baby in the very first scene). That does not mean I'm unaware that it's all fake. Still fun.

       If the kid doesn't grow out of it, i'd agree with you. Kids believe all kinds of stupid shit that they grow out of. Some even think they have imaginary friends, big whoop. If they don't grow out of it, then be concerned.

        If you do what a particular person tells you to do without questioning it, you will be rewarded by a mysterious entity with an unconfirmed link to that person.

        Nobody has ever seen that entity or linked the reward to the entity. No proof of the entity's existence has ever existed. The confirmed rewards can always be easily explained without involving the entity.

       Many grown men believe in gods. That's their brains malfunctioning, not a good thing. You should probably avoid forcing a child to accept these thought patterns.

       the fact you think its okay we we fucking lie to our kids? Dude, I was born early 1970's and by the time I was 10, I was already sick of the bullshit lies being fed to me. I only played along because  I cannot control my need for greed.  Fuck you thinking this is harmless fun.  EDIT: Tell you what, you buy each and every fucking  Syrian refugee a gift from santa, make them believe some fucking fat cocksucking elf that looks like the spokesperson from Coke will make their dreams come true,  if they dont have a new iphone under the tree they just chopped down, means they  were aweful, so please accept the latest toy from the dollar store.

       nope. i believe it is actually to plant the seed of doubt within a child so they seek guidance outside of their parents. further dividing the family unit. destroy the family. destroy society... and here we are.

       Let's say you're right about the "seed of doubt" theory. Why is instilling the idea not to trust everything your parents tell you a bad thing? Why is the family unit only capable of survival if absolute obedience and blind acceptance followed? As someone with a pretty fucked up family, the destruction of that unit was one of the best things that ever happened to me.

       this is true. and i am sorry for your experience with your family. i don't believe in blind obedience. i was talking about a hypothetical family unit where the parents were teaching and guiding truly what was best for the child. honesty is the best policy, it builds a bond between the child and parents. because of this relationship the child would be made more aware of dishonesty in relationships causing more adept decision making.

       If you like, you could try finding flaw in my logic instead of attacking a person you know almost nothing about. Stick to the topic at hand, don't be emotional use your brain and logic to discern if what I am saying is true. No need to make accusations or belittle yourself to name calling.

       Aren't you told about jesus and god before santa? Its an indoctrination and setup from the start making people believe without facts or independent research. I dont agree with either.

       Sint Nicholas is also the root of Sinterklaas.  Our Dutch tradition including 'zwarte piet' (Black pete).  Which you may have heard about
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I  really like the magic mushroom theory,  I actually believe companies like coca cola capitalised on a tradition like Sinterklaas to further their consumer agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way.  The current state of the holiday called 'christmas'  is wrong and really should change.

       Isn't it more about what they believe? They know they are pretending when they put on a costume. Lying to them about Santa so they really believe in him is a horse of another color. IMHO.

       I tried telling my own child Santa doesn't exist and she didn't believe me. It would go in one ear, she would go to school/friends house and it would get pushed right out the other ear. It's pushed super hard in school. They made countdown chains, reindeer food to sprinkle the night before, a cookie for santa, wrote to Santa in school for the radio station and newspaper to publish, plus all the coloring sheets and activities they did on top of that. Her logic is that nobody would spend that much time convincing her of a lie because we consider lying a very big offense in our house.

       Yep.

       My big problem with teaching kids about santa and company is that it teaches undeveloped minds illogical thought patterns that can be used against them later in life.

       Good point. Parents will be pissed if your child tells their child Santa isn't real, but fuck'em that's their problem for telling their kids lies. Anyway they find out eventually.

       Controlled opposition to any ideas or rumors that might be getting popular that may not paint an entity in a good light, these entities could be govts (both local and foreign, specifically an middle eastern country bordering the Mediterranean) or private individuals (like political candidates). Basically some rich person or powerbase pays people to monitor social media and push their own agenda or most like just sow disinformation (typically by mixing truth with lies). Is there documented proof? No, not yet (of course this would be complete black budget within govts). But as explained earlier in the thread, they can be spotted based on repeated patterns of behavior.

       is excellent for them because it sort of funnels such anti- establishment ideas into one place that can monitored and shilled. But like I explained earlier, over a period of time, shilling becomes easier to spot - and can even be used to decipher what the TPTB are thinking. It's an information battle.
