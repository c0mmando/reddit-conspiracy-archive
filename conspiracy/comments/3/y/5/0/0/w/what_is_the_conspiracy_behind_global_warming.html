       Genuinley curious, not trying to hate on anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see people deny it a lot here, what's the conspiracy behind it? The greenhouse effect is so simple. Greenhouse gasses are trapped, warming the planet, humans release more and more over time, having a dangerous effect on our climate. Millions die from pollution in China alone. This is a very unhealthy future for humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've noticed that links denying it get 100+ upvotes, but proof the opposite way gets hardly any. Is this one of those conspiracies that is spread simply because it goes against the 'mainstream' idea? Or is it about government regulation?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just curious because my stepdad denies it as well. If I show him evidence he doesn't really care/prove me wrong. He's not a conspiracy theorist or anything. To be fair, I think he just has fun annoying me at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would like some input, TY.

       Corbett Report has many good videos on climategate.  I prefer CR because James does great research and provides reference.  Here's a good video on the issues.  His older videos are less sophisticated (suit in front of media panel).

       I struggle taking Carson seriously. In his last appearance on the JRE (with Hancock) he spent about 20 minutes trying to explain how mass extinction events that timed with human migration into these regions were unrelated to human activity despite this being a pretty well established narrative. He raised the example of there being no such mass extinction in Africa without mentioning that uh... we evolved with all those animals and that presumably they became adapted to recognize us as a danger before our numbers started expanding. Whilst I'm not a climate scientist, I find many of his statements on climate change equally dubious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway onto some points:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The global climate is an
        <em>
         incredibly
        </em>
        complicated system. Unsurprisingly computer models and theoretical analysis cannot encompass more than a small fraction of the variables involved. As we don't have a good holistic understanding of this system we do not know which variables are truly important and which are just co-incidental.
       </li>
       <li>
        The Carbon Cycle is incredibly important for sure. What is important here though is not the
        <em>
         amount
        </em>
        we put in, but whether or not man-made emissions cause this cycle to fall out of balance. We know reasonably reliably that there is a fairly fixed limit to how much CO2 can be absorbed each year. Logically then it is not the amount of CO2 but how much
        <em>
         excess
        </em>
        CO2 there is. Producing 6bln tonnes, as you say, is peanuts compared to the natural turnover however is this 6bln tonnes cannot be accommodated by natural cycles then it is simply going to build up over time.
       </li>
       <li>
        It is completely right to say that historically many 'golden eras' have coincided with climatic warm periods however it should also be noted that each of these golden eras has resulted in catastrophic collapse when the warm period has ended. Is this a model we want to follow? Is it even relevant with the dawn of modern agriculture? I doubt it. Also worth noting that yes plants can operate more efficiently with a slightly higher atmospheric CO2 content however it does not follow a linear trend, too much CO2 and the plants (as well as most animals!) begin to suffer harm.
       </li>
      </ul>

       You realize your last point is like saying you won't go have fun because you know you'll just be depressed later.  It seems like you're stretching it.

       Like, if people are starving and you can feed them better for a year but you won't so "they don't get used to it".  Jeez, glad I'm not in your family!

       result in deprivation for billions of individuals. Suggesting we should be prepared for this is just logical in my mind. Hoping the problem never arises or just goes away... not so much.

       When I hear about extreme weather I think of like sharknado.  As for disruptions in food production, sure that's a problem but we're already producing much more food than is naturally possible thanks to technology so I'm sure we can prepare as you're saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't think the climate change issue can be discussed seriously once we have to scare people with like "super-hurricanes" or whatever.

       Well you have a good imagination at least ;) Where did I mention 'super-hurricanes'? Like in the other thread you are putting words in my mouth and arguing from that. I don't like it. Extreme weather is unseasonable, unusual, or severe weather. It could include the changes in crop growth patterns due to unseasonably warm/cold/wet/dry seasons etc. Just because it isn't dramatic doesn't mean there isn't an issue. And again as I said in my OP here this is an
       <em>
        incredibly
       </em>
       complicated system we are talking about here, it's silly to try and assign specific weather events to climate change which is why the focus tends to be far more on longer-term trends.

       I completely agree! Sadly though we are dealing with pre-historic history here, solid conclusions are hard to come-by. We have strong correlation between human migration and mass-extinction events. We have archaeological records of large-scale hunts. From these two points we are drawing a hazy conclusion. That's all. But yes you are right, apologies if I sound like I am trying to state this as 'fact' in any way I am just trying to present the 'standard' argument here because...

      <p>
       Yes I completely agree. I think to a point this goes back to what you were saying about ideology. The 'CO2 causes climate change' narrative is extremely easy to understand from a layperson's perspective and is

       even if it is

       from the whole picture. I don't think it is as nefarious as many dissenters often seem to suggest but yes I would much rather the discussion were more complex and nuanced. That said though it seems hard enough to get the general public off the topic of celebrity culture so... y'know compromises and all that xD That said I'm also not a climate scientist so I am not 'in touch' with that field. For all I know, the actual academic discussion behind the public announcements is actually very nuanced but they choose to stick to a simplified narrative for the sake of maximizing public reaction? I dunno man.

       is the best summary I can find with a quick search. Basically increasing the CO2 consumption of a plant generally increases metabolic rate as a whole. tl:dr is basically you start to run into

       but the proteins and carbohydrates responsible for giving function are not always able to keep up. Also many issues in terms of soil depletion, over-consumption of water etc. etc. Eventually you also run into the point at which the partial pressure of CO2 becomes so great that you inhibit aerobic respiration but that's a bit of a moot point as everything else would also start to die by that point :v

       The Rockefellers and many of the foundations sponsored by the elite had a set of agendas they wanted enacted.
      </p>
      <p>
       A world government, fewer people, control of resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some other agendas, but we can start with these. To make their agenda a reality, they pursued many means of population control, many ways to bring about a world government and basically already had resource control.
      </p>
      <p>
       CO2 is exhaled by all people and is part of each and every human transaction. There are methods to avoid it, power sources that don't produce CO2, but they are not discussed by the global warming crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exxon is now being portrayed as the "bad guy" in global warming. This is true, but not how the media tells it. Exxon published 53 papers supporting AGW. Exxon belonged to the Rockefellers and they were driving the message of AGW through Exxon and other resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's important to understand the depths of the Rockefellers influence and connections. At the turn of the 20th century, the Rockefellers took over the American Medical Association and made it into what it is today. They took a bunch of everyday Joes and made the idea of a doctor as a status symbol, highly paid and godlike. They simultaneously ensured that diseases would be treated rather than cured and the pharmaceutical companies treating the diseases would be Rockefeller companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       People couldn't become doctors without the AMA, they could be dismissed from the AMA for curing people.
      </p>
      <p>
       They did kind of the same with climate science. The history of climate science is a bunch of people jumping on board with the current trend and not being able to explain it, with some being extremely alarmed about it. This happened during the dust bowl, the 50s to the seventies were a scare of global cooling, and then the uptick in temperature came about and a new thing to jump on board and cause alarm over was put in place. But this time the Rockefellers were there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rockefellers of course provided the land and helped the UN get started as the follow up to the League of Nations which they also got started. Both these groups essentially were moves towards a world government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maurice Strong started the IPCC and gave them their raison d'être: find human influence on the environment. Maurice Strong was a high school drop out, from Canada, who found himself living in the apartment of a wealthy and influential New Yorker at the age of 19. He was introduced to the Rockefellers and went into the oil business. He helped make Canada dependent on foreign oil and then was put in charge of PetroCanada to get Canada independent from foreign oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then just as the uptick in temperature occurs, he becomes:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Secretary General of both the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, which launched the world environment movement, and the 1992 Rio Environmental Summit, he was the first Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He establishes the IPCC and then 600 scientists are set to work to determine "man's influence in the climate" during a warming period.
      </p>
      <p>
       Man's influence was then obviously to warm the climate and CO2 was a good scapegoat for the cause. People make lots of it, it in fact encompasses every facet of human life.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they rolled with CO2.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next step is to get the world to start funding the problem. All that we need to do is fund this world body with a payment from every aspect of our life and also give them the ability to enforce. Enforce against every aspect of our life.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rockefellers turned climate scientists into many superstars with very good salaries. And anyone who goes against their story is attacked all around. Only few older scientists are willing to cross them. Young scientists who object to the theory just don't get hired.
      </p>
      <p>
       The models have been completely wrong. Antartica's ice is growing. No hotspots were found, the temperature hasn't risen in 18 years of the greatest CO2 output, there is no past evidence of CO2 driving warming.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you can see from the truly "religious" believers in global warming what their sentiments are (many leading advocates for global warming have instructed their followers to "stay on message" i.e. don't say shit like:) "I'm not going to have kids", "Humans deserve to die", "Deniers should be imprisoned".
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, we have 25% energy poverty in my province. Last year the models predicted a "mild" winter with "high confidence", it turned out to break the record for the coldest winter, broke the snow record, was what many contractors for snow removal based their prices on and got screwed for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their policies and belief in their models which have never been right cause havoc. Less access to energy and people taking taxes for CO2 will certainly result in terrible consequences. But they've prepped their faithful for this. Part of studying climate change is to go through moral dilemmas where they basically tell you to save humanity you need to be willing to kill most of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing that makes it most obvious are their lack of solutions. Thorium can prove a thousand years of energy with no CO2 emissions, but they won't mention it. Biofuel is supposed to be producing 3000 gallons per acre of marginal land, but gets no mention.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go through a long list of technologies that exist and are competitive but are not promoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       An interesting example is Lomberg. First, I completely disagree with his ideas, but the funny thing is he completely agrees with the premise that CO2 causes warming, but suggests that trillions of dollars aren't necessary to deal with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For that, he is called a denier. He proposes solutions, and so he is a denier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Climate Change is the apocalypse for athirst/would be scientists. And to say it can be prevented is sacrilege.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the basic story of climate change.

       You are 110% correct on the AMA being hijacked by the Rockefeller's/Carnegie's...  The Flexner report of 1910, sponsored by the two crooks,  killed all naturopathy and homeopathy in the states.  They should be tried for crimes against humanity.  There is no reason why pharma could not coexist with naturopathy and homeopathy, but the fuckers are so greedy it seems there's NOTHING they will not do to gain marketshare.

       Fast forward to the 8 min mark to see how the AMA brainwashes the doctors,  by having its curriculum controlled by pharma thru lobbyists and donations.  If you watch a couple of minutes I guarantee you will want to watch the rest of the 2 hour video.  There are 9 episodes like this.

       It also has a deeper agenda of a global earth worship religion and promotion of overpopulation and land scarcity with the need to have land locked up and kill off us carbon emitting plebs.

       You fool. Unless we do something, humans will be extinct from this planet, perhaps even by 2030, which is in 15 years. Why? Methane hydrates coming from the Arctic sea floor and from Northeastern Siberia, especially.

       Global warming/climate change is a vehicle for creating a world government. Through carbon tax/cap and trade, money will become available to operate an un-elected world governing body. I believe this would be tied to international trade agreements that replace the power/laws of nations with corporate rights.

       This is probably the main reason, I agree. There is a loose global elite that want to consolidate their power by abolishing nation states. The League of Nations, the United Nations, the European Union etc have all been introduced to this end, albeit without much success. The elite have now decided they need to convince the world there is a "common enemy" that could destroy the planet, and this will bring countries together under a single planet-state.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a long time, it was thought that the threat of an alien attack (or even a hoax alien invasion) might be used to implement a world government, but for the time being the elite have chosen another (still bullshit, but less idiotic) "threat" - namely
       <strong>
        ecological and climatic catastrophe
       </strong>
       . This ploy has been quite successful - billions of people have fallen for this unscientific propaganda, and the recent global elite jamboree in Paris shows that the elite may be starting to get their way.

       "Hurricane" Patricia is a perfect example. Catastrophic winds reported, risk of death and destruction on an epic scale! It was literally called the strongest hurricane in recorded history!

       Once it hit land and could be measured by everyone else it was moving at 30 mph. Barely a storm at all. Pathetic, and all the Chicken Littles running around should be laughed at.

       You are so naive. Are you seriously pointing to "Hurricane Patricia" as your basis for thinking the whole climate change is a hoax?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Climate Change calamity coming our way is not confirmed by just ONE method of temperature measurement. There are now dozens and dozens of different ways of measuring the climate, from satellite, to ground-level temp measuring stations--more every day. Every single one of these methods are pointing to the same thing: our climate is getting warm at an alarming rate. Why should you care? Because CO2 does its magic and then it releases Methane gas from the frozen Arctic sea floor, and from the vast Siberian permafrost. Methane is at least 30 times more severe as a greenhouse gas.
      </p>
      <p>
       This could--serious as a heart attack--kill all of us by 2030. I know that sound crazy.

       If you've been alive for more then 18 years just walk the fuck outside. The last few years have been the mildest when it comes to hurricanes despite every model predicting the opposite. I have lived in various states on the east coast for the last 20 years and it is clearly observable that there is no sea level rise. The fact that the weatherman can't predict beyond a week (sometimes even a day) with any accuracy makes it clear how much more complex the issue is than one molecule with a bad reputation.

       Pointing to one cherry picked datapoint--such as the formation of hurricanes--is useless. Unless you can say that that local weather did not just move elsewhere, your example is meaningless. In terms of the total global climate system--which is what we're discussing--pointing to any local incident such as bringing a snowball on the floor of the Senate--is just a stunt that means nothing, just as your hurricane example means nothing. Just because somebody misread the hurricane season does not disprove the entirety of worldwide climate science!

       The number 2030 was put forward by professor Guy McPherson, a Climate Scientist who has been studying this issue for  about 45 years. 
McPherson has two sites:
       <a href="http://guymcpherson.com/">
        Nature Bats Last
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://www.onlyloveremains.org/">
        Abrupt Climate Change
       </a>

In case you're not aware, Methane is 30 times worse as a green house gas than CO2 is. CO2 emissions have permitted the elimination of Arctic sea ice, thereby allowing the current huge spike in Methane emissions from the Arctic.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        According to the satellite data (the most accurate record we have on global climate) there has been no extreme warming for the past 18+ years (it's in the 10ths of a degree which is quite OK). It really makes me wonder where people are coming from when actual scientific observation is disregarded in favour of preserving a political ideology.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Arctic, Greenland and Antarctica are all breaking records for ice accumulation, sea ice extent, shortest melt seasons etc. We've seen normal sea level rise, which has been rising steadily since the end of the last ice age about 10,000 years ago. Hurricanes, cyclones, monsoons are all in decline and the climate isn't rising at an alarming rate.
       </p>
       <p>
        All this, and more, in spite of rising levels of CO2. It seems that nature just doesn't want to play ball with the UN and its anthropogenic climate alarmism. Seriously, if you're getting your news from Arnold and Bill Nye (who doesn't know shit about the climate FYI, Richard Lindzen is an atmospheric physicist from MIT) you're not helping yourself or anyone else.
       </p>
       <p>
        We've seen a 40% greening of the planet, crop yields are up and the plants are loving it. CO2 only exists in the atmosphere at a level of around 0.04%. Of that very small amount only 3% is man made. Heck, ants all over the world produce ten times more CO2 than humans do each year. Is ant CO2 good but human CO2 bad?
       </p>
       <p>
        Did you know that if CO2 levels dropped to 150ppm all plant life on the planet dies? By all estimates, before humans came along and started putting CO2 back into the atmosphere, from whence it came, the planet only had about 2 millions years left before reaching that catastrophic level. Levels of CO2 are still less than 400ppm, which is less than ideal for plants to flourish. As an example, owners of agricultural greenhouses pump in extra CO2 up to levels of 1,200ppm so that plants will grow more efficiently and with higher yields.
       </p>
       <p>
        The UN is an unelected political body that is using anthropogenic global warming as a means to change the world order and accrue power unto itself. Their Sustainable Development document, which I have read in its entirety, is nothing short of a blueprint to establish a technocratic socialist world order. It's a centrally planned nightmare. If the 20th century is anything to go by, this new version of global socialism will cause way more harm than good. Central planning and socialism in general just doesn't work.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have also taken the time to download and analyse John Cook's 97% scientific consensus paper with the data. It's a scam. That guy, who lives just up the road from me, literally, faked that consensus. There was nothing like the consensus he claimed there was. In fact, based upon his data, it's more like a 0.3% consensus if you don't group unrelated categories or include papers that have nothing to do with AGW. If you knew anything you would know that the only place you'll find a scientific consensus is at the UN. The Petition Project, where 31,487 scientists have signed a document stating that AGW is not real, refutes the consensus claim, as does the survey conducted by the Scottish, Climate &amp; Energy Forum.
       </p>
       <p>
        You criticise us deniers as loons and immovable but we're, at least, prepared to take time out of our days to actually look into the data. Are you? If you're willing, maybe a good place to start is to research why that bloomberg page linked above is nothing but climate alarmist propaganda. Also, typically, climate sceptics have had their minds changed at least once, so to say they can't change their minds is also silly. I used to believe in AGW until I started asking questions and looking for answers.

       A few, mostly tied to either CRU or GISS (both on record collaborating to promote the alarmist narrative and squash dissenting voices), records show warming, but these use surface temperature stations which actually do not show warming in the raw data and so are adjusted upwards.  An audit of this data has shown that many of these stations should probably be adjust downwards due to a buildup of asphalt in the vicinity over the years.

       Not only that, but even the placement of the readings stations are disproportionately placed near the equator to drive up the average. And they STILL have to be adjusted up to jibe with the AGW claims.

       It's not a pollutant therefore its healthy? Nice. And no, we were taught that it is a greenhouse gas as the molecule absorbs and re-emits long-wave radiation. Which it does. This is not in dispute

       It's healthy to plant life, it's not toxic except after a certain point to humans.  We consume it in sparkling drinks.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does absorb radiation, but given the minuscule amount of it in the atmosphere, it's role is very minor.  Theoretical models suggest that maybe CO2 is pushing the system over the edge and triggering worse greenhouse chemicals, but CO2 alone had a very minor effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, sure, maybe human emission of it contributes to climate change.  Maybe we should do something about it.  But it's not an otherwise dangerous chemical and right now there's s tactic out there to associate CO2 with "polluted and unhealthy air".
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'll say "I don't think we need to worry about CO2."  And someone will say "but shouldn't we have clean and healthy air".  Yeah, that'd called changing the subject.

       CO2 acts as a strong coolant in the upper atmosphere. For roughly 250 kms (it fluctuates) the incoming energy from the sun is prevented from reaching the planet by CO2.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not in dispute.
      </p>
      <p>
       The energy then hits the earth, clouds, and is absorbed and reradiated.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the biosphere, it doesn't warm. In the region dominated by water, it doesn't warm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Above the area dominated by clouds it absorbs some of the otherwise out-going radiation. This is a very narrow band.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the overall effect is has not been determined. NASA isn't clear:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2010/15jul_thermosphere/">
         http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2010/15jul_thermosphere/
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        When carbon dioxide gets into the thermosphere, it acts as a coolant, shedding heat via infrared radiation. It is widely-known that CO2 levels have been increasing in Earth's atmosphere. Extra CO2 in the thermosphere could have magnified the cooling action of solar minimum.
       </p>
       <p>
        "But the numbers don't quite add up," says Emmert. "Even when we take CO2 into account using our best understanding of how it operates as a coolant, we cannot fully explain the thermosphere's collapse."
       </p>
       <p>
        According to Emmert and colleagues, low solar EUV accounts for about 30% of the collapse. Extra CO2 accounts for at least another 10%. That leaves as much as 60% unaccounted for.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In other words, extra CO2 results in cooling but how much is unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does CO2 in the upper atmosphere compare to models? Models predicted half the rate of increase that observational measurements later determined. In other words, that  "Extra CO2 accounts for at least another 10%" means that the models at least half of that cooling effect as an error, with the potential for much more.
      </p>
      <p>
       In NASA's AMA, I asked about the extent of the cooling effect of CO2 in the upper atmosphere. This article is quite old and the only further research I've found from NASA suggests the effect is quite significant:
      </p>
      <p>
       The conclusion was (from the first link):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Important clues may be found in the way the thermosphere rebounds. Solar minimum is now coming to an end, EUV radiation is on the rise, and the thermosphere is puffing up again. Exactly how the recovery proceeds could unravel the contributions of solar vs. terrestrial sources.
       </p>
       <p>
        "We will continue to monitor the situation," says Emmett.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In 2012, we found out from NASA:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2012/22mar_saber/">
        http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2012/22mar_saber/
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “This was the biggest dose of heat we’ve received from a solar storm since 2005,” says Martin Mlynczak of NASA Langley Research Center.  “It was a big event, and shows how solar activity can directly affect our planet.”
       </p>
       <p>
        For the three day period, March 8th through 10th, the thermosphere absorbed 26 billion kWh of energy.  Infrared radiation from CO2 and NO, the two most efficient coolants in the thermosphere, re-radiated 95% of that total back into space.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well, that seems quite informative, but as I said, I asked NASA about it in their AMA, perhaps their direct reply is of more use?
      </p>
      <p>
       The comment, linking to the same site, NASA's, using a direct quote from NASA, asked to NASA, with a request that they expand on it, was automodded. During that important time when comments first appear on the thread, it is shadow banned, automatically according to the mod who approved it one hour later.
      </p>
      <p>
       It still attracted attention and rose to smack dab in the middle of the voted up questions. NASA chose to answer the following questions, but not this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, don't just listen to people saying CO2 warms the atmosphere. It shields us to a certain extent to the full force of the sun, and what gets through is then slightly held back in a small region.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that mean that CO2 in the atmosphere causes cooling overall? Since we can't even mention that it causes cooling without a flock of alarmists descending on us, it will be hard to determine. Where do the politics lie at NASA?

      <p>
       Most components of the atmosphere are invisible to long-wave radiation. CO2 being a minor component of the atmosphere does not necessarily mean its contribution to the greenhouse effect is minor.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Theoretical models suggest that maybe CO2 is pushing the system over the edge
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Exactly. Even if anthropogenic contributions are tiny compared to natural turnover, if it causes CO2 output to exceed what natural cycling systems can cope with then there is an issue. Where I feel there is ground for a debate is precisely how much we can produce without overly stretching these natural cycles.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        maybe human emission of it contributes to climate change. Maybe we should do something about it. But it's not an otherwise dangerous chemical and right now there's s tactic out there to associate CO2 with "polluted and unhealthy air".
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I haven't mentioned pollution at all but yes I agree that it is a shame so much attention is placed on CO2
       <strong>
        however
       </strong>
       most of the CO2-producing processes we usually associate with ACC (transport, industry etc.) also produce tremendous quantities of harmful pollution therefore I don't feel it's really fair to make the distinction you are making.

       True, I'm just trying to show that the statement is not always correct. If we reached that point we'd all be dead anyway from causes completely unrelated to climate change.

       The graph shows temperature vs CO2 levels for the last 400,000 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the exact graph that I was shown in climate change courses. I will tell you what I found out online (and what made me become suspicious of "global warming", a theory I just assumed was true). The professors said, CO2 goes up, temperature goes up. But that's not what's happening. Temperature goes up and then 800 years later, CO2 goes up.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, warmer temperature causes more growth. But, they use it to say, look how closely related they are (and don't mention the 800 year gap following warming)!
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like someone looking at a horse-drawn carriage and saying the carriage is what's making the horses move.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for the last 400,000 years, temperature increases caused CO2 increases. What about recently? CO2 increases were met by:
      </p>
      <p>
       cooling,
      </p>
      <p>
       warming,
      </p>
      <p>
       no change.
      </p>
      <p>
       That does't sound very convincing for CO2 to cause warming, maybe if we go way back we can see some connection?
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Nope, no connection. So CO2 didn't correlate with temperature for most of history, followed warming, and now doesn't correlate with warming in modern history.
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes an extremely biased person to glean from these graphs that CO2 causes warming.

       We don't really know as much as we act like we do.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, a few years back, NASA printed a few articles on the thermosphere's collapse and couldn't explain it by what was understood to be the cooling effect of CO2 in the upper atmosphere alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       CO2 increases in the upper atmosphere were double the rate predicted by the models. This means that we don't really understand the balance.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also don't really understand the effects of the biosphere very well. Would reforesting a desert cause warming or cooling? TBH, we don't really know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the studies done into deforestation often take a model predicted CO2 forcing rate. These have shown to be over-predictions, but then they base the studies on them. We have different studies with different results for water vapours effect on CO2, with some saying the effect is negative and some saying positive, but the models had based it on having a positive feedback and the studies adopted this.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, we do know, but it's contrary to our narrative. Forests cause warming. We've known it for quite a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then NASA comes and does their climate change AMA and when asked about just planting vast forests to sequester CO2, NASA basically hedges and doesn't get into it. Because forests are green and climate change is a green movement, so they just ignore the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same with nuclear. The same group who supported it is all up in the climate change videos, at the rallies, and add to their numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nuclear is not only the safest power source, it doesn't give off CO2.
      </p>
      <p>
       If their movement is more important than the science, then it's not about the science, but about the movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen no strong evidence to suggest that CO2 levels correlate with warming. All major hypotheses have failed to materialize.

       Oh man. You are completely out of line with this comment. I've been here, on reddit and on this sub, for the past 10 months and have finally got to the point where various shills are easily identified, and

       You, on the other hand, have a post history on this sub of less than two weeks and post almost entirely about Israel. You may not be a shill, but calling out untumulted as a shill with a two week history of posting in this sub is out of line. And you couldn't be more wrong.

       Pollution is obviously a problem and, of course, we should be trying to get ourselves off fossil fuels. But there is no scientific experiment that proves CO2 emissions are responsible for Global Warming. Climate Change is statistical analysis, it is not science.

       That being said, I believe that CO2 is a huge pollution problem and for that alone we need to get off fossil fuels. But remember, if the Government and Elite think that climate change is seriously a "national security threat", then why are there still
       <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title35/pdf/USCODE-2011-title35-partII-chap17-sec181.pdf">
        3000 renewable energy patents classified by the patent office?
       </a>
       Wouldn't you think they'd release new energy devices to the public and subsidize them? Wouldn't you think they'd stop subsidizing the Oil companies in favor of renewable energy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, think about the solution being presented. The only "solution" to the problem anyone is talking about is a
       <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122826696217574539">
        Global Carbon Tax
       </a>
       . So if that gets passed, the UN will have a brand new bureaucracy that collects taxes from Americans and a bunch of other countries. For all intents and purposes, we will be beholden to a new form of government that will collect taxes and make decisions about our industry and the industry of many other countries. The UN will be able to stop small countries from developing their industry if it is deemed that they are producing too much Carbon. This is about control, not saving the world. Will we be able to vote on the people making decisions in this new government? Of course not. No taxation without representation.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Climate Change" is a smoke screen being used to set up a new form of government. They are playing on everyone's heart strings and humanity to trick people into paying a new tax that
       <em>
        will not do anything
       </em>
       . Do you think Climate Change would just magically reverse course and everything would then be cool? Of course it wouldn't be in reality but the MSM would start reporting "We've saved the world! We've done it! No need to worry about Climate Change anymore because now you're paying taxes directly to the UN and now the problem is solved." Meanwhile the Oil companies will continue to receive their subsidies, pollution will continue to get worse and worse, and all the inventions that could change the world will remain suppressed and hidden in the black projects going on in the bottom levels of S4 and Area 51.

       I don't believe you are a scientist after this comment. What field of study are you in and what do you do?
      </p>
      <p>
       The scientific method is this:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Form a Hypothesis
       </li>
       <li>
        Develop testable predictions
       </li>
       <li>
        Experiment
       </li>
       <li>
        Check results against predictions
       </li>
       <li>
        Form further hypotheses and repeat.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Examples of this include the Double Slit Experiment, Galileo's falling objects, the Cavendish Experiment, Foucault's Pendulum, etc. etc. etc. All of these experiments are repeatable and prove beyond a shadow of a doubt a certain aspect of reality. There is no equivalent to any of these for Climate Change. Climate Change is simply the laying of two graphs over one another, a correlation, and then "97%" (made up number) of scientists agreeing "Yes! We all have a consensus that correlation DOES equal causation in this instance!" That's not science, that's the bastardization of science.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you are right about one thing: so much of the "science" nowadays is actually just bullshit statistical analysis. Most of it is also not repeatable. Have you ever heard of the Lancet Journal of Science (it's a pretty big one right?). This is what the editor of that journal had to say about the current state of science
       <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1.pdf">

       <p>
        The case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness....
       </p>
       <p>
        It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of the New England Journal of Medicine
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The state of science in America is profoundly flawed at the moment. The term "science" is being used to encompass so much bullshit that it's astounding. Meanwhile, the "scientists" seem to have either forgot or just don't give a fuck about the scientific method.

       And clearly you have no idea what you're talking about here. What is a hypothesis and how do you 'check your results against predictions'? You have heard of a null-hypothesis I take it?

       Actually there is. The greenhouse properties of certain gases can be measured using spectroscopic equipment as per this
       <a href="http://www.weatherquestions.com/A_backyard_greenhouse_effect_experiment.htm">
        relatively simple demonstration
       </a>
       . The issue is that you are trying to compare experiments that demonstrate fundamental properties of the universe with the analysis of system-wide phenomena. As I've said multiple times in this thread, the global climate is a
       <em>
        ridiculously
       </em>
       complex system, one which we still have a fairly basic understanding of. I don't see why you would reasonably expect a simple demonstration that can somehow summarize the multitude of variables involved in real-world climatology before actually accepting some of the hypotheses. In reality most of our models for most sciences depend upon vastly simplified descriptions of phenomena that we
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       don't necessarily behave in this way in real life. That doesn't mean we reject them wholesale but rather we take these shortcomings into account when assessing what the models show us (or try to). As a biologist this is something that affects me a great deal as the complex, dynamic nature of cells seems to defy any and all attempts at accurate modelling. It doesn't mean these models have no value, just that we shouldn't take them at face value but rather interpret them with the understanding that they do not represent the whole picture. Leading to...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Quote from the Lancet.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes this is, again, especially true of Biology. As The Lancet is a medical (not 'Science') journal they are talking here about the inherent variability of biological experiments. This is
       <strong>
        precisely why
       </strong>
       statistical analysis is so god-damn important. Consider that any and all biological organisms are the result of 3+ billion years of evolution. They are adapted to respond to cues from
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       aspect of the environment, no matter how minute. In fact often it is these minute changes which drive the heterogeneity of a culture. One example I have worked with fairly frequently is the issue of nutrient and waste distribution in static
       <em>
        in vitro
       </em>
       culture. Cells generally speaking exist in a dynamic environment, some kind of force generally exists to ensure a constant flux and flow around the cell's environment. When we then try and study cells in a culture flask we face a
       <em>
        giant
       </em>
       problem from the absence of this distribution - Suddenly individual cells may find themselves in a micro-environment entirely different from that of their neighbours and will respond accordingly. How exaclty do you suggest we control this in our experiments? Another great example that blew my mind a little during my PhD was that of pH. Did you know most labs don't properly control the pH used in their dH2O? In fact this is nearly impossible due to the amphoteric nature of water and solubility of atmospheric gases. We actually found in our labs that water from the generator dropped from pH7.1 to 6.9 around lunch time (using statistical analysis to compare multiple datapoints from 4 weeks of analysis using 1-hour timepoints...) before increasing again. Why? Not a clue but this is a
       <em>
        huge
       </em>
       difference for a cell and could well mean that media made-up around lunchtime would have a wildly different effect on the culture than media made at any other time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Leading back to...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Without this analysis it is
       <em>
        impossible
       </em>
       to seperate true results from noise. I have literally no idea how anyone who professes to understand how science works can say this. How the hell else do you determine if a result is significant? Your description of 'laying two graphs over one another' is a laughable excuse of understanding, I'd suggest watching some lectures and reading some books, maybe try doing your own work to see why this is so important. Statistics really is a beautiful tool once you begin to understand how it works. That said I do accept that there are many,
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       instances of scientists using the 'wrong' statistics and trying to extrapolate something from a non-significant result. The reasons for this are numerous but simply put i) It
       <em>
        sucks
       </em>
       to find a non-significant result. A properly conducted experiment, especially in my field, can be the result of
       <em>
        hundreds
       </em>
       of hours of meticulous work. Quite often there is significant pressure to publish
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       with that data and even more to avoid publishing negative results. This is a sad turn of events but is not the fault of the scientific method so much as financial and professional pressures as this work is
       <em>
        expensive
       </em>
       and generating publications is pretty much the main metric of how 'successful' someone is in academic science ii) Statistics is a ridiculously complicated field. Most scientists have not been taught statistics (though this is changing) but simply put, you're asking someone who may have minimal education in mathematics to understand an entirely separate field from what they have trained in as a student. People spend
       <em>
        years
       </em>
       training to be statisticians but there are no-where near enough of them. An ideal scenario would be if scientists had the ability to hand their data over to a professional statistician but again there are issues with this in terms of needing to understand how variables interact, which variables are interesting, how the data can best be represented etc. etc.

      <p>
       I'm not American so I can't say however from outside observation the main issues I tend to find is there there is a
       <em>
        huge
       </em>
       gap between the level of knowledge in the public field and in academia. Far too many people seem to have the kind of attitude that you have in terms of feeling like they understand science better than the people who have dedicated their lives and careers to the field. Let me tell you, if scientists wanted to get rich, we wouldn't be fuckin' scientists. It is a
       <em>
        hard
       </em>
       job with few prospects and comparatively little pay for the amount of training and work required. People do not seem to have a good grasp of how scientists actually work, the amount of communication and peer-review involved at all levels etc. Genuinely
       <em>
        the greatest
       </em>
       thing you can achieve as a scientist is to disrupt the
       <em>
        status quo
       </em>
       and introduce a new paradigm. We
       <em>
        dream
       </em>
       of achieving this. It means fortune and it means fame. We are not a cabal trying to further our own agenda, we are trying to identify what the fuck is going on in the objective reality outside of our subjective senses. Mathematics, including statistics, is by far the best tool we have for achieving this.

       As an electrical engineer studying electric engines and clean energy, here's my input.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) doesn't matter if it's a conspiracy. Clean energy (especially electric engines) in their infancy are more efficient than fossil fueled combustion engines 100 years developed. Embrace the new cool tech.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) the facts above about how we put a small ass amount of CO2 in the air compared to its natural levels is totally believable. My concern with our current energy usage is pollution. I'm not too concerned with melting the ice caps. Mother Earth has ways to deal with it and there's plenty of room left in Central US for new cities should the water level rise. I'm more concerned with the after-products of coal and other forms of pollutants being tossed into our water and air supplies by coporationfags
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: also, I saw once that really longly-named volcano in Iceland?? (Not sure) a few years back launched so much CO2 into the air that it undid the carbon reducing efforts of a decade. If someone has a source to back this up, then the "global warming from CO2" shit is 100% just political nonsense

       I'm a bioengineer, and I agree with the tech...just a few problems with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of my main interests is hemp. I've collaborated on studies and may be the foremost researcher on it in my region.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hemp is legal in Canada...but not really. The redtape watchdog pointed to hemp three times as an area with too many bureaucratic obstacles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Farmers must buy pedigree seeds (which cost ten times what they can sell their own grain for), you need a license (good for one calendar year) to grow, store, transport, process and research hemp.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hemp is specified as having less than 0.3% THC (it can't get you high) but you need to test it which adds several hundred dollars to the cost of growing. Of course, there are no testers available in my region, so...
      </p>
      <p>
       Farmers are liable for volunteer plants. If any hemp pops up in the following year, then you have breached your license and are fully liable.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of hemps most common current uses for the byproduct (hemp shiv) is in a building material called hempcrete. Hempcrete was used to house the archives of the British Museum. It self-regulates humidity, is an excellent insulator and is highly fire resistant. There are many other good qualities: it's near soundproof, rot-resistant, doesn't off-gas and is carbon neutral.
      </p>
      <p>
       In many countries it's used quite a bit: Australia, France, England.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, a farmer jumps through all the hoops, gets the grain from the hemp and then has a byproduct which is a renewable building material. So it becomes attractive to environmentally conscious folks. And they apply for a building permit.
      </p>
      <p>
       6 months of bureaucratic hurdles with the hemp just sitting there and they ok the project, with the caveat that hempcrete buildings will "never" be granted another license.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are roughly 100,000 acres of hemp being grown this year. Enough byproduct to produce 100,000 2000 ft
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       houses.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just can't be used.
      </p>
      <p>
       Embracing the "new cool tech" is great. But don't kid yourself. They aren't in this to make solutions available.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not even particularly new. It has been used for centuries, perhaps millennia.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are countless examples. Rocket stoves can heat a house with 1/4 to 1/8 the fuel and can use scraps not suitable in normal fireplaces. Even Mark Twain recognized this importance and wrote about it. He was talking about masonry heaters, which a rocket stove is. For a hundred plus years the US could have been heating homes with cheap and efficient stoves.
      </p>
      <p>
       But cheap and efficient mean less GDP. Less tax. Less government. Less control.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1916, the Department of Agriculture recognized hemp as a sustainable resource. They then made growing it illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it very much does matter if it's a conspiracy, because the same folks promoting the idea are the same ones able to prevent the solutions from coming around that deprive them the money and control that the "problem" of CO2 is allowing them to demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem, reaction, solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem: everyone is evil because CO2,
      </p>
      <p>
       Reaction: we need to stop CO2,
      </p>
      <p>
       Solution: gives us the power, money and authority to do it.

       In my energy systems class we asked about thorium. The guest speaker said thorium is not naturally fissile, and the energy required to make it fissile and then begin the fission process is simply too inefficient and costly.

       Wow great information. Although I do believe people like Musk are out to create solutions. This is why we see the government stepping in out west by trying to create a "solar tax". Like come on... That's comparable to an oxygen tax. I definitely see your point about more money and control, but there are some out there just trying to make the world better.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, in the case of hemp (and marijuana as a painkiller), the government realized widespread use of these great natural products would result in the destruction of already-established industries.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree with you for the most part. The government is always stepping their foot in to snatch more money and gain more control. Anyways... Best of luck in your field! I'll look more into hemp, it seems interesting.

       Conspiracies happen and operate all the time. If you've had a job you've seen little conspiracies at work. Perhaps there's a bigger conspiracy that keeps customers coming in. You, me, and everyone reading this, are probably involved in one or more conspiracies right now. Not all conspiracies are bad, or even carried out maliciously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people don't know why they believe what they think to be true. We may be subject to conditioning, propaganda, peer-pressure, or lies. A lot of the time though what we believe comes from "experts". We recognize our ignorance and so rely on others to guide our thinking. Once we see that thinking in a particular way gets positive results we resist change.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe that the entire pro-AGW community is involved in conspiracy. Some, like the more well-known advocates, have flesh in the game and so will go to any lengths to obfuscate and pontificate when holes appear in the theory or predictions. Others are simply dependent on AGW for their livelihoods and so will not hear opposition. Take for example the IPCC. We all laugh when prominent believers are tripped up and aren't aware of basic details. But if you're convinced that you're correct and have built a career around it, you have a vested interest in protecting your position.
      </p>
      <p>
       While there may be a large-scale conspiracy we can't assume that to be so. We do see a number of smaller, inter-related conspiracies though, and most of those have to do with money. AGW is called, and considered, settled. Being outside of a settled theory carries professional and personal cost. Many researchers, journals, and others connected tangentially to AGW let their real self-interest guide their thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       AGW is a cause for environmental concern and is therefor a political "mommy" issue. Mommy issue have huge traction in the public mind. Is it any wonder that AGW skeptics are so vilified? Taking a stance against AGW evokes the same visceral response as being against motherhood itself. People don't know why they're upset but they're willing to strike down all opposition if that makes them feel better. AGW is not so much a huge conspiracy as it is a cultural phenomenon that has the same effect.

       The globe is warming, but it's got very little to do with us. These are natural cyclical temperature variations caused by the sun. See this graph for proof. [img]

       The world has been hotter than it is now, several times, long before the industrial revolution. Long before modern humans even existed. The real conspiracy is the conspiracy of fear. The globalists use fear of the temperature, to pass legislation which de-industrializes countries or to get useful idiots to donate to their lucrative charities. Of course very little of that money will ever go to fix the problem, it will mainly line the pockets of scumbags.

       2 other points worth making- Trees love CO2, it's like brawndo, its what plants crave. If we weren't clearcutting millions of acres of rainforest, we would be seeing less impact from CO2 because the trees would soak it up. and a warm globe is infinitely preferable to an ice age. if its too hot you can go for a swim, but if it's too cold, most of humanity dies. simple as that.

       It’s not a fucking thing like that. Oil companies don’t want to be allowed to dump whatever the fuck they want wherever the fuck they want (like tobacco companies can), and they already CANNOT do that. Their concern is with their entire livelihoods being destroyed based on a false premise.
      </p>
      <p>
       The overall concern is with totalitarian government owning the both the means and the TYPE of production for the sole purpose of the destruction of industry itself, while letting the rest of the fucking world do whatever the fuck they want.

       Okay. And? What’s your point? They exist. They are, in general, followed. One instance of not being followed does not change the definition of them being followed, nor the fact that they exist, nor is it a proof that there should be more regulations or that the institutions themselves should be shut down. The company in question was punished for them not being followed. The companies are not calling for them to be removed.

       The profit motive is constrained by regulation only to the degree that the regulators have the rules and means to enforce them.    Now that there is a revolving door between the corporations/government and the fascist culture of bribery/lobbying has been accepted as normal,   the environment is at the mercy of corporate self restraint.    Public opinion does make some difference.    But it too can be controlled.   Take you,   for instance.

       I’d be happy to rewrite it, then.
      </p>
      <p>
       For what do the energy companies lobby? The continuation of their services. They don’t want their production to be shut down. We know, from both history and through continued operation that they’re not averse to increases in safety (physical and environmental), where necessary. Indeed, increasing profits naturally comes from increasing safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans are environmentalists at heart. This is something that the AGW crowd has
       <em>
        completely forgotten
       </em>
       . Environmentalism has nothing to do with believing in AGW, but they have co-opted the term and scream, “IF YOU DON’T BELIEVE THAT WE’RE ALREADY DOOMED TO BURN TO DEATH AND THERE’S NOTHING WE CAN DO TO STOP IT, THEN YOU ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD DUMP GARBAGE AND TOXIC WASTE EVERYWHERE AND CUT DOWN THE FORESTS.” This is utter nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       No energy company wants to remove their scrubbers or be allowed to destroy the environment. A company cares for its profits, and as no customers would accept such behavior, it would lose all of its profits in engaging therein.
      </p>
      <p>
       Current energy company lobbying pertains to not putting every single last one of their employees out of their jobs, which is what the AGW crowd demands. Look at Alberta. Canada’s near-marxist government has destroyed the economy. Plants are shut down, no one can work, and suicides are skyrocketing. The government wants complete and utter control over what people can and cannot consume, never mind what they can and cannot do. If it gets bad enough, I hope the “Texas of Canada” gives sincere consideration to leaving Canada and joining the Union, as we’d love to have them, their resources, and wouldn’t deny them their livelihood.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ll mention that lobbying should be a felony, but stopping it would be unenforceable. We’re in a bad position.

       Sir,
I understand that you seem to have a personal connection to the oil industry--and perhaps you or a relative gained employment from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you that what would happen to the entire oil-based industry is tragic for the people who make their lives from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, when we are concerned with the health of the public--the health of your grandchildren--we cannot choose today to preserve these jobs if they pose a danger. I'm sure, if it were some other industry affected, you'd say: "Well, those people need to find new jobs." Harder to say that when it's your kid.
      </p>
      <p>
       You and people who share your opinions are really hanging 100% of your point on the hope that, despite the last 20 years of ongoing concern about this exact issue, despite the thousands and thousands of scientists who have been working in competitive fields, writing papers, researching, finding evidence, shooting down the viewpoints of other scientists--despite all that work--scientists have only grown more convinced human-caused climate change is a serious danger, one that could potentially cause runaway global climate change that actually exterminates all human life on this planet by as soon as 2030. Sounds crazy, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I know what you're hoping for. Some big giant bombshell that all the world's scientists have been lying. It was just a big farce. THAT's what you're hoping for. But let me ask you this. How often in life do you PLAN and BASE your future life on "what you hoped was true". Basically, by assuming that this AGW thing is going to be proven as just a hoax, you are risking everything--the lives of your grandchildren. You really that sure? Sure that EVERYBODY is lying?
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you wrote back in a calm manner, I will make one request from you. Now, I'm betting that you've heard of a guy--former Republican Governor of California? Arnold Schwartzenegger?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a documentary with Arnold that I will ask you to watch.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can always come back and ridicule it here. But just watch. What can it harm you?

       Among the single handful of scientists--physicists--that are paid to spew their climate denial nonsense, not ONE of them--not Singer, not Seitz--have done a single iota of research.

I understand that it saddens you, you old codger, that you spent your life on oil and now to accept that it was all wrong is like realizing that--to your species--you were a Judas.

I understand how hard this has to be for you to accept, but it unfortunately is true.

       No, you provided links to known climate-denier sites.
      </p>
      <p>
       When asked for any climate research done by either Singer or Seitz, you sent me a link that allegedly contained 1350 links--but that list was actually examined and shown to contain nothing of the sort.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, as long as we accept all the climate denier bullshit from your side that is funded by the people whose bottom line would be affected by this change, I think it's clear that your sources cannot be believed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's look at just one of the links I've been hammering:
       <a href="http://ameg.me/">
        Arctic Methane Emergency Group
       </a>
       . Let's look at the name of that group of respected scientists that started that
       <strong>
        Arctic Methane Emergency Group
       </strong>
       . Notice, they didn't decided to officially call their group the "Arctic Methane
       <em>
        Inconvenience
       </em>
       Group". Nor did they call it the "Arctic Methane
       <em>
        Study
       </em>
       Group". No, this group of respected scientists put their hard-won professional reputations on the line to form a group called the Arctic Methane
       <strong>
        Emergency
       </strong>
       Group.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, to believe your side's money-tainted opinion--the whole thing is a big nothing myth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, I gather that you just barked out the word "Yes!" but
       <em>
        unfortunately for you
       </em>
       , most Americans are really convinced that AGW exists and is human caused, by our use of fossil fuels. Most Americans are just about to hate and despise the entire oil industry--even more than they did when it was pushing that ridiculous, Ogalalla-aquifer-endangering Keystone XL that President Obama slapped away, or when BP was spewing millions and millions of barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico, leaving oil dispersed on the bottom of that body of ocean in a way that it will burp up for thousands of years.

       If everything is hunky dory in the Arctic, why do you think they named it the "Arctic Methane
       <strong>
        Emergency
       </strong>
       Group"? You think it's just a big joke?
      </p>
      <p>
       If we're talking the financial interests behind the two polar opposites--let's consider who is better funded--Kochs, ExxonMobile, Chevron on the carbon side and on the green side who are the big pockets? Soros? Who stands to make a lot of money if climate change is a real problem that we have to deal with?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, you are hanging your entire side's truth on the hard fact--you allege--that the ENTIRE AGW thing is a hoax designed to allow PhD candidates to get grants? Or maybe Elon Musk with Solar City? Who else?
      </p>
      <p>
       I will grant you that the deniers side has done its work well. It has done the easy job of convincing Americans to be cynical. The Gallup poll you linked to is worth counting only if you don't step back and consider that you have Rupert Murdock's Fox News ready and eager to feed misinformation to all the "low effort thinkers" who watch Fox and take it all as gospel.
       <strong>
        You
       </strong>
       know that Fox is full of shit--but they're all your side has. Your polls only merely confirm that the deniers have been successful in triggering the cynicism of Americans. But you know what is the most cynical person of all? A person who has been willfully misled--such as Exxon just recently admitted to having done, by funding all those denier groups that hoodwinked
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       . Eventually, the American public--and the world--will understand the deception that was orchestrated among the deniers. It's repellent and you will, one day, feel that you were led down the garden path by the denier community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I am not okay with a train carrying oil derailing. No, I hate that equally with your pipeline-fed tar sands. I want your Canadian tar sands to stay in the ground where it belongs. It costs 40% of the energy you extract just to mine and process it. Tar Sands oil is bad and should not be used.

       You apparently have no faith in the free market, the same one that would cause the consumer to prefer and choose green alternatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oil companies realized decades ago that they were selling a product that was dangerous to the environment--we have hard evidence of that now in the form of the Exxon documents that were released.
      </p>
      <p>
       You WANT to think this is not the same thing as Tobacco but, sorry to inform you, we know from the research done for the book: "Merchants of Doubt" that not only are the same techniques being used to deny Climate change that were used to deny the dangers of tobacco smoke--but the EXACT SAME handful of people worked on both campaigns!
      </p>
      <p>
       It's stunning. You have enabled the same people who manipulated the US population on Tobacco to hoodwink you AGAIN by convincing you that the whole Climate Change thing is fake. The deniers--The George C. Marshall institute and similar groups--have fooled you. You will one day realize it and I hope you're realize that one day.

       Are you capable of counting? One, two, three; all that jazz? Are you aware of the definitions of the words “up” and “down”? That’s literally all you need to comprehend the data collected on this topic. It is literally no more complex than an ability to know which way up and down are with regard to numbers.

       Either look at the actual temperature data and have a real rebuttal to my links or you’d better buy a gun and a single bullet for when your cognitive dissonance forces you to end it all (since the world won’t be doing it for you).

        Millions die from pollution in China alone.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       climate change was pushed after pollution was deemed too nebulous to act on.   The stakes were seen to fit the agenda for alarmism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effort to control the agenda started with money but now the pro-sovereignty crowds have been stimulated into siding with the climate change deniers.    Very interesting and slightly amusing.   Also cringe-worthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its akin to the environmental movement turning pro-nuclear power.   Even to the point of embracing the efforts to claim that the damaging effects of Chernobyl and Fukushima were being blown out of proportion and supporting the reactivation of nuclear plants in Japan,   and condemning the closure of nuclear plants in Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
       Information and misinformation are truly the new battlegrounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       My takeaway is that each issue has to be investigated without reliance on the franchise of the media channel we heard it from.    The story being broken is the hero,    not the messenger.    Too many messengers have let a little bit of notoriety go to their heads,   and are distracted by their attempts to profit by the status that their message could afford them.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words,  we need to ask questions faster than the media channels can decide for us what the real issues are.    Right now,   the climate change deniers are fixated on the problems of correlating climate change with human industrial activity.    Millions dying from pollution are not of concern to them,  evidently.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can all be distracted by a Judy Wood from time to time.    That doesn't mean that Richard Gage is perfect either.    But the real stories stand the test of time.    And the lies do end up getting exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the long run,   those who do not come clean on their mistakes are shown to be self-promoters more than they were committed to the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the long run,   the statistical correlations of human activity with climate interference will prevail.    What other natural event on the planet was the equivalent of man's consumption of fossil fuels over the last 100 years?   Merely by volume of impact of the mined and burned (vaporized into the atmosphere) of coal,  natural gas,  and crude oil?    How much is just 80 million barrels of oil a day?   That would be 19,000 normal sized supertanker loads a year for global demand.    Every year.    If you can't imagine this  having an effect on the greenhouse effect,   I would call that make believe.
       <a href="http://gadgetopia.com/post/6118">
        http://gadgetopia.com/post/6118
       </a>
       And remember,  that does not include mountains of coal every year,   or the deforestation of Indonesia or the Amazon.
      </p>
      <p>
       It reminds me of the dismissal of the Gulf oil spill a few years back,   the dismissal of the toxic effects of the dispersants (corexit) that were sprayed in the Gulf.     The deal is that the media can suppress the news of the impacts to life,   and that other news events eventually drown out the chatter.

       Only this time,   we are rolling much bigger dice.

       The ACC theory does not propose that humanity will be wiped out, but rather that our current mode of existence will become impossible to maintain. Crops will fail, extreme weather will disrupt economies, mass migration will cause political and social instability etc. etc. Just because CO2 makes up a small fraction of the atmospheric content does not mean its effects are necessarily equally minor. Salt is also essential to life yet too much will sterilize most things, this is not a valid argument against ACC.

       We know it happens, our economy depends on fuel, the lives of thousands of people that are directly related to the fuel industry will be devastated if we fix it. That's why new investors are pointing to other sources of energy. We are moving there but one generation at a time, hoping the sons and grandchildren of the big oilers point somewhere else.

       Its not CO2, pollution among other chemicals leaves CO. CO is known as carbon monoxide one of the reasons that firefighters wear a breathing apparatus for instance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Carbon dioxide, known as CO2, is part of the oxygen and carbon dioxide cycle. Lifeforms other than plants, on land, breathe oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. Plants breathe carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is any dispute it could be what chemicals are not good for the atmosphere as well as what terms to apply to such a topic. As far as a conspiracy is concerned maybe, eco-fascism? Not fundamentally a "false flag" maybe an attempt to hijack the good cause of protecting the environment, the planet and so forth.

       Before it was CFC and hydrocarbons that were at the centre of the environment particularly the ozone layers. The ozone layers were hot topics in the 1980s and the 1990s.

       There are right-wing groups [ExxonMobile, Chevron, Koch Brothers] that fund an army of think tanks, dedicated to the idea that any regulation is a bad regulation, and they pay armies of paid commenters to flood any issue that attacks fossil fuels.

      <p>
       Just last November 23, 2015, the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science (PNAS) published an extensive report that confirms in detail that ExxonMobile and the Koch Brothers funded allegedly independent groups dedicated to spreading climate denial disinformation. Here is the report:

         Ideological polarization around environmental issues—especially
climate change—have increased in the last 20 years. 
This polarization has led to public uncertainty, and in some cases,
policy stalemate. Much attention has been given to understanding
individual attitudes, but much less to the larger organizational 
and financial roots of polarization. This gap is due to prior
difficulties in gathering and analyzing quantitative data about 
these complex and furtive processes. This paper uses
comprehensive text and network data to show how corporate
funding influences the production and actual thematic content
of polarization efforts. It highlights the important influence of
private funding in public knowledge and politics, and provides
researchers a methodological model for future studies that blend
large-scale textual discourse with social networks

         Abstract
        </strong>
        <em>
         Drawing on large-scale computational data and methods, 
this research demonstrates how polarization efforts are influenced
by a patterned network of political and financial actors. 
These dynamics, which have been notoriously difficult to quantify,
are illustrated here with a computational analysis of climate change
politics in the United States. The comprehensive data include all
individual and organizational actors in the climate change
countermovement (164 organizations), as well as all written and
verbal texts produced by this network between 1993–2013 
(40,785 texts, more than 39 million words). Two main findings
emerge. First, that organizations with corporate funding were 
more likely to have written and disseminated texts meant to
polarize the climate change issue. Second, and more importantly,
that corporate funding influences the actual thematic content of
these polarization efforts, and the discursive prevalence of that
thematic content over time. These findings provide new, and
comprehensive, confirmation of dynamics long thought to be at the
root of climate change politics and discourse. Beyond the specifics
of climate change, this paper has important implications for
understanding ideological polarization more generally, and the
increasing role of private funding in determining why certain
polarizing themes are created and amplified. Lastly, the paper
suggests that future studies build on the novel approach taken 
here that integrates large-scale textual analysis with social
networks

       Thank you for doing your part to motivate my side. With every outrageous comment people like you make on your side, you further outrage people on my side, and further motivate us to mobilize and come after liars like ExxonMobile and the Koch Brothers. They can pull off their flimflam denial for only so long.

       I have no doubt that you personally--eventually--will throw all this aside and say out loud: "I was wrong. This is real and we need to do everything we can to stop it." But by then, given the way CO2 has a ten year head start on us, it will be too late.

        I reviewed all 53 of the papers referenced by Exxon’s spokesman, and they indeed consist of high-quality scientific research. Most of them implicitly or explicitly endorsed the expert consensus on human-caused global warming; none minimized or rejected it. This means that there is a 100% consensus on human-caused global warming among Exxon’s peer-reviewed climate science research – even higher than the 97% consensus in the rest of the peer-reviewed literature.

       Good old Rockefeller has his scientists pumping out papers in support of the exact agenda which coincides with the beliefs espoused by the family for a century.

       What a coincidence? Oh, but even better, they are the same guys who are the "big bad wolf". Amazing. They are simultaneously the supporters and opposers. That is referred to as co-opting a debate. It is the same thing the CFR does, but in regards to military spending. What is the CFR? Just a Rockefeller think tank. Imagine that, the same tactics used by the same people promoting the same agenda.

       Must be some accident. Oh wait, your agenda has them as the bad guys, the guys willfully leading us to Armageddon. You take that for granted. But, obviously this group that managed to infiltrate each realm of American, and international, influence and is prepared to cause "the end of humanity" isn't cunning or devious enough to fund both sides of the debate? They are willing to destroy humanity for profit, but they aren't willing to use their money and influence to further their agenda by representing both sides?

       Exxon in
       <strong>
        public
       </strong>
       may have funded studies that agree with the commonly understood fact that humans are causing climate change that is detrimental to human life on this planet.

       Exxon in
       <strong>
        private
       </strong>
       funds disinformation campaigns.
      </p>
      <p>
       You assert this allegedly divided or balanced loyalty--on the one hand funding science that agrees with AGW and on the other funding think tanks that fund AGW denial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, this is beyond mere debate--actions have been taken based on these viewpoints.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the perspective of defending their investments, of course Exxon had to do solid science on GW.
      </p>
      <p>
       But their efforts to fund AGW denial was much more effective and public and it backed their business model. What they did caused the oil to flow unimpeded. I will let you decide if their efforts, CFR be damned, alleged Rockefeller involvement be damned, resulting in the oil stopping. It did not. Their allegedly balanced efforts are biased toward oil flowing.

       I insist that they are 100% in support of Global Warming, as they have publicly stated. It asserts the very positions that the Rockefeller foundation engaged in since it's beginnings, and at the same time that these papers were published and the think tanks funded, Rockefellers were major shareholders in the major oil company that their family established.

      <p>
       CFR be damned? The secretary of state and wannabe president gets her marching orders from the CFR.

       What you have in your theory is just smoke and mirrors. Smoke and mirrors put in place by the very "boogeyman" of your nightmare. If big oil is to blame, then quite simply the Rockefellers are to blame.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your boogeyman is just smart enough to be both the guy you hate and the guy teaching you why to hate him. You are the victim of a swindle ignoring all observations contrary to your story. And the guy that did it, is the guy that is going to get the impetus from your hate, from you being swindled by him.

Is it not obvious once the politicians start wanting to imprison scientists that dissent, alarmists have to call dissenters "deniers" comparing them to Holocaust deniers, regular reports on massive fraud in the alarmist community and epidemic temperature manipulation, and demagoguery like the world has never seen? Obama makes Chicken Little seem like a denier. Are you really naive enough that you believe a politician, that is a serial liar, when he tells you HE can stop climate change(that has been occuring for billions of years) if you give him all of your money so he can give it to someone else, destroy the economy, and end up killing tens of millions of 3rd world poor?

       CO2 is not a poison for Christ's sake! It is essential to life on earth and the more of it the better as it greens the earth allowing us to grow more food. Why don't you bother watching some anti-climate change videos on YouTube for the science that easily discredits every single alarmist claim. Not that they need the help as their own predictions discredit themselves. How many times can they be 100% incorrect and you still believe what they say?

       Dissenters get called "deniers" because that is exactly what they are. They are denying the existence of man made climate change and often using unsupported conspiracy theories to do it. No one is bringing up holocaust denial except the deniers themselves. If accurate descriptions of their position offend them, that's their problem and no one else's.
      </p>
      <p>
       The temperature manipulation conspiracy theories are not true and often based on what are actually legitimate scientific practices (e.g. data is adjusted if monitoring stations are moved or changed).

       The "climate change is fake" conspiracy theories are some of the most ridiculous theories around today.

       The data adjustment concern is more rigorous then that.  Scientists have audited NASA and found in many cases no justification for the adjustments.  Just because NASA lies and manipulates the data and then says "no trust us we had a good reason" is not really a slam dunk case on the matter.  You should look into this issue more thoroughly and not just borne official lies.

       The problem with your point? Global climate change is backed up by dozens of different ways of measuring. It's not just your allegedly-problematic land measuring stations. Every other measure is showing the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, for what you are saying to be true, there would have to be an ongoing conspiracy among THOUSANDS of climate scientists--and then if only ONE revealed evidence of such a conspiracy--it would be a bombshell. That has not happened, nor have Climate Scientists been dying of unexplained suicides or accidents.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only problem? If you're wrong--human life is exterminated on this planet.

       First, most sincere climate scientist do not claim that human life will be exterminated.  That's a totally unsubstantiated view.  The concern is more over severe disruptions that could cause famine and maybe some coastal flooding.  Which, admittedly, is theoretically capable of displacing hundreds of millions of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, no, the other climate records do not agree with the "hottest month on record".  The satellite data shows cooling, and historic ice cores show hotter global temperatures in the recent past etc etc

      <p>
       It's not a conspiracy.  It's politics and hierarchy.  What's your take on Judith Curry?  A shill?  Anyone who comes out against alarmism is called a shill and a sell-out and loses their job.  It's not a conspiracy, because it's not being done in secret.  It's just massive group think.

      <p>
       What I described about scientific studies was saying that people trust the CRU or GISS data because their professional environment tells them to. And if they raise questions, they get ostracized.  In fact one of the biggest smoking guns of climategate was how prevalent this sort of protectionism was where they strategize do how to discredit intellectual foes, and get only peer reviewers on their side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look academia is screwed up.  It's economics sucks and is wrecking the world.  It's history and politics favor terrible killer tyrant leaders.  It's crap.  There's very little accountability in the academic system, because it's so hierarchical and compartmentalized.

       When only CO2 is considered, most climate scientists push the harshest effects of warming out to 2050-2100. The IPCC really does not consider Methane. Recall, the Arctic sea floor and all that Siberian permafrost holds gigatons of Methane hydrates. Once the CO2 warming has happened sufficiently to melt the Arctic sea ice cover, the Methane hydrates start to melt quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a question of sincerity--it's science. I invite you to start googling for scientific journals that consider the warming triggered by those big belches of Methane-hydrate gas that have already started bubbling up, including a 150km-wide hole in the Arctic ice that was suggested to be Methane bubbles.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that each individual academic would be biased to accept the data coming from their particular set of sensors. But that does
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       explain why the same warming is being replicated from
       <em>
        every single other method
       </em>
       of measurement.

       On the subject of the methane warming, I will simply ask you to spend an hour viewing these and then telling me where I've misread them. The number of
       <strong>
        2030 for total human extinction
       </strong>
       comes not from me but from this research. Once you consider Methane, 2030 looks all the more plausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that there are perverse microcosms in academia, where anything is possible. But that does not explain the vast numbers of datasets that are all agreeing on the warming and its cause. For this to actually be a hoax or academics looking to start gravy trains--it would have to include 100% of the world's academics.

      <p>
       As for
       <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/curry-ohc-corrections.html">
        Judith Curry
       </a>
       , she predicates her views on the existence of the alleged warming "pause" which has been shown to be fictional. Scientific American, a trusted source of information for over two-hundred years, stated that the "pause" did not happen:
       <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/no-pause-in-global-warming/">
        No Pause in Global Warming: A new study suggests that global warming continues to steadily increase
       </a>
       . So, without the fictional "pause", Judith Curry's claims cease to exist. What you are seeing in the case of Judith Curry is the academic system weeding out a scientist more interested in a pushing a political agenda than in doing objective research and science.

       The pause did happen, and it took ten years of hit and miss theories and manipulating surface temperature data to rationalize the facts of the pause away.  Have you read the critique of that blatantly shallow study?  Judith Curry doesn't seem to have many incentives to be political.  Her claim to want to just pursue the evidence rigorously seems valid, since alarmists tend to immediately accept any half-baked study or explanation to support their viewpoint.  So, your attitude seems to confirm that it's the academic community that's broken, not Judith Curry.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for methane, I have trouble believing that.  Hasn't the ice melted before?  That implies we used to have all that has in the atmosphere. Life was around back then wasn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       And if 2030 is when we'll die, what could we possibly do to stop it today?  How can we possibly stop that train short of self-suicide ahead of time, if that would even stop it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're buying into the hype.  Consider this: global warming a not a big deal.  We're in an interglacial period of an ice age.  It will continue to get warmer for a few centuries and then we'll transition back into a terrible ice age.  At least, human release of carbon back into the atmosphere favors plant growth since the ice age has left atmospheric carbon levels dangerously low.  Therefore, we should relax, and focus on long term social and technological changes.  Tech that will come to fruition in two or three centuries, to socks our long term energy needs.  Fossil fuels will last at least that long, though the cost will go up as more advanced extraction technology is needed to get harder to access but still fairly uniquitous oil.

       is dishonest or incompetent? Which is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       No, the methane did not come from the atmosphere. In the case of permafrost, the vast quantities that come from its melting come from millennia of frozen plant material that finally all rots once its melted. So, you have demonstrated you don't understand the science behind Methane.
      </p>
      <p>
       You offer a theory "interglacial period". If we on the AGW side were to propose such a theory, your side would instantly clamor for proof or some theory that fits and explains the data. Do you have any such data or foundation for this theory of yours?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you are being fooled if you think this climate change is not a problem. Allowing CO2 to reach its current 400+ppm creates conditions that humans have never before seen. It unleashes dozens of positive feedback loops that make it so runaway climate change happens quickly and then it will take 10 million years for conditions to again become conducive to life.

       So I had trouble replying because it turns out that the study was in Science, and Scientific American just wrote about it.  It's late here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, this study is dishonest and incompetent.  The pause is real and alarmist have spent 10 years trying to explain it.  They assume warming must be real, and when it doesn't happen they assume there must be 'missing heat' somewhere.  Each explanation doesn't pan out, so they come up with new ones.  This one attempt, from June cheats by adjusting historical data in the arctic
       <em>
        for which no data exists
       </em>
       .  Basically, they're saying "we can't find the warming, so it must be in a place we don't measure, because we
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       there's warming even though the data doesn't support it".  Again, lefties and climate alarmists have a habit of talking about how empirical and fact based they are, but they trump up one or two data points as incontrovertible final proof of their beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       For a brief overview.  Basically, what's going on in climate science is that warming is treated as an a priori reality.  And so when warming doesn't exist it's treated as an excuse to "improve science" by looking for the warming wherever it
       <em>
        might possibly
       </em>
       exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even neutral sources say that the Science study suggests more data is needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Methane is the new bogeyman because the CO2 case has collapsed so strongly, in the science at least.

       jesus what a joke.  "Not worth clicking on", because they consistently oppose the alaist narrative?  That's fairly Orwellian.  The article was written by scientists - gasp one was Richard Lindzen (just a corporate shill right).  They make substantive claims about the study's flaws.  Confront them, or live in your bubble of approved channels of information.

       That list of lies is not very substantive.  It's just a list of things he said with "I know you are but what am I" narrative signaling retorts.  I hate to say it, but you realize this is trumped up.  They made substantive critiques of the Science report.  This is ignored.  Instead, half-baked allegations and character assassinations.  Judith Curry went through the same thing.  I'm sorry, but again it seems
The curse of academia is present in your perspective.  There's a desperate effort to promote narrative conformity, and argue truth from the measuring stick of what conforms or not to the narrative.  But the substance is ignored.
      </p>

       There has been a very noticeable pause in temperature rise.  This has been acknowledged.  They said the oceans ate the heat energy.  That was discredited. This was acknowledged.  They said surface temperature showed warming.  This was discredited by a careful audit of the way station data was manipulated and adjusted.  This was, while not acknowledged, tacitly conceded, because now they are finding warming in the arctic, a region notoriously impossible to get reliable data from (since the surface is generally ice, it remains consistently cool despite global variability, meaning you can 'adjust' the data however you choose).  Sorry, this isn't credible science.  And "oil shills" like Watts have provoked alarmist scientists to
       <em>
        admit
       </em>
       their half-baked rationalizations about the pause are a joke.  Which is exactly why they keep looking in more and more obscure places for the warming.  The goal is to generate a headline: "pause is disproven, there's no pause".  Which is meant to settle the matter in the public mind, when in fact climate scientists are still studying "why" there's a pause, which there obviously is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read an article about sinking atolls in the pacific.  It said coral growth, shifting sand and "rising sea levels from climate change" are why the atolls are sinking.  While climate alarmism predicts eventual sea level rise in the near future, there hasn't been any observed sea level rise other than what has been the trend for many hundreds of years, in other words, not yet.  But media can get away with blaming sinking islands in the present on climate change.  Because that's the environment, the anti-intellectual anti-science anti-evidence environment the alarmists have created.  The island sinks because of climate change, because the government said so.  Why does the government think this - why, it's the party line: global warming
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       causing extraordinary sea level rise
       <em>
        today
       </em>
       .  Not because of facts, but because that is the government line which harmonizes with the hypotheses, not evidence, of lousy climate scientists.

       Sorry, without sources that I can verify--none of your statements has the slightest effect and I wonder what you hoped to accomplish in making a bunch of unsubstantiated assertions.

      <p>
       In any case, do you dispute that 2015 has been already seen as the warmest year on record?

       Here's the real question: what evidence would it take for you to change your mind?

       So, other than your blanket, ideological objection to regulation in principle--do you have some insights on why you do not accept the SCIENCE?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I gather that you do not trust President Obama. That is your right.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that DOES NOT explain how and why every other country on earth also accepts the SCIENCE behind human-caused global warming--how do you explain that? Also, this problem had been recognized years before President Obama was elected.

      <p>
       No one is saying that CO2 is a poison.

       How about addressing the facts in the article instead of attempting to impugn the credibility of the publication. Or do you not realize that by ignoring the arguments in favor of name calling you actually prove the facts in the article are correct?
      </p>

       Nah, you are a typical intolerant Progressive that cannot bear to see or hear any differing perspective without enduring massive psychological damage. You cannot even bear to read scientific data that does not enforce your confirmation bias. So you are correct. I don't know why I bother. People like you, those that worship at the alter of the all powerful, iron-fisted tyrannical bureaucracy, are a lost cause. You despise liberty so much you cannot see even the most obvious political agenda being perpetrated upon you. Your refusal to think for yourself makes it too easy for your corrupt overlords to manipulate you. It is sad really. A hundred years from now when these insane energy policies have killed off 3 billion of the world's poor and the climate impact from man ends up being negligible, AS THE IPCC SAYS IT WILL BE, people like you will be hauled before an international criminal court to answer for the genocide and your answer will be, "we were just following orders". History repeating itself over and over.

When one starts their analysis on an extraordinarily warm year, the resulting trend is below the true long term trend. It’s like a pro baseball player deciding he’s having a batting slump three weeks after a game when he hit three homers because he’s only considering those three weeks instead of the whole season.

        Why did climate cool in the mid-20th Century?
       </a>
       This is an area of intense research. Two points have been made that may have relevance. Starting in 1940, industrial output surged--first for the war and then for the rapid industrialization. Because of lax pollution controls at the time, significant aerosol particulates were released into the air, thereby decreasing solar radiation that reached the planet surface. Ironically, once the 1970s pollution-control measures went into effect the aerosols decreased and so did the cooling effect of those aerosols. Also, starting in 1945, the method used to calculate ocean temperature changed significantly. Finally, following the observation that nighttime temperatures would not be affected by aerosols, when they looked at that, the discrepancy went away.

The theory of greenhouse gases predicts that if we increase the proportion of greenhouse gases, more warming will occur (Arrhenius). Scientists have measured the influence of CO2 on both incoming solar energy and outgoing long-wave radiation. Less longwave radiation is escaping to space at the specific wavelengths of greenhouse gases. Increased longwave radiation is measured at the surface of the Earth at the same wavelengths.

       Thank you for attempting to refute the ten points in the article that you claim are all dishonest. I know you think there are NO scientists that study the climate that do not 100% agree we are all going to fry and fry soon. Hopefully, you will research this point a little to see that is not the case. Once you do, you will realize that these scientists, all extremely persecuted for their beliefs as if they were flat earthers, are all liars according to your beliefs.

       Before global cooling became global warming and before global warming became climate change, a catch all that cannot be disproven as it can be blamed for all occurrences, the arguments for were much more simple. They didn't have to be "nuanced". I read your rebuttals, all of which I have read before since I read the other side's arguments, and what I see is massive confirmation bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time a major flaw is pointed out in the theory, the data gets adjusted, the data set gets moved forward or back in time, or some new incredibly nuanced explanation is literally pulled out of someone's ass like NOW the oceans are absorbing the heat or war causes global cooling. It is like the little boy running around sticking his finger in the holes in the dike. There is always a more nuanced and complicated explanation which if anything, seems to me to be the definition of confirmation bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not take it back the basics and use just plain old common sense? It is a well known fact that the climate models include  hundreds of assertions and variables, many that represent areas of science that have yet to be fully understood. These UNKNOWN variables have resulted in the multitude of times the climate model predictions over the last three to four decades have not only missed the mark, but not even come close to observable data.
      </p>
      <p>
       I totally get the desire to use "clean" energy so our air, water and earth remain clean for future generations. I believe technology will get us there eventually. I, like most conservatives and libertarians, care for the earth as much as leftists do. However, unlike leftists, I care more about humans than the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason it seems so obvious to me global warming is a giant scam, other than the demagoguery and wealth redistribution, is because it fits so perfectly with the leftist's anti-growth agenda which has been around a long time.  Be it eugenics or population control or now climate change, they all have the same anti-growth, anti-human, elitist totalitarian agenda that guarantees the death of tens if not hundreds of millions of poor on earth. It seems obvious to me that these elitists have co-opted climate science and made it into the perfect vehicle for their anti-growth agenda. After all, now it cannot be disproven, there is always a more nuanced explanation for holes in the science, 90% of it is pure speculation, and if you dissent some politicians want you arrested.

       There was only ONE study in the 1970s that predicted cooling and yet that one is trotted out as if it equates to the hundreds since then with an opposite conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I am just not willing to accept that there is a worldwide conspiracy to hoax this. Surely, as you suggested, there are scientists who dissent from the currently accepted situation--AGW. But to say that the rest are lying to make a buck--it would have to be huge numbers--I am not willing to consider.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are looking for nuance-free data, you're going to be disappointed. For example, on the satellite measurements, it's critical to have the measurements occur at precise 24-hour intervals. That does not happen because the orbit of the satellite is decaying. So, that has to be considered as a justifiable reason to account for that when interpreting the data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line: you think the scientists are lying.
I think the scientists are reporting accurate, truthful data to the best of their abilities.

       I think that cooling study is used so often because the press ran it on the cover a magazine, Newsweek maybe. I had not heard of the satellite temp data being questioned before. Every where I have seen it mentioned it is presented as the most reliable from a technical perspective. That probably says more about the ground station temp issues than anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       You summed it up rather well I think. I certainly do not think we are going anywhere any time soon and I think it is ridiculous to think we can destroy our planet with CO2 emissions in the span of a couple hundred of years. We could certainly pollute the planet but that is an entire other issue and something we have already moved past in America.

       I just feel for the poor people in the developing world who will be prohibited from getting electricity so they must continue to breath in ash and animal dung particulates to cook to survive. Is it not the height of elitist arrogance to say to these people, "because we have a theory with hundreds of unknown variables in a model that tells us we MAY have run away temperatures in a thousand years, you have to remain destitute and die young."? Where is the compassion?

       This article is horribly written and actually proves the point it tries to contradict. Just look at all the ambiguous terms and clarifying words used, no facts. In fact, the reasons they use to try to discredit, not disprove, the warming hiatus, are contradicted by the facts in the article I first posted. You know, the one with the scientific facts you "chose" not to believe. Or did you even read the article?
      </p>
      <p>
       The simple fact is that the data had to be manipulated to reverse an obvious cooling period and every scientist or scientific publication that attempts to discredit the raw data REFUSES to use the most reliable and consistent temperature source, the satellite data. Why is that?
      </p>
      <p>
       The graph they even use proves without a shadow of a doubt that the entire CO2 causing warming theory is bullshit. It clearly shows a dramatic decrease in temperatures from 1940-1980. The Vostok ice core data also backs this up. Can you bear the obvious scientific question? How do temperatures decrease for 40 years while CO2 levels are exponentially increasing if increasing CO2 is the direct cause of increasing temperature????
      </p>
      <p>
       Mull that simple question over for a few days and then reevaluate why you allow your political ideology to bar your ability to think critically. Try researching this question your self and see how the supposedly unbiased "scientists" twist themselves into a pretzel trying to explain away this glaring evidence that their theory is utter bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, have you ever heard of the logical fallacy of "confirmation bias"? If it’s cold, it’s climate change. If it’s warm, it’s climate change. If there are big hurricanes, it’s climate change. If there are no hurricanes, it’s climate change. If Antarctic ice is receding, it’s climate change. If Antarctic ice is growing, it’s climate change. Everything and anything confirms climate change, apparently. If that’s not confirmation bias, I don’t know what is. Under the umbrella of confirmation bias is cherry-picking (where only favorable data is emphasized), special pleading (where unfavorable data is suppressed), and the anecdotal fallacy (where someone’s personal experience—like, “Hey, it’s warmer than usual today. Global warming”—is used as evidence for a conclusion).
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the most important things to remember about confirmation bias is that you don’t have to be an idiot to fall prey to it. Leo Tolstoy seemed to think that smart people were more susceptible to it, actually, because they had usually done more work to arrive at their wrong conclusions and therefore had more to lose if they changed their minds. Tolstoy said,
      </p>
      <p>
       "I know that most men—not only those considered clever, but even those who are very clever, and capable of understanding most difficult scientific, mathematical, or philosophic problems—can very seldom discern even the simplest and most obvious truth if it be such as to oblige them to admit the falsity of conclusions they have formed, perhaps with much difficulty—conclusions of which they are proud, which they have taught to others, and on which they have built their lives."
      </p>
      <p>
       That about sums up the situation with many climate scientists and all climate change alarmists.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the Scientific American, you are not making an argument. On the contrary, you are making a logical fallacy called "appealing to authority". Apparently, “scientists” agree that climate change is true. And most politicians too. The only people who won’t accept it are the ignorant selfish anti-science backwater gun-cradling yahoos from the sticks. I get it. A lot of smart people have bought into anthropogenic climate change theory. I won’t call them stupid for doing it. It’s often the smart thing to do. If you’re a Democrat or a climate scientist, you would be an idiot to publicly deny climate change. Because you’d lose your job.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is that most people on both sides of the climate change debate have picked a side for political, not scientific, reasons. Maybe you’re a Republican, and you want to appeal to your voter base and your friends in Big Oil. Well, you need to deny climate change. If you’re a Democrat and you want to appeal to the Prius drivers and stick it to the greedy capitalists, you need to confirm climate change. The difference is that climate change deniers generally can’t appeal to authority. So they’re safe from at least that fallacy. It’s the climate change alarmists who are constantly talking about the scientific and scholarly consensus when, at least logically speaking, it doesn’t matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all, climate change alarmism has become a clinic in logical fallacies. Actually, you can pretty much close your eyes, open a book on logical fallacies, and put your finger down at random to find another problem with climate change logic. I’ve merely scratched the surface here. Try thinking for your self.

       Please see my other, detailed analysis of the article you sent. It was extremely easy to shoot down most of those points because there is an active scientific community around this issue that is tired of having people cherry pick and manipulate the data so that they can go on burning fossil fuels with abandon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having a great familiarity with Tolstoy myself, I know that he would point out that the quote can easily be turned against a group of individuals--with invariably an unmentioned conflict of interest with regards to the fossil-fuels industry--who
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to believe that climate science is a hoax. All of your comments regarding logical fallacies can easily be applied to
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       . Funny you don't see the irony in all that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, sir, short of opening my own lab and having you standing there performing experiments with me--neither of us has any choice but to accept the construct of our civilization and accept that our scientists as a collective will be honest, and that any wrongs there will be found out by rigorous application of the scientific method.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the example of Scientific American. You are, in essence, saying they published lies. If that happened--if someone could
       <strong>
        prove
       </strong>
       , not just make potshots from the peanut gallery, that Scientific American had committed fraud, don't you think it would be on Fox News? It's not, because you're living in a fantasy land where every scientist on earth is keeping some hush-hush secret that everybody is in on, and that every scientist working on this on earth is quietly changing the data to create a problem out of thin air. Really? Do you really think that's possible, that NOT ONE disgruntled climate scientist researcher has come forward to stay there's this big communal lie?

       I do see the double edged nature of confirmation bias. But I also am a student of history and have studied political wealth redistribution scams like this perpetrated on peoples many times before. Why this time is different, even when the leaders of this movement admitted many years ago that it was a wealth redistribution scam, and now have proven as much in the Paris accord, I do not understand. To further prove my point here is an anti-alarmist article from, guess who.....the Scientific American!
       <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-will-not-be-dangerous-for-a-long-time/">

       Is it really that crazy of an idea that an industry can be created out of whole cloth (climate science) and the people that enter this industry have a bias to support their receiving a portion of the now tens of BILLIONS of tax payer's dollars politicians have shifted from traditional energy sources to this now "favored" energy source? Do you not see money as a corrupting influence on "scientists"? Why is it that when an oil company funds a dissenting view it is discredited but when politicians fund the favoring view that is OK? Where is the logic in that? Why is it that all government employees, including the scientists, are forced to sign massive non-disclosure agreements and when they try to whistle blow under the supposed lawful protection of whistle blower laws they are attacked and persecuted by the government like they are terrorists?
      </p>
      <p>
       It really is not difficult to find scientists, and yes, even climate scientists and other scientific disciplines that study the effects of climate change, that dissent from the narrative. It is VERY EASY to find scientists that disagree with the climate alarmism you hear Obama, Clinton and Kerry spouting all the time, that the world is going to end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a recent report on dissenting views:

      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an article summarizing it:
       <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2015/07/31/new-study-majority-of-climate-scientists-dont-agree-with-consensus/">
        http://www.breitbart.com/london/2015/07/31/new-study-majority-of-climate-scientists-dont-agree-with-consensus/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The 97% consensus that so many lay people bought hook line and sinker, including you, was discredited long ago. This is why you only hear politicians, professional liars, still spouting this lie.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the IPCC report states they do not know to what degree man is causing the climate to change. It could be 100% like Obama would have you believe or it could be 1%. Is that fact not substantive?
      </p>
      <p>
       The IPCC report also admits there is no correlation between CO2 emissions and dramatic weather events like hurricanes, tornadoes, etc. Yet, the Democratic politicians scream exactly the opposite. Why are you OK with them lying about that major point but believe everything else they say?

       You are saying that ALL the world's Climate Scientists, thousands and thousands--not just your oddball crank physicists Singer and Seitz--would have to be actively lying, continuing to lie every day. For what you are saying to be true, NOT ONE climate scientist could break their silence. There are no examples of scientists claiming to be part of such a conspiracy. The whistle-blower prizes alone would be huge. If there were ANY SUCH conspiracy, somebody would step forward. Or, worst case scenario, we would see Climate Scientists involved in dubious suicides. Yet, none of that is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your allegation--that the Green Movement is doing this all for the money, your alleged "HUGE economic incentives", only stands if NOBODY gives up the gag.

       And really--not everybody is like you Conservatives. Not everybody is about greed, as you folks are.

       The conspiracy theory is that many thousands of scientists from many different countries and many different institutions over the course of several decades at least have somehow created a scientific hoax (which in reality would be impossible to pull off), but luckily a brave heroic band of politicians and oil companies have seen the "truth".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's one of many conspiracy theories which simply cannot be true because organising something on that scale involving that many people would not be anywhere near possible. It would be impossible to organise it within one country, let alone almost the entire climate science community across the whole world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real conspiracy here is that fossil fuel companies and those with financial links to them have heavily funded various organisations and politicians promoting climate change denial over many years, because oil companies and the like don't want climate change action taken that would hurt their profits.

       No, the conspiracy is that two institutions known for political activism CRU and GISS have unjustifiably adjusted surface temp data and predictive models based on tree rings to suggest a rapidly warming world due to CO2 when all the rest of the data shows nothing if the sort.  Because of the political influence of the IPCC and the literally billions of dollars at stake in carbon credit trading (Wall Street) plus the massively draconian UN takeover of the world financial system to implement a solution (their wet dream), because of all these incentives, a lot of media and political institutions have favored the alarmist narrative.  More and more funding is going to alarmist studies.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if CRU says temps will rise X degrees in 100 years, 20 scientists all write papers on all the bad stuff that will happen.  And then, non-scientific institutions like the Pentagon or refugee groups use those papers to say that climate change will cause all sorts of problems. But none of that hysteria proves that the original CRU premise of X degrees in 100 years was at all valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alarmist case is very shaky when you peel back the layers.  And you notice that most discussion of the issue doesn't really confront the core claims.

       You are so naive. Are you seriously pointing to "Hurricane Patricia" as your basis for thinking the whole climate change is a hoax?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Climate Change calamity coming our way is not confirmed by just ONE method of temperature measurement. There are now dozens and dozens of different ways of measuring the climate, from satellite, to ground-level temp measuring stations--more every day. Every single one of these methods are pointing to the same thing: our climate is getting warm at an alarming rate. Why should you care? Because CO2 does its magic and then it releases Methane gas from the frozen Arctic sea floor, and from the vast Siberian permafrost. Methane is at least 30 times more severe as a greenhouse gas.
      </p>
      <p>
       This could--serious as a heart attack--kill all of us by 2030. I know that sound crazy.

        The rate of global warming during the last 15 years has been as fast as the warming seen during the last half of the 20th Century, according to new study published in Science this month by scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)

       <em>
        The new study used the latest global surface temperature data and other improvements in the quality of the observed record. This study refutes the notion that there has been a slowdown, hiatus, or Pause, in the rate of global warming in recent years. The Pause has been a rallying cry for those not wanting to accept climate change as real.

       That list of lies is not very substantive.  It's just a list of things he said with "I know you are but what am I" narrative signaling retorts.  I hate to say it, but you realize this is trumped up.  They made substantive critiques of the Science report.  This is ignored.  Instead, half-baked allegations and character assassinations.  Judith Curry went through the same thing.  I'm sorry, but again it seems
The curse of academia is present in your perspective.  There's a desperate effort to promote narrative conformity, and argue truth from the measuring stick of what conforms or not to the narrative.  But the substance is ignored.

       There has been a very noticeable pause in temperature rise.  This has been acknowledged.  They said the oceans ate the heat energy.  That was discredited. This was acknowledged.  They said surface temperature showed warming.  This was discredited by a careful audit of the way station data was manipulated and adjusted.  This was, while not acknowledged, tacitly conceded, because now they are finding warming in the arctic, a region notoriously impossible to get reliable data from (since the surface is generally ice, it remains consistently cool despite global variability, meaning you can 'adjust' the data however you choose).  Sorry, this isn't credible science.  And "oil shills" like Watts have provoked alarmist scientists to
       <em>
        admit
       </em>
       their half-baked rationalizations about the pause are a joke.  Which is exactly why they keep looking in more and more obscure places for the warming.  The goal is to generate a headline: "pause is disproven, there's no pause".  Which is meant to settle the matter in the public mind, when in fact climate scientists are still studying "why" there's a pause, which there obviously is.

       I read an article about sinking atolls in the pacific.  It said coral growth, shifting sand and "rising sea levels from climate change" are why the atolls are sinking.  While climate alarmism predicts eventual sea level rise in the near future, there hasn't been any observed sea level rise other than what has been the trend for many hundreds of years, in other words, not yet.  But media can get away with blaming sinking islands in the present on climate change.  Because that's the environment, the anti-intellectual anti-science anti-evidence environment the alarmists have created.  The island sinks because of climate change, because the government said so.  Why does the government think this - why, it's the party line: global warming
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       causing extraordinary sea level rise
       <em>
        today
       </em>
       .  Not because of facts, but because that is the government line which harmonizes with the hypotheses, not evidence, of lousy climate scientists.
