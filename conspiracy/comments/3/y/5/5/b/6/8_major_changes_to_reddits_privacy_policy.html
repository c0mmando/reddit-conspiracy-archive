<ul>
<li> &quot;Except as it relates to advertisers and our ad partners, we may share information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work for us&quot; (The lines are a bit blurred. Exactly what &quot;carry out work&quot; entails, I&#39;m not sure.)

<ul>
<li>You signed up to something promotional and the promoter wants to see the results/interests/information</li>
<li>A legal/governmental request has been made</li>
<li>In an emergency such as the risk of bodily harm to someone</li>
<li>You go against a policy/user agreement</li>
<li> Reddit personnel or those related to Reddit such as its partners/affiliates/etc want to see your information (and can)</li>
<li>A consensual sharing of your information (I&#39;m assuming through apps or another service)</li>
</ul></li>

<p>Edit: Google is one of their partners. I&#39;m not sure who else is but if Google has your information, Google&#39;s partners have your information.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I don’t care I don&#39;t have anything to hide</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’re a complete idiot.</p>

<p>This is a very dangerous mindset. The argument is frequently raised in debates by pro-big brother hawks, and doing so is dangerous, cowardly, and dishonest. There are at least four good reasons to reject this argument, solidly and uncompromisingly.</p>

<p><strong>The rules may change.</strong></p>

<p>Once the invasive surveillance is in place to enforce rules with which you agree, the ruleset that is being enforced could change in ways with which you don’t agree at all. But then it is too late to protest the surveillance. For example, you may agree to cameras in every home to prevent domestic violence (“and domestic violence only”), but the next day a new political force in power could decide that Christianity will be illegal and they will use the existing home cameras to enforce their new rules. Any surveillance must be regarded in terms of how it can be abused by a power worse than today’s. </p>

<p><strong>It’s not you who determine if you have something to fear.</strong></p>

<p>You may consider yourself law-abidingly white as snow, but that won’t matter. What does matter is whether you set off the red flags in the mostly automated surveillance. Where bureaucrats look at your life in microscopic detail through a long paper tube to search for patterns. When you stop your car at the main prostitution street for two hours every Friday night, the Social Services Authority will draw certain conclusions from that data point and won’t care about the fact that you help your elderly grandmother–who lives there–with her weekly groceries. When you frequently stop at a certain bar on your way driving home from work, the Department of Driving Licenses will draw certain conclusions as to your eligibility for future driving licenses–regardless of the fact that you think the bar serves the world’s best reindeer meatballs and have never had a single beer there. People will stop thinking in terms of what is legal and start acting in self-censorship to avoid being red-flagged out of pure self-preservation. It doesn’t matter that somebody in the right might possibly and eventually be cleared–after having been investigated for six months, you will have lost custody of your children, your job, and possibly your home.</p>

<p><strong>Laws must be broken for society to progress.</strong></p>

<p>A society which can enforce all of its laws will stop dead in its tracks. The mindset of ‘rounding up criminals is good for society’ is a very dangerous one, for in hindsight it may turn out that the criminals were the ones in the moral right. Barely over 200 years ago, if you promoted republican ideals, you were criminal. It is an absolute necessity to be able to break unjust laws for society to progress and question its own values, in order to learn from mistakes and move on as a society.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy is a basic human need.</strong></p>

<p>Implying that only the dishonest people have need of any privacy ignores a basic property of the human psyche and sends a creepy message of strong discomfort. We have a fundamental need for privacy. I lock the door when I go to the mens’ room, despite the fact that nothing secret happens in there. I just want to keep that activity to myself, I have a fundamental need to do so, and any society must respect that fundamental need for privacy. In every society that doesn’t, citizens have responded with subterfuge and created their own private areas out of reach of the governmental surveillance–not because they are criminal, but because doing so is a fundamental human need.</p>
