       I just spent a while searching for interviews with San Bernardino survivors. All of the results are three weeks old and none of them identify the accused as the shooters or even that they saw the shooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       The interviews shamelessly melange the witnesses' statements with the author's editorials to appear as if the witnesses are espousing the official account, when really, they don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shouldn't the wounded survivors have been invited as guests of honor at major sporting events, or gone on TV (or in front of congress) to peddle more (or fewer) firearm regulations, or spoken of the 'existential threat' of Islamic extremism, or interviewed simply to garner clicks and ratings guaranteed by gory details?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hey media! Some of us aren't convinced merely by FBI hearsay and an old photo of a stern looking lady in a burqa.

       As someone who lives less than an hour away from where that happened, I can say that most average people around here believe it was a terrorist plot.

       I personally find it highly unlikely that the gov't DIDN'T play a part in this event.

       I'm thinking best case scenario is an FBI entrapment sting gone awry, with these two under total surveillance the whole time and their handler/informant being concealed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Worst case, the couple were taken hostage in the parking lot and killed by trigger happy police while the real shooters (possibly Gladio) escaped.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not ruling out full on media fabrication with government complicity or vice verse but it's not too high on the list.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, including according to the official narrative, the security surveillance apparatus is proven to be a monumental waste of tax dollars.

       "I'm thinking best case scenario is an FBI entrapment sting gone awry". Agreed, considering there lavish history in such things.
      </p>
      <p>
       They may also have a 3rd suspect on the run and they are keeping tight lipped hoping he/she won't go far. Hence the utter blackout of the 3rd shooter which as far as I've watched on the news every eyewitness saw.

       Par for the course with open investigations.  The general rule is, when there's an open investigation into anything, those witnesses or survivors involved are effectively told (though not ordered...well not always) "Don't talk about this, as your actions may make it harder to investigate the details."

       There's also a chance that it was facilitated by another country's intelligence apparatus.  illegal violence probably isn't going to be conducted by "the government".  covert operations are often state sponsored, but intentionally kept removed from official channels.

      <p>
       You'll never "prove" anything about this type of thing at this point in time.  They've adapted.  The most you will be able to do is make connections- personal and financial between those who carry out attacks, their handlers and their financiers.  Layers like onions.

       Frankly I'm surprised California isn't home to more of these so-called "terror plots". You got all the liberals in Lala Land, defense contractors in San Diego, porn industry, sports teams, Disneyland. It'd be a terrorist's dream come true.

       I work less than a mile from where they found Dzhokhar in the boat and I know some of the people that lived where the shootout occured.

       I remember going to work, not listening to the news and surprised about the lack of traffic that day. Saw police and swat EVERYWHERE when I got to belmont.

       that's true he was a muslim I think, well not sure, but he looked like possibly an immigrant from middle east, and would not want to go off saying what he really thinks, who knows if the passengers in his car might call his taxi company to complain.

       Thanks for that, I had not seen that one. The interview adheres to formula perfectly.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A survivor of San Bernardino massacre says she doesn't feel an overwhelming sense of anger because she spends little time thinking about the co-worker who shot her and massacred her colleagues.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The witness only says she doesn't think about Syed or the gunman, she never says it was Syed that shot her or her colleagues.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I don't really think about him ... I just don't try to think about him," [end quote] said Jennifer Stevens of Syed Farook, [begin editorial] who, with his wife Tashfeen Malik, gunned down county employees at a social services facility on Dec. 2. [end editorial, continue actual statement] "I don't think I was ever really angry," Stevens said.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Notice how they pepper in their own statements, which are yet to be proven, with the witness statements and end with "Stevens said".
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But she is grieving.
       </p>
       <p>
        "These were people I worked with, people I was very familiar with, I talked with every day ... They're not there anymore or, you know, they're not doing as well and it just breaks my heart," Stevens said.
       </p>
       <p>
        Farook was one such person that Stevens was used to seeing at work, but she said the 28-year-old was "very quiet" and "wouldn't really make eye contact."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       More quotes never once stating Syed shot her. Hinting at spooky loner vibe though. Then, next paragraph.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Investigators have said that the married attackers were radicalized, and Malik had pledged allegiance to ISIS before the attack. Stevens said she couldn't understand why the mental health facility was targeted because "we don't really get on anyone's nerves. No one's out to get us."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Begins with unproven claims by investigators but ends with quotes from Stevens.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The idea of an attack at Inland Regional Center was so unfathomable to Stevens that when Farook stormed into the room where employees were eating and chatting during a holiday celebration, she thought the commotion was a drill.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Notice the deception of conveying Stevens' thoughts while the author is the only one ever saying that it was Farook that stormed the room. Also, thought it was a drill, okay.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "It was a masked man — that's what I know for sure — and he had a big gun," Stevens said. "I saw my co-worker drop to the ground, go under the table and I was like that's a good idea — even if it's just a drill."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No identification of the suspect whatsoever. The rest of the article is just personal account of being injured, though it is of interest.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When Stevens realized the violent scene wasn't a drill and first responders told those who were injured to stay put, she tried to leave because she didn't know how hurt she was, and she feared the assailants were going to come back.
       </p>
       <p>
        But once Stevens did get outside, she became aware of how hurt she really was when EMTs started tagging people by the severity of their injuries.
       </p>
       <p>
        "There was like four or five different categories, and I was labeled the one before morgue," she said.
       </p>
       <p>
        Stevens had been shot straight through her abdomen and in her arm, but she said her recovery is going smoothly. She considers herself "lucky."
       </p>
       <p>
        "I am very fortunate, you know, where I was shot ... compared to other victims," Stevens said. "I wish that more people were more fortunate."
       </p>

       Very few people can read a story like you and decipher what the victim said vs. what was interjected by the author. I applaud your comprehension of the directed story as most can't or won't be able to do so for themselves and just read the entire story like it was ALL the victims statements.

       My issue with everything surrounding San Bernardino is that there is no video from inside the room/hall while the attack was going on, no video of the aftermath as we have seen from the Boston bombing or the chemical attacks in Syria. Were cell phones confiscated by officials at the scene? How did no one get any picture or cell phone video?

       they could have explained that as just saying it was 3 white cops that were on the scene because that's what cops do, respond to scenes of crimes. But the full media blackout on ever mentioning it again makes it look suspicious. Coverups always prove guilt.

       Can someone explain the motives of the false flag? From some people I heard they are trying to make Muslims look violent to paint them in a negative light. On the other hand I heard that they are trying to downplay the fact that Muslim terrorism exists, maybe even focus on the gun control issue. Which one is it?

       Whenever there is something to be afraid of or some impending danger you can bet your ass there will be something you can BUY to make you less afraid or less at risk of danger.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there are rampant theories about taking all guns away but let's be honest for a moment. Until companies no longer need money to buy influence with (which might be what the TPP/TTIP is really for to be honest) they will never do something that effects their bottom line to the extent that banning guns in America would. Especially when the industry your talking about is the most profitable and powerful on the planet. I don't want to completely rule out the "they're taking our guns" conspiracy but it just seems really unlikely as long as money is the key to power, but like I said earlier the TPP could be what changes that and gives them Total Political Power (T.P.P. - lol) without having to buy it out anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I think the most likely reason for the false flag is, as usual, to rally the ever dwindling support for occupation of foreign lands. Hence why they felt it necessary to connect Sayed's wife to ISIS even without definitive proof. America most certainly has an economy based on war. It's what made us the world leader and it's what is keeping us the world leader.
      </p>
      <p>
       They knew this one was weak sauce too since the whole story hinged on the fact that for some reason the "shooters" decided it would be a "good idea" to drive back to the scene of the crime (compounded by other mistakes like the 2 different eye witness reports of 3 tall and athletic white men). So to finish convincing the weaker minded that somehow managed some semblance of skepticism at first, we get that unprecedented media bombardment at the home of the deceased shooters showing fake ID's and all sorts of seemingly pertinent things that are meant to convince you they were terrorists but somehow the authorities decided they "didn't need" as evidence and therefore concluded their investigation after only a day or two......

       There was some weirdness also with reports about witnesses being sequestered in a church and their families and media being told to go to a different place ...or something. Again, anecdotal.

       You are right.   The rock church.  The witnesses were told not to talk that day.  Don't know why we haven't heard from anyone and why there is no footage or mention of the third guy.

       And the most "interesting" part about it is that they had broadcasted, if I recall, cell phone footage of people being filed out of a hallway by the police alleged to be from an employee, so obviously that hallway full of people are all potential witness accounts, or even

        this

       collection of footage allegedly from the people in the building should, in theory, add some merit to the official narrative and yet they choose not to support it with anything but authority figure instead of actual evidence.

       To continue my previous statement:
      </p>
      <p>
       And the thing about that is, the public doesn't care to ask for evidence as long as it's told to the from a pretty lady on the magic image box, and the only time the average person demands evidence is when something questions what they hold near and dear to them, which is generally the official narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to run on a tangent: Does anyone ever notice how cleverly set up the presentation of the news is to subliminally reinforce our trust in these people? To start, you always have there full name on screen, like how you know a good friend's or a family member's full name, adding a little sense of "trust" or "closeness" between the viewer and the anchors. Then you generally have one man and one woman as co-anchors, both of which are generally semi-attractive, by the American standard at least, and are dressed professionally, because we place value in those who wear a suit as good or powerful people (i.e. The President, any government figure, a lawyer, a rich person, etc.). And to top it all off, there is generally a solid consistency to them, it's always the same set of people at the same time frame everyday, "Because I can always count on Tom Cunningham to tell me the weather at 4" or " Y'know I really love watching the morning news on ABC as part of my morning routine, the anchors are always such nice, wholesome people."
      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess to sum it up, the news puts in to play subtle methods to make the viewers feel "closer"or "more trusting" towards the people thereby also reinforcing our belief in their stories because "They're like family".

       Without speaking one way or the other on my own personal beliefs, this is what's funny to me,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Shouldn't the wounded survivors have been invited as guests of honor at major sporting events, or gone on TV (or in front of congress) to peddle more (or fewer) firearm regulations, or spoken of the 'existential threat' of Islamic extremism, or interviewed simply to garner clicks and ratings guaranteed by gory details?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So if they do that, it's peddling their agenda and you guys would jump to call them crisis actors.  Don't do it and somehow it's equally suspicious?  People will justify what they want to believe regardless.  Both those that think it was a 'regular' mass shooting and those of you that think it was a false flag.

       from what I understand, it's still an active federal investigation and it's not unusual for a gag order to accompany an NSL. especially since the official narrative is a terrorist attack so I would fully expect every witness to get an NSL

       I made it to Quincy Center Station right as the MBTA closed that morning, so I was on reddit all day till they caught him. I woke up to use the bathroom that night and saw that they were reporting the shooting at MIT.
