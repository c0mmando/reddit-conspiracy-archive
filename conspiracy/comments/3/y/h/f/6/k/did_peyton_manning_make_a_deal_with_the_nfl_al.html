       Yes, it is a conspiracy--the leagues look the other way while the media doesn't investigate and report...
      </p>
      <p>
       File under Corporatism:  The report includes a pharmacist who makes the accusation that he visited Green Bay, WI--where he advised 20 to 25 Packers of seeking his advice on where to order banned substances...Millions of dollars ride on covering up the NFL's dirty secret--I wonder how many news outlets turned the story down before Al Jazeera finally published.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the documentary, a former investigator for MLB also states 20% of players are using banned substances.
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the players are alleged to be using substances marked "Not fit for human consumption" and even taking multiple drugs at a time...For football players, this is added to the extreme amount of shocks to the brain their bodies take during their lifetime. In Will Smith's latest movie
       <em>
        Concussion
       </em>
       , the central character Dr. Omalu estimates that one of the NFL's greatest players took 70,000 shocks to the brain during his lifetime playing football (high school, college &amp; pro).  The player was Mike Webster, an All-Pro with the Pittsburgh Steelers who ended up killing himself.  Dr. Omalu named the disorder Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy and published his findings in a medical journal.  Adding the brain trauma to using pain killers, steroids and drugs "not fit for human consumption" doesn't sound like a wise choice for college and pro players to be making.

       <p>
        On December 27, 2015, Al Jazeera America released a report investigating professional athletes' use of Performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) that named Manning, among other prominent athletes, as having received drugs from Charles Sly, a pharmacist who had worked at the Guyer Anti-Aging Clinic in Indianapolis from 2011 to 2013. The report involved Liam Collins, a British hurdler, going undercover in an attempt to obtain banned substances from Sly and other medical professionals.
       </p>

       ...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sly later claimed to ESPN that Collins had taken advantage of him during a vulnerable time in his life, after his fiance died.[241] Sly also told ESPN's Chris Mortensen that he is not a pharmacist and was not at the Guyer Institute in 2011, as Al Jazeera claimed, but state licensing records indicate that a "Charles David Sly" was licensed as a pharmacy intern in Indiana from April 2010 to May 2013 and that his license expired May 1, 2013.[242] Sly later stated that "[w]hen [he]was there, [he] had never seen the Mannings ever. They were not even living there at that time," and that "[s]omeone who worked there said they had been there before. That was the extent of any knowledge I had. I feel badly. I never saw any files. This is just amazing that it reached this point."

       Funny... the guy accused of illegally selling drugs to Manning, claims
       <em>
        he
       </em>
       made up the story? Then he denies he was a pharmacist working for the institute in question... then retracts that claim and admits it when he is prooved to be lying, but says he never saw the Mannings, and someone else told him about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       What a surprise. He could be facing criminal charges if the story is true, so of course he's going to deny it.

       Yes, it is a conspiracy--the leagues look the other way while the media doesn't investigate and report...
      </p>
      <p>
       File under Corporatism:  The report includes a pharmacist who makes the accusation that he visited Green Bay, WI--where he advised 20 to 25 Packers of seeking his advice on where to order banned substances...Millions of dollars ride on covering up the NFL's dirty secret--I wonder how many news outlets turned the story down before Al Jazeera finally published.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the documentary, a former investigator for MLB also states 20% of players are using banned substances.

       Some of the players are alleged to be using substances marked "Not fit for human consumption" and even taking multiple drugs at a time...For football players, this is added to the extreme amount of shocks to the brain their bodies take during their lifetime. In Will Smith's latest movie
       <em>
        Concussion
       </em>
       , the central character Dr. Omalu estimates that one of the NFL's greatest players took 70,000 shocks to the brain during his lifetime playing football (high school, college &amp; pro).  The player was Mike Webster, an All-Pro with the Pittsburgh Steelers who ended up killing himself.  Dr. Omalu named the disorder Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy and published his findings in a medical journal.  Adding the brain trauma to using pain killers, steroids and drugs "not fit for human consumption" doesn't sound like a wise choice for college and pro players to be making.
