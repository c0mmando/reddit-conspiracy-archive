    <div class="md"><p>yep exactly.  they are selling merchandise,  not just os.  im running an older machine that is xp. and a diferent one with win 10.  my xp machine  kicks ass compared to the new one and is ten times more flexable as far as what i can do with it.  just turn updates off.  you dont need most of what they send you.. a geek friend of mine told me to just toss the i phone in the garbage.and buy a cheaper phone that runs android.  if the updates ever over take the phones capability you wont be stuck with an over priced clunker.. i have never run in to problems with android,not to mention they are hell of a lot more secure than i phone ( in geeks opinion)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who has owned many generations of Apple products I can say this is patently false. The argument here is assuming Apple intentionally hamstrings (artificially slows) older devices each OS release in order to frustrate users into upgrading.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to say that your iPhone 5 is going to run iOS 9 at the same speed as it ran iOS 7, but that doesn&#39;t mean the only logical conclusions is that Apple is sandbagging so you upgrade. Each OS brings new features, often times taking up more memory and/or background tasks.</p>

<p>My parents have an iPad 2 and first gen iPad mini they still use, despite being upgraded to iOS 9. While they occasionally complain it feels slow, it is usable along with most of the newer features from each iOS. That&#39;s pretty good considering the hardware is considerably dated at this point.</p>

<p>Case in point, I have a friend who recently upgraded from a Samsung S5 to the S6 Edge. They had no real reason to upgrade and were actually reluctant because they enjoyed the S5.</p>

<p>A month later they unfortunately lost their S6 and went back to using the S5 as a backup. No updates, nothing changed (literally stored powered off). They absolutely noticed how slow everything felt in comparison. The device lagged, camera took much longer to initialize, etc.</p>

<p>The reality is that technology improves rather quickly and we adapt to it rather quickly as well. As we do, the parts that lag behind are more noticeable and undesirable.</p>

<p>To the computer side, the last OS X update is an example of how untrue this really is. El Captian introduced Metal, which allows big improvements in graphics performance. The OS itself uses it and many users, even on older devices, have noticed considerable smoother interaction.</p>

<p>A lot of it is also the hardware, which often is bottlenecked by the weakest link-- the traditional spinning hard drive. I cannot tell you the number of times I have taken an &quot;insantly slow computer&quot; and made it feel brand new and fast by replacing with a solid state hard drive.</p>

<p>The real issue is ignorance and most people just assume they can take a computer/tablet and use it for 4-5+ years and be &quot;locked in&quot; to a certain level of performance. Meanwhile, they download every app possible, keep them all running, and install all kinds of garbage that only slows it down further.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That a SSD makes such a difference with MacOSX only proves their OS has some real issues with VM,Caching and general IO.</p>

<p>Safari&#39;s memory management is a joke. It only takes a while until you have to wait <em>seconds</em> to load any apps because of the VM trashing. A SSD just hides most of these effects under the carpet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh come on, this is absurd. Every OS was at the mercy of hard disk speeds. It&#39;s entirely unfair to say OS X was awful when Windows and Linux suffered the same bottlenecks.</p>

<p>In fact, overall performance in OS X outperforms Windows. It has been proven time and time again. The only area Windows reigns is gaming/graphics performance and that may start to change with Metal in El Capitan.</p>

<p>Calling out Safari while ignoring the 800lb gorilla in the room -- Internet Explorer? Safari is an application, not an OS feature. Bogus comparisons and claims just make you sound like an Apple hater.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s undoubtably true that they spend <em>less</em> time in compatibility and more in making it work smooth with new hardware. There has to be a cut off because there are only so many man hours to put on each aspect.</p>

<p>Apple does a very good job at trying though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last year there were a number of articles touching on this subject.  While they steer clear of declaring planned obsolesce, they certainly raise enough questions to point in that direction.  <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/does-apple-throttle-older-iphones-to-nudge-you-into-buying-a-new-one/">Here&#39;s just one story</a>:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you ever felt like your iPhone got slower around the time Apple released the next edition of the device, you&#39;re definitely not alone.</p>

<p>Some digging into Google Trends by Harvard University PhD student Laura Trucco has shown that searches for &quot;iPhone slow&quot; have peaked consistently at the time Apple releases a new iPhone.</p>

<p>The same pattern has occurred since the 2008 release of the iPhone 3G, but what do the spikes mean? Could it show that Apple slows down older iPhones to nudge owners onto newer ones, helping it announce record breaking sales in the weeks after it releases a new iPhone? Or do people just think their old devices have become slower because they&#39;re presented with a newer, faster device?</p>
