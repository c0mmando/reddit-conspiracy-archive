        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Given that it is impossible to travel faster than the Speed of Light, how would Aliens visit Earth?</p>

<p>Their best method would be a Generation Ship traveling at perhaps as much as 0.10% of the speed of light thanks to any number of means like laser propulsion, nuclear pulse propulsion (aka orion drive), bussard ramjet.</p>

<p>But even so it would still take centuries to travel between systems, just to give you an idea in the recent Hard SF novel Aurora using this proven scientifically possible technology it took the generation ship 270 years to travel 12 lightyears. Not bad, but not something you can do in a single lifetime.</p>

<p>Aliens visiting Earth would be spending entire generations on their ship without ever even reaching their destination. It&#39;d be pretty depressing to know you&#39;re just cargo to ensure there are future generations around when the ship arrives.</p>

<p>And then that brings us to the Why go to all monumental effort. Why come all this way to... carve some animals on the ground and build some Pyramids. Seems like an awfully large expenditure of manpower and resources and lives lived in the Generation ship just to do that.</p>

<p>What are some other possibility? A robotic probe ship seems more reasonable, though that raises more questions and besides nobody ever says the visitors were automated.</p>

<p>We haven&#39;t created them. They are observed universal constants. Thermodynamics and Conservation of Energy aren&#39;t just something we made up and imposed. They are observed and tested and repeated.</p>

<p>Traveling at the Speed of Light would require infinite amount of energy, which would saddle you with an infinite amount of mass. The faster you want to go the mass you&#39;re going to have to carry.</p>

<p>Saturn is a Gas Giant. It has no solid surface we could stand on. If we could, we would be crushed by our weight because of its higher gravity. Thats not anything being relative. Thats you misunderstanding what these things mean.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bollocks. No &quot;law&quot; dreamed up by a human is untouchable.</p>

<p>Did you know that the latest theory of how this universe works breaks one of the fundamental laws of thermodynamics?</p>

<p>According to &quot;Big Bang&quot; cosmology, a mysterious &quot;Dark Energy&quot; that pervades all of space is accelerating the expansion of the universe. But to do that, it creates more space, which then creates more energy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Linear momentum is also a conserved quantity, meaning that if a closed system is not affected by external forces, its total linear momentum cannot change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum</a></p>

<p>For the accelerating expansion to not break that law, there has to be an external source of energy. Hence the &quot;Dark Energy&quot; title.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first law of thermodynamics is a version of the law of conservation of energy, adapted for thermodynamic systems. The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but cannot be created or destroyed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics</a></p>

<p>In order for &quot;Dark Energy&quot; to expand the universe at an accelerating rate, it must create more space, but the space created has its own &quot;Dark Energy&quot;, increasing the total amount of &quot;energy&quot; in the Universe. In essence energy is created out of nothing, breaking the First Law of Thermodynamics.</p>

<p>Right now, the prevailing theory of how the universe works (and that includes the &quot;light speed barrier&quot;) breaks at least one of the &quot;fundamental&quot; laws of physics.</p>

<p>Knowledge is power.</p>

<p>There was a report from the Brookings Institute in 1957 (?) that predicted humanity would lose its collective marbles if it were announced that ETs were really here.  Our &quot;leaders&quot; have such little respect for the mass of humanity, it isn&#39;t too hard to believe they withhold all sorts of information &quot;for our own good&quot;... and, of course, their benefit.

<p>To say it&#39;s impossible implies we know this for <em>fact</em>, which we do not. We assume this to be true, based upon what we know of science <em>now</em>, but 100 years ago people thought bad humors made us sick as opposed to microscopic organisms. Before that, people believed the sun revolved around the earth, because surely man must be the center of the universe. That&#39;s the great thing about science: it&#39;s always under revision as we learn more about the universe around us.</p>

<p>So, in other words, a complete waste of time. Meaning, if you follow the logic trail there, it stands to reason we <em>weren&#39;t</em> visited by ancient aliens.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A robotic probe ship seems more reasonable, though that raises more questions and besides nobody ever says the visitors were automated.</p>

<p>Why bother? We&#39;ve only really started getting <em>interesting</em> as a species in the last... seventy or so years. Since we started going to the moon and splitting the atom. Elsewise, suppose a probe was sent to observe. Where is it, who would it report to, and what would it be looking for?</p>

<p>Personally, I think &#39;ancient aliens&#39; is another cockamamie &#39;theory&#39; along the lines of flat earth, meant to derail and discredit the sub, but at least alien life is more interesting as a thought experiment.</p>

<p>Have to go back quite a bit further than 1915 to get to the humors. More like 500-1000 years. But yes back then, much further back then, they did believe that.</p>

<p>Some did. A lot of that had to do with adherence to the Greeks and then Religious dogma.</p>

<p>Yes, but this has to do with universal constants of energy and physics. What happened then is people not being aware of principles. These are principles we know and we know they are unbreakable.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Given that it is impossible to travel faster than the Speed of Light</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it though? Yes, that&#39;s what Einstein said, but no one has even come close to testing it. It is an untested theory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But even so it would still take centuries to travel between systems,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who said they would perceive time like we do? Right on this planet there are life forms that live hundreds of years, and life forms that perceive the passage of time differently to us.</p>

<p>To claim that aliens would be just like us is foolish.</p>

<p>An alien species could perceive days like we perceive seconds. A year to them might by the period before lunch. Just because <em>we</em> would take multiple generations to carry out a 300 year journey, that doesn&#39;t mean <em>they</em> would.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And then that brings us to the Why go to all monumental effort</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do we want to send men to a lifeless moon orbiting our planet? Why do we want to send men to our nearest neighbour, Mars?</p>

<p>They could simply be studying us like an entomologist studies an ant nest.</p>

<p>In terms of ancient aliens, they may have come here, found a bunch of unintelligent apes, and decided to do some selective breeding and genetic modification to create loyal pets and work animals. A species capable of FTL travel, or that perceives time totally different to us, might look at <em>us</em> the we look at ants. Fascinating... fun to raise, but really just a bug in comparison to them.</p>

<p>If they invented fire, went through a Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Industrial Revolution, space age, Information Age, and now developed exotic forms of energy and propulsion it follows that they are land dwellers (no fire underwater), have dexterous fine motor manipulators, can think rationally and logical to be able to study things and make tests, and perceive time in a linear manner in order to make plan and carry them out</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To rationalise funding aerospace R&amp;D, and Cold War dick measuring.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do we want to send men to our nearest neighbour, Mars?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is so much harder to get funding for mars, its so half hearted and drawn out I doubt it will ever happen. But again for much the same reason doing so provides a means of transferring public wealth to private industry.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The actions attributed to them in abduction stories are rather bizarre and don&#39;t seem to form any rational purpose.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and decided to do some selective breeding and genetic modification to create loyal pets and work animals</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why? And why would a species as advanced as you claim who perceive time as you claim need work animals?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to travel faster than light if you don&#39;t move at all. With a hypothetical warp drive or interdimensional travel one could move the space around them while remaining completely still. I could imagine an advanced et species that has unlocked the secrets of the quantum universe and developed some type of quantum teleportation or manipulating matter at a quantum level to propel their craft at superluminal speeds. However if they develop technologies this sophisticated what could they possibly want to do with the earth or beings from earth?</p>
