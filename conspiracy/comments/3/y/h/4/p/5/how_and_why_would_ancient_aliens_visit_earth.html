      <p>
       Given that it is impossible to travel faster than the Speed of Light, how would Aliens visit Earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       Their best method would be a Generation Ship traveling at perhaps as much as 0.10% of the speed of light thanks to any number of means like laser propulsion, nuclear pulse propulsion (aka orion drive), bussard ramjet.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even so it would still take centuries to travel between systems, just to give you an idea in the recent Hard SF novel Aurora using this proven scientifically possible technology it took the generation ship 270 years to travel 12 lightyears. Not bad, but not something you can do in a single lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aliens visiting Earth would be spending entire generations on their ship without ever even reaching their destination. It'd be pretty depressing to know you're just cargo to ensure there are future generations around when the ship arrives.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then that brings us to the Why go to all monumental effort. Why come all this way to... carve some animals on the ground and build some Pyramids. Seems like an awfully large expenditure of manpower and resources and lives lived in the Generation ship just to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are some other possibility? A robotic probe ship seems more reasonable, though that raises more questions and besides nobody ever says the visitors were automated.

       We haven't created them. They are observed universal constants. Thermodynamics and Conservation of Energy aren't just something we made up and imposed. They are observed and tested and repeated.

      <p>
       Traveling at the Speed of Light would require infinite amount of energy, which would saddle you with an infinite amount of mass. The faster you want to go the mass you're going to have to carry.

       Yup, that is the text book/orthodox response to what I said. Doesn't mean it's true though. We may think it is, but very well could be different. It's all relative. How old are you and how much do you weigh on say, Saturn?

       Well feel free to demonstrate its only a law of man by producing more energy than is require to make it.

       Saturn is a Gas Giant. It has no solid surface we could stand on. If we could, we would be crushed by our weight because of its higher gravity. Thats not anything being relative. Thats you misunderstanding what these things mean.

       Thats not defying gravity. Thats countering gravity with thrust and air pressure. Or using lighter than air element for lift like hydrogen or helium. Cut off the thrust or air pressure and you fall. Vent the hydrogen or helium and you fall. And that falling is gravity.

       Bollocks. No "law" dreamed up by a human is untouchable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that the latest theory of how this universe works breaks one of the fundamental laws of thermodynamics?
      </p>
      <p>
       According to "Big Bang" cosmology, a mysterious "Dark Energy" that pervades all of space is accelerating the expansion of the universe. But to do that, it creates more space, which then creates more energy.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Linear momentum is also a conserved quantity, meaning that if a closed system is not affected by external forces, its total linear momentum cannot change.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       For the accelerating expansion to not break that law, there has to be an external source of energy. Hence the "Dark Energy" title.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The first law of thermodynamics is a version of the law of conservation of energy, adapted for thermodynamic systems. The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but cannot be created or destroyed.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       In order for "Dark Energy" to expand the universe at an accelerating rate, it must create more space, but the space created has its own "Dark Energy", increasing the total amount of "energy" in the Universe. In essence energy is created out of nothing, breaking the First Law of Thermodynamics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, the prevailing theory of how the universe works (and that includes the "light speed barrier") breaks at least one of the "fundamental" laws of physics.

       There was a report from the Brookings Institute in 1957 (?) that predicted humanity would lose its collective marbles if it were announced that ETs were really here.  Our "leaders" have such little respect for the mass of humanity, it isn't too hard to believe they withhold all sorts of information "for our own good"... and, of course, their benefit.  Actual ET presence on Earth would certainly fall into this category.

These aliens are of a higher dimension. When they assume forms on this plane, it's more like a dream to them. They're just sending thoughts down in the form of tangible forms. They're not traveling within the 3rd or 4th dimensions. They pop out into the fifth, pick a point in the 3rd/4th, and just go to it.

       To say it's impossible implies we know this for
       <em>
        fact
       </em>
       , which we do not. We assume this to be true, based upon what we know of science
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       , but 100 years ago people thought bad humors made us sick as opposed to microscopic organisms. Before that, people believed the sun revolved around the earth, because surely man must be the center of the universe. That's the great thing about science: it's always under revision as we learn more about the universe around us.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, in other words, a complete waste of time. Meaning, if you follow the logic trail there, it stands to reason we
       <em>
        weren't
       </em>
       visited by ancient aliens.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A robotic probe ship seems more reasonable, though that raises more questions and besides nobody ever says the visitors were automated.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why bother? We've only really started getting
       <em>
        interesting
       </em>
       as a species in the last... seventy or so years. Since we started going to the moon and splitting the atom. Elsewise, suppose a probe was sent to observe. Where is it, who would it report to, and what would it be looking for?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I think 'ancient aliens' is another cockamamie 'theory' along the lines of flat earth, meant to derail and discredit the sub, but at least alien life is more interesting as a thought experiment.

       Have to go back quite a bit further than 1915 to get to the humors. More like 500-1000 years. But yes back then, much further back then, they did believe that.

       Yes, but this has to do with universal constants of energy and physics. What happened then is people not being aware of principles. These are principles we know and we know they are unbreakable.

       I've heard some people say they were landing strips and beacons. They have interstellar space travel, possibly faster than light space travel, and they dont have radio or radar or gps they need pyramids and drawings to guide them in. Really?

       In terms of ancient aliens, they may have come here, found a bunch of unintelligent apes, and decided to do some selective breeding and genetic modification to create loyal pets and work animals. A species capable of FTL travel, or that perceives time totally different to us, might look at
       <em>

       If they invented fire, went through a Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Industrial Revolution, space age, Information Age, and now developed exotic forms of energy and propulsion it follows that they are land dwellers (no fire underwater), have dexterous fine motor manipulators, can think rationally and logical to be able to study things and make tests, and perceive time in a linear manner in order to make plan and carry them out

       You don't have to travel faster than light if you don't move at all. With a hypothetical warp drive or interdimensional travel one could move the space around them while remaining completely still. I could imagine an advanced et species that has unlocked the secrets of the quantum universe and developed some type of quantum teleportation or manipulating matter at a quantum level to propel their craft at superluminal speeds. However if they develop technologies this sophisticated what could they possibly want to do with the earth or beings from earth?
