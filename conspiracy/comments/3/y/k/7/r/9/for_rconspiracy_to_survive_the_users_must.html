You could go from there and create a movement or group that believe in shadow government and that the flat earth theory is shit.

You can downvote, post why you think it&#39;s a wrong theory, ignore their existence, but the moment you try to ban them a priori, people will use that to deny any difference between this sub honest regulars and nazis. Because it&#39;s in its nature to be open to any theories if they have some argumentation, wrong or right. You can then explain why you think it&#39;s wrong but you can&#39;t go &quot;mod ban troll pls&quot; mode.</p>

<p>This simply isn&#39;t true, <strong>dozens of people have been banned for exactly this over the last few weeks.</strong> Report rule violations when you see them.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s a mod saying that. So you know its true.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one of the oldest tactics on forums like this. They antagonise the opposition into breaking some minor rule, then report them to the mods. Mods rarely check to see if the rule violation was provoked, and even more rarely care. So the genuine members get banned while the trolls get to take over. It&#39;s a sort of entrapment.</p>

<p>I do not want to see bans of any kind, <em>but</em> the obviously bullshit posts should be met with ridicule and insults, while the mods allow people to speak freely.</p>

<p>If I can claim the moon is made of cheese, you should be able to call me an idiot without opening yourself up for a ban, simply to prevent the tactic above from being used.</p>

You should be asked to post valid evidence/indications of your statement and when you show your lack thereof, future such weird statements should just get banned.
If we are to censor ideas solely on the basis of how much off they seem we are debasing the very principle of this sub.</p>

<p>I honestly think this is a bit of a honeypot subreddit, it is flawed by default being such a large concept.
It would be much easier to have specifics like &quot;politics related conspiracies&quot; and &quot;alien related conspiracies&quot; and &quot;science related conspiracies&quot; 
That way they would need to atleast get a bit more creative to troll the subs.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll just quote myself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do not want to see bans of any kind</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The point is, as soon as you make a rule that if broken can result in a ban, trolls will attempt to get genuine users to break that rule so the troll can report them. Any &quot;ban worthy&quot; rule can be abused, even if the mods are not actively involved.</p>

<p>People who believe in free speech will not report rule violations, no matter how egregious. They will simply speak themselves. It is the ones that are trying to censor other people that report violations, so the bans usually go against the people who speak freely. The trolls win.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen it time and time again in my 20 odd years of participating in online discussions.</p>

<p>I have no problem with &quot;flat earth&quot; posts being here. What I have a problem with is the people that oppose those posts with ridicule and insults being banned. It means that the mods become a tool of the trolls, rather than protecting the sub and its genuine users <em>from</em> the trolls.</p>

<p>However i don&#39;t believe insulting those ( obvious to me and you, i guess ) shills or useful idiots will bear any fruit.
To acknowledge them for too long in a rational way, or worse yet get a bit crispy/emotional over their fuzzy ideas will just give them an edge.</p>

<p>It would be right if we were a movement who adher to some basic belief lines or do limit the range of interests, but there is no such thing there. The problem is the context. As i said i&#39;d be more than happy to have more specific subs with stricter quality rules instead of this. But being the way it is, shaming or ridiculing those ideas won&#39;t net truth any gain. It will simply be used against it like a tribunal, because in a open format the most common voice are the tribunal, and obviously truthseekers are at a disadvantage. 
So i&#39;d rather play it smart than hard and let this people have their way in the posts, only to just skip them alltogether and downvote.
Sadly while this subreddit has great potential is too overrun and liberal to turn it into an actual knowledge base or group base.</p>

<p>It won&#39;t save the earth, but if used correctly it can surely help willing individuals to understand. There is no good fight to fight here. imo. Only some good scattered infos to gather to be used in the actual battlefield ( and some good confrontations with constructive, rational users, when we are lucky ).</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t have to. What the trolls are doing will not bear any fruit either. Besides, sometimes it just feels good to call an idiot an idiot. That has value too.</p>

<p>You use loaded terms like &quot;truthseekers&quot; to disguise the fact these people are not seeking truth at all. They are spreading obvious lies.</p>

<p>Real &quot;truthseekers&quot; can handle a few insults. It&#39;s the <em>trolls</em> that run to the mods to silence criticism.</p>

And if aren&#39;t the mods/admis taking charge of solving the problem, we can&#39;t - anything intelligent you will say to this kind of people will be ignored due to agendas.
I wouldn&#39;t waste energy with them. Sometimes if im in doubt i post a couple messages and the answers are usually enlightening on the matter. After that i usually move on.

<p>Because you’ll never have anyone on Reddit care about the content of posts unless you can divorce it from the names. That’s why the “chans” are so popular.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>id like to find a way to organize r/conspiracy to downvote or even ban all users that are actual computer programs that post here to spread disinfo or just for clickbait.  </p>

<p>i know youre going to ask &quot;how can we tell who is a computer and who is real?&quot;  well, the way i do it is i call them out.  if i suspect OP is a computer program, i just ask them.  if they dont say anything i  downvote and put them on ignore.  if everyone did this it may help keep the content from being shit and eventually keep the shills out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>from my understanding they arent designed to respond properly to questioning.  so far every time ive called someone out for being a computer they havent responded.  i would think that if someone were called out like that they would ask me what the hell i was talking about or at least say &quot;no im not.&quot;  </p>
