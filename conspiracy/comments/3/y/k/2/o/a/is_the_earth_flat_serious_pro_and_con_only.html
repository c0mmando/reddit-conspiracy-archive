       Lets keep it simple, what is your belief regarding the Flat Earth Theory and why do you believe so.
Edit...everyone bashing me....please take it easy.  I am not a Flat Eather..I am a Truth Seeker. A wise man once told me do not believe anything just because someone tells you so...find your own evidence and discuss it with open-minded people.  That is all I am trying to do.  I know many of you guys have dealt with disinformation and such..and are fed up with this particular theory..but if R/Conspiracy becomes a place where a guy gets bashed for asking a question about a conspiracy without even getting facts...how does that make us any different than CNN News? I am genuine in my question and am asking for your help.  I am not trying to disinform anyone....I never even made a statement, only a question.  If attempting to hold an open dialogue is wrong I am sorry..and perhaps I am in the wrong sub.

       i suspect..

      <p>
       the earth isnt flat or whatever, but there's something else about the nature of earth and outer space they're hiding - that they're using 'flat earth' as a cover for.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm leaning towards some sort of
       <a href="/r/holofractal">
        /r/holofractal
       </a>
       double-torus structure, which implies energy is being emitted from the poles. if energy is emitted from the poles, that implies that there's a sort of oasis at each pole, similar to how undersea life thrives deep geo-thermal vents. and note that civilians are strictly forbidden from traveling anywhere near the poles.

       and its sidebar links - the idea is that reality is the same repeating patterns of double-toroids from the subatomic level to the planetary level to the galactic level. gets into sacred geometry and tesla stuff.

       Unfortunately, I am not much of a scientist. So many of the technical details escape my understanding.  I have more of a legal/monetary mind, for better or for worse.  I'd love to know more about the physics of the world.  If you happen to come across anything interesting i'd love to read your hypothesis and conclusion...dumbed-down version of course =)

       There are experiments you could use to test whether the moon is spherical or not. For example:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Attempt to create a non-spherical lunar model that reproduces the visible lunar phases we can all observe
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You could also use shadows from the sun to measure the approximate height of various lunar terrain features, and then try to create a flat moon model with those same shadow configurations.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A flat moon would have a different, measurable gravitational impact on the Earth. You could use a physics simulation to model each and then compare that with real measurements taken

       Flat earthers don't believe in gravity. They also deny science as a whole and any references you give they will just poo-poo them. You can not win an argument with people who put their fingers in their ears and go "LA LA LA! "

       Oh, I'm aware. But I'll still err on the side of someone being genuinely curious, especially if I can inspire people to think in terms of the scientific method and thinking about how to test assumptions.

       But they don't investigate
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       the globe model was formed. They include ridiculous YouTube videos as "research" and totally ignore the scientific method.

       The more I see of them the more I am leaning towards making truthers look like imbiciles. They even bring up 911 truth and other possible psyops in their videos. Seems a little convenient

       Wow very interesting. I kinda suck at science, I'm more of a legal minded person. But ill look into this, I'm sure a greater mind than mine has attempted this before. Thanks for the lead my friend, and for recognizing the sincerity of my question

       No problem! I've debated flat earthers in the past, mostly because it's an interesting intellectual challenge and I think it helps maintain my mental dexterity, so I enjoy coming up with these kinds of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also some interesting experiments you can use to demonstrate the curvature of the earth,
       <a href="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/%7Edns/teachersguide/MeasECAct.html">
        like this one
       </a>
       , though it requires access to an ocean that you can watch the sun rise or set over. If you live near a very flat desert, you might be able to use a telescope and a straight pole with a yardstick attached to measure the curvature from a few miles away (not sure though, said desert would have to be almost PERFECTLY level).
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond experiments you can do yourself, consider speaking to people who deal with the curvature of the earth in their everyday jobs. Surveyers, snipers, artillery gunners, navigators, truckers, hell, even a local DirecTV technician comes to mind.

       That's not actually true. Because it wobbles, we can actually see slightly more than half of its surface (58% to be precise), but only half at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
       That proves the moon is a sphere otherwise we would always see the same amount of surface.

       I understand your fear.  I cannot believe the negative backlash I am receiving for simply posing the question.....However.. the minute we let fear win and prevent us from speaking our opinions...especial when someone ASKED for it...is the moment we have already lost the war.

       I think much of the negative comments are because a lot of adamant Flat Earth supporters phrase their posting as an innocent, curious newcomer "just asking questions", but quickly reveal themselves to be adamant proponents who regurgitate very similar poorly-constructed arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few weeks ago someone posted an "innocent" question about fluids maintaining spherical shapes under their own gravity, but then revealed he actually didn't believe space actually exists and was a flat earth evangelist.

       Wow I see now. I do apologize for any confusion, I certainly meant no harm. I was just curious why some people believed in that theory to begin. I thought maybe there was something I was missing. Thanks for clearing this up for me and for your understanding. I certainly am not a flat earther, like I said I haven't even flown before. Thanks again for you comment friend.

       That does not make the question appropriate.  It's not to your credit that you entertain inappropriate questions.  It demonstrates that you are intellectually weak, and probably an under-30-year-old who has been raised in the new culture of celebrating stupidity in the name of political correctness and open-mindedness.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have nothing to be proud of when you entertain inappropriate questions.  It's not a positive quality.
      </p>

       It isn't appropriate for me to show you any respect.  You have earned this derision by posting an inappropriate question.  It doesn't matter whether you believe its possible for a question to be inappropriate.  Your bad education is your problem.

       I do not have a dog.  If I did I would hope I would not have to beat him.  I would treat it with love and caring.  If I did beat him I would definitely have a legitimate reason, such as he bit my child or my significant other for no reason other than to be viscous.

       I actually have never fallen on my head, I have pretty good reflexes.  I did play football (running back). I have never had any concussions just a few broken bones.  To the best of my knowledge my brain works fairly well.  A little weed here and there, but I digress.

       It is indeed a silly question.  Is the Earth Flat? I was almost embarrassed to ask.  I was equally embarrassed to ask "Is money real"...Yet, I am  glad I did ask.  Turns out money has not been real since we lost the gold standard and the Central bank start anally pounding us. Hmm, I was also embarrassed to ask if girls had weiners when I was 5...even though it turned out that they, in fact, DID NOT have wieners, I am sure glad I asked.  Turned out I found out a very crucial piece of info by asking a "dumb" question

       If the Earth was flat, explain gravity and how it would behave in a flat world?  How about the moons gravitational tug on Earth creating tides?  Or do you consider gravity a hoax as most Flat Earthers do?
      </p>
      <p>
       When it is night time how come the sun can still be seen elsewhere?  Wouldn't it be all or none?  Unless you consider the sun very small, but still it would surely be visible from everywhere at the same time would it not?

      <p>
       Where is Earth's edges?  If you traveled in a straight line, wouldn't you eventually find an edge?  If you fly a plane leaving from New York and arrive back in New York without turning around, how could the Earth be flat?  Same with a boat, although it would take a long time and it could not be done in a straight path.
      </p>
      <p>
       My suggestion:  Don't question what is already proven.  Focus on things that have a valid question or alternate possibility based on observable evidence.  The "Flat Earth" idea is not a "theory" nor would I classify it as a testable hypothesis.  Thus, it is completely false and those seeking to prove otherwise have discarded reality for fiction.

       Thanks for your legitimate response.  Makes a lot of sense.  I thought the same.  I read something from a Flat Earther who suggested that the SouthPole really was the end of the earth and that technically noone had ever documented visiting its end.  I think they said something along the lines of a governmental truce existed and that noone can venture to the south pole without a license and an escort.  They also claim that the horrible ice, weather etc, makes travel to its ends almost impossible.  I agree with you for the most part, the theory sounds incredibly unlikely.  You can call me lazy, but I was simply hoping someone with more time/knowledge on the subject could help me counter those points.  I truly am not a disinformation agent and do not mean to upset anyone.  I simply have learned my lesson about blindly believing ANYTHING..I use to believe in religion and a bunch of other stuff until I actually was able to open my mind.  Again, I thank you for taking the time to actually answer me seriously.

       My theory is that the sudden influx of flat earth posts on Reddit is due to some university professor doing a study, or maybe it's a grad student writing a thesis, about how easy it is to get gullible Redditors to go along with your ridiculous conspiracy theory if you just keep exposing them to the theory for a prolonged period of time.

       Not your fault. I was being sarcastic. Pretty much Im saying if everyone believed the earth was round when it was really flat then we would have people &amp; water falling over the edge by accident. And if it didnt then it would require massive mountain ranges to keep the water in. Nothing something easy to hide.

       Flat Earth has been disproven via space programs. If the Earth was flat, that would mean other planets would also have a flat shape to them as well, at least an option to round. However, astronomers have only seen round planets. This leads many to think flat Earth as a debunked idea.

       You can verify that other celestial bodies are spherical in nature. You can verify this through observing the orbits of their moons. In Jupiter's case, you can observe the transit of the great red spot as it rotates around the planet.

       I am starting to get the feeling that you are correct. I get the feeling it may be a distraction, much like flyyyyyyy said above, to keep us from recognizing a greater truth. However, I promise you that this is not my intention. I truly came with a genuine question. I am not nor ever claimed to be a flat earth theory supporter. Even though I met a lot of backlash, I am glad that I asked my question. I understand now why people are so upset by this question, as it definitely may be often used for disinformation. But thanks to redditors like you, who take the time to pose true dialogue, I believe I have gain both valuable experience AND knowledge. Thanks again friend.

       Well, I still have a nagging doubt about your lack of belief in "Flat Earth" theories. However, I personally do not believe
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       speech should be censored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not the bullshit about a "flat earth", nor the vitriolic replies those posts get. We either have the freedom to speak freely, or this sub is just as censored as the rest of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, you do not have a right not to be insulted.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have the right, and the ability, not to read insulting comments. You can even put other users on a personal ignore list so that you do not have to see their comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why the censorship?

       I have never censored anyone? I may be confused by you comment, so I apologize if that is not what you were suggesting.  But my original intent and question was directed at BOTH flat earth believers AND deniers to to come use this platform to discuss their views regarding this topic and bring supporting evidence.  People attempted to censor me, downvote me and insulted me based on my question, even though I clearly stated that I am not a flat earther.  I simply found it interesting that some people are believers and I wanted more information so that I could come to a 100% conclusion.  Like I stated, I find it unlikely, however I also use to find it unlikely that One Central Bank could cause so many problems...UNTIL I became more open minded and started discussion with more informed people.  Honestly, this post and it’s comments did lead to some valuable information for me, and I find myself NOT believing the Flat Earth Theory.  Even the people who bashed me (said I fell on my head as a baby...called me a basement dwelling momma’s boy who could not read, spell and was retarded) I treated with respect and did not discourage them from commenting. All I asked was that they understand that I am a real Truth Seeker, an enemy of the Illuminati, and was genuine in my question; simply attempting to come to a place of like-minded people to have a debate that hopefully could further my knowledge.

       I didn't say you had. But people have been censored simply for expressing their opinion. It's just that the mods have decided which opinions they will censor and which they will allow.

       If you walk into the middle of an argument and start asking people to "talk about it"... you usually just piss off both sides of the argument.

       The fact is, there has been a rush of "flat earth" posts made by obvious trolls or plain stupid people. Not one or two, but dozens of them. Then you come along and make another one.

       Those two claims are not even in the same realm. Even fools know that central banks set monetary policy and thus have a major affect on the economy. That was their purpose, after all.

       What you are doing is saying "because this obviously true claim turned out to be true, this obviously false claim could be true too."

       That's bullshit, and it's why I doubt you when you say you do not believe in these bullshit "flat earth" theories. And I'm being kind. I could say you're just keeping them going for the same reason the trolls are.

       I am keeping noone going.  Like I said, many people answered my questions and presented me with new leads, new things to check out.  Flyyyyyyyyyy even gave me a legit reason as to WHY people may be pushing this Flat Earth Theory down our throats, other than to just discredit other conspiracies. That seems beneficial, and well worth the wrath of people like who, who no matter how obvious I make it that I am not a troll or a flat earth agent or a disinformation agent, would rather insult, than discuss.  Either way, I appreciate your input.   "The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy."

       Seems like you are just looking for an excuse to engage in an adverse conversation.  If your looking for a debate/argument with a flat earther, you have the wrong guy sorry.  I have come to the conclusion the earth is more likely than not flat.  Also Tom Brady is more likely than not generally aware.

       be flat, since Newton first explained it to us centuries ago.

       Dude, Truth is what I live for.  This post did its purpose.  I got some critical information both pro and con the flat earth theory. (1) I know why some people believe it.  (2) I know why most don't. (3) I know why some of those who do not believe it do not even want to HEAR about it and get incredibly hostile.  My question was genuine and I got some genuine responses.  I am now solid in my belief that the Earth is in deed round.  I am also personally classifying this theory as the same as the Annunaiki theory which is that it is here to provide disinformation, even though many who believe it may simply be confused and are not hostile intent.  I am NOT however going to keep entertaining your ignorant and rude comments.  We have had about 12 responses back and forth and all twelve times I have said the same thing, which is that I am not a damn troll nor an agent.  Instead of you saying "Ok man, glad you finally came around to the light", you keep insulting me. I am a Truth Seeker and an enemy of the Illuminati.  You keep insulting me, asking me if I believe in gravity? Since intelligent responses do not satisfy you, I decided perhaps gravy would calm you down, since you remind me of ed from Ed Edd and Eddie.

       Down vote me all you want.  All I did was ask a question.  You guys are bashing me for asking if the earth is flat. I did not tell anyone the Earth is flat.  I simply asked if you could tell me your opinion and provide me with some facts to disprove.  This is the same people who call people closed-minded for immediately disregarding Truth Seekers who preach about the Assassination of Kennedy, or discuss the Moon Landing.  and yet you bash me? I was simply asking for help in a sub-reddit I thought could help.

       That is such a lame and whiny excuse.  This is not the appropriate forum for ridiculous nonsense, but there are many opponents to this forum who would like to "slide" it into ignominy.  One tactic in play is the posting of Flat Earth Psychosis drivel to this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question you asked does not belong on this sub, and is so ridiculously stupid that its presence on this sub discredits the sub.  An outsider might think that this sub seriously entertains the psychotic fantasies of you flat earthers.

       Your comment karma is already negative for a reason.  Today, it will become more negative.  This is a good thing.  Reddit has an inherent function that squelches disruptive posters such as yourself.

       Thanks for your opinion.  Many people feel the same way about JFK Truthers, Moon Landing Truthers and people who believe in the illuminati.  Good thing we do not let single-minded people stop us Truth Seekers from...well seeking truth right? Again, I am not even a Flat Eather...I simple posed a question regarding a possible conspiracy theory that had been bugging me and figured you guys would have more answers that I.  I do not respect anything you have said, however I respect your right the say it.  The moment I cease to do that, I am not a true Truther.

       I have not said much of anything.  I simply asked for your opinion the Flat Earth Theory.  Actually..not even YOUR opinion specifically...If me asking about what some people deem a CONSPIRACY in a CONSPIRACY sub offends you, then by all means DO NOT ENGAGE IN THE DISCUSSION.  I have made ZERO pro Flat Earth statements.  I simply asked for facts and reasons why he/she has come to that conclusion.  Period.  Thanks for your imput, hope you have a nice day.

       Fuck you, the question doesn't belong here.  You don't have a right to engage in a DisInfo PsyOp.  Things are not morally relative.  You are absolutely in the wrong.

       You have no authority to dismiss me, and I won't be departing.  You still need to learn to spell, and you also need to learn that you have zero moral authority.  You are a forum slider, an opponent of actual communication.

       I am a Truth Seeker.  I seek truth. Period.  If I am not 100 percent sure of something I will attempt to find out.  I always look at both sides of the story and do not come to a conclusion until I do so.  I have prevented ZERO disinformation.  The people who come here to discuss do so on their own.  If the Flat Earth Theory is indeed, as you, most others, and even myself think is most-likely untrue, then this should be an easy and simple debate.  Instead of debating, we are reduced to name calling, trolling and flat out rudeness.  Also, no you may not fuck me.  I appreciate the offer.  However, I am not a fan of neckbeards =)

       The problem is, you don't
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       to come here to disprove the Flat Earth theory.  A normal person can do a very small amount of research and figure out that everything claimed by Flat Earthers is blatantly false.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why are you here, posting a question as if this were the appropriate subreddit for Flat Earth Psychosis?  I would assume you are either a victim of the DisInfo, so you think this is an appropriate sub, or a perpetrator of the DisInfo.  Either way, the mere presence of your post is discrediting to this sub, and the only morally correct thing you could possibly do is delete your post.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for
       <em>
        neckbeard
       </em>
       , hardly.  Unlike you, I can both spell and think.  I can imagine that, yes, a dummy who can't spell "global" and wonders if the earth is flat probably does have a neckbeard, and probably does sit in mommy's basement using the Internet.  I can't believe you would have a job above minimum wage, because you're clearly stupid.

       I love reddit.  I do believe that anyone may Join.  I feel anyone who is here just to bring disinformation, pain, or confusion should indeed go somewhere else.  I also believe that just because the majority believe that a question is dumb, should not mean that it should not be allowed.  Following your logic Greek philosopher Pythagoras would have been shunned when he first proposed the earth was round.  Why? Because the majority thought that was idiotic, the earth was "obviously flat, so they felt at that time". Luckily, we allow questions for this reason.

       Yea I get murded in the Funny section lol.  I actually posted this with -60 karma so i'd say -4 on a controversial topic is not too bad. Especially when I have the same 3 people downvoting every single one of my responses.  I'll accept that.  I gained some useful knowledge, or atleast a useful lead from Flyyyyyyyyyy up above.  Truth over Karma I say, so it is well worth it.  Thanks for entertaining me my friend.

       If they don’t matter, why are they on the site? Of course they matter. They’re part of hegelian dialectic. The site is built on that by people who fellate the concept.

       How can I be off topic when I am the one asking the question? I asked for people's view/belief and for their help so that I can make a proper determination.  Originally I posted a little about my personal conspiracy beliefs so people could understand why I am asking a question that many would find ridiculous, if that is a problem or distraction just ignore it and answer the proposed question.  Or better yet, if you believe I am off topic, simple ignore my question and move on the other countless Conspiracy Posts..... I find it disturbing to find such close-minded people in a "Conspiracy" Sub.

       The Flat Earth Theory, if true, would indeed be an incredible conspiracy, proving that NASA and many others are lieing to us.  How does that not qualify as a conspiracy? Again, I never said I was a Flat Earther...I am not.  I am simple a Truth Seeker, seeking truth.  Thanks for your opinion, no matter how rude it may be.

       I am not on the news shouting that the earth is flat.  I came to a sub that I felt had a bunch of similar minded people who would understand that, whether my question is dumb or not, they would at least understand WHY I might want to ask.  I am speaking to fellow conspiracy theorist asking for help and their opinion, not screaming on a stage shouting that I speak for all conspicy Theorists....Thanks for your opinion

       Wanting to ask if the Earth is flat is a stupid and lame excuse.  A normal person would not need to ask the Internet if the Earth is flat.  A normal person would be able to do some geometry and disprove the Flat Earth lies.  A normal person would go to a museum and look at a Coriolis Pendulum, or look at the moon, or go up in an airplane.

       IF you are very solid in your belief, then I understand why you feel so strongly.  I felt equally as strongly when I was a christian and anyone who doubted Jesus must have been a mi-guided idiot.  Turns out (in MY opinion) I was the misguided one.  Same with the globel elite, JFK Assissination (how could anyone ever let the President be killed and not know who did it right?....) The question becomes where do we draw the line that we no longer discuss things without insulting others.  I am sure many people have bashed you the same as you as bashing me right now for a certain Conspiracy that you truly belief.  The sad part is that I am not even a Flat Earther....I simply asked my fellow redditor's what info that had on this matter.  and on a more personal note. I do not live with my mother, I am NOT an agent, and even though you are an ass, I truly appreciate you taking the time to answer.

       OK, now I understand where you are coming from.  You can't spell, and you've been raised in a culture that told you that you have your own unique intelligence and bring value to the conversation.  That isn't true.  Some people are smarter than others, and you aren't smart.  You have absolutely nothing of value to add to any conversation.

       I'm not here to insult people in general.  But if a person is such a dumb ass that they wonder if the earth is flat, they have the rest of reddit and the internet to do so.  Posting it here is bullshit, and frankly I think you and the other mods are abdicating your responsibility to foster good discussion by allowing that shit.

       I disagree.  There is literally nowhere on reddit where someone can discuss flat earth theories without being ridiculed.  This sub exists to give people a platform to discuss what they want without having to worry about being shit on by others who don't even attempt to refute any of the claims but instead just attack them personally.  Sorry but that isn't going to fly here.

       If you can't resist attacking and insulting people simply don't comment.

       Because it’s wrong. Definitionally.
      </p>
      <p>
       The concept of rooting out conspiracy hinges on evidence FOR a conspiracy. Evidence, by definition, is FACTUAL INFORMATION either unknown to the general public or the knowledge thereof being suppressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone with a couple hundred dollars can buy a balloon and a ruggedized camera and see that the Earth isn’t fucking flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the only answer that these mental defectives will accept is seeing it for themselves, then put them all on a rocket and shoot them into space. It’s a win win. They get the proof they want and they’re out of our hair forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       But again, most of this bullshit is just people being paid to look stupid to discredit the concept of ‘conspiracy theory’ itself.

       Down vote me all you want.  All I did was ask a question.  You guys are bashing me for asking if the earth is flat. I did not tell anyone the Earth is flat.  I simply asked if you could tell me your opinion and provide me with some facts to disprove.  This is the same people who call people closed-minded for immediately disregarding Truth Seekers who preach about the Assassination of Kennedy, or discuss the Moon Landing.  and yet you bash me?

       So even though It is more likely than not that the earth IS round...I am not a complete Moron for asking if people have higher quality information that myself?  I think sliquidsnake would shoot me if given the chance...just for asking a dang question.

       Unfortunately, I am not much of a scientist. So many of the technical details escape my understanding.  I have more of a legal/monetary mind, for better or for worse.  I'd love to know more about the physics of the world.  If you happen to come across anything interesting i'd love to read your hypothesis and conclusion...dumbed-down version of course =)

       Yea I get murded in the Funny section lol.  I actually posted this with -60 karma so i'd say -4 on a controversial topic is not too bad. Especially when I have the same 3 people downvoting every single one of my responses.  I'll accept that.  I gained some useful knowledge, or atleast a useful lead from Flyyyyyyyyyy up above.  Truth over Karma I say, so it is well worth it.  Thanks for entertaining me my friend.

       I disagree.  There is literally nowhere on reddit where someone can discuss flat earth theories without being ridiculed.  This sub exists to give people a platform to discuss what they want without having to worry about being shit on by others who don't even attempt to refute any of the claims but instead just attack them personally.  Sorry but that isn't going to fly here.

       If you can't resist attacking and insulting people simply don't comment.
