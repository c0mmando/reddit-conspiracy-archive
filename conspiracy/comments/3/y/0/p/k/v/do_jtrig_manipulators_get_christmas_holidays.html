       I can see by your inept handwaving and lies that you aren't even qualified for their level of idiocy.
      </p>
      <p>
       'Edit: I just realized you meant that the building collapsed uniformly, so that means the structure had to lose integrity simultaneously across the entire structure, and your issue was with the "across the entire structure" part. The issue with this is all of the beams are connected, and in a progressive failure, the failure of one component causes the load on the others to become too high, causing them to also fail. I don't see how this isn't consistent with what you can see here.'
      </p>
      <p>
       how do you reconcile uniform collapse with 'progressive collapse'  with WTC7?  there's no 'progressive collapse'  - all structural support disappeared.  that's an observation.     the only 'progression' was the fucking explosive charges going off demolishing the columns all at once you dolt.    why do you think buildings are demolished, rather than a few fires set randomly and wait for the inevitable?  what a joke.

       Is it possible to sway the preponderance of evidence to the fire caused collapse? And I can also cast doubt on other evidence too. This isn't a hard question, unless of course you're unwilling to be open minded.

       you'd have to show a mechanism where those fires can effect a global collapse - uniform - at free fall acceleration over 8 stories (at least).   It's never happened to any steel frame building, and we keep building em out of steel.
      </p>
      <p>
       go for it.   of course it makes more sense to examine evidence for the most obvious cause - not the one that you have to handwave like NIST and fudge the data to get a result that isn't even close.
      </p>
      <p>
       see, people did examine the most likely cause - even if insurance companies refused.   scientists found explosives in the dust.   so what do you say to that evidence?  can you handwave and make it disappear?

       I thought you said you use scientific method.    Why don't you get a sample and repeat the experiment yourself.  That's the good thing about science.  You don't need to appeal to authority or discredit sources.

       I am not a chemist, and I probably do not possess the technical skills to carry out analysis for explosives residue in the dust of a collapsed building. I am also assuming you are not either, which means you did not do any analysis yourself. If I am wrong, please do share your findings. However, if I am not, I would like to know who told you there was explosives residue in the dust so I can evaluate the evidence. If I don't know the specifics of your claim, how can I hope to agree or disagree with it?

       Actually I am a chemist, and I've worked previously in a DSC lab.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets get a sample of the dust and do the experiment,  I know how to run it. We can compare against other samples of known thermitic content.

       see that peak, the blue one?  it's a highly energetic exotherm.  much better than even the substance it's compared to.   it means when you heat this substance that it becomes highly exothermic.   paint chips don't.

       of course, because you only believe in the official conspiracy based on authority that you'd need another authority to tell you the science is valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       the great thing about science is, you can repeat the experiment yourself. and confirm it.   go ahead.  I'm well satisfied with the methodology and techniques - also the chain of custody of the samples.   I bet there are plenty of samples you could have analylzed - run DSC on the red/gray chips and observe the iron microspheres formed on ignition.    Slam dunk.

       First off, yes, I do need the authority of other scientists. I do not know everything, and I am not well versed in this field. So, I rely on the process of peer review to help me sort out bad science from good science, like every other scientist.

       So is this you citing your expertise? I really would love the input of an expert. I know that it is a bit much to ask you to send me proof of your expertise, but I know

       I actually can't. I don't have a sample of the dust, the skills necessary to test the dust, or the knowledge to interpret the results. This is why I really want to be sure you have this knowledge before I take what you say to heart.

       get a chemist you trust to do it then.  do you not trust any scientists, or do you only trust the ones with authority?  do you see what's wrong with that picture?   science doesn't give a shit about your authority.    do the experiment.  surely the insurance companies have scientists.  why didn't they find the explosives before paying out billions?  they didn't even examine the obvious cause.   and you still hold on to your 'fire collapse' theory?  now that's faith in authority.

      <p>
       I'd like you to provide some evidence of your expertise. I would also love to see your data on the explosive residue in the dust, so I can see what you saw. You're claiming the tower was brought down by explosives, and I want to see your evidence.

       that's great.   I explained to you that you don't need mine, or any one else's credentials.   simply get a sample of the dust and run the analysis.  why didn't the insurance companies do it?  (it's obvious isn't it?)

       the evidence is in the dust.   do you need help getting a sample, or a DSC lab?  there are other faithers that have questioned the result too,  some have also repeated the experiment.

       Find a scientist that you trust then. Someone who has faith in authority like you do.  Why didn't any of the scientists from insurance companies or nist test for explosives?  it's the most obivous cause.

       if someone can't explain to you how the experiment works and what the result is, then they might as well be doing magic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm confident you can understand the experiment, and I'm certain you could run it after a little training.     You understand what a photograph depicts, even though you don' t understand CCD physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone can run the experiment and get a different result, then that's significant.  So far, nobody has run the experiment to get a different result, and the official scientists didn't even test for explosives?   are you ok with that?

       To avoid getting bogged down in how we handle information that is beyond our expertise, I will drop that. However, I think that your approach might not work too well for areas that are far outside of your expertise.

       So, moving on: all I am trying to do right now is find your data on the explosive residue in the tower debris. Once I find that, I would love to discuss it, but I would like to see the data. I am giving you the opportunity to present it, because I can't be sure what your evidence is.

       I don't know what you mean by source.  It explains the scientific determination well and also shows the DSC results, amongst others.    Do you mean the source of the samples?  Do you question it?   Do you want the names of scientists that did the experiments?  I think several are mentioned in this article.

       I do not have your data. I am questioning nothing yet, I am simply trying to make sure we can agree on a set of data to work with. You see, I am worried that if I disagree with that article I linked, you're just going to say "well it isn't my data so those complaints don't matter." Are you going to do that?

       Edit: there appears to be some issue with the DSC for the chips being performed in air while the DSC for the thermite reference material was performed in an inert atmosphere, but I am having a hard time sorting it out.

       Millette has the samples and can run the DSC in inert atmosphere.   The reference material was run in air - at least the scientists indicated that they had done so originally.

      <p>
       There are iron spheres produced in the reaction.   Paint chips do not account for either the DSC result (gives a completely different long broad exotherm)

       Isn't this is a large flaw though? From what I am reading, the lower ignition temperature and subsequent burning in an atmosphere is consistent with the paint burning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, you say that burning paint is not consistent with the DSC results. Have we taken a sample of the paint-primer mix used in the towers and compared that against the DSC of the chips? Or do we even have a graph of the DSC results of ANY paint compared against the chips?

       I have to ask you the same.   why do you believe the story of 19 hijackers?  there's no black boxes, no DNA, no video of them in the airports that day, 19 of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       also the one black box that was produced shows a crazy flight path, that hani hanjour couldn't fly well, let alone experienced pilots.   instead of diving into the pentagon, he does a 360 and pulls impossible G's..  and all that security at the pentagon and we get 5 inconclusive frames.

       To move me to an agnostic stance, you would need to either poke holes in my theory (that the towers collapsed due to fires and being hit by planes) or show strong evidence for a competing theory to a level that it becomes more viable than the alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Poking holes in my theory is straight forward, simply take a look at the analyses by NIST and show how they couldn't have happened, either with computer models or mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
       To give evidence for a competing theory, my primary stopping points are the lack of conclusive evidence for explosives (no seismograph evidence of detonations, no well conducted experiments of the "thermite" in the dust, no feasible way to rig the buildings with explosives) and the sheer breadth of the conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if you can give me conclusive evidence of explosives or thermite, I will gladly take at least an agnostic stance on the whole issue.

       I believe NIST because what they say agrees with my knowledge of physics and computer modeling. As for what I believe on the building collapses, the NIST reports are a good place to start.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, easier to call me a living contradiction than it is to show how there's a contradiction. You also haven't given me what would change your stance to agnosticism. I'd like you to share that with me. I seriously doubt "seeing it happen again" is your criterion for believing something, because then you would not believe any event that occurs once which is just asinine because we experience unique events all the time.

       don't be ridiculous.  Bazant has been fully debunked.    Your conspiracy theory rests only on faith in authority - all the expected evidence is missing/covered up - and everything given to us requires impossible belief in coincidence.

       you can watch the building exploding and hear it, and listen to authoritarian witnesses describe it.
      </p>

       I must ask you, since you pretend to understand science - how would you account for the energy of WTC1 and 2 collapses, the volumes of hot dust, huge sections thrown laterally, VISIBLE explosions.   you really make every excuse in the book to believe what you do.  I can only call it indoctrinated.   it's not an insult, but a sad fact.

       Then debunk Bazant, or link to a source that does if you are unable to.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for eyewitnesses claiming to see explosions, how do you differentiate those from eruptions caused by air being forced out of the collapsing towers? Additionally, where are the seismographs showing explosions?
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, what do you mean by accounting for the energy of the collapse? Are you referring to the pulverized concrete?  Bazant does the calculation of the gravitational potential energy and shows it is sufficient to pulverize the concrete, but if you have a source debunking him I'll retract that.

       Isn't it convenient to just make claims then not provide evidence? Again, with the whole "it's easier to throw accusations than it is to make points." Come on, if you're right, just explain why. It's all I have been asking for this whole time.

       Okay, here's what I can deduce from the links.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Szuladzinski paper tried to say some of the assumptions made in the Bazant papers are wrong. I am not sure if this is correct or not. I understand the physics in the paper, but I am not skilled enough in engineering to be able to say whether those assumptions are wrong. The reason I am not sure of the paper is mainly the journal they chose. They didn't try to write a letter to the editors of the original Bazant paper, and didn't try (or tried and got rejected) from the journal Bazant published in. Instead, the published in a journal that I can't even find an impact factor for.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, all of this being said, I will gladly step back to an agnostic stance on the Bazant paper. To convince me they're wrong, I'd like to see publications in more serious journals.

       yes, how about you articulate in your own words, how progressive collapse reconciles with free fall acceleration.   NIST couldn't do it.   the facade comes down in one piece.   if there had been progressive column failure, how could the facade come down uniformly?   do you think the interior of the building simultaneously and immediately separated fron the rest of the building?  are you forgetting some structural elements?  NIST is.

      <p>
       So, do you
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to know how and why that building came down, or do you just want to maintain your current position and not have it challenged? If it's the latter, why did you ask for information in the first place?

       Those reports are written by PhDs in structural engineering. I think their knowledge of how buildings are assembled is a little more advanced than yours.

       You asked for information. I provided it. Now you want no part of it.

      <p>
       Unfought fires on multiple floors combined with insufficient fireproofing on critical structural elements and an improperly restrained construction type caused a girder to expand and a critical support column to buckle. That caused a chain reaction of support failures on the interior of the building, which eventually led to the outer facade collapsing.

       garbage in garbage out.      the girder can NOT walk off it's connection, there are other structural elements, besides, not as much heating could be done, and the facade would have deformed, not come down in one piece.  you coud model that if it were true - also no steel frame skyscraper in history after burning for many hours has come down uniformly at free fall acceleration.   you are handwaving.

       Why would they need one, when main demographic of Reddit (White young adult males from the Anglosphere) are almost exclusively useful idiots who will fight to their death to protect the very forces which enslave them?

       For every shill on Reddit (aside from all the obvious corporate shilling and advertisement, which is like a solid 50% of the front page day in and day out) there's 10+ useful idiots.

       To avoid getting bogged down in how we handle information that is beyond our expertise, I will drop that. However, I think that your approach might not work too well for areas that are far outside of your expertise.

       So, moving on: all I am trying to do right now is find your data on the explosive residue in the tower debris. Once I find that, I would love to discuss it, but I would like to see the data. I am giving you the opportunity to present it, because I can't be sure what your evidence is.

      <p>
       I don't claim to be an agnostic on the issue. This can be seen in me telling you what you need to do to make me agnostic.

      <p>
       Next, the models in question are the discussions of the WTC7 model, as well as a model of collapse for the twin towers by Bazant in a paper titled "What Did and Did not Cause Collapse
of WTC Twin Towers in New York."

      <p>
       I will ask again, what would change your mind to be agnostic on the issue? I answered the question. Why can't you?
