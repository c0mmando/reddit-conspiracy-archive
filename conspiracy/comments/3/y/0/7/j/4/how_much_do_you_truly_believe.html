        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just wondering, where do you draw the line on what&#39;s really happening. Is it just money and corruption and lobbyist influence that control the direction of the US. Is there really an Illuminati(a small group of powerful elite) dictating policy? Is there a large portion of influential people working towards a &quot;new world order&quot; because they feel its best? Does it go as far as demonic influence(i&#39;ve been an atheist for a while and there definitely seems to be some obsession with Luciferian doctrine the further you go up, just sayin&#39;)  or reptiles(lol)? Or is it all false and most politicians are just incompetent? I&#39;m just looking to see what people think is really happening.</p>

<p>P.S.- I don&#39;t care what anyone says but rampant pedophilia in Hollywood and within the elites is 100% true and very fucked up</p>

The human race needs to be informed in order to prevent ourselves and society from being a hell on earth, on the contrary we should all strive for heaven(or what our collective ideas of a utopia is) on earth. To think that EVERY single person that is part of government and high society is looking out for the interest of the masses is close to retarded, therefore, the rest of us have to be vigilant in order to sustain transparency and to find the right people to lead us forward into what we shall define ourselves as a race.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our whole existence is doomed to be fucked up even with no outside interference. It&#39;s sad to admit that humans are fucked up in general. It&#39;s in our nature to be helpful and kind to each other face to face but get in traffic and the car behind you gets too close and the first impulse is to brake check them and wave the bird. Humans are extremely vulnerable to a life changing emotional overreaction. 
See any news story where a cop kills someone, usually the cop and the victim start off on the wrong track and the events escalate and end in death. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not really religious but I do believe there is something to the Garden of Eden story where we were cast out of the garden and given free will. Our life is a test and we are tested constantly. I used to think I could get to a position where I would be ok and things would be easier but as soon as I did things changed. Life is constant change and always moving. You may get a good job and married then have kids and everything seems great - then you get laid off or get a divorce or you get sick or your wife gets sick or something happens to your kids...  You are really never safe and always being tested. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the most basic and most obvious level, it&#39;s the Jews who are running things in Western nations. They&#39;ve taken great care to gain control over the key aspects of society that allow them to control its direction of progress.</p>

<p>On a higher, more abstract level, we must ask, &quot;Why are the Jews doing this?&quot; They are intent on destroying the authority of Christianity in the West, and on committing genocide against the white race. Why? Surely they can recognize that their chosen course of action will work against their own best interests, as Muslims rush in to fill the vacuum created by a crippled Christianity?</p>

<p>The answer is that the Jews are instruments of a higher purpose that is, at its root, demonic. Beneath the surface of the human race, there are intelligences at work directing the course of our future. When we stood on the brink of space, after the Apollo moon missions, they pulled us back and kept us bound to the Earth. They are responsible for the continuing warfare around the world. Currently, they are pressing for a New World Order that will destroy nationalism and take away the ability of a sovereign people to protect themselves against external domination and control. We are seeing this push in the eagerness of Obama to force as many non-white immigrants into America as possible, and in the flood of Muslims into Europe from the Middle East and Africa. These trends are destructive of national integrity and personal freedoms alike, but they are being forced upon us, in defiance of reason. Most of us know that we are on an insane course, but we continue on that course.</p>

<p>The demonic intelligences are not corporeal, but they can act through both groups of human beings, such as the Jews, and through individual humans, such as Obama. Their overall purpose is to spread chaos and disorder. Why they wish to do this remains a mystery. They prevented America from moving into the solar system. Now they seek to destroy the power of the white race, and to render Christianity powerless to stand against them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you remember hearing about the &quot;synagogue of Satan&quot; in your Bible? That&#39;s why Jews have survived. That&#39;s why Jews exist in this world. They are Satan&#39;s little helpers. But Satan is a simplistic concept for children. The Jews are controlled by demonic forces of this world, but not in this world. These forces are intelligent, and they can control not only individuial human beings, but large groups of humans such as cults, ethnic groups, and even whole  races of human beings. They are determined to crush Christianity. Therefore, we know that Christianity is their enemy, and that Christian moral teachings give us power against them. They are using Jews and Muslims as their tools of chaos and destruction. Therefore we know that Jews and Muslims are both enemies of Christianity, and of lawful order in this world.</p>
