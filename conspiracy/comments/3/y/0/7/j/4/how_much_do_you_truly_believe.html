       Just wondering, where do you draw the line on what's really happening. Is it just money and corruption and lobbyist influence that control the direction of the US. Is there really an Illuminati(a small group of powerful elite) dictating policy? Is there a large portion of influential people working towards a "new world order" because they feel its best? Does it go as far as demonic influence(i've been an atheist for a while and there definitely seems to be some obsession with Luciferian doctrine the further you go up, just sayin')  or reptiles(lol)? Or is it all false and most politicians are just incompetent? I'm just looking to see what people think is really happening.

       P.S.- I don't care what anyone says but rampant pedophilia in Hollywood and within the elites is 100% true and very fucked up

       its a fuzzy line of increasingly blurry confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       like, im pretty sure (95%) nasa is lying their asses off about outer space, but i cant say with any confidence (5%) that, say, aliens are ultimately controlling the vatican. then again, i cant rule it out entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       conversely, i do know that the war on terror is an absolute fraud (99.9%), for example. but im always ready for a big mind-fvck that proves the 0.1% correct.

       The media tries very hard to make the world seem like a small place. They generalize everything and make everyone dumbed down. At the same time they serve the interests of few individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe there is a group of people hellbent on world domination. They push globalization on everyone's throats and if they don't abide with them, they hit them with sanctions or do worse things.

       I never took the Illuminati theories seriously until I saw the
       <a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/economist-2015-cover-filled-cryptic-symbols-dire-predictions/">
        infamous January 2015 Economist cover
       </a>
       and realized that they published the date of the Paris attacks (11/13/15) months in advance. Taken in combination with the rest of the symbolism on the cover, I don't believe those numbers corresponding to the attack are mere coincidence. I'm still sorting out
       <em>
        what
       </em>
       I believe on this front, but I'm not as quick to dismiss Illuminati discussion as I used to be.

       I have never believed in the Illuminati, but it is naive to believe that the elite aren't pooling their influence to increase their wealth. We have seen very few major changes and events, in the last 30 years, that were not to the benefit of the billionaire class.

       I believe a lot of shit goes down that is sometimes inevitable, so we can't always look at the negatives (which this sub is full of sometimes and I won't blame anyone), but I try to stay informed and not make any final decisions because some press or ALT-press told me THIS happened. 
The human race needs to be informed in order to prevent ourselves and society from being a hell on earth, on the contrary we should all strive for heaven(or what our collective ideas of a utopia is) on earth. To think that EVERY single person that is part of government and high society is looking out for the interest of the masses is close to retarded, therefore, the rest of us have to be vigilant in order to sustain transparency and to find the right people to lead us forward into what we shall define ourselves as a race.

       Our whole existence is doomed to be fucked up even with no outside interference. It's sad to admit that humans are fucked up in general. It's in our nature to be helpful and kind to each other face to face but get in traffic and the car behind you gets too close and the first impulse is to brake check them and wave the bird. Humans are extremely vulnerable to a life changing emotional overreaction. 
See any news story where a cop kills someone, usually the cop and the victim start off on the wrong track and the events escalate and end in death.

       I'm not really religious but I do believe there is something to the Garden of Eden story where we were cast out of the garden and given free will. Our life is a test and we are tested constantly. I used to think I could get to a position where I would be ok and things would be easier but as soon as I did things changed. Life is constant change and always moving. You may get a good job and married then have kids and everything seems great - then you get laid off or get a divorce or you get sick or your wife gets sick or something happens to your kids...  You are really never safe and always being tested.

       It's nothing supernatural. It's the (no longer Italian) mafia running this country and trying to run the world. Big money racketeers who buy judges and politicians and turn free states and people into debt-ridden slaves. They are everywhere, from Port Authority to major American universities, and they are instrumental to instigating war worldwide. Soros and his gang, the only thing they give has to be worth 10x in the investment.

       You can only describe what you can see. The rest is ghosts and speculation, and the kind of stuff that gives real seekers of truth a bad name.

       I don't think the Illuminati call themselves that, but yes, small groups of smart people run this world, always have, and always will. In a way they believe they are evolutionarily superior, and in a way they are right.

       On the most basic and most obvious level, it's the Jews who are running things in Western nations. They've taken great care to gain control over the key aspects of society that allow them to control its direction of progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a higher, more abstract level, we must ask, "Why are the Jews doing this?" They are intent on destroying the authority of Christianity in the West, and on committing genocide against the white race. Why? Surely they can recognize that their chosen course of action will work against their own best interests, as Muslims rush in to fill the vacuum created by a crippled Christianity?
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is that the Jews are instruments of a higher purpose that is, at its root, demonic. Beneath the surface of the human race, there are intelligences at work directing the course of our future. When we stood on the brink of space, after the Apollo moon missions, they pulled us back and kept us bound to the Earth. They are responsible for the continuing warfare around the world. Currently, they are pressing for a New World Order that will destroy nationalism and take away the ability of a sovereign people to protect themselves against external domination and control. We are seeing this push in the eagerness of Obama to force as many non-white immigrants into America as possible, and in the flood of Muslims into Europe from the Middle East and Africa. These trends are destructive of national integrity and personal freedoms alike, but they are being forced upon us, in defiance of reason. Most of us know that we are on an insane course, but we continue on that course.
      </p>
      <p>
       The demonic intelligences are not corporeal, but they can act through both groups of human beings, such as the Jews, and through individual humans, such as Obama. Their overall purpose is to spread chaos and disorder. Why they wish to do this remains a mystery. They prevented America from moving into the solar system. Now they seek to destroy the power of the white race, and to render Christianity powerless to stand against them.

       No. "Reptilians" is code for the human beings who operate cognitively from the reptilian brain core rooted in all beings.

       Do you remember hearing about the "synagogue of Satan" in your Bible? That's why Jews have survived. That's why Jews exist in this world. They are Satan's little helpers. But Satan is a simplistic concept for children. The Jews are controlled by demonic forces of this world, but not in this world. These forces are intelligent, and they can control not only individuial human beings, but large groups of humans such as cults, ethnic groups, and even whole  races of human beings. They are determined to crush Christianity. Therefore, we know that Christianity is their enemy, and that Christian moral teachings give us power against them. They are using Jews and Muslims as their tools of chaos and destruction. Therefore we know that Jews and Muslims are both enemies of Christianity, and of lawful order in this world.
