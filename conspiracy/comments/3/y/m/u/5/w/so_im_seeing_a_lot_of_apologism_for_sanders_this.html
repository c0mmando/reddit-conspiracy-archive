        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">0</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-12-29 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/TheWiredWorld.html">TheWiredWorld</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://truthinmedia.com/bernie-sanders-calls-for-sweeping-gun-ban-that-would-outlaw-all-self-defense-firearms/">First and foremost</a>, consider that Sanders voted for the Assault Weapons Ban in the 90s. I will elaborate on this in a second.</p>

<p>I implore those of you that want to see real change in this country, and are passionately on a crusade for Sanders, to calm your emotions and take a step back. Not 10 months ago, it seemed that EVERYONE (but more importantly the demographic that is currently for Sanders) were &quot;awake&quot;, and just knew with every fiber of their being that all forms of popular media were utterly bought and sold, that anyone getting any air time were complicit with the establishment (aka, playing &quot;the game&quot;), that Murdoch and his cronies completely stifled the dissemination of information - and all of this was corroborated by Ross Perot and later how they treated Ron Paul.</p>

<p>Except when Bernie Sanders starts running for president.</p>

<p>It may seem like I&#39;m attacking one issue of Sanders, but to be fair, it is, and it may not feel like it at times, arguably the most important issue for a people to remain free - the right to bear arms.</p>

<p>So why does him voting for the Assault Weapons Ban, and calling for more banning, especially his words of &quot;civilian guns&quot; matter? Because it was based completely on mythical, authoritarian, ignorant, and illogical means. Even excluding the fact that it reduced rights (just for this argument), its entire reasoning was introduced purely by fallacious, as well as made up reasons. To elaborate - <strong>there is no such thing as an &quot;assault weapon&quot;</strong>. It is a term that was made up FOR the argument to ban them. It is classic propaganda speak. An example of this is <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KLXDV3L.jpg">illustrated in this image</a> - that floated around social media for a while by gun control advocates (the likes of Which Bernie Sanders is himself).</p>

<p>The thing about that picture is - and partly what makes it both cringey and infuriating - is that both of those guns are THE EXACT SAME GUN. One is not &quot;higher power&quot; than the other. They&#39;re the exact same caliber, it is not suddenly automatic when it becomes black and scary. It&#39;s just that as soon as it gets black furniture, and a different handle, it becomes an &quot;assault weapon&quot;. That&#39;s literally it. This is what they banned. They DID ban hunting rifles - or at the very least, what they <em>didn&#39;t</em> perceive to be hunting rifles. This is the type of thinking that authoritarians and those that support him have. This is how they, and government, creeps from one &quot;inch&quot;, to taking a mile. And none of what I&#39;m saying is speculation - it is historical fact. The Assault Weapons Ban in the 90s was a culmination of preying on fear and ignorance, and the early success of such gun control groups.</p>

<p>This example alone shows that he is authoritarian, not educated in what he claims to be, and will use government in any and every way he can to intrude on the rights of Americans. Extrapolate.</p>

<p>He also supports Israel. This wouldn&#39;t be much, and the argument by itself opens itself up to be aligned with ignorant racists, but the fact of the matter is that the Zionist government of Israel is one of the most Right-Wing extremist governments in history - practicing protectionism, the very same protectionism that the U.S. used to practice, but was called &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;economically close minded&quot;.</p>

<p>So how can he simultaneously claim to be progressive on nearly every issue, and support <em>one</em> of the least progressive governments on the planet? Do Sanders supporters not see a &quot;do as I say, not as I do&quot; tinge here?</p>

<p>Anyway, I just wanted to clear this up, and actually provide some reasons against the circle jerk.</p>

<p>P.S. This is a question to Bernie Sanders supporters: what would you do if Sanders pulled out and endorsed Hillary Clinton? Would you perform mental gymnastics to justify it, or would you atleast consider a change of stance?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so whats the alternative then? Hilary? the wolf in hawks clothing?</p>

<p>trump the unapologetic racist? </p>

<p>he has made his opinions on guns pretty clear he is against assault weapons but thats about as far as he goes with gun control.</p>

<p>iirc his state is one of the most pro-gun out there and hes been against gun control with the exception of assault weapons.</p>

<p>as for pro-isreal wtf are you talking about? hes pro-two state solution and always has been.</p>

<p>frankly you seem like one of the shillary accounts just trying to falsely represent his views.</p>

<p>please link ANYTHING showing he supports Israel, or gun control beyond assault weapons, because in all of my digging i have found zero evidence supporting either of those claims.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vermont has very few gun control laws, and has among the most permissive laws in the nation regarding the purchase and open or concealed carry of firearms. The state&#39;s rural character, along with its strong hunting and outdoor sports traditions, have contributed to the state&#39;s permissive gun policies. Gun dealers are required to keep a record of all handgun sales. It is illegal to carry a gun on school premises or in a courthouse. State law preempts local governments from regulating the possession, ownership, transfer, carrying, registration or licensing of firearms.[1]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>nope canadian here.
and yeah i&#39;ve actually read the 2nd amendment and i agree that it gives MILITIAs the right to bear arms, now if you want to really reach and twist things you can apply that to all private citizens.</p>

<p>i mean if you want to talk about taking something and twisting an agenda your interpretation of it is the one that has been twisted.</p>

<p>i am all for people having guns, and hell to an extent even teh &quot;assault weapons&quot; but if you really are a knowledgeable gun owner banning the high ammo magazines and military grade guns is not about to disarm the public, a good 30/30 or  a .306 is going to do more in a &quot;protect yourself from your government&quot; scenario than any AR-15 or whatever will.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t support the assault weapon ban, frankly because it won&#39;t work anyway.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t see why the gun nuts are so worked up over the issue, he is a lot less likely than hilary is to actually &quot;take your guns&quot; and he seems like the only one who would even care to ask the people what they wanted and consider it. the only way he could just take all your assault weapons would be an executive order, which frankly i think Obama is going to put in place before the summer so i think this is just a stupid reason to try and push people to abandon sanders.</p>

<p>i mean ffs what are your other options realistically</p>

<p>No! It&#39;s not about fucking, militias. Jesus Christ. So many people wanna chime in, but have no idea what the fucking 2nd amendment is. That is not the point. The point is, that the average citizen shall be allowed to have/be armed equally to the average front line military soldier (for self protection and tyranny). You don&#39;t have to be in a militia to be armed, but you are required to be armed if you join the militia. You&#39;re Canadian. Worry less about what our gun laws are here and focus on fixing your fucked up Country also. Justin boy and his grand pappy set the the blue print for our (US) Fed/Social security. Also, you are still kneeling to the Crown. Fuck off, respectfully. </p>

<p>just to point out, at the time this was written, you still had to muzzle load your power and charge. so yeah anything you could even loosely consider an &quot;assault rifle&quot; is very clearly out side the scope of the amendment to any reasonable person.</p>

<p>Government can change in an instant. It&#39;s your <strong>responsibility</strong> in this country as a citizen to defend your constitution and country, by force, if required. Owning a weapon or two is somewhat necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>nope canadian here.
and yeah i&#39;ve actually read the 2nd amendment and i agree that it gives MILITIAs the right to bear arms, now if you want to really reach and twist things you can apply that to all private citizens.</p>

<p>i mean if you want to talk about taking something and twisting an agenda your interpretation of it is the one that has been twisted.</p>

<p>i am all for people having guns, and hell to an extent even teh &quot;assault weapons&quot; but if you really are a knowledgeable gun owner banning the high ammo magazines and military grade guns is not about to disarm the public, a good 30/30 or  a .306 is going to do more in a &quot;protect yourself from your government&quot; scenario than any AR-15 or whatever will.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t support the assault weapon ban, frankly because it won&#39;t work anyway.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t see why the gun nuts are so worked up over the issue, he is a lot less likely than hilary is to actually &quot;take your guns&quot; and he seems like the only one who would even care to ask the people what they wanted and consider it. the only way he could just take all your assault weapons would be an executive order, which frankly i think Obama is going to put in place before the summer so i think this is just a stupid reason to try and push people to abandon sanders.</p>
