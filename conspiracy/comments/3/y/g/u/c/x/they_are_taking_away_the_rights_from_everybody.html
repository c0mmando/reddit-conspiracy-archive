       On the one hand this is dumb. On the other it's absolutely stupid. I'm trans* for the record.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think transitioning across the gender binary is stupid. I'm uncomfortable with my birth gender because it's limiting and restrictive. Why would I want to switch to the "opposite" gender that has roles that are just as limiting and restrictive?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm firmly in the trans* camp that advocates moving beyond the gender binary. I don't deny sexual biology. I just think that it shouldn't be a pretext for limiting and restricting choices people want to make.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being an enormous asshole about adhering to gender roles is just as shitty regardless of if you're cis or trans.

       You say you're Trans, and then continue to throw most other Trans people under the bus simply because they happen to be different to you, and you base your disrespect on a complete lack of understanding about the whole thing? Wow.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not Trans because being a guy was "limiting and restrictive". No, I needed to transition
       <em>
        across the gender binary

       because Gender Dysphoria very seriously affected my life for a long time.

       Disagreeing with someone is not throwing someone under the bus. The world doesn't owe you anything. Everyone has to play "roles" in this society that they don't like. The way to solve your problems is not to have the state start enforcing your whims on other people.

       Way to exercise your right to downvote me. I'd like to know how you equate what I just said with "throwing most other trans people under a bus" before trying to explain why you must be mistaken.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only represent myself. In no way does my experience invalidate yours. I fully advocate your right to transition across the gender binary. In my situation, that was not the solution for dealing with my own crippling dysphoria.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, I find gender roles to be stupid. If your transition has nothing to do with adhering to those gender roles then I'm not talking about transfolk like yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm talking about transfolk and cisfolk alike who endorse and consequently pressure people into fitting into neat, binary, gender roles that defy all my empirical knowledge of the full diversity of human gender expression.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think everyone has their own unique gender and that's just fine. It just really gets my panties in a wad when people start telling one another how to live their lives.

       I equate what you said to throwing other Trans people under a bus, because you're calling all binary-identifying Trans people stupid, as part of your saying that punishing people for intentionally using incorrect pronouns is stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gender Roles are archaic and unnecessary, but that has nothing to do with respecting a person's identity and not using the wrong pronouns.

       I'm calling the gender binary stupid. I'm not singling out binary-identifying people for being trans or cis but for being binary. How can't you see that?

      <p>
       I think all people should be able to use all bathrooms. I think all people should be able to identify as themselves. I think laws are stupid. I disapprove of these stupid laws.

      <p>
       Disrespecting a person's gender identity is an asshole move. Are we going to make it illegal to call a guy a sissy? Is it going to be illegal to call a cop a pig? How about calling a politician a turd sandwich?

       Slippery slope aside, this is all my opinion and I'm sad people are so indoctrinated into statist ideology that the first solution is always punitive legal action.

       Dafuq? Pretty sure society didn't give me a penis (male), biology did. Are there trans gendered wolves? I've yet to see that......

       Pretty sure you've never read so much as a paragraph on gender studies. Gender =\= sexual anatomy.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, third gender categories have
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_gender">
        existed across human culture and history
       </a>
       . AFAIK, this has nothing to do with hermaphroditism but is a social construct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_systems">
        more examples
       </a>
       that should ultimately lead you to the conclusion that gender roles are societally determined.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did biology give you boxers, jeans, muscle mass, a sports coat and a $1000 watch, or was that society?
      </p>
      <p>
       Society gave me all those things AND dresses, heels, tits, and a taste for unagi.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure wolves identify as wolves, not men nor women.

       What about age?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is age a social construct? Sorta depends on what you mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the most part no. Age is measures of time. Our measurements are based on natural phenomena. The names for those measurements are social constructs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have major issues with gerontocracy. The ideas of categorizing people into groups such as "adults," "children," and "the elderly" are social constructs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Different cultures define these differently and people don't age at a uniform rate.

       I hesitated on answering the age question. I agree with you ultimately. Like other social construct it is designed around and from natural patterns but it's certainly designed by people.

       They do matter because if thousands of people are clamoring for the criminalization of self-expression then I hope they all can find a nice spot of land over there somewhere to settle together and not bother the rest of us with their repressiveness. I pity the poor soul that foolishly incarnates into one of those cesspits.
      </p>

       For to criminalize the defiance of assigned genders is just as liberal and collectivist as criminalizing the defiance of addressing gender deviants "incorrectly." I'm against that kind of statist swag even if it means assholes get to run about and troll me with their opinions on how I'm a symptom of the death of their culture, that I'm ill/unwell, and that it'd be best to put me out of my misery for everyone involved. Because if I kill myself over that shit, that's my own decision and I can take responsibility for my own actions.

       The "little people" was a reference to Blade Runner and it was a stupid thing to say because this crusader got under my skin. I've got nothing against dwarfs, unlike the the author of this bigoted link this crusader posted in a comment somewhere around here.

       You're entitled to your opinion, just like I'm entitled to act like an idiot. It's when idiots with opinions choose to act in unison to pass repressive laws that oppression starts to happen and people should face all the repercussions for those decisions that a murderer or rapist should face for theirs.

       If I asked for medical help they'd probably try to cut off my penis. I'm managing just fine on my own. It's attitudes like yours that give rise to eugenics and genocide. You should maybe reconsider being a fascist butthole before you spew more shit all over this thread.

       No, that’d be psychological “help”. You need medical help because you have a legitimate mental illness for which there is a cure.

       The entire trans movement is suffering from a severe case of self-delusion. What we have here is a legalized case of feeding the psychosis. Instead of pointing out the psychosis and urging them to seek help, it is now illegal to do so and so you must pander to their idiocy. I'm sorry, but you are not a special snowflake. Being male or female, man or woman is an inescapable fact of biology, written in our genes: XY for men, XX for women. Yes, you do occasionally get an XXY, but those are freaks of nature (in the literal sense, as in this happens so rarely as to be beyond an outlier).

       Putting on a dress and calling yourself a girl's name won't make you a woman if you were born a man, likewise putting on pants and cutting your hair and calling yourself a man's name won't make you a man if you were born a woman. Nor will mutilating yourself change that. Cutting off your penis and giving yourself an axe wound will not make you a woman. You are not capable of carrying a child, nor have your genes changed.

       There are two genders. Two. Man and Woman. There is nothing in between. I'm sorry, but there is not. And I'm not going to pander to your mental illness and pretend there are. Nor are you a half-wolf-half-dragon planet-kin omniamorous heteroslug. This bullshit needs to stop, soon, or we're going to be stuck with
       <em>
        an entire generation
       </em>
       of that.

       On a side note, next time I visit new york I'm going to identify as an attack helicopter and start throwing law suits around for not using my proper pronouns of heli, copt, and ter.

       Imagine going back 100 years, to 1915, and telling a crowd of New Yorkers about this law.  They would simply not believe it possible.  It's only because of 100 years of the Fed and our controlled media that people have utterly lost the ability to reason, and believe only what they hear on their TV.  Truly, all is lost.
