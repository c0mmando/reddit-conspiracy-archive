       It's a metaphor for the core reptilian brain stem that is driven by the most primal urges, and at the root of the "service to self" types who are fucking us over every day. Explaining it an actual physical transformation may be what keeps Icke alive.

       Currently we are.  Nothing has opposed humanity, except nature, which we've learned to control/subjugate/mitigate against.  And no, it scares the fuck outta me.

      <p>
       There are probably civilizations billions of years older than us.  They just don't care about the bacteria that is humanity, relatively speaking.  So why should I care about what they do to/for/about us?  We have no control over their decisions.

       a movement started by a delirious individual who twists a portion of evidence without addressing the counter evidence like any good hypothesis does. I believe it got such a big buy-in by the general populace because like any difficult time, finding a scape-goat for why things are crap is the best way to justify not changing.

       Lol, its a good agenda to push someone's belief, such as AAT. like one above replier said, its hard to refute it, its difficult to prove a negative. Like Georgio Tsoukalos does, he always says "Aliens? Could be" to anything because you can disprove aliens dont exist until you cover the entire universe with irefutible proof

       Children of the Matrix by David Icke is the spark of the phenomenon, read that book and see the insane connections in it. He even invokes Zachariah Sitchin, who's translations of the stones from Sumeria were proven to be bunk and basically a fantastical story he made up

       Ancient astronaut theorists believe that the requiring theme of snakes throughout the ancient world is ancient man's interpretation of the double helix shape of a DNA strand. It relates to the role that ancient aliens had in tampering with hominid DNA to propel human evolution. According to this idea, the mention of reptilian forms in the ancient world springs from this initial interpretation of the double helix as two intertwined snakes. Man was taught about DNA by the aliens, or the aliens utilized the imagery as a symbol and man was witnessed to it and gave it their own meaning but continued to associated with the "gods" that "made" them. The idea is not that ancient aliens where reptilian themselves, but that man associated them with the symbol. If you subscribe to the ancient alien theory, it makes sense. I do believe I might have seen somewhere on the webs that Mr. Icke himself at one point stated that his discourse was satire but no one took notice.

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Icke">
        David Icke

       , who suffered a mental breakdown.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He wrote in 1993 that he had felt out of control during the press conference. He heard his voice predict the end of the world, and was appalled. "I was speaking the words, but all the time I could hear the voice of the brakes in the background saying, 'David, what the hell are you saying?'". His predictions were splashed all over the next day's front pages, to his great dismay.

       A friend and I came up with an idea while smoking weed a few weeks ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reptilian motif is older than civilisation and associated with 'forbidden knowledge'. Perhaps the most famous ancient representation of 'reptilians' are the so-called
       <a href="http://www.ancient-origins.net/sites/default/files/field/image/lizardmen.jpg">
        Ubaid Lizardmen.
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Drugs have always played a role in human society and it is very probable that they also played a role in the evolution of our minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Users of DMT, among others substances, have reported psychedelic meetings with beings that some describe as angelic, others as alien and still others as reptilian. It is therefore possible that things like the Ubaid figurines are connected to the use of a DMT-like drug.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's about as far as I got before St Mary Jane started whispering in my friend's ear... and then in mine. The conversation went something like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if... what if reptilian aliens really are real, man? But! But wait, hear me out, coz I know what you're gonna say. Hear me out. What if they're real, BUT
       <em>
        they've never been here
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       If they're real but have never been here then you should have another cone?
      </p>
      <p>
       YES!! Wait. No. Yes on the cone. You just can't see the big picture, man.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's the big picture, then?
      </p>
      <p>
       BIG! It's just... big!
      </p>
      <p>
       And a picture?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes. It is big and it is a picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       A picture of what?
      </p>
      <p>
       Huh? I don't know. What are we talking about, again?
      </p>
      <p>
       The big picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ah yes. It's really big.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Um, a picture that's big? Pay attention ya stoned cunt, I'm tryna tell you something. What am I tryna tell you?
      </p>
      <p>
       The big picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       YES!
      </p>
      <p>
       And?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's big.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've established that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know...
      </p>
      <p>
       Reptilians?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes! The reptilians! The reptilians are from another planet, right, but they've never been here because of all the distances and stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if they're real, how can we know about them if they've never been here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the bigger picture. Weren't you listening?
      </p>
      <p>
       You didn't tell me what the big picture was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes I did. It's big.
      </p>
      <p>
       And a picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       And a picture. A great big picture of the DMT molecule. We know that reptilians exist because when we take DMT we tap into a quantum entanglement. We're not seeing visions of other species because we're tripping balls...
      </p>
      <p>
       Well... you kinda are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, yeah. Point is, the visions they see aren't imaginary and they're not spirits from the fifth dimension.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forty-second.
      </p>
      <p>
       What?
      </p>
      <p>
       They come from the 42nd dimension because they explain everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes! No. Fuck you. Where was I?
      </p>
      <p>
       They're not spirits from the fourth dimension.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fifth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're just reptilian dudes chilling on another planet on a Saturday night with some DMT, just like people here. And there's like, this quantum entanglement thing going on so we connect. Our conciousness sort of goes through a wormhole.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's pretty fuckin trippy. Why aren't I that stoned yet?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because you don't see the big picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big picture is that a trip is a trip. Like, a
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       trip. Across the universe. And
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       know that, see? They know how to tap into that quantum entanglement, but we don't. They can get here with DMT.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they can get here, then we can get there once we learn how.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will take much practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Know where we can get some DMT?
      </p>
      <p>
       Buggered if I know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck.
