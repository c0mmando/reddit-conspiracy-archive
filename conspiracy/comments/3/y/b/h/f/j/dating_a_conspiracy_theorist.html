       Its easier not to have to hear another person's insane ideas. The love of my life is a good Christian who pays no attention to anything.  Im te complete opposite and all we do is laugh and show our love for each other.

       I was sheeple AF before my boyfriend came along. It took some time but now were totally on the same page, as you can see from me being on this sub. I think its way cool to change someones life and spread knowledge than to try and find one of the few and far between

       I converted my whole family. They are converting their friends. Its amazing. Even the shock value and novelty it brings to any discussion is quite rewarding in itself. You'd be surprised how many people are borderline truthers, just needing that extra push.

       Within my family, I'm the guy who has had to overcome quite a lot and when I'm committed to something, my family generally knows it's because I've researched the fuck out of it. The great thing about them saying all the usual shit they were programmed to say is that you can penetrate that armour with enough passion and conviction behind your words. Converting my family members was the easiest because you just get to be yourself and your family can tell you're being honest. But at the same time, I never ever spent more than 5 minutes talking. It was always quickly finished with, "look, you know I've watched and read a lot. I can tell that you've only watched the news stories. If you're not willing to at least watch 2 hours of evidence, I'm not going to bother arguing with you. I get enough of that shit out in the world. Either call me a liar now or watch some stuff for yourself and then make up your own mind."

       It's just such a tough pill to swallow. That extra push basically means realizing that some of the stuff you question was done on purpose and planned to happen. It's a huge game changer. For example,  going from,  "man... fuck the elections you know? I feel like it's just a stupid show and politicians are stupid" to "ok elections are probably,  definitely rigged and it happens because of legal bribery and crony capitalism". It goes from general annoyance to actual doubt of legitimacy.

       One of the most famous female conspiracy theorists was Mae Brussell (she's deceased, late 80s).  She was one of the best researchers there ever was.  She was essentially a detective treating theories as crimes, able to put people, associations, organizations, and events into a stunning chronological context in a manner I've never seen anyone accomplish since.  Maybe if more females knew about Mae Brussell they'd be quite interested in what she had to say in her time--it's inspiring--and likewise they'd be more intersted in conspiracy theories.  Mae went from housewife to broadcaster (truther) following JFK assassination and the lies around the reportage.

       Regarding dating a truther; I know 4 female 'truthers' right off hand (I'm male).  I found them by joining AE911Truth as a volunteer.  That's how you find females, generally, if you're old and fat or unemployed.  YOu volunteer your time towards doing something moral / altruistic. And you keep it light and be smart / fun / funny and that's more influential than being an annoying activist trying to shove stuff down people's throats.  We can do that enough here on reddit.

       That's when you need to volunteer for truth orgs or get involved in some other aspect of life, like a new hobby. I"m saying you need to push those in your circle to a further out orbit and find some new friends more aligned with your beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do get what you mean, I have people in my social circle like that i cannot just 'let go', they are basically my whole family.  I'm the black sheep areligious non-neocon

       I tried this. I just didn't have the patience to put on the show. Plus, certain theories and facts have altered how I live my life. It becomes a huge conflict of interest and I've made the decision to just not date a sheeple in any sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've come to find that most women are a little more hesitant to entertain some of these theories. Which makes it much harder for me to make female friends (I'm a woman). Id rather talk politics than fashion, rather talk current events than the kardashions. Very glad it's easier to find men who are in the know than women. It's not something I have to worry about, at all really.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of guaging if they're in the know, I get to gauge just
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       in the know they are and go from there.

       Facts alter how I live mine too, and I'm sure that'll change the more I learn. She's not open to learning that kind of thing though, so that's why I don't think it's a hopeless effort. She believes in me, and that's a good a start as any. I only have one close friend that I'd talk to about the Truth. I don't know how to go about finding other people

       One you get tired of banging her move on.  You don't want to spend your life with a schmuck who is so easily fooled.  Imagine if you need her to pick you up from the airport--she'll just get lost and leave you stranded.  Then she'll cry about it and blame the terrorists.

       Just clinging to hope/change.  Until February.  I think I reached a state of overt skepticism.  Disbelief of the mainstream narrative.  I can't listen to MSNBC/FOX/ABC NEWS.  I have 0 faith in the current direction government at this point.  911 === inside job.  ETC.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my own research, I very much believe the world is predicated on protecting a banking scheme.  This type of stuff has been going on forever.  The Obama administration is absolutely no exception.  Yet I voted for this.  A vote is simply an admission-pass to someones power trip.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have it all figured out.  But I am aware that I am constantly being gamed as a peasant in the new millennium... And now I'm very 1st amendment/2nd amendment.  Clinging to the 1's and 2's.

       I've had a girlfriend for about 10 years. We talk about this all but she doesn't really come on here off go on forums. Its a really stupid stereotype to say conspiracy believers are all basement dweller males. it's simply not true.  I know plenty of other couples who, for example, believe 911 was a conspiracy.... Idk what to tell you plenty of people here are wives and girlfriends.  There are plenty of girls/women as well.

       I'd already been with my partner for 4 years when I escaped from the Matrix five years ago, and despite my prodigious efforts, he still clings stubbornly to the official story about almost everything.  It is really wearing on me and I feel less and less like spending time with him, despite his many wonderful qualities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would agree that female conspiracy researchers are different, and I certainly am.  For one, I have a very high IQ.  I was tested by Mensa and told that my IQ is in the top .5% of the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also had an unusual childhood that fostered a great deal of self-reliance at a young age.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, I'm naturally pretty fearless.  That seems to be genetic, my dad is the same way.  We'll do things at the drop of a hat that most people would be terrified to do.  Looking back on my life, I sometimes marvel that I'm still alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of that combined creates a person with a tremendous capacity to absorb, retain and analyze  information, and the courage to stick to her guns whether anyone agrees with her or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I really need to meet a guy who has my intellect and courage.  If that's you and you're over 50, please PM me!

       We do exist.

      <p>
       But you are right about the stigma being a "conspiracy theorist" carries.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would never date/marry a guy unless he held similar views to me, yet at be same time I don't want to be labeled "that weird conspiracy theorist girl I went on a date with" if I were to being up my views when out on a date.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you should start a conspiracy theorist dating site. Besides that, I guess you just have to be ok with being labeled the weirdo if you bring up your views to someone who doesn't share the same beliefs as you.

       I think u guys need to get out your parents basements and actually talk to a girl. And I'm not talking about club/bar/tinder bitches either. Go to a library/ museum/ bookstore where girls with brains are at. Most people are unreceptive to this type of thinking, doesn't matter if they're men or women. If anything I feel like men are even more stubborn about learning the "truth" in my experience.

       female conspiracy theorists are more rare due to the way that females process information vs men.
      </p>
      <p>
       its harder and more damaging for them to "wake up."
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: and i'm not casting shade/condescending women. i know a few female conspiracy theorists, they actually explained this to me.

       You're probably hanging out with stupid bitches. Hang out with STEM/business/law girls and you'll see how much they'll drag the government in the dirt. Smart girls are aware and very sassy about their opinions. I'm a female computer engineer who loves to get into conspiracy theory discussions with my GFs.  Girls who love to read, will read about everything and anything even if it's contrary to popular opinions.  My Reddit saves would put me in FEMA camp no question.

       Sassy as they'll debate with u to the ground about what they believe in.  Not all STEM girls are created equal. medical girls in my experience can be accepting of the "truth" like some of my dr friends that don't vaccinate their children or they'll go with BS full steam because they really like they're paychecks from bigpharma A LOT.

       Being awake doesn't make you superior to anyone else. Because you realize there's no such thing as superior. And we're all pawns, and we're all stupid, and we're all hypocrites. And we're all asleep. It's just about degrees.
      </p>
      <p>
       My girl isn't a conspiracy theorist, but she's also not from America so she hasn't been exposed to the same things. It's pretty short-sighted to view people as stupid because they don't understand US/global politics. It's also pretty short-sighted to view someone as intelligent just because they will argue with you all day about their beliefs. Stubbornness is the exact same thing that keeps most people from waking up.

       You were the one insulting the women in your life by saying women can't come to understand conspiracy theories because some sexist view you have of women. I don't see myself as above anyone because I believe in what I do but you certainly do because having a dick apparently gives you extra reasoning points. I'm sorry my feeble mind can't explain why you're gf isn't as understanding about the atrocities that are around her.

       hits the nail directly on the head. So find a woman that was never socially ingrained. Here's the problem: you'll have to look among the women that society doesn't value. What does society value where women are concerned?
      </p>
      <p>
       ~ You could find a woman you fancied and reprogram her. But then... the ethical considerations. And really, you wouldn't end up with an awakened woman. You'd just have a woman who was conditioned against the system. Is that even what you want?

      <p>
       ~ You could find a woman you fancied and deprogram her. But this is honestly impossible for most men. And it may be even more unethical than reprogramming. Women are socially wired. You honestly would psychologically damage a woman in ways you can't predict by attempting to snip those wires. I know because I started to do this... it fucked her up. There is a reason people are not free- they don't want to be.

      <p>
       The average woman even less so than the average man.

       This is so true that it hurts. I'm an "rarity" I'm from a demograph that is so against conspiracy theories and fairly pro government that whenever I tell people about my beliefs, they think I'm a white male. As you said, women are more socially wired than men and the average woman does not like going against the grain, especially in controversial issues. Most female conspiracy theorists are "low value" (sorry sounds bad but it's true because I have low value) or come from an alternative or foreign culture. There are several reasons why I'm awake. My father isn't American so I've been taught things that aren't stereotypically American, my intelligence, and the fact that I research things like crazy.

       I am female and you know what woke me up?  In 2012 I googled what happened in Benghazi. The first several pages were the official narratives, then I started seeing pictures of the ambassador dragged through the streets. I thought wait this doesn't match up.  I then heard about the media in North Korea and what they tell those people and it all clicked for me, the brainwashing, the media, the false flags.

       Well, I'm female and do not agree with this. I am not more receptive to vaccines, biological conspiracies, GMO's. I am as receptive to those things as I am equally to all others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please don't say things like "oriented towards their frame of mind". I don't even consider myself a feminist one ounce, yet that is offensive because to me it implies you think that women don't participant/read about conspiracy theories. It also implies females are not capable of certain things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Me personally, I have been lurking here for a looong time and haven't posted here until recently. The reason had nothing to do with me being female and having "a different frame of mind". It had everything to do with the men posting here and their frame of mind towards females.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only male conspiracy theorists I have met irl were quite sexist towards women. Not all dudes are like this, but even during my lurking here I have noticed quite a few males like that. There is a difference between being sexist and being manly, and I wish men would remember this.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't harder or more damaging for me to wake up in any way whatsoever, so I am just confused by this point of view to be honest.

       You are an exception to a rule. If you want to chalk it up to social conditioning or biology, it doesn't really matter- still, it is an obvious fact that as a general rule, females are more submissive than males. It is a fact that females prioritize security more. It is a fact that to be a conspiracy theorist is to go against the established order which is the opposite of submission and also is a good way to put yourself in danger.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not even about what females are capable of; its about what females want. Most females don't want to lead themselves and will admit it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So few females will lead themselves out of the.matrix and will remain where it is most secure unless they are.lead out. Because its scary. Its scary to women and its scary to men. And if you aren't scared, then you aint seen shit yet.

       I personally don't think there should be any music at all. Music is emotionally manipulative. I never trust things presented to me with a tune playing behind, because I know there is an intent to provoke emotional bias.

       When you call yourself with such stupid fucking labels as ' Truther' and 'Conspiracy Theorist' no wonder you your being called a 'virgin' etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       The term Truther is the most stupid thing I've heard, it's putting people in a box.
I've always been an open minded, curious person which lead me to question authority and everything in general.

      <p>
       Totally understand your point of the post and agree with you.
I've dated girls who's first task when they wake is check fucking facebook!!!
Oh who's telling me what theve had for there breakfast today!!!
I FELT LIKE PUTTING A BULLET IN MY HEAD...But getting a bit of ass balanced it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really does make me cringe when I hear 'I am a truther' No your a tool. Think for yourself you daft twat

       If someone is a virgin with no friends it probably has to do with factors other than any "conspiracy theories" he may subscribe to.

       But when you all talk like a bunch of sexist red-pillers it makes us females want to hide away and not participate.

       It's not that conspiracy information is packaged in a way that doesn't attract women...it's that many of the men who participate are narrow minded in their views on women and THAT is what makes us not want to participate.

       Maybe you guys can't find females because we don't want men who think of women in this way. I'm saying maybe THIS is the reason we don't really participate. It's not that we don't participate because we don't understand, it's that we don't participate because we are not welcome!

       Please try to understand where we are coming from &amp; try to understand this pov.

       I guess I have nothing left to say because it is up to you to understand this viewpoint. So bring on the downvotes and negative comments about women?

       The only thing the conversation demonstrates is that you are close minded and chauvinistic.

       Any female that sticks up for herself clearly has a "feminist agenda".

       I am a female conspiracy theorist. My female friends are all conspiracy theorists. We read and think about the same issues as men and in the same way as men. These issues and how they are "marketed" DO appeal to us. I am telling you this as a female.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the men who react like you is what does NOT appeal to us. I am telling you that you are wrong in thinking that we don't exist. We do, but we don't participate. We hide because of reactions like this. I know that we exist and some of us post on this sub, but we hide that we are female because we get this type of reaction all the time.

       It's not a feminist agenda to want men to be as respectful to us as they are to other men.

       I tried this. I just didn't have the patience to put on the show. Plus, certain theories and facts have altered how I live my life. It becomes a huge conflict of interest and I've made the decision to just not date a sheeple in any sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've come to find that most women are a little more hesitant to entertain some of these theories. Which makes it much harder for me to make female friends (I'm a woman). Id rather talk politics than fashion, rather talk current events than the kardashions. Very glad it's easier to find men who are in the know than women. It's not something I have to worry about, at all really.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of guaging if they're in the know, I get to gauge just
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       in the know they are and go from there.

       Maybe you guys can't find females because we don't want men who think of women in this way. I'm saying maybe THIS is the reason we don't really participate. It's not that we don't participate because we don't understand, it's that we don't participate because we are not welcome!

       Please try to understand where we are coming from &amp; try to understand this pov.

       I guess I have nothing left to say because it is up to you to understand this viewpoint. So bring on the downvotes and negative comments about women?
