    <div class="md"><p>Within my family, I&#39;m the guy who has had to overcome quite a lot and when I&#39;m committed to something, my family generally knows it&#39;s because I&#39;ve researched the fuck out of it. The great thing about them saying all the usual shit they were programmed to say is that you can penetrate that armour with enough passion and conviction behind your words. Converting my family members was the easiest because you just get to be yourself and your family can tell you&#39;re being honest. But at the same time, I never ever spent more than 5 minutes talking. It was always quickly finished with, &quot;look, you know I&#39;ve watched and read a lot. I can tell that you&#39;ve only watched the news stories. If you&#39;re not willing to at least watch 2 hours of evidence, I&#39;m not going to bother arguing with you. I get enough of that shit out in the world. Either call me a liar now or watch some stuff for yourself and then make up your own mind.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just such a tough pill to swallow. That extra push basically means realizing that some of the stuff you question was done on purpose and planned to happen. It&#39;s a huge game changer. For example,  going from,  &quot;man... fuck the elections you know? I feel like it&#39;s just a stupid show and politicians are stupid&quot; to &quot;ok elections are probably,  definitely rigged and it happens because of legal bribery and crony capitalism&quot;. It goes from general annoyance to actual doubt of legitimacy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the most famous female conspiracy theorists was Mae Brussell (she&#39;s deceased, late 80s).  She was one of the best researchers there ever was.  She was essentially a detective treating theories as crimes, able to put people, associations, organizations, and events into a stunning chronological context in a manner I&#39;ve never seen anyone accomplish since.  Maybe if more females knew about Mae Brussell they&#39;d be quite interested in what she had to say in her time--it&#39;s inspiring--and likewise they&#39;d be more intersted in conspiracy theories.  Mae went from housewife to broadcaster (truther) following JFK assassination and the lies around the reportage.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Regarding dating a truther; I know 4 female &#39;truthers&#39; right off hand (I&#39;m male).  I found them by joining AE911Truth as a volunteer.  That&#39;s how you find females, generally, if you&#39;re old and fat or unemployed.  YOu volunteer your time towards doing something moral / altruistic. And you keep it light and be smart / fun / funny and that&#39;s more influential than being an annoying activist trying to shove stuff down people&#39;s throats.  We can do that enough here on reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried this. I just didn&#39;t have the patience to put on the show. Plus, certain theories and facts have altered how I live my life. It becomes a huge conflict of interest and I&#39;ve made the decision to just not date a sheeple in any sense.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve come to find that most women are a little more hesitant to entertain some of these theories. Which makes it much harder for me to make female friends (I&#39;m a woman). Id rather talk politics than fashion, rather talk current events than the kardashions. Very glad it&#39;s easier to find men who are in the know than women. It&#39;s not something I have to worry about, at all really. </p>

<p>Instead of guaging if they&#39;re in the know, I get to gauge just <em>how</em> in the know they are and go from there. </p>

<p>From my own research, I very much believe the world is predicated on protecting a banking scheme.  This type of stuff has been going on forever.  The Obama administration is absolutely no exception.  Yet I voted for this.  A vote is simply an admission-pass to someones power trip.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have it all figured out.  But I am aware that I am constantly being gamed as a peasant in the new millennium... And now I&#39;m very 1st amendment/2nd amendment.  Clinging to the 1&#39;s and 2&#39;s.</p>

It is really wearing on me and I feel less and less like spending time with him, despite his many wonderful qualities.  </p>

<p>I would agree that female conspiracy researchers are different, and I certainly am.  For one, I have a very high IQ.  I was tested by Mensa and told that my IQ is in the top .5% of the population.   </p>

<p>I also had an unusual childhood that fostered a great deal of self-reliance at a young age.  </p>

<p>And, I&#39;m naturally pretty fearless.  That seems to be genetic, my dad is the same way.  We&#39;ll do things at the drop of a hat that most people would be terrified to do.  Looking back on my life, I sometimes marvel that I&#39;m still alive. </p>

<p>All of that combined creates a person with a tremendous capacity to absorb, retain and analyze  information, and the courage to stick to her guns whether anyone agrees with her or not.  </p>

<p>That said, I really need to meet a guy who has my intellect and courage.  If that&#39;s you and you&#39;re over 50, please PM me!</p>

<p>But you are right about the stigma being a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; carries. </p>

<p>I would never date/marry a guy unless he held similar views to me, yet at be same time I don&#39;t want to be labeled &quot;that weird conspiracy theorist girl I went on a date with&quot; if I were to being up my views when out on a date. </p>

<p>And I don&#39;t appreciate you insulting the women I care about.</p>

<p>Being awake doesn&#39;t make you superior to anyone else. Because you realize there&#39;s no such thing as superior. And we&#39;re all pawns, and we&#39;re all stupid, and we&#39;re all hypocrites. And we&#39;re all asleep. It&#39;s just about degrees.</p>

<p>My girl isn&#39;t a conspiracy theorist, but she&#39;s also not from America so she hasn&#39;t been exposed to the same things. It&#39;s pretty short-sighted to view people as stupid because they don&#39;t understand US/global politics. It&#39;s also pretty short-sighted to view someone as intelligent just because they will argue with you all day about their beliefs. Stubbornness is the exact same thing that keeps most people from waking up.</p>

<p>This is one reason why I am asking this question. In what social environments, where women exist, is conspiracy theory more accepted?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not any answers you&#39;ll like, but there are three options.</p>

<p>~ Counter-culture. You&#39;d need to look among the social rejects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>women are more socially wired than men, and it is more rare for them to go against the social grain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>hits the nail directly on the head. So find a woman that was never socially ingrained. Here&#39;s the problem: you&#39;ll have to look among the women that society doesn&#39;t value. What does society value where women are concerned?</p>

<p>~ You could find a woman you fancied and reprogram her. But then... the ethical considerations. And really, you wouldn&#39;t end up with an awakened woman. You&#39;d just have a woman who was conditioned against the system. Is that even what you want? </p>

<p>~ You could find a woman you fancied and deprogram her. But this is honestly impossible for most men. And it may be even more unethical than reprogramming. Women are socially wired. You honestly would psychologically damage a woman in ways you can&#39;t predict by attempting to snip those wires. I know because I started to do this... it fucked her up. There is a reason people are not free- they don&#39;t want to be.</p>

<p>The average woman even less so than the average man.</p>

<p>These are my observations. Glean from them what you will and take them with a grain of salt. Good luck.</p>

<p>Just remember- freedom isn&#39;t free.</p>

As you said, women are more socially wired than men and the average woman does not like going against the grain, especially in controversial issues. Most female conspiracy theorists are &quot;low value&quot; (sorry sounds bad but it&#39;s true because I have low value) or come from an alternative or foreign culture.

My father isn&#39;t American so I&#39;ve been taught things that aren&#39;t stereotypically American, my intelligence, and the fact that I research things like crazy. </p>

<p>Please don&#39;t say things like &quot;oriented towards their frame of mind&quot;. I don&#39;t even consider myself a feminist one ounce, yet that is offensive because to me it implies you think that women don&#39;t participant/read about conspiracy theories. It also implies females are not capable of certain things. </p>

<p>Me personally, I have been lurking here for a looong time and haven&#39;t posted here until recently. The reason had nothing to do with me being female and having &quot;a different frame of mind&quot;. It had everything to do with the men posting here and their frame of mind towards females. </p>

<p>The only male conspiracy theorists I have met irl were quite sexist towards women. Not all dudes are like this, but even during my lurking here I have noticed quite a few males like that. There is a difference between being sexist and being manly, and I wish men would remember this. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t harder or more damaging for me to wake up in any way whatsoever, so I am just confused by this point of view to be honest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are an exception to a rule. If you want to chalk it up to social conditioning or biology, it doesn&#39;t really matter- still, it is an obvious fact that as a general rule, females are more submissive than males. It is a fact that females prioritize security more. It is a fact that to be a conspiracy theorist is to go against the established order which is the opposite of submission and also is a good way to put yourself in danger.</p>

<p>This is not even about what females are capable of; its about what females want. Most females don&#39;t want to lead themselves and will admit it.</p>

<p>So few females will lead themselves out of the.matrix and will remain where it is most secure unless they are.lead out. Because its scary. Its scary to women and its scary to men. And if you aren&#39;t scared, then you aint seen shit yet.</p>

<p>Marketing has absolutely nothing to do with this. I&#39;m saying marketing isn&#39;t the problem. </p>

<p>The problem is people like you who think that females obviously can&#39;t be interested in this type of thing because they can&#39;t comprehend basic things with their complicated, differently working lady-brains. </p>

<p>Maybe you guys can&#39;t find females because we don&#39;t want men who think of women in this way. I&#39;m saying maybe THIS is the reason we don&#39;t really participate. It&#39;s not that we don&#39;t participate because we don&#39;t understand, it&#39;s that we don&#39;t participate because we are not welcome!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing the conversation demonstrates is that you are close minded and chauvinistic. </p>

<p>Any female that sticks up for herself clearly has a &quot;feminist agenda&quot;. </p>

<p>I am a female conspiracy theorist. My female friends are all conspiracy theorists. We read and think about the same issues as men and in the same way as men. These issues and how they are &quot;marketed&quot; DO appeal to us. I am telling you this as a female.</p>

<p>But the men who react like you is what does NOT appeal to us. I am telling you that you are wrong in thinking that we don&#39;t exist. We do, but we don&#39;t participate. We hide because of reactions like this. I know that we exist and some of us post on this sub, but we hide that we are female because we get this type of reaction all the time. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a feminist agenda to want men to be as respectful to us as they are to other men. </p>

<p>Get over yourself man. What are you, like 70 years old anyway? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried this. I just didn&#39;t have the patience to put on the show. Plus, certain theories and facts have altered how I live my life. It becomes a huge conflict of interest and I&#39;ve made the decision to just not date a sheeple in any sense.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve come to find that most women are a little more hesitant to entertain some of these theories. Which makes it much harder for me to make female friends (I&#39;m a woman). Id rather talk politics than fashion, rather talk current events than the kardashions. Very glad it&#39;s easier to find men who are in the know than women. It&#39;s not something I have to worry about, at all really. </p>

<p>Instead of guaging if they&#39;re in the know, I get to gauge just <em>how</em> in the know they are and go from there. </p>
