        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Structural engineers who designed the Twin Towers carried out studies in the mid-1960s to determine how the buildings would fare if hit by large jetliners. In all cases the studies concluded that <strong>the Towers would survive the impacts and fires caused by the jetliners</strong></p>

<p>Contrary to widely promoted misconceptions, the Boeing 767-200s used on 9/11/01 were only slightly larger than 707s and DC 8s, the types of jetliners whose impacts the World Trade Center&#39;s designers anticipated</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/docs/aircraftcomparison.gif">FEMA&#39;s Report shows the sizes of a 707 and a 767 relative to the footprint of a WTC tower.</a>  Flight 11 and Flight 175 were Boeing 767-200s. Although a 767-200 has a slightly wider body than a 707, the two models are very similar in overall size, weight and fuel capacity</p>

<p>Given the differences in cruise speeds, a 707 in normal flight would actually have more kinetic energy than a 767, despite the slightly smaller size. Note the similar fuel capacities of both aircraft. The 767s used on September 11th were estimated to be carrying about 10,000 gallons of fuel each at the time of impact, only about 40% of the capacity of a 707</p>

<p><strong>Statements by Engineers</strong></p>

<p>John Skilling was the head structural engineer for the World Trade Center. In a 1993 interview, Skilling stated that the Towers were designed to withstand the impact and fires resulting from the collision of a large jetliner such as Boeing 707 or Douglas DC-8.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930227&amp;slug=1687698">Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed, ... The building structure would still be there</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A white paper released on February 3, 1964 states that the Towers could have withstood impacts of jetliners travelling 600 mph -- a speed greater than the impact speed of either jetliner used on 9/11</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/City-Sky-World-Trade-Center/dp/0805076913">The buildings have been investigated and found to be safe in an assumed collision with a large jet airliner (Boeing 707â€”DC 8) traveling at 600 miles per hour. Analysis indicates that such collision would result in only local damage which could not cause collapse or substantial damage to the building and would not endanger the lives and safety of occupants not in the immediate area of impact, page 131</a></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.statemaster.com/encyclopedia/Factor-of-safety">One aspect of engineering that is not widely understood is that structures are over-engineered as a matter of standard practice.</a>  Steel structures like bridges and buildings are typically designed to withstand five times anticipated static loads and 3 times anticipated dynamic loads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean like other sources have stated the study actually involved a far lower speed, and did not assess the risk of a plane deliberately crashed into the building at the maximum possible velocity?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nae.edu/Publications/Bridge/EngineeringandHomelandSecurity/ReflectionsontheWorldTradeCenter.aspx">Source</a> - note, this is written by Leslie Robertson,  lead structural engineer of the WTC, who should presumably be regarded as a reliable source. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was assumed that the jetliner would be lost in the fog, seeking to land at JFK or at Newark.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Robertson also repeated this statement <a href="http://scott-juris.blogspot.com/The%20Height%20of%20Ambition%20Part%20Four.pdf">later</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Robertson took the time to calculate how well his towers would handle the impact from a Boeing 707, the largest jetliner in service at the time. He says that his calculations assumed a plane lost in a fog while searching for an airport at relatively low speed, like the B-25 bomber.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And from <a href="https://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_ch1.pdf">another source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was assumed in the 1960s design analysis for the WTC towers that an aircraft, lost in fog and seeking to land at a nearby airport, like the B-25 Mitchell bomber that struck the Empire State Building on July 28, 1945, might strike a WTC tower <strong>while low on fuel and at landing speeds.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the study is, it appears, no longer available for detailed analysis, we&#39;ll probably never know for sure. But OP&#39;s claim, &quot;The Twin Towers were designed to survive jet impacts of the type that happened on September 11th&quot; is at best, unproven, and at worst clearly false. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems very unlikely someone working in the sixties - before hijackings for terrorist purposes really became a thing - would have considered the use of a plane as a weapon. However, there had been accidental, low speed impacts previously, both at the Empire State Building and 40 Wall Street. It would seem far more logical to have considered things which had happened in the past, rather than speculative and unprecedented events.</p>

<p>It&#39;s right there in the post. The plane that hit was bigger than they prepared for. And even if it was designed to xyz standards, doesn&#39;t ensure perfection. I&#39;m an engineer and if I had a dollar for everytime I designed something to a standard and then found out it didn&#39;t work, I&#39;d be rich. If all engineering worked as we intended we&#39;d never have any accidents, bridge collapses etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t need to convince you. Just go back to my original argument. </p>

<p>If -all- engineering worked as intended 100% of the time, we&#39;d never have issues - but it&#39;s impossible to factor everything into the model accurately. So even stuff built to withstand xyz sometimes actually won&#39;t withstand xyz. </p>

<p>Toyota never intended for their brakes to fail in 1 in a million cases. GMC never intended for their key fobs to turn ignitions off. </p>

<p>In this case the WTC was designed prior to 1973, so they probably didn&#39;t have a ton of the benefits we have now (superior computer simulations etc). They also didn&#39;t field test assumable (as crashing a big plane into a building that size would be ridiculously expensive and kind of impossible at that time). </p>

<p>You need to realize that even though something is built to withstand xyz, it means built to withstand xyz in abc conditions. Shit happens and bridges collapse.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my whole and only point, that this thread shouldn&#39;t be used as &#39;proof&#39; that the buildings didn&#39;t collapse as the result of a larger than expected plane crashing into it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If only a part of the building failed to work as designed, why did each tower fall instantly and completely at near-free-fall speeds? </p>

<p>Surely a local failure wouldn&#39;t cause complete collapse. A slower, more progressive collapse should have been expected. To use your analogy, when a GM ignition fails, even in the event of an accident, it doesn&#39;t demolish and vaporize the entire car at once. There is localized damage where the accident happens, and the rest of the car, especially the body/frame, stays intact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the buildings couldn&#39;t handle the tons of thermate placed at their bases and the explosive charges set on the support columns. The buildings were in freefall when they came down, and witnesses reported a series of explosions immediately before they collapsed. Side by side comparison with a controlled demolition is identical. For the sake of argument, given your theory, how and why did Building 7 come down?</p>

<p>Your no planes bullshit does nothing to help us, wastes time, and turns off normal non-schizo people to the cause.</p>

<p>Focus on things you can prove, like the demolition, the war games going on at the time, the faked pentagon pictures, the geopolitics behind it all.</p>

<p>Also, I think it is you who needs to do more research, specifically into Dov Zhakeim and his company, Systems Planning Corporation.  Let me know when you realize i&#39;m right, start here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t need to convince you. Just go back to my original argument. </p>

<p>If -all- engineering worked as intended 100% of the time, we&#39;d never have issues - but it&#39;s impossible to factor everything into the model accurately. So even stuff built to withstand xyz sometimes actually won&#39;t withstand xyz. </p>

<p>Toyota never intended for their brakes to fail in 1 in a million cases. GMC never intended for their key fobs to turn ignitions off. </p>

<p>In this case the WTC was designed prior to 1973, so they probably didn&#39;t have a ton of the benefits we have now (superior computer simulations etc). They also didn&#39;t field test assumable (as crashing a big plane into a building that size would be ridiculously expensive and kind of impossible at that time). </p>

<p>You need to realize that even though something is built to withstand xyz, it means built to withstand xyz in abc conditions. Shit happens and bridges collapse.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my whole and only point, that this thread shouldn&#39;t be used as &#39;proof&#39; that the buildings didn&#39;t collapse as the result of a larger than expected plane crashing into it. </p>
