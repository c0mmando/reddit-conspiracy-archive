       I don't understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get the 9/11 thing. If it's true then our government is corrupt and is willing to kill its own citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get the Presidential race interest. Candidates have shady backgrounds and funding.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get the interest in police brutality. Self explanatory.
      </p>
      <p>
       But why do so many on this sub care about jews, zionists, anti-jews, shills, etc? What about someone being jewish matters?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say a jewish person is trying to control things. Why does it matter if they're jewish?
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I can tell the difference of impact on my life by powerful jews and powerful non-jews is exactly zero.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care about israel because I don't go there. I don't care about jews because I don't know any. So why are some people on this sub absolutely insistent on mentioning them at every turn?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are the jews a part of some master conspiracy to put all jews in camps and gas them? Are they trying to consolidate monetary power so they can create a jewish reign over the planet? Are they basically the sith of our world?

       WHY CARE ABOUT JEWS?!

       I don't like how they use the holocaust card endlessly.
      </p>
      <p>
       They basically run the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       They support mass migration in European nations,and yet they go through such efforts that they require DNA tests to prove if you're Jewish if you want to move to Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate how Zionist murdered 70-100 million people by creating communism,and in many cases they were directly responsible for the mass murder of Europeans through events such as the Holodomor,and the Armenian  genocide(The young turks were Jewish).
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate how the Jewish organization the ADL traveled to Ukraine to lobby it's government to downplay the Holodomor because of the holocaust.

      <p>
       Jews do run the media, but it's useful to stop and consider this fact for a minute. Yes, Jews run the media, but why? What is their purpose? Did it just happen by accident? That's seems unlikely, that a tribe making up 2% of the population should just magically happen, by sheer coincidence, to take over total control of the mass media, including all forms of news media.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, the Jews' total control of the media required decades of careful planning, co-operation between wealthy Jews, and the expenditure of vast amounts of money by Jews. It was a focused campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why do Jews feel the need to totally control the media of Christians in Christian nations? So they can shape the minds of Christians. How? Well, for example, to make you feel uncomfortable when I mention the word "Christian" or refer to "Christian nations." The reason you feel that slight internal hesitation upon reading these things is Jewish mind control, imposed daily through the media, over a span of decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       By controlling our minds, Jews can make us hate our own culture and our own accomplishments as a people. They can make us hate our own race and our own religion. And they have done so.

         Jews are perhaps the most powerful and privileged ethnic group in America.

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There's a taboo against discussing Jewish power, while it's perfectly acceptable to discuss, say, "WASP" power, or "white privilege."

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Jewish community has a very, very strong undercurrent of "dual loyalty" - specifically, with Israel. It's taboo to discuss this fact because it's an "anti-semitic canard."
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>

         Organized Jewry pretty much "openly conspires" against the traditional American majority by, for instance, fanatical support for mass immigration.

      <p>
       Gonna use this as a jumping off point to express what I was ruminating over today.  I'll be deleting this account soon anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought: how could characterizing the Jewish people as powerful and influential possibly be considered
       <em>
        anti
       </em>
       semitic?  If I'm saying you're at the top, how am I denigrating you?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I said Jews are idiots or unimportant, I could see
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       being called antisemitic.
      </p>
      <p>
       But of course, it would be factually incorrect.  The Jewish culture has brought forth many brilliant minds, and played an irrefutably pivotal role in the human story.
      </p>
      <p>
       We seem to have an inversion of language here, if saying that is somehow antisemitic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this unique talent to twist meaning - and this is only one example among many - stems from an insecurity or paranoia that is rooted not only in their history of inability to avoid conflict, but also their small population.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are very sensitive to how their group's power is characterized on the moral spectrum by the rest of humanity, which is 500 times their size. It's self-preservation, and understandbly, they're highly vigilant of the tide of public sentiment, and masters at Public Relations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this manipulation of language and culture - specifically through Cultural Marxism - deceitful?  I often think so. It is uniquely dispiriting to be told you have hatred in your heart when you know you do not, or to be told you have privilege precisely while it is being stripped from you.  Do all Jews partake in this? Of course not. Do many Gentiles? Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think one of the most common misunderstandings today is the failure to distinguish between amoral behaviour (i.e. self-interest, even if it is pragmatism distorted by paranoia or greed) and immoral behaviour (i.e. evil for its own sake).  I think this is emotionally driven.  Competition continues to play out on many levels, and people don't want to admit that others have gained 
the upper hand. Dovetailling this, those who
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       the upper hand naturally don't want everyone else to be constantly reminded of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's be honest, there's also some degree of envy at work:  I've lost track of the number of times I've learned about an important discovery, development, or prominent figure, and looked it up, only to find my intuition correct: yup, Jewish.  The list of impressive achievments (and indeed, lovable characters) is profound, and there shouldn't be anything wrong with acknowledging that.  The 
modern world (including Aaron's reddit) enjoys the fruits of countless contributions made by brilliant, decent, hardworking, idealistic, generous people of Jewish ancestry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can say that in my own direct personal experience, which is far more solid than my shifting conceptions of how the world came to be as it is, I have had overwhelmingly positive friendships and dealings with people who have Jewish ancestry, and I would never wish to insult them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall I have tremendous respect and admiration for them, but at the same time, I lack understanding
       <em>
        of
       </em>
       them, they are somewhat mysterious.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main barrier to mutual understanding, as I see it, is their insular identity.  Their culture has turtled over thousands of years (whether due to elitism, dealing with being unfairly scapegoated, or from reactionary persecution they brought on themselves). This was one of the forces that drove their evolution into being not only brilliant today, but also a bit neurotic.  They're afraid of being wiped out.
      </p>
      <p>
       When an insular, powerful group acts in its own self-interest - especially if this counters the interests of other groups and the leverage is grossly lopsided - resentment is unavoidable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does waking up to deceit engender resentment?  Of course it does, it's only natural, we're all human.  But once you've seen the deceit, you are 9/10ths free.  Congratulations, you figured it out.  What follows is often the wish to demonize the group the deceivers belong to, and use one's resentment to fuel efforts to shake others awake.  But promoting resentment, even packaged with truths, can actually get in the way of others' enlightenment.  We have to see for ourselves.  Not to mention it might not be in our own best interest.  As Victor Frankl said, you may not be able to control your situation, but you
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       control your reaction  to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, they're some of our brightest on planet earth, and I had this thought that it would behoove the world to embrace the Jewish people: let's study their culture, celebrate their contributions, and dispel their fears.  Let's pull the details of the story that led to their way of thinking and arranging their 
culture out into the common light.  Let's not be afraid to discuss fairly how it has made them so successful.  Let's tell them: "You are fascinating! You ARE special! I want to know more about you!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope that wouldn't make them feel icky, but they really should be encouraged to break through their insularity, let go their persecution complex, be more forthright with the world, and live by example the dream of equality that some of their brilliant minds so ardently espouse for everyone else.

       No, you posted a link that was ALSO wrong. You can be a Christian or you can be a Zionist. You cannot be both. STOP FUCKING LYING. You don’t have the first fucking clue about the topic at hand. Christians hate Jews and Jews hate Christians.

       Do you have some sort of problem with Jewish people wanting their own nation?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't. I think Jewish people are ... JUST PEOPLE ... and they have the same rights as everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Jewish people want their own nation - no problem from me. Why wouldn't they be allowed to have their own nation? Good for them. I'd look forward to trading with such a nation, I have no doubt they would be great trading partners and formidable allies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, it might even be worth it to marry some of our best to this "Jewish nation" - closer ties and all that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think Jewish people shouldn't be allowed to have their own nation? Are you an anti-seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeemite or something?

       yes i do have a problem with ZIONISTS, not Jews you dense fuck. do you support racism and the genocide of Palestine? do you support the illegal colonization of someone elses land. all Jews are not Zionists for the millionth time, if your too ignorant to understand that its your problem not mine, your quick to pull anti-semite out of your ass but i doubt you include Arabs in that as well. defending Zionists is the same as defending the KKK for wanting an all white nation.

       your an equal offender by saying anyone is racist. im done with your fucking troll baiting dude. im no racist and i will always refuse to support an organization who illegal occupies another countries land in order to take the land and resources. Zionists are racist monsters running Palestinians off their land. the Zionists are the racist anti-Semites and your just as bad as they for choosing to be ignorant. they have done it in Lebanon and now they are doing it in Palestine. how is that not racist?

       What does any of that have to do with your denial of Jewish people to have their own state?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your racism and bigotry is obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you also believe the European people - along with Jews - don't have a right to their own state?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet you haven't said ONE WORD about Japanese nationalism, Chinese nationalism, Vietnamese nationalism, or Columbian nationalism - or anyone else, right?

       Quite honestly, I haven’t seen much of anything relating to jews here. You’ll see the odd mention of a zionist plot or the behavior of Israel shown in a hypocritical light, but it’s certainly not like other websites.

       Do your own research, IF you actually do care. If not, then whatever. You wont learn anything by listening to others, not here anyway. What i mean is you need to see the information for yourself. If you are just looking for someone to tell you the answer, then good luck with that.

       Talk to a true Jew 10 minutes, they are miserable angry people! (See Bernie Sanders)
      </p>

       Actually doesn't it come down to historically they have money and are successful hard working people (Read Atlas Shrugged) that won't budge on their beliefs and traditions. (See Fiddler on the Roof)
      </p>
      <p>
       But ultimately doesn't it come down to religion? Jewdisim, Christianity, and Islam all start in the Old Testament. (See the Torah) Jews are the only ones that still follow it and are not a "spin off" religion. They claim to know the one true God, and that pisses off the "spin off" religious people because "F U you don't believe what I do."

       You asked why they matter.  Personally I'm with you, who cares what anyone does as long as they aren't bothering or interfering with anyone else. &gt;&gt;Talk to a true Jew 10 minutes, they are miserable angry people!

       But for some reason some people feel the need to get involved with what other people are doing and crapping all over anything they don't like. And that's why (to them only) the Jews mater.

       Do your own research, IF you actually do care. If not, then whatever. You wont learn anything by listening to others, not here anyway. What i mean is you need to see the information for yourself. If you are just looking for someone to tell you the answer, then good luck with that. After your done, make sure you ask your mommy to wipe your ass too.
