       The highest-level participants in the U.S. Government, of both political parties, are not stupid. They know the depth and breadth of the massive problems facing our nation and our civilization. And, rather than solve these systemic problems, they are instead implementing a policy of illusions of normalcy, security, and prosperity so that the wealthy ruling elite can siphon and skim the most personal wealth from the economy until the sh*t hits the fan. Then, it will be every man for himself, with the wealthy having rigged the national security forces to protect their own physical interests and security while the "Big Collapse" of industrial civilization thins out the masses of the "common people".
      </p>

       How else can one explain the criminal failure to act on global warming? How else can one explain the failure to reform western agriculture and move away from chemical and water dependent food production in the proximity to Hubbert's peak of world oil production? A well-written synopsis of the agricultural situation, called "Eating Fossil Fuels", by David Allen Pfeifer, can be accessed at
       <a href="http://www.oilcrash.com/eating.htm">
        http://www.oilcrash.com/eating.htm
       </a>
       How else can the loss of speciation of the entire planet and the failure to resist it be explained? How else can the rise of corporation-based military forces be explained in an age of huge Federal deficits? (see the new book "Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry", by P.W. Singer, published in 2003 by Cornell University Press).
      </p>

       So, what we see is a U.S. Government desperately trying to create illusions. The illusions are designed to make the American public feel safe; to promote the workings of a maximum economy for as long as possible. An economy cannot humm along at maximum speed when people feel insecure, as in the aftermath of the 9/11 catastrophe, which many informed persons believe was only accomplished by some level of complicity of the U.S. government itself. So, in order to promote feeling of well-being and security of the American people, the U.S. Government has created the illusion of an investigatioin of the disaster, while stonewalling and hiding the evidence that would explain the disasters. A "Homeland Security" agency has been created which provides further illusions of security, while laying the basis for control of the population when the shit finally hits the fan. The mechanisms of homeland security are already being used to stifle dissent, to spy on the American people and likely to establish databases from which future covert and public actions can be taken to eliminate dissent altogether by whatever means necessary. Threats to "national security" in other nations trained by U.S. "counterinsurgency" forces have resulted in many, many thousands of "missing" people, and the same possibility is highly predictable in the U.S. itself in the intermediate future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many tragedies are now inevitable for the American people and the industrial civilizations of the world. It is just a matter of time before world petroleum-based fuel prices skyrocket. This will likely end modern agriculture as we have known it, making food production at the scale necessary for our civilization impossible. At the same time, the economies of the major nations of the world will implode in an ocean of debt. The retirement funds of the masses will be meaningless, but the wealthy will have stashed away wealth and military armaments to protect themselves through the expected years of upheaval and population die-off.
      </p>
      <p>
       There can be no doubt that the wealthy, corporate elite expects an eventual die-off of economies and masses of humans around the world. They are rigging the situation to survive while the masses perish. They will use their wealth and power to pay for their own survival, believing themselves to be superior by virtue of their ability to concentrate and consolidate their wealth at the expense of the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be too late already for the situation to be reversed. As long as the masses of working people are willing to see their work, their efforts, their skills and their sweat and blood distilled into wealth by the ruling class, they have no long-term hope. The entire system of economics, taxes, and government, plus media, is geared to the advantage of the greedy and against the needy. To keep the masses pacified, illusions of normaly, security, and prosperity are projected through media. The dumbed down masses have fallen for the bait -- hook, line and sinker.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the crash will be hard. When the shit hits the fan, a lot of angry people will realize they have been duped and now their end will be in sight. Then, the security forces will begin the slaughter, even as food become scarce, global climate change becomes a real danger to life itself, and the rich take cover behind their carefully planned escape routes and procedures.
      </p>
      <p>
       This avalanche is all set up. It will not be prevented for one and only reason -- sheer human greed by all involved. Even the so-called human democracies have failed to predict the coming disaster, because greed, not principle, has dominated the workings of the democracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fan is blowing now, and the revolutions are increasing in tempo. it is just a matter of time before the merde hits the fan.

       I think you're being too pessimistic. It's not going to be nearly so easy for them, and I think there are forces for Good in play that you either are unaware of or are discounting out of hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are supernatural forces in play, spiritual connections, well beyond the material greed that rules our world -- Rules, but does not CONTROL.
      </p>

       It's quite possible America as we know it won't make out too well in the shakeout, but I wouldn't write off the whole world just yet. And I'm not even writing off America. Our finest hour may yet be before us.
