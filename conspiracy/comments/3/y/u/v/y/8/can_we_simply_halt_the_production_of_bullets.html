<p>But I do find it curious that I&#39;ve never heard this angle come up in any public dialogue. Nor did I find it searching threads on Reddit. Has there been any in-depth look at this, or is it just a silly notion altogether?</p>

<p>Also, yes I know how easily brass is reloaded... I understand that there must be billions of rounds already loose in the US... I understand the potential for black/covert markets... And I sure as shit know how this would put average law abiding citizens at a serious disadvantage, and how it would infringe upon on our greatly substantiated right to self defense..</p>

<p>Like I said, just for the sake of discussion... What are some perspectives here?</p>

Yes, there are indeed some unfortunate useful idiots and people that are <em>that</em> lost, but I think TPTB&#39;s MSM machine also pushes the agenda forward <em>big time</em> behind smoke and mirrors that don&#39;t sufficiently reflect how some of the public <em>really</em> feels about many issues.</p>

<p>Obviously we are here, you and me, talking about this stuff... But does everyone else need a rallying point? A new medium? I know decentralization seems inevitable, man but do we really stand a chance all fragmented as we appear to be?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think many people these days feel comfortable with positing what the fuck is going, and those that do are just parroting bullshit and talking points... Like remoted and automated, self replicating fear mongering... The TPTB stand to gain from pitting us against each other. </p>

<p>Since the shit in MSM is misdirection, how do we build cohesion between us.. Is it even necessary?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wonderful question.  Cohesion <em>is</em> most definitely necessary.  This is the reason TPTB work so diligently at keeping us apart and antagonistic toward one another - because they know that a citizenry divided is a citizenry that is very easy to control and enslave.</p>

<p>So how do we build cohesion between us?  Well, it’s certainly difficult because there is so much troll and shill provocation left and right, as well as people that actually <em>believe</em> in racists ideals that keep the people divided and conquered.  I’m not super sure how to get everyone to see one another as family other than refusing to fight against you fellow brothers and sisters.  WAY easier said than done though.  I know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>do we really stand a chance all fragmented as we appear to be?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think we stand much of a chance fragmented - no.  I think the only way we can do well as a civilization and a species is by uniting together.  Strength in collective numbers, so to speak.  It sucks because it doesn’t actually seem like we as a species are really at the point where we can all see that we are one and <em>should</em> be united.  There’s too much fighting and (again) racism, and too many types that actually <em>believe</em> in the ignorant ideas they have.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The TPTB stand to gain from pitting us against each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly this.  This is how they ensure their own success.  Divide and conquer.</p>

<p>What’s the solution?  Well, seems to me that it’s something that I don’t think all of us as a species are ready to actually do.  As such, it appears that we will simply remained conquered and enslaved as we have been.  I just try to make sure and educate and evolve <em>myself</em> as much as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hell yeah bud. I&#39;m with you.. You have a teammate in me.</p>

<p>Lately I&#39;ve been on board with the idea of decentralization. Using a currency that can&#39;t be as easily misappropriated seems like one of the more practical things I can do... And just the simplicity of it. No violence necessary at it&#39;s core; it&#39;s basically just a work around.. A parallel economy...</p>

<p>I just want to feel like I am active in protecting my loved ones, friends, and community... And besides crypto, sharing knowledge and stimulating conversation seems like the most productive thing I can do. It just never feels like enough..</p>

<p>Thank you for engaging me in this thread.. I get more substantive contact on Reddit than I do with people in person unfortunately.. You guys are basically some of the only common minded people I know of.</p>

<p>So honestly, thank you... And know you have someone else on your side.</p>

<p>Much as I know that the fiat currency system is an absolutely horrible one, I can’t say I’m too super familiar with the ins and outs of crypto currency.  I’ve heard pros and cons by various sides and am not sure which side is more valid.</p>

<p>I understand these sentiments and feel similar enough.  I tend to work on educating myself as much as possible and, like you said, share as much information as I can with as many individuals as I can; teaching and learning, learning and teaching, so to speak.</p>

<p>I can’t say I disagree with this.  This is similar to my own perspective as well.  Kind of lame actually, as I wish, of course, that we could engage with others on meaningful subjects irl.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I feel the same way…which is actually kind of lame if you think about it since we don’t even know each other irl.  We’re just words on a screen, you know?  :/</p>

<p>finally, you have more important rights than the right to bear arms.  freedom of religion, to assemble, to speak your mind without fear of reprisal.  these are the rights that actually keep you safe because they allow us to call big brother on their bullshit and make it all public.  if rights like these are taken away, then we have nothing to fight them with.   in the above scenarios (which we all know are plausible, if we didnt think they were none of us would be here on this sub) a gun would do nothing except maybe take a couple of people out with you when youre killed.  the only thing you would have succeeded at  would be killing someone that was just following orders ( a police officer, swat team member etc) while the real culprit is scott free.  it all boils down to this: guns are for protecting your home, your rights are for protecting your freedom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read this and shut the fuck up.</p>

<p>If there was a revolution in the US, the rest of the world would get involved, fast. Depending on the type of uprising, there is a large chance that it would not be a quick affair. It would be brutal, it would be bloody, and the US government could start a global scale war. Here are the top ten issues that came up.</p>

<p>1) The US power grid can be taken down by a series of “surgical strikes” with the exception of the Texas grid. By surgical strikes, I mean a few marksmen (US army-tier Marksmen–the minimum requirement) hitting certain spots on the grid would fuck a lot of the military and government because they need the grid more than Bubba and his friends do. Additionally, while all government agencies have backup generators, they will be hard pressed dealing with the resultant looting and other madness that would come with power outages. This would effectively create another front for the military. It would also turn the people against the government more quickly and paralyze the government’s propaganda machine. Worse still–the key points of the US power grid are publicly obtainable information, and not only are the points too many to be effectively guarded, they are not guarded anyway.</p>

<p>2) The estimated desertion rate in case of a civil war is 75% in the case of a left-wing president. 50% of that would be assumed to immediately betray the president. The remaining (treasonous) military would be fighting its own. Yet another front created in the war. Additionally, there is an assumed 25-50% desertion or outright betrayal rate in three letter government agencies (FBI, CIA, NSA, ATC, TSA, etc.). Additionally, it is assumed that 5% of the initial 50% betrayers would stay in their job and become saboteurs. 10% of that 50% would contain key information that would be of critical danger to the US government. Of that 10%, 1% would be able to deliver that information to the US’ foreign enemies. What you should get from this is that the second the United States government declares war on its own is the second it ceases to exist as the state we know it.</p>

<p>3) “Tea baggers,” “right-wing extremists,” and “oath keepers” which are considered untrained racists who aren’t “good with a gun” often are A) veterans who now have more time to have fun at the range, sometimes more than some Army units or Marine units. In addition to previous military training, B) often camp and do other outdoor activities–more than many in the military do, as the focus has gone away from field exercises, and C) often have better equipment–outside of armor and heavy weapons–than the military. However, C) is kind of irrelevant because many of the places in which these people could hide would make the kind of war the US fights with the equipment they use pointless.</p>

<p>4) Outside influence is a huge problem. Russia has already stated they would back a Texas seperation movement. and right now we already have enough problem keeping Islam in check. The second the US has to fight in a “civil war” is the second it becomes a proxy war between NATO and whoever wants to mess with America. While America has amazing nuclear and air defense, if it comes to a civil war you have to assume that in a best cast scenario the US military is going to be operating at 50% capacity at best. Shit would go down. Hard. And fast. And if Russia–spoiler alert: one of the best militaries in the world at fighting in an urban environment–sent trainers and helpers to rebels, you can reliably bet that they would also possibly deliver weapons to them. So instead of fighting “Timmy TeaBagger,” you are fighting “Timmy TeaBagger who is buddies with Vlad.”</p>

<p>5) A civil war is not just the US versus the rebels. There will be looting. There will be rioting. Cities will burn. The National Guard cannot fight both the rebels and rioters in a city that would also cut off their supplies. Additionally, if you don’t think that the rebels will send in instigators into the cities–or worse, stand alone actors (A Lone Wolf on steroids. Think Timothy McVeigh, but instead of one van they have a whole fleet of them. A good movie example would be Bane)–you would be mistaken. If the US government cannot even help its own people. why would its own people support the remaining (treasonous) military? Worse yet, if someone emptied out prisons (There are more prisoners in the US than there are people in the entire Chinese Army), you would have more crime than the police could ever handle.</p>

<p>6) Logistics and infrastructure in the US are crumbling and failing. Any war fought against a rebellion in the US would be a logistical nightmare, even before the rebels started going full Al-Qaida and putting IEDs in the road. A retired general who was contracting with us on the team said, “The only thing holding together the US’ infrastructure is duct tape and the will of the Department of Transportation. And often enough, there isn&#39;t enough duct tape.” Your most loyal cities to the US government, as we polled, are also the most logistically easy to cut off. NYC? San Fran? L.A.? D.C.? Baltimore? Most of them require crossing water to enter, from certain directions. Most of them have critical air ports. Some of them have critical ocean ports. If anything happened to just TWO of the cities on the list, it would create a logistical clusterfuck.</p>

<p>7) Your “Johnny Reb” and “Timmy TeaBagger” states (i.e., “red” states) all have something most of your “oh so progressive,” “Aren’t we so European,” “Oh my god, we are just like Sweden,” blue states don’t. Blues are mainly consumer states. Reds are producer states. Urban areas don’t have farms. The second that shit goes down, realize a lot of those blue areas are likely to starve. In a civil war scenario, we predicted that at least 10,000 people would die of starvation if the war was not finished in a year. The numbers get worse after that.</p>

<p>8) The US has way too many choke points, and the government forces would often be on the wrong side of them. This ties into the logistical nightmare, but it also has to do with an odd phenomena. Liberals like to live near the ocean. Many of the dividers of the country, like the Rocky Mountains, the Mississippi River, Appalachia, the Missouri River (fun fact: the biggest choke point for the US government is in Missouri) are red state areas. Sure, air travel is a thing, but a majority of the US government&#39;s needs would have to travel by ground. Even still, many of the major airports are outside of the city. Of course, the US would use military base air fields, but if civil war did break out… which bases would be safe? Which ones would have fallen to the deserters?</p>

<p>9) PR Nightmare. Every rebel killed on CNN would be spun as “the US government killed X Civilians today in a strike” on foreign news and pirate media not owned by the government. That is–as pointed out earlier–if the US media could even function in a civil war or uprising. Your “rebel scum” know that the main thing that holds together the US–nay life in the US as we know it–is the 24 hour news cycle and the media. The second it&#39;s gone, you are going to have urban anarchy. If you are from America, can you imagine a day without TV, newspaper, or Internet? Your average urban youth can’t. If you don’t think that isn’t going to cause rioting, you must have a real high regard for how much restraint they have. Assume in a civil war that your ability to talk to the people is compromised. Also assume that in the case of a civil war that rebels may know how to monitor conversations like the US does, as there are manuals online on how to do so.</p>

<p>10) This one is either 1 or 10, depending on who is asked. The US will never nuke its own. The second it does, they have lost the civil war and other countries will come to “liberate” the US from its own “repressive regime.” Additionally, if any general, minuteman, nuke tech, or nuke sub captain decided to side with the rebellion, the US government is immediately SOL.</p>

<p>In short: The second that a “civilian uprising” or “extremist group terrorist attack” turns into “civil war” is the second the US loses. As a result, you will never see a civil war. You will see Waco, you will see Bundy Ranch, you will see all sorts of militant group confrontations and maybe even some skirmishes. But the US government fears its own people way the fuck too much to ever start a civil war. </p>
