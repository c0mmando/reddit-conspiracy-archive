    <div class="md"><p>I worked, briefly, for a company that conducted polls. I was not there long, but I was there long enough to figure out a few things about how it worked. The people who owned the business were later convicted of fraud. </p>

<p>They would receive an order for a poll, the questions and criteria for participating, from a third party. Then worker drones like me would receive instructions when we arrived at work before grabbing a phone headset and logging in to a computer terminal. Then we would load up a survey and an autodialer would start calling numbers out of a database. </p>

<p>From time to time the poll would have a ( yes/no ), ( Repulican / Democrat ) type of question right at the start where one of the responses would lead to a &quot;thank them and end the call&quot; type of action. Basically these polls were farming for responses that would favor a specific group&#39;s interests. Our &quot;data&quot; would then be reported to whoever commissioned the poll. </p>

<p>I do not know how major polling companies work, I only worked in one small office with a few dozen other people, but I can&#39;t imagine the large pollsters have the staff and resources to conduct poll after poll after poll. My best guess is that they outsource the actual dirty work to companies like the one for whom I worked and then use their reports when finalizing their polls. </p>

<p>But working there was hell. Most people seemed to hate it, my guess is because of those apparently rigged polls. Those questions made me feel dirty, so I would ask to conduct a different poll or just pretend to be talking to someone long after they had hung up and just randomly answer the questions so I would have one more &quot;completed&quot; poll on my computer so it looked as if I was actually doing something. This itself was risking the &#39;loss&#39; of the job, since the supervisor would plug in to random terminals from his desk and listen in from time to time. </p>

<p>People showed up drunk, high, some people drank while working or took &quot;cigarette&quot; breaks. We were constantly calling people who would get angry, say something like &quot;I&#39;m on the do not call list, how many times do I have to tell you people...&quot; Even though I only worked there for a short time, the name of the company we were working for <em>was not</em> how we identified ourselves when we called. That information was in a script we had to read, word for word, on each call. I finally just stopped going in, it made me feel dirty. </p>

<p>Selling addictive drugs to children would probably not feel as dirty, and at least then I could call myself &quot;doctor&quot; or &quot;pharmacist,&quot; or something respectable. </p>

<p>Since that experience I have not trusted a single poll. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>at least you didn&#39;t have to ask people for money. I did that for a few weeks once years ago for a job. Door to door, face to face, worse than getting rejected on phone call. No one gives money to door to door salesmen except maybe elderly people who don&#39;t realize it. At least your voting poll thing is in theory for the good of people (I mean if politics weren&#39;t rigged, the polls weren&#39;t rigged)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Polls are misleading and there is a huge margin for error.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.comres.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IoS-SM-Political-Poll-December-2015.pdf">From this recent poll in Britain,</a> the frontpage voting intentions are 29% Labour and 40% conservative. But looking at page 7 the raw data is 29% Labour 32% conservative.</p>

<p>They can justify changing the raw data because Labour supporters more often don&#39;t bother voting in actual elections. But its misleading to call it voting intentions and misleading to change the data by such a huge margin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie did very well and won every debate. There are a whole bunch of polls are showing that. The funny part is the MSM use a poll of a 160 people who said Hillary won the debate and then other MSM used that as a reference. They ignored several other polls.

    <div class="md"><p>Polls are scientific. At least they should be. But you can back door the results. For example, if you find land line respondents overwhelmingly vote a certain way you can simply use them and get the desired results. One has to really look into the methodology.
