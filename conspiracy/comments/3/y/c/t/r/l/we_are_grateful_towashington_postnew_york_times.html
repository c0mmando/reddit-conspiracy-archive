       Purported remarks at a Bilderberg Group meeting in Baden-Baden, Germany in June 1991, The remarks are said to have been printed in several right-wing French publications shortly thereafter; as quoted in Programming, Pitfalls and Puppy-Dog Tales (1993) by Gyeorgos C. Hatonn, p. 65.

       "For more than a century, ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions.
       <strong>
        Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure — one world, if you will. If that is the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it."

       <p>
        The Fed is private (owned by the banks, according to their own website).
       </p>

       What their web site actually says:
       <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_14986.htm">
        <strong>
         Who owns the Federal Reserve?
        </strong>
       </a>
       The Federal Reserve System fulfills its public mission as an independent entity within government.  It is not "owned" by anyone and is not a private, profit-making institution. ... The 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, which were established by the Congress as the operating arms of the nation's central banking system, are organized similarly to private corporations--possibly leading to some confusion about "ownership." For example, the Reserve Banks issue shares of stock to member banks. However, owning Reserve Bank stock is quite different from owning stock in a private company. The Reserve Banks are not operated for profit, and ownership of a certain amount of stock is, by law, a condition of membership in the System. The stock may not be sold, traded, or pledged as security for a loan; dividends are, by law, 6 percent per year.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Fed prints money at interest and the govt uses our taxes to pay the interest - well since the Fed is private then who the fuck is getting those interest payments (about $230B per year).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Almost all profits from the Federal Reserve (after the 6% dividend mentioned above) go to the Federal Government.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Federal Reserve creates money and uses it to buy assets. Some of the assets it buys are government bonds. The government pays interest on the bonds, not on the money.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fiscal year 2014, the government paid $430 billion in gross interest on bonds. Of that, $158 billion was paid to other parts of the government (not the Federal Reserve), such as the Social Security Trust fund. Subtracting that and other interest income, the government paid $229 billion in net interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of that, about $63 billion went to the Federal Reserve. But the Federal Reserve paid the government $97 billion.

       In 2014, the Federal Reserve paid member banks dividends totalling nearly $1.7 billion ($1,685,826,000). (From

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There is no such thing as "controlling shares" in the Federal Reserve. Each member bank gets two votes to choose directors of its regional Federal Reserve Bank. The number of shares only determines how much dividend a bank gets. Each member bank is told how much stock it must own in its regional Federal Reserve Bank.

       So 229B in net interest (edit: right, I did say 230B) of which 63B went to Fed - but the Fed paid the govt 97B. That math doesn't work out does it? Also, where did the 229B-63B go?

      <p>
       I'm not in the US - I can't access that fed page, not sure if it is blocked or what here. Who is it audited by? And where can I find the audit documentation? I know the GAO recently did some audits - but that was focused on the bailout. And why are some in congress clamoring for a completely independent audit and why is Janet Yellen strongly opposing it?

      <p>
       The Federal Reserve had income from sources other than government bonds--mainly mortgage-backed securities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other 229B-63B that the government paid in interest went to the other owners of government bonds. Most government bonds are not owned by the Federal Reserve.

      <p>
       The financial statements are currently audited by Deloitte and Touche LLP. A few years ago, the auditor was KPMG. The financial statements are on the the web site. I don't know why it would be blocked for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The GAO also does audits of various aspects of the Federal Reserve. They are blocked by law from auditing the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions, since those are supposed to be independent of Congress, as well as a few other things, such as transactions with foreign central banks.

       People invited to the Bilderberg meetings include corporate leaders, politicians, reporters, and academics. So people at the meetings control a lot, but "the group" doesn't control them.
