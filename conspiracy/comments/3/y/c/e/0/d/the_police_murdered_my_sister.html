        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This was in 2011 when there were a lot of cyberattacks. My sister was 14 at the time, and she was likely involved in that. Something happened, and my sister and her friends got in trouble for threatening to kill someone, so the FBI visited our house and asked her questions but they left. The local police arrest her a day later and then that night she dies. My parents are told that it was a suicide and that she cut her wrist. However, my sister is left-handed, but her left wrist was cut. She also had taken valium and she didn&#39;t even know what valium was, so I don&#39;t know why she would willingly take it.</p>

<p>I have her death certificate, and I tried to get her autopsy and the investigation of her death, but they told me both times that such record does not exist. I even asked if she was ever there, and they told me she was not. They didn&#39;t just give me some fake one or some made up one. They literally told me that it doesn&#39;t exist when the death certificate proves otherwise. I faxed them a copy and they couldn&#39;t explain it and just told me that they didn&#39;t have the records I was looking for. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m thinking is that the Feds couldn&#39;t prove that my sister was involved in the 2011 cyberattacks, so they had her killed. Then they covered it up by deleting all her records because they realize later that they made a mistake in cutting her wrists. </p>

<p>All media mention of her is also nonexistent. There would have been some media reports of her death, but her name returns nothing. </p>

<p>It also confirmed my suspicions that cutting your wrists, rather than slashing open your forearms would take hours and hours for you to bleed out, and often doesn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>Also, how did she take Valium in police custody? OP&#39;s description seems contradictory, although is likely missing detail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, I&#39;m so sorry to hear this.</p>

<p>Have you thought about making a website or video to make a big stink about the death of your sister? Granted, doing so would probably cause trouble for you and your family, much like Steven Avery from &#39;Making A Murderer&#39; on Netflix, but may eventually lead to the truth.</p>

<p>If you need money for a private investigation and proper representation, you could use GoFundMe to raise funds. I would certainly chip-in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>honey..i mean this in the nicest way. If someone wants to commit suicide..they will find a way. My friend courtney was left handed &amp; slit both wrists..its left handed not no hand. Think of all us right handers can do with our left hands..also this will lead no where &amp; eat you alive. </p>

<p>My brother commited public suicide. A comment on our news fb said a person was watching with binoculars from the 2story apartment complex across the street from where my brother was. He said when the swat team ran up he saw my brother hand over a gun &amp; go to give the 2nd one up..but the cop holding my brothers gun panicked shooting him in the chest. That was never proven because the news footage shuts off at that moment like it was edited &amp; picks up with my brother dying in the parking lot. We looked into it all &amp; had more leads. It only brought more heartache :( its NOT easy hearing your loved one commited suicide..it sucks. </p>

<p>As for the valium..sometimes jails give it to keep them calm. They keep it cold, food is loaded in carbs &amp; they give people who need it sedatives. Its all to keep the jail as controlled as possible. </p>

<p>I do hope you dont take any of this as me calling you crazy or etc..ive been where you are questioning everything. Im always up to talk if you would like too...just an ear of sorts to vent too. My heart truly hurts for you love.</p>

<p>I think my sister only cut her left-wrist. The autopsy reports would have it, but I don&#39;t have access to it because they&#39;re saying that it doesn&#39;t exist. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t hurt me to look into this. I feel I owe it to her if she was murdered because she&#39;d had done the same for me. It makes me closer to her because we were twins and we were suppose to be in each others classes and like graduate high school together and all. </p>

<p>Private or government facility?..

<p>Private facilities will have many more disgruntled former employees willing to talk, if its a govt facility...try retired officers and officers who work for a different dept.    </p>

<p>Talk to others who were in custody about the same time... </p>

<p>There should have been copious amounts of blood, being a juvenile facility, likely they have a janitorial staff...</p>

<p>Make sure you can recieve information anonymously...</p>

<p>Find out what bars they go drinking at after work.. become a regular, eavesdrop like a fly on the wall.. record everything you can. Even better, send a hot scantily clad female, or 2, to these bars... they&#39;ll get liquored &amp; trip over their dicks to impress tail. Different shifts often have different spots btw..  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A - sorry for your loss </p>

<p>B - odds are if she was doing unstable things as threatening to kill someone, she probably was either on, or at a minimum, knew about various drugs</p>

<p>C - in corroboration with being unstable, if she took a potentially mind altering medication, even if she wasn&#39;t suicidal, it it can drastically alter her mentality and how she acts</p>

<p>D - if she cut her wrists, like over ~85% of female suicides, it was probably for attention or manipulation. She expected to get caught and taken care of before she died</p>

<p>E - while incarcerated, the state is required to take care of you and a nurse probably prescribed her that medication.</p>

<p>You&#39;re just upset and want to find someone to blame other than your sister. It is understandable. But, she probably did do this herself.</p>

<p>Again, I am sorry.</p>

<p>it&#39;s easier to use your dominant hand if you want a clean and thorough cut. the non-dominant hand would shake and cause problems. you can&#39;t get a good cut if you aren&#39;t steady.</p>

<p>police confiscate any &quot;weapons&quot;, even lighters, at the time of arrest. she couldn&#39;t have gotten her hands on a razor, while in prison, in less than 12 hours. sorry.</p>
