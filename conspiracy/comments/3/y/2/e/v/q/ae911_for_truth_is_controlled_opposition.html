        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Thermite, thermate, or nano-thermite alone cannot explain the lack of rubble and total pulverization of steel, office furniture, bathroom fixtures, and human bodies -- not to mention the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N7AgArSl-s&amp;feature=youtu.be"><del>239%</del> 1,100% elevated incidences of thyroid cancer in WTC recovery workers</a>. Hell, <a href="https://youtu.be/Lec9giab90I?t=2h27m37s">you can see the detonation points in satellite imagery</a>.</p>

<p>Knowing 9/11 was an inside job, that we were attacked by our own government, is bad enough. But it is not the bottom of that rabbit hole. The public <strong>must not know</strong> that WTC1, 2, &amp; 7 were demolished by <a href="https://youtu.be/Lec9giab90I?t=1h26m6s">nuclear demolition devices</a>. Our government set off not one, not two, but three nukes in the most crowded city in the US. And then concealed it from the WTC recovery workers -- they could have prevented hundreds of cases of cancer with simple potassium iodide pills. The betrayal here is off the scale.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an excellent new documentary on this, &quot;Thermite Hoax - 9/11 WTC an Act of Nuclear War&quot; (uploaded Sep 11, 2015): </p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://youtu.be/gClwoSA5ZKo">Part Three</a> (whodunnit)</li>
</ul>

<p>credit to <a href="/u/MurrueLaFlaga">/u/MurrueLaFlaga</a> for finding this documentary</p>

<p>Or for more focus on the technical aspects of nuclear detonation, this one is fantastic:</p>

<p>edit:</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a nice article, originally in the German magazine <em>NEXUS</em>:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I know AE say it wasn&#39;t just thermite, but that&#39;s all they have evidence for at this time. As for them being controlled opposition, I doubt it. We have a few examples of such and AE don&#39;t fit the profile. On the whole they seem well reasoned and stick to what they know, but they could have a few infiltrators or been given bad intel so......</p>

<p>What&#39;s wrong? Are you frustrated at their apparent lack of progress over the years?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another piece of very compelling evidence that nukes were used on 9/11 is the USGS dust sample analysis which was tested at UC Davis. Link posted below of a very detailed discussion of what was found and why it indicates (proves) there was nuclear activity that day. </p>

<p>I talked to Richard Gage about this issue and he told me that he did not get into the question of nukes BECAUSE he didn&#39;t understand the science. Later his group put up a &quot;debunking&quot; of the nuclear demolition theory based on junk science, which I found deeply offensive. Before that I would defend him and his group, but not anymore. Now I just get angry (and silent) whenever the issue comes up. </p>

<p>As a 9/11 truther who believes the buildings were nuked, I have probably received more abuse on the topic than just about anyone else I know of. IMO, Judy Woods is fully aware it was a nuclear event and made up a lot of nonsense science in order to get people off track. </p>

<p>Probably, the actual truth movement is harmed by you spreading this false information. But, hey, that&#39;s the point isn&#39;t it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think so. I think more went down on that day (nukes). That being said, if we can bring this to the general populous and get another investigation and prosecute the perps. It really doesn&#39;t matter to me (and could lead to more evidence of a nuke). It&#39;s like saying, that JFK was taken out by a .308 not a .9mm. We know who was behind it.

<p>AE911Truth puts out the most compelling and fact-based educational materials about 9/11.</p>

<p>The &quot;mini-nuke&quot; people put out stupid videos and lots of science fiction.</p>

<p>How would AE911Truth be a &quot;limited hangout?&quot; What, the government wants us to believe a combination of thermetic materials and conventional controlled demolition was used to destroy the three WTC buildings, because they are covering up &quot;space beams&quot; and &quot;mini-nukes?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so why hide the nuclear nature of 9/11, while allowing the &#39;inside job&#39; aspect to be known? i think its because it proves that israel has access to thermonuclear devices within the usa. and i think theyre working on a grand finale for when this whole babylon system falls.</p>
