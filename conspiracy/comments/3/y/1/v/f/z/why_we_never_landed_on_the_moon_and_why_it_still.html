<p>I mean come on NASA -- what&#39;d ya lose the directions? You&#39;re telling me we did this awesome thing back in the 60s and just never felt like doing it again? Common sense would tell you as Americans, we&#39;d have a McDonalds and a Wal-Mart up there by now. Let alone the fact that <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/216013-nasa-crowdsources-mars-spacesuit-durability-testing-offers-15000-in-prizes">they admit that their spacesuits don&#39;t work</a>.

<p>The only evidence we have is shoddy at best that it actually even happened and no one else in the world has ever claimed to even being close to even comprehending such a feat.

<p>Why does this matter? Because if we&#39;re wrong about this we&#39;re wrong about everything... But I&#39;m sure you&#39;re right, and NASA isn&#39;t just a PSYOPS program sucking at the teat of American taxpayers developed by Hitler-loving President killers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to realize that the Moon Landings were not a trivial undertaking, and the costs were very much astronomical even at the time, unfeasible if the only goal was scientific research or exploration. The whole affair was, before all the rest, a stand-in for war with the Soviet Union. A show of superiority. </p>

<p>Without that, a space race cannot be maintained on anywhere near the same level as we saw in the 60&#39;s. This is why essentially all exploratory missions are robotic now - between superior technology and lower costs, there&#39;s rarely an economical model which would support a manned alternative. But nobody&#39;s half as impressed by a robot doing something, compared to a human being. We&#39;re egocentric that way. </p>

<p>The only way that more manned missions beyond LEO are feasible today is if the goals are different - either focusing on gathering resources or outright settlement. Flags and Footprints might work once or twice, but that&#39;s not a sustainable framework. If you want to resurrect the space race, it&#39;d have to be a race to claim new territory for whatever nation, corporation or group sets out to do it. </p>

<p>Basically, it&#39;s all well and good to pay Columbus to sail west, but you ain&#39;t gonna do that a dozen more times unless you send along supplies to start building in far-flung lands. You need return on investment, even if it&#39;s just investing in the local area. This is why SpaceX and the like are focusing on that type of Mars mission, rather than a been-there-done-that affair which would just result in another lull of little or no outward exploration. </p>

<p>Regarding your links - the spacesuit article clearly states that they&#39;re looking to develop more resilient spacesuits to deal with the rigors of Mars, rather than that there&#39;s no spacesuits right now. It even mentions the ones used on the Moon, which got damaged by the abrasive dust and as such wouldn&#39;t really work in any sort of long-term mission. Besides that, they&#39;re not really meant to be used on a surface at all - there&#39;s a reason why they&#39;re ungainly waddling things! </p>

<p>As for the Van Allen belts, they were talking about testing a new spacecraft&#39;s resistance to radiation; Apollo-era technology would have relatively little of relevance to modern-day equipment. Your apparent interpretation that NASA somehow forgot about the Moon landings is one of the dumber things I&#39;ve ever heard. Is that really a plausible explanation?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The Soviet Union was fairly far along its own path to a Moon mission at the time, as the US and it strove to outdo each other; they actually have a lot of firsts in space technology until they were eventually overtaken. Other nations have landed crafts on the Moon since then, or orbited it, and there&#39;s even numerous robotic crafts to other planets. The technology to keep people alive in space is also fairly common now, with the International Space Station as an obvious example. All the parts are there, and comprehensible - it just takes the will to go forth. And money, of course. ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their lunar rocket didn&#39;t really measure up, and exploded several times on the launchpad or during launch. The designer also died around that time, and there wasn&#39;t really enough talent to continue the program without reworking it. The US landing just sealed the deal, with most of the funds allocated elsewhere from then on. Without the competition, neither side maintained that investment; half of NASA&#39;s planned missions were cancelled as well in the following years.</p>

<p>How come we only went to the moon once? Why did we go just once and never go back huh?</p>

<p>These arguments are always used by people as &quot;proof&quot; the moon landings were faked.</p>

<p>Education these days is so awfully bad they have never heard of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apollo_missions">Apollo missions</a> which included multiple landings on the moon between 1969 and 1972.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We went to the moon. </p>

<p>When I was a kid - long ago - they used to bring moon rock samples around to high schools so kids could do geology science with them. This was at a time when high schools still actually taught science. When we had real facilities for chemistry and physics. And when geology used real rocks, sometimes even borrowed rocks brought back from the moon. </p>

<p>There are laser reflectors scattered at various landing sites. And video of astronauts placing those reflectors on the moon&#39;s surface. With which you can beam a HeNe laser and both verify its existence and - with some calculation - also verify aspects of Relativity theory. Something else advanced high school used to teach when public schools actually taught students real science instead of which box to mark on national standards tests.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had opportunity to speak with Edgar Mitchell on occasion. We&#39;re not close. But I&#39;ve spoken with him a few times. He&#39;s the astronaut who claims UFOs are real. Along with former Astronaut Brian O&#39;Leary (who sadly passed away a few years ago). </p>

<p>Anyway, Mitchell walked on the moon. Ask the man. He has the balls to speak out about UFOs - real or not, its not good for his standing and career - so if he didn&#39;t walk on the moon like the historical record says he did, I think the man would speak. He just doesn&#39;t do bullshit. </p>

<p>We went to the moon. </p>

<p>Did they fake the earlier Apollo missions where people died?

<p>Do you have a source for the fact that it was NASA that provided rocks to the Dutch government?  As far as I know, the rock was provided by a US Ambassador, not by NASA.  Furthermore, the rock wasn&#39;t even labelled as a moon rock.  Lastly, the rock was far larger than any of the other gifted moon rock samples, came in a different package and was provided years prior to rocks even being given out.  It seems strange that this is a point you consider to be salient.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You will never have to think about the fact that large moonrocks are regularly found lying on the surface of Antarctica - much easier to collect than sending a man to the moon, don&#39;t you think? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A total of approximately 70kg of lunar meteorites have been found on the entire planet, while the Apollo missions collected approximately 380kg.  Does this mean that all of the people involved in the meteorite searches are secretly giving meteorites to NASA?  What about the geological differences between lunar rocks and meteorites, how do you account for those?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And, you can ignore the fact that the US does not dispute that Russians collected their own moon samples and set up their own laser-retroreflectors on the moon during their UNMANNED Lunokhod missions. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>These used completely different technologies.  Not only that, but the Lunokhod missions returned with approximatley 0.1% of mass of rocks that were collected by the Apollo missions, not really comparable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One obvious way is to avoid going through them. They&#39;re called belts because they only cover parts of the sky, so you can avoid them entirely (or the vast majority of them) by going in another direction. </p>

<p>The Apollo missions planned a course that <a href="http://www.braeunig.us/apollo/pics/doserate1.gif">avoided</a> the most radiation-filled parts, skirting the outside of the outer belts, and all the astronauts carried dosimeters to keep track of their radiation exposure.

<p>If this were the case, why wouldn&#39;t they just skirt around the Van Allen belt for Orion instead of testing the radiation before they could send <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlXG0REiVzE#t=3m32s">people through it again,</a> twice?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are plenty of trajectories where skirting the belts isn&#39;t really practical, so you&#39;d have to go through some of the more dangerous parts.

<p>First, man was able to get to the moon, which is 289,000 miles away by skirting around the Van Allen belt, which according to Wikipedia, is 60,000KMs above Earth but now you&#39;re telling me that man hasn&#39;t gone through the thickest part of the belt?</p>

<p>But according to this <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/van-allen-probes-spot-impenetrable-barrier-in-space">Nasa page,</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Van Allen belts were the first discovery of the space age, measured with the launch of a US satellite, Explorer 1, in 1958. In the decades since, scientists have learned that the size of the two belts can change – or merge, or even separate into three belts occasionally. But generally the inner belt stretches from 400 to 6,000 miles above Earth&#39;s surface and the outer belt stretches from 8,400 to 36,000 miles above Earth&#39;s surface.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So from 1958 until now, scientists have observed how the belt can and will change shape.  </p>

<p>So how were they able to predict what shape the belt was before &quot;skirting&quot; around the belt?</p>

<p>And in what decade did they learn that the shape changes?</p>

<p>And what shapes do the belts form into?  Could it be that one of the shapes could interfere with that computer graphic in that youtube link?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>What makes you think you can only send one probe? Besides, although there is flux in the intensity of radiation in the belts, they don&#39;t change to any huge degree on a short timescale, and at most it would increase radiative dose to a higher (but still safe) dose. You can see that in the official doses, too; some flights had almost 10 times as much radiation exposure, with Apollo 11 being one of the more relatively benign ones.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You can look up the definition and measurements of the belts fairly easily, since even wiki has a decent write-up with references available. If you think &#39;can look up basic facts&#39; qualifies me as an expert on part with the original author, that&#39;s not really my problem.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What specific facts are you looking references for? Most of the basics are listed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt">here</a>, with references at the bottom. An analysis of the radiation dose received on the Apollo missions is available <a href="http://www.braeunig.us/apollo/VABraddose.htm">here</a>, including extensive calculations based on official sources &amp; known measurements. References to how variable the belts are almost universally talk about how strong the radiation is (largely due to solar influence) and little about size changes, so it seems the latter is of relatively minor influence. </p>

In the decades since, scientists have learned that the size of the two belts can change – or merge, or even separate into three belts occasionally.

<p>The only thing I could conclude about you is that you&#39;re nothing but a hack trying to defend something you know nothing about.  The extent of your knowledge is that you&#39;re able to repeat theories from other people.  You don&#39;t have any original thoughts going through your pea brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of the memory on the Apollo missions were made from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-core_memory">core rope memory</a>, it was used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer">Apollo Guidance Computer</a>. This stuff is literally small rings of iron with copper wire running through/around it. It was extremely reliable, since the only way for the data to change would be physically re-weave the cores.</p>

<p>Modern memory is made of silicon, and has each bit measured in the <em>nanometer</em>. Do you see how modern computers may be affected differently by radiation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never commented on this, but here&#39;s my 2 cents. The evidence points to not going to the moon. Just recently a nasa scientist came out and stated they are figuring out how to combat the van Alan belts! No chance they simply forgot how to do it. </p>

<p>As for stuff being on the moon, I&#39;ve no doubt we&#39;ve been there, just not carrying man. That there are reflectors on the moon does not prove a man made flight.</p>

<p>That said, pretty damn cool we could fake it. Only in America would that have been a possibilty. That, in itself, is an achievement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is there an on-going attempt to deny that mankind went to the moon?</p>

<p>Because it was an achievement almost wholly of white Christian men. Humanity didn&#39;t go to the moon -- white Christian males went to the moon, and the feminists and SJWs and liberals and communists and cultural Marxists and Jews and Muslims and blacks <em>can&#39;t stand that truth</em>.</p>
