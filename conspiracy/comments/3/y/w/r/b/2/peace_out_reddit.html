    <div class="md"><p>I discovered that nearly all the VPNs are compromised by the NSA, not by breaking encryption but by ownership and alliegance.  They run their vpns on amazon&#39;s aws servers or google&#39;s: compromised.    On cloudflare: compromised.  On limelight cdn compromised.  On digitalocean compromised.  The DNS their software sets is google or level3, no matter how it disguises itself.  private internet access  is considered the most private, which means it&#39;s the most NOT, you can verify by the fact that I was with them and they gave ALL my info over to amazon.  When the recurring payment came up, it billed me through an amazon processor and tried to bill using the card on file with amazon, instead of the prepaid credit card I had used previously.  This was all done without my knowledge or consent. I complained directly to them and they ignored me 3 times on this issue.</p>

<p>You have to have a vpn in seychelles, russia or an enemy of the us country in order to really get privacy.  That&#39;s fucked up.</p>

<p>SO I&#39;ve given up that game.  I paid for 99yrs of vpn (&#39;vpn unlimited&#39;) on boingboing that i found out is compromised, so I use for Netflix but that&#39;s about it.  There&#39;s no more privacy unless you use tails and tor, use the secured tails firefox browser and never ever log in to anywhere.  Sorry to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there really isnt a lot to worry about in reddit. i just allow all of it. it gets tricky for instance when you go to a news source/site. holy christ the cookies they try to lay on you from those? unbelievable.    so you just have to play with it.  like you go to a news site and no script is blocking a vid you want to watch. the script you want is usually a cdn. something. it takes time. ad block is cool but it is on or off  no customizing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously don&#39;t use chrome either.  by default it has a remote desktop viewer enabled, which means all this time you didn&#39;t know it even existed they&#39;ve could have been looking at everything you do.  If it&#39;s gone from your chrome plugins, then it&#39;s either been removed because &#39;we&#39; forced them to remove it by mass surveillance fear mongering and deep state scrutiny, or they&#39;ve just baked it into the browser itself making it immutable, and removed <em>your knowledge of it instead</em>.  Which do you think they did?</p>

<p>chrome://plugins/  Disable everything except wildevine and flash, you need those for netflix and amazon, which are the only 2 things you should be using chrome for anyway, if ever.  It&#39;s better if you take it off your computer and use firefox like someone who knows something about what&#39;s what in their world around them.</p>

<p>Also: Ghostery is deep state.  Sorry.  Use NOSCRIPT and WorldIP</p>

<p>How do you know Ghostery is deep state?  It slows down amazon browsing to where the browser almost doesn&#39;t function.  Which says one of 2 things--1) it&#39;s using amazon to load some script that run at high CPU so it&#39;s doing something really complex, which likely means they are siphoning data or ghostery+amazon are trying to hack your machine by password cracking, 2) you the end user is being severely punished by amazon for having ghostery installed (amazon is effectively CIA now)--which means that this would be provable and a case for suing Amazon...which hasn&#39;t happened, therefore see item #1</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally understand that ghostery have an adequate level of privacy, specially if you opt-out for the GhostRank, but you should be cautious with any &quot;privacy enhancer&quot; plugin, for that reason I also use Adblock and the &quot;Do Not Track&quot; available on Firefox. On Chrome you can use disconnect as a second layer of protection. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s good advice. I do use disconnect, I&#39;ll have to check out ghostery. </p>

<p>I just want people to be aware that &quot;Do Not Track&quot; does not make them any more secure. Like &quot;private browsing,&quot; I fear it provides people with a false sense of security. I still think true privacy is likely unattainable on the modern internet, but tools such as what you recommend do make it harder to be tracked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? OP just said he&#39;s leaving here, so while I heard his last statement, I likely won&#39;t hear anything he says again (unless he comes crawling back here.) I&#39;m all for trying to migrate off reddit to a more decentralized system, but you can&#39;t just leave and expect people to follow. All leaving from reddit would accomplish is a slow drain of alternative viewpoints; the hive-mind will just become more solidified.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ghostery has a mobile browser with built-in adblock that I use, although truth be told staying clear of any tracking with a mobile device is a bit moot if you&#39;re more worried about the NSA tracking since they&#39;ll just get the data from the ISP directly. I also have GPS disabled. You can also use tor but it&#39;s really slow. I&#39;m not leaving reddit because honestly I think they already operate like this, they are just making it official now. I&#39;m not going to change my behavior just cause some power hungry creeps want to control the Internet. </p>
