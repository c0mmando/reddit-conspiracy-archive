        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Americans seem to understand something that most of the rest of the world seems not to understand.</p>

<p>It is very simple.</p>

<p>Any person who willingly hands over their arms is a coward.</p>

<p>Any person who willingly hands over their weapons to authorities who are not disarmed, have willingly accepted their slavery.  You have willingly given up your freedom.</p>

<p>Because they now own you.  They are armed, you are not, and they can do whatever they want to you.  You have no way to stand up for yourself or your rights.</p>

<p>You can cry and yell and scream about it, and throw out your intellectual arguments, and your numbers, and your talking points.  You are ignorant and naive of the nature of authority and governments and powers.  The world is not a utopia, and will never be as long as powers exist  and have weapons. So to disarm yourself in today&#39;s world is absolutely foolish and cowardly. </p>

<p>If you are anti-gun, you are pro-slavery.</p>

<p>This understanding that Americans have is bred deep in the bones and the fabric of the American consciousness, ever since Americans picked up arms to fight for their freedom, and the founding fathers created the 2nd Amendment, to protect the people from a tyrannical government.</p>

<p>We will never give up our arms willingly, not without a fight , it will never happen - count on it.</p>

<p>&quot;Our main agenda is to have all guns banned. We must use whatever means possible. It doesn&#39;t matter if you have to distort the facts or even lie. Our task of creating a socialist America can only succeed when those who would resist us have been totally disarmed.&quot; Sara Brady Chairman, Handgun Control Inc, to Senator Howard Metzenbaum The National Educator, January 1994, Page 3. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They aim to see us unarmed. This is why we need militias, armed communities standing together both to defend themselves and their neighbors against government seizure of their weapons and to drive out undesirable elements from their neighborhoods. If you aren&#39;t willing to fight and die for your neighbor, why would you expect him to do the same for you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Americans disarmed themselves long ago. The fact you hold a physical gun in hand is irrelevant, When you wake up everyday defeated and deflated. Trudge your way to your 9 to 5 job more than half your life. Extorted into handing over half your life&#39;s wages to the money masters. Drink your fluoride water and get your flu shots. Watch your super bowls and idol stars and drink your piss beer.
Eat your diseased steak. Beef, it&#39;s what&#39;s for dinner!
Eat your gmo corn and soy products. Go for a swim in your pesticide lakes and relax in a fuckyoushima sea. Don&#39;t forget to post a selfie on fecesbook.  We are all so happy!
Post stuff on the internet like reddit. We are united we are fighting the system. We won&#39;t let corruption win.
We are living in the system. It&#39;s already happened.</p>

<p>If they decide to bring in the military, most soldiers will not fire upon Americans.  If they choose too, they will also be outnumbered, and it will be a long bloody fight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that you don&#39;t have true unity around this issue. If you were to ask every person with a gun in America if they would give up their way of life and the safety and security of their family to go fight a war with the federal government in order to protect their right to own a firearm, you would likely find yourself more alone than you think. Australia is a perfect example - they had a gun culture much like ours and it was resulting in mass shootings, so the government decided to disarm everyone. There wasn&#39;t an armed revolt, there wasn&#39;t a Government occupation of the country - they just changed the law and &quot;took people&#39;s guns away.&quot; The result was no more mass shootings and a drastic reduction in gun violence. This issue simply isn&#39;t worth destroying your whole life over - it&#39;s a public health issue, not a tyranny issue. We&#39;re way beyond that now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, yeah, I don&#39;t consider myself a &quot;gun grabber.&quot; I happen to own one, I&#39;m just being realistic about this issue and pointing out that tough talk on the internet is easy when nothing is at stake. Just pointing out that we&#39;ve amended the constitution many times and it&#39;s not some crazy thing that can&#39;t happen. Hell, Colorado just amended the State constitution to allow for recreational marijuana use. Point is, this big stand-off you have in your head where all of your gun-owning neighbors band together to fight off the lawless, tyrannical government just isn&#39;t going to happen. They will put you in a position where you&#39;re breaking the law and face jail time if you want to keep your gun. And unless you&#39;re completely crazy, you&#39;ll give it up just like the rest of us. I point this out because it&#39;s going to happen - not a question of &quot;if&quot; but when. You know how I know? Because we have an epidemic of gun violence in this country, an electorate that is becoming significantly more progressive, and every other 1st World nation on earth has outlawed firearms in some significant way, resulting in far less gun violence. The government won&#39;t decide this needs to happen - the people will. Public sentiment will continue to move toward disarmament, and then the politicians will get on board. The government already knows that your guns don&#39;t offer you any real power over them - they could care less if you have one or not - it&#39;s all about public opinion and that&#39;s changing rapidly. My hope is that you&#39;re realistic about it, rather than ginning up some misplaced rage over a false sense of what your gun actually entitles you to. It won&#39;t protect you from the government and it won&#39;t allow you to break the law. Deal with it.</p>

<p>Wrong. The Constitution has been amended very few times, particularly when compared to the attempts to do so. It could happen, if 2/3rds of Congress agree, 75% of the states ratify the amendment and monkeys fly out of my ass, which is as likely as the first two conditions. See, the public overwhelmingly supports gun rights despite what your teevee tells you. </p>

No. Do they say to themselves that they better be good or risk the wrath of the armed citizen militias? Nope. Their media propaganda does the job for them - it keeps us divided into 2 groups (in this case, gun control vs. 2nd amendment rights), fighting amongst ourselves instead of concentrating on the real villains.

    <div class="md"><p>I am not suggesting that the revolution would be peaceful. But like most other revolutions in history (ancient and very recent), the population can start unarmed and can acquire weapons, convert part of the military/police apparatus, adopt the appropriate approach to resistance, and ultimately defeat the tyranny.</p>

<p>My argument is that having small arms at the start of the next American revolution is not going to make a big difference. Maybe slightly fewer victims of the revolution and the faster start. But the revolutionaries would still have to figure out the right guerilla warfare, acquire more and heaver weapons, play the politics, focus on intelligence, do the PR to discourage or convert members of armed forces and to align the people, etc.</p>

<p>The small benefit of having the population armed with small arms at the start of the revolution is not sufficient to justify all the regular annual loss of life caused by armed population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually. Switzerland requires gun owners to take a course and have the least gun deaths in the world per capita. Honduras has MASSIVE gun control and guess what, most gun deaths in the world per capita. Gun ownership is a great deterrent to other crimes being committed, such as a government attempting to control a populus. If you think they are going to hand their&#39;s over, think again, they just want YOU to hand yours over.

    <div class="md"><p>I partially agree with you.</p>

<p>Swiss model works because everybody goes through mandatory military service and does annual training. And while everybody has a weapon at home as part of their military service, the ammunition is controlled until they complete their military obligations. If US could implement something like that, it might work.</p>

<p>Honduras is not the best example. First, it doesn&#39;t have a MASSIVE gun control. Gun purchase and possession is still allowed in Honduras. Although they are slowly trying to restrict it. Second, nobody is able to implement gun control there now even if they would want to.</p>

<p>You are completely right about the &quot;freedom&quot; fighters. Although they don&#39;t have to be left-wing. Left or right wing armed militias most often led to dictatorship rather than freedom. Castro, Mugabe, Gadaffi, Franco, Mussolini, Pinochet, etc. all started as revolutionaries.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about being NRA members or not. Even if there would be some, I would not use that to paint all NRA members with the same brush. Problem with NRA is that it represents interests of gun manufacturers more than interests of armed population and because of that lobbying it is still far too easy for anybody with malicious intent to obtain guns.</p>

They will simply change the laws around gun ownership, and every citizen will choose to either own a gun illegally and be put in jail and have their life ruined, or give it up. If Australia is any indicator, most people will choose the latter and this big armed revolt against the government you&#39;re all envisioning will never need to happen. They don&#39;t need to occupy - they make the rules and decide who goes to jail and who lives the life of a free man. This great power you think this gun gives you is a total farce.</p>
