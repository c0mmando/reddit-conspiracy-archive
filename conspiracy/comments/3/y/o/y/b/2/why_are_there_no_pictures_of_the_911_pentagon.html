       Why did you repost this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone already pointed out that, while it is most likely plane-wreckage, there is no evidence it was taken at the pentagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know planes crashed before and after 9/11, yes?
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, I'm not certain what I think happened, but something is definitely not kosher with the official narrative of the pentagon attack that day, just like all the other attacks.

       Because inconvenient history is not history at all, it is wiped from the record and hopefully forgotten in time. How many Americans know we had foreknowledge of Pearl Harbor (yes even Pearl Harbor could've been prevented) so why the fuck would they care now? The entire Vietnam war which many potential great Americans were lost in was waged on a farse, research the truth behind the Gulf of Tonkin. History is a fucking lie, that's why. But on a less dramatic note, it's hard to video tape something being done by those who control some of the most sophisticated technology and networks on the planet. Al-Queda has a hell of a computer team huh? America #1

       You mean like John McCain and John Kerry, drug-addicts, criminals, psychos, and dregs of society? Anyone who was bright/sane/nos-psycho enough knew that the Vietnam war was unjust. Going miles away from your country to kill other human beings living poorly but simply who had enough of foreigners deciding what's good for them.

       Anyway I admit that I have been too harsh. When one sees a wrong sometimes the mind shuts down and perceives everything to be classified into black, and white, as enemies to be killed/despised, or not. Just what probably happened to a lot of soldiers up to today , and definitely what happened to me, lumping all American soldiers with the nasties and the responsible officials. What I said was proof enough that humanity, compassion and empathy takes a back seat when emotions and thinking are prepped/triggered by aggression/hate/threat.  Again, I apologise. In  memory of the deceived fallen and the suffering survivors.

       It's easy to blame the foot soldier out there doing the bidding, but at the end of the day, many were tricked, many were bribed, many were promised things they will never receive to go out and further the aims of the MIC and its current masters. War is hell, not all soldiers are good, not all are bad. May they rest in peace.

       Yeah I've heard of it. I also heard you can dodge it and go to jail. Just ask Cassius Clay. The ones who willingly went were psychos/bloodlusters or too naive easily fooled(they could probably be fooled into doing a lot of nasty things too)  into fighting for a non-defensive war. The ones who were "forced" saw abetting/participating industrial-scale murder as a preferable hell than jail.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of things better to do for the country than fighting for an unjust war, even selfish/self-preservation reasons are waaay better. So yeah. Good riddance, I suppose. Salute to the National Guard and Militias, underpaid, underfunded and lacking recognition and praises but way more honorable than the idiots to be/deployed out of the homeland

       Or just weren't connected and rich enough to dodge the draft legally, or educated enough to conscientiously object. You act so high and mighty, but were this 40-50 years prior, we'd either be serving or getting drafted too if we weren't in college or rich.

       It's easy to act tough with years of facts and history at your finger tips, many of these men were still boys. Ever heard of peer pressure? Ever heard of coercion? Are you in any branch of the military by chance?

       The plane was a Boeing 757-200. It is big, over half a football field long, about 125' wingtip to wingtip, and the tail is 44' tall. It has over 200 passenger seats, two titanium engines, a massive landing gear, and literally miles of wiring.  Here are the specs.

       Take a look at the Pentagon, after the floors collapsed.  Zoom in.

       Look carefully. There are no wings, no engines, no landing gear, no tail, no seats, no wiring, no luggage, no bodies. There is no plane there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go to google images and look for yourself. If you search long enough, you will find a couple of scraps of aluminum. You may also find a few other pics of plane parts that were purportedly found at the Pentagon...but the Pentagon is absent from those pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, there should be thousands of pictures and videos showing the plane. There are none.

       Does anyone have a link to the picture of suited Pentagon staff handling wreckage? I swear I saw one years ago but its gone now, maybe I am having a Mandela moment.

       I think some people get tripped up in the wreckage photos and forget to think of other options. Who's to say if it was even a boeing 757. I believe a plane did impact the building, but theres a chance that it was something different than a 757. Look into the light poles knocked over as the plane decended and made it's approach. In order to knock those down you would have needed wings. One key thing to note is that the pilot voice recorded and flight data boxes that were found never had their serial numbers released. Without those serial numbers we can't tell what plane did hit it, but it backs up the plane impact story. Don't bother looking for the serials either, pretty sure people have filed and had their freedom of information act requests denied.

       Those are a few pictures of what may or may not be plane parts, but the Pentagon is absent from the pictures.  There is one picture of a piece of aluminum taken with a deep focal lens.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a piece of aluminum is not a Boeing 757-200.  A 757 is over half a football field long, and 125' across, and stands 45' tall.  Yet there are no pictures or videos of wings, engines, landing gear, tail section, over 200 seats, miles of wiring, luggage, or bodies at the Pentagon.  There should be hundreds, maybe thousands of pictures or videos.  All we have is that strip of aluminum.

       So you expect a photo of an intact plane? You do realize it crashed right? Planes tend not to be in one piece after they crash.

      <p>
       Also one of those photos was of an engine and another is of landing gear.

       You're right. That's why there's a photo of the engine in the pentagon.

       post it then, I dont believe you because it doesn't exist... there is a picture of a tiny piece of a rotor I believe you are thinking of, but it is certainly not a giant jet engine.... and what wreckage? lol there is none... not consistent with a giant jet anyways. And I dont know how it got there.... If we are to believe it was actually a missile, it could certainly be from that. I mean, have you ever seen a real missile up close? They are fucking massive, easily the size of at least a small plane.

       What kind of missile are you referring to? For reference a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpoon_missile">
        Harpoon missile
       </a>
       is 12.6 feet long while a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_152">
        Cessna 152
       </a>
       is 24 feet 1 inch long. So the missile is only half as long as this specific small plane. If you're talking about the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-7_Semyorka">
        R-7 Semyorka

       the rope could not be unattached, so they had to ignore it until it got found ten years later, then it got MSM ignored again as rope does not tie in with airliner.

       Sorry to cite Popular Mechanics, but they truly had the final word on the Pentagon hoax. There was plenty of plane wreckage and the hole fits enough. Was it investigated enough? Nothing on 9/11 was but Pentagon speculation is a waste of time.

       Those are a few pictures of what may or may not be plane parts, but the Pentagon is absent from the pictures.  There is one picture of a piece of aluminum taken with a deep focal lens.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a piece of aluminum is not a Boeing 757-200.  A 757 is over half a football field long, and 125' across, and stands 45' tall.  Yet there are no pictures or videos of wings, engines, landing gear, tail section, over 200 seats, miles of wiring, luggage, or bodies at the Pentagon.  There should be hundreds, maybe thousands of pictures or videos.  All we have is that strip of aluminum.

       THIS is what a proper plane wreck looks like... Those engines are so massive, they don't just disintegrate....
