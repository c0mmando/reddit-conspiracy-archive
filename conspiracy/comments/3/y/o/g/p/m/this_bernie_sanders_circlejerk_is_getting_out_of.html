<p>That is all hilarious and whatever the mainstream media told you to think is right but all of this has no place in a subreddit that is supposed to be critical of everything. Bernie videos getting 500 upvotes in 30 minutes is one thing but Bernie comments on vaguely relevant posts is another (and actually getting upvotes). Almost makes me think this subreddit is really filled with Bernie shills instead of propaganda bots. There are enough subreddits where this kind of behavior is encouraged and applaud upon but this one should be the last of them to do that. This subreddit is supposed to question everything, not spam Bernie propaganda and downvote anything that is critical of Sanders. I am considering unsubscribing because <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is the opposite of what it used and ought to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the thing you have to realize is that reddit collectively leans so far left it&#39;s laying on its side. Pick the most radically left-wing candidate you can find and odds are good reddit&#39;s going to vote for them, especially if they tick off reddit&#39;s boxes. Bernie and Obama, for instance:</p>

<p>[X] Not christian. Bernie&#39;s a jew.</p>

<p>[X] Not caucasian. Obama had a winning complexion.</p>

<p>[X] Not male. There&#39;s a reason reddit is split down the middle between Bernie and Shillary.</p>

<p>[X] Makes (empty) promises of &quot;hope,&quot; &quot;change,&quot; or &quot;social justice.&quot; All of the above.</p>

<p>Reddit is very easily lead by the media on these things and seems to fall for the stupidest of campaign tactics, as though they couldn&#39;t believe a politician would <em>lie</em> to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He complains about money in politics, yet he lines up to accept money from both corrupt unions and anti-labor corporations, and he does favors for sugar industry lobbyists and defense contractors.</p>

<p>He claims to be a real civil rights leader and a fighter for the poor and downtrodden, but then he&#39;ll turn around and try to use poor ethnic communities as dumping grounds for his state&#39;s nuclear waste.</p>

<p><a href="http://social-ecology.org/wp/1998/10/the-texas-vermont-maine-nuclear-dump-bringing-environmental-racism-home/">Source</a></p>

<p>He&#39;s a huge warmonger. He tries to disguise this by playing dumb about foreign policy and deflecting to climate change and his irrelevant economic stump speech whenever he&#39;s asked about it, as he knows the truth would alienate his &quot;progressive&quot; base, but his history is one of consistent cow-towing to the war lobby:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alternet.org/election-2016/bernie-sanders-troubling-history-supporting-us-military-violence-abroad">Source</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.libertyunionparty.org/?page_id=363">Source</a> </p>

<p>He promises all the &quot;glorious&quot; free handout programs of Europe, yet neglects to mention the extremely regressive taxes, the key differences in culture and population size, and the fact that none of those countries actually fund their militaries because they rely on us to fight for them (freeing up money to go towards their welfare states instead). He also leaves out the part where nationalist parties and conservative welfare reform parties are becoming more and more popular in Europe because they&#39;re finally realizing that socialism doesn&#39;t work in the long run. Even scarier than his deranged views are the Modern Monetary Theory kooks he surrounds himself with.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/7ORjJ">Source</a></p>

<p>He&#39;s an SJW. He&#39;s released a &quot;racial justice&quot; plan, but he won&#39;t release a tax plan. He&#39;s still pushing the phony and discredited wage gap myth.</p>

<p><a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/racial-justice/">Source</a></p>

<p>He has deranged ideas in general. For example: He wants to bring back illegals who were deported.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what I notice about scientists? There seem to be two types; the real variety and the pseudointellectual variety. The real variety will take any question or opinion seriously and discuss it with a kind of passion and love of discovery. Even if, for example, the topic is &quot;how might homeopathy work?&quot; You know, the kind of thing that the pseudointellectual variety might deride vehemently. You, for example, have written off my assertion that fluoride might have an effect on atherosclerotic plaques without (clearly) looking it up, because you would discover that this has been investigated and the results published (check pubmed). Also, before you write me off, not only do I have a 4-year degree in organic chem, and worked in chem labs for years, I have also ghost written about 2,500 published medical research articles. I was the one reviewing and telling authors to improve the rigor of their message. I very, very clearly understand the science, the scientific method and many aspects of its communication. I can smell scientific bullshit a mile away and within the body of pro-fluoride research, which is extremely limited to begin with, lurks a great deal of ambiguity and linguistic sleight of hand. On my review of the available research, there really is almost no question that fluoride is quite bad for you. The question is really if it&#39;s just a bit bad or extremely bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was only nine years old  </p>

<p>I loved Senator Bernie Sanders (D) so much, I owned all the campaign posters and surfed <a href="/r/sandersforpresident">/r/sandersforpresident</a> daily  </p>

<p>I pray to Bernie every night, thanking him for the dank bud I have been given  </p>

<p>&quot;Bernie is love&quot;, I say, &quot;Bernie is life&quot;  </p>

<p>My dad hears me and calls me a commie  </p>

<p>He is obviously jealous of my devotion to Bernard  </p>

<p>I called him a cunt-servitive  </p>

<p>He slaps me and sends me to my room  </p>

<p>I am crying now, because Donald Trump is on the television  </p>

<p>I go into my bed and it is very cold  </p>

<p>I feel a warmth moving towards me  </p>

<p>I feel something touch me  </p>

<p>It&#39;s Bernie Sanders!  </p>

<p>I am so happy  </p>

<p>He whispers into my ear, &quot;This is my Country&quot;  </p>

<p>He grabs me with his powerful Jew hands and puts me on my hands and knees  </p>

<p>I&#39;m ready  </p>

<p>I spread my ass cheeks for Mr. Sanders  </p>

<p>He penetrates my butthole  </p>

<p>It hurts so much, but I do it for Bernie.  </p>

<p>I can feel my anus tearing as my eyes start to water  </p>

<p>I push against his force.  </p>

<p>I truly feel the Bern now.  </p>

<p>I want to please the Senator  </p>

<p>He roars a mighty roar as he fills my butt with his Eco friendly seed.  </p>

<p>My dad walks in  </p>

<p>Bernie looks him deep in the eyes and says, &quot;In my view, a corporation is not a person. A corporation does not have First Amendment rights to spend as much money as it wants, without disclosure, on a political campaign. Corporations should not be able to go into their treasuries and spend millions and millions of dollars on a campaign in order to buy elections.&quot;  </p>

<p>Bernie leaves through my window  </p>

<p>Bernie is love, Bernie is life</p>
