       agenda of our lovely 3-letter agencies. They are investing huge amounts of time and energy pushing gun control. That gets frightening when you start asking "why?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Why isn't this talked about every day on here? Because part of that effort includes setting agents to task with multiple accounts behind proxies to derail discussion about it on forums like this. So who are the mods here? Have any of them revealed their real life identities or given any info about themselves that gives them cred that they're not agents?

       Let's see who the shills are.

       It's of my opinion that the senseless high school style massacres that have taken place over the last 10 to 15 years are not staged at all. I do like to frequent this subreddit out of a general interest in conspiracy theories and I like to challenge subscribers sometimes on the aforementioned topic as well as others.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many others are like me in this, and does that make me a shill? Is it okay to hang around here even if I may have a completely different world view?

       I'm not of the "nothing conspiracy camp", at least I don't think I am. Yes, I guess generally I do not subscribe to some of the more "mainstream" conspiracy theories, for want of a better word. However, I'm certainly on the fence with a lot of them, I'm comfortable on the fence. I think the fence is often an intelligent place to be, and questioning popular conspiracy theories, like all global events, is a rationale and smart thing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am aware of MK Ultra, the Bay of Pigs incident, Wikileaks, Snowden, The Iran Contra Affair and Operation Northwoods, among other conspiratorial and relevant stories. I do subscribe to these narratives, and a lot more. I'm aware of the lies surrounding the 2003 Iraq War and the somewhat intentional plan to destabilize that region in order for a group like ISIS to grow.
      </p>
      <p>
       I consider myself a conspiracy theorist, perhaps just not your type of conspiracy theorist. But who is to say that there is only one right or true conspiracy theorist? To my mind there are many conspiracy theorists with different world views and the situation we find ourselves in is not simply, conspiracy vs the mainstream.

       This sub needs more people like you. I like to lurk and read everything I can. There's no right way to be a conspiracy theorist. It's like politics in here. The left are tin foils and the right are shills. Just stay in the middle and find the reason and logic behind conspiracies and you'll find the truth. Just my opinion at least.

       That's it really. And I think that the same can be said for other forums and groups, even in the mainstream, take r/worldnews for example, you may not find to many people who are willing to entertain the demolition theory surrounding 9/11 or staged high school massacres, but that doesn't mean that the place is made up of mindless jew loving sheeple who blindly buy into everything the MSM says.

       Sure, if something has been proven beyond all reasonable doubt, naturally, I'll be more comfortable coming off the fence, as anyone would, right? But if there is a reasonable doubt, then one ought to remain on the fence and continually question it. There is no need to jump straight down the rabbit hole and never return to a more objective place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, back to the point, which is that none of what I have said ought to equate to me being some sort of a paid agent of the state, and if I, or others like me, want to hang around here and challenge others (as well as agree when the opportunity arises), that should be welcomed, no? No one wants to subscribe to an echo chamber, those places are intellectually unhealthy.

       I see that, day in and day out here, of course there are events which one could present as being linked together to further a particular agenda. But I still want to see the explicit evidence that any two given events are in fact connected. Thus I wouldn't buy into it 100 percent without said evidence, and I also won't completely strike it off as a coincidence, if you see what I mean.

       I don't actively discourage people from using intuition, I welcome people to contemplate any conspiracy they want, and explicitly give opinions if they must. But I'm still going to promote reason and rationality at every opportunity.

       On the contrary, I'd argue it's more in lieu of all other sources of information, starting with actual libraries.

      <p>
       At the end of the day, the Oxford dictionary defines intuition as "the ability to understand something instinctively, without the need for conscious reasoning".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, there will be areas in life where that sort of thinking is true. I'm just not totally sure that when dealing social and political events, it's the only way to approach complicated events. There is always a need for conscious reasoning when discussing the kinds of topics we do in this forum.

       I changed my tune before I came here, I use to wholeheartedly believe in most popular conspiracy theories. 
There are plenty of stories I agree with here, and not just stuff that’s agreed with in the mainstream, such as WikiLeaks and Snowden. 
I don't think I toe any party line. I don't really support the government’s position on 9/11, nor 9/11 Truth. Hell, I don’t really support anything the government does.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is, there isn't a test to determine whether or not someone is a conspiracy theorist, believing in the 9/11 inside job theory, or staged high school massacres, should not be the litmus test to be welcomed here. Nor should it be the factor that determines whether or not someone is a paid agent of the state.

       In order to really prove identity mods would need to provide personal details.  I think it is unfair to ask for that.  No matter who they are or what their motivations are, as individuals they would not be interested in doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is more feasible to be aware of manipulative techniques and point them out when they are being used.

       Are there entire topics which are disallowed here?  I haven't seen that.  There was a thread recently asking for updates to the Hampstead child abuse case in the UK.  Commenters on that thread stated that reddit admins had previously shut down discussion on that topic because of personal details of minors.  I have looked into that one a bit and I'm not sure what to make of it.  There is a possibility that it is a hoax to discredit other claims of organized pedophilia.  If the children involved are speaking truth though, it has some rather large implications.

       I think they were.  The "recant" video of Gabriel was among the most egregious examples of police coercion I've ever seen on video done in the guise of an "interrogation".  It was so fucking obvious that the cop was feeding the child the answers he wanted and not accepting the answers he didn't want.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you try finding this video on the internet today?  Good luck.  It's been scrubbed completely from every site it used to be on, I had about five bookmarks of it which are all dead links today.  It's like they needed that video of Gabriel "recanting" in order to make the story go away, and then once that happened they sent the video down the memoryhole so that people like myself can't show it to people like yourself in order to prove how much bullshit it was.  I hope you're able to find it somewhere or that you've seen it already because if you have/do, I don't think you'd have much doubt at all about the kids telling the truth.  I certainly don't having watched every video I could find.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, as a mod of this sub, I can say that there are only a very few times I can remember where so much weird activity happened here and with the admins.  The SLC daycare was one of them.  I was getting death threats via PM, the sub had thousands of active viewers where it usually only has ~500 or so, the admins seemed to be in full-on panic mode and basically implied that there would be serious repercussions if we continued to allow the topic to be discussed (I assume shadowbanning us or banning the sub entirely), one day old accounts spamming the threads saying it was all nonsense and that we should stop attacking the people at the daycare, just lots of strange stuff.

       These are extraordinary times, and we're watching the endgame play out right before our eyes. I don't think it's very much to ask the mod team to "take off the mask" considering the severity of the situation.

       Well, it would prove they aren't government agents - so I think it is fair. Its not like the government doesn't know who they are anyway.

       I'm not a mod here, so its not really relevant. That said, I can prove I'm not a government shill. I'm a web developer who specializes in the Drupal CMS, and can discuss it at length in real time - something a mod who works for the government couldn't do.

       No, calling for doxxing will literally get you IP banned from reddit on the spot.  It was simply a warning.  You can continue doing so if you want, just don't be surprised when the admins ban you.

       It's pretty easy to tell who the mods are. Who else would have the hours of free time and the interest to log onto an entertainment website and exert meaningless power in a community focused on government conspiracies
       <em>
        rather than
       </em>
       lowlifes who haven't developed any tolerable facets of personality, who nobody will listen to in real life because they have nothing worthwhile to say, whose only hope of feeling successful and important and accepted is to pander to the other sheltered lowlifes in the world who think the world is as simple as "THEY control everything but WE have THEM figured out!"?

      <p>
       What,

      <p>
       And by shill, you mean a paid agent of the state, correct?

      <p>
       Or do you merely mean someone who unknowingly carries out shill work simply by not agreeing with some of the more popular conspiracy theories around here?

       Well you sound pretty convinced, so I'm eager to learn what has convinced you. I assume that it's because I disagree with some of the more notable conspiracy theories here? Is that it? Or can you provide me with some more information as to why you have concluded that I am a shill.

       At the end of the day, if you are presenting a fact, you ought to have some evidence to support this.

       Guess you have to swallow every ludicrous "false flag" theory under the sun, in order to avoid being a "shill", even though the actual "evidence" for most of the events touted here is nonsensical garbage, if not flat out lies.

       You can use the word "shill" all you want, doesn't make it true. Maybe YOU'RE the shill trying to steer attention away from yourself. FOUND THE SHILL GUYS, WE CAN GO HOME.

       You are wasting your time with collecting accounts. Most  tool bags have many accounts &amp; probably argue amongst themselves to sway opinions . CPU vs smartphone dialogues I'm guessing .

       I think I know why most people on this sub are shills. Most people figure out this is bullshit here and move on.

       Okay. I'll reword the question then.
      </p>
      <p>
       What,
       <strong>
        specifically
       </strong>
       , leads you to conclude that I'm a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       And by shill, you mean a paid agent of the state, correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or do you merely mean someone who unknowingly carries out shill work simply by not agreeing with some of the more popular conspiracy theories around here?
