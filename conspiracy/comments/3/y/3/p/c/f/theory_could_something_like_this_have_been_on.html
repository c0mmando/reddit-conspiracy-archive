<p>think of it this way: if you wanted to stage a big media event like 9/11, how would you do it? if you were making a 9/11 movie, would you remotely-fly planes into buildings? or would you do as much cgi as possible?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>would you remotely-fly planes into buildings?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fuck yes. Much cheaper, much easier, and practically zero chance of discovery.</p>

<p>The 767 and late model 757&#39;s came fitted with an avionics suite called &quot;Future Air Navigation System&quot; or FANS. This suite connects digital datalink communications with GPS navigation and a Flight Management Computer System capable of flying the aircraft from take off to landing.</p>

<p>Pilots do the actual take off and landing for safety reasons, but the autopilot can fly the aircraft to a specific point in space within 10 metres of the bullseye.</p>

<p>The digital data link gives the airline, air traffic control, and anyone else that has the correct codes and frequencies the ability to directly upload changes to the flight plan into the FMCS. This means that as long as the autopilot is engaged, the plane can be flown remotely by simply uploading new waypoints for the autopilot to follow.</p>

<p>To turn a 767 into a guided missile, all you need to do is prevent the pilots from turning off the autopilot. This would take nothing more than some modified lines of code in the FMCS - impossible to detect after the aircraft has been disintegrated and burned.</p>

<p>CGI on the other hand would require ensuring that none of the physical eyewitnesses were able to tell the world what they saw. It would involve faking dozens of videos and silencing hundreds or even thousands of eyewtinesses. And CGI can not damage a building.</p>

<p>A real 767, digitally hijacked and flown by remote control, will give them the spectacle they want and be practically undetectable.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>except an aluminum &amp; plastic 767 could not penetrate multiple layers of 2.5&quot; thick steel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it could. Anything with mass moving fast enough acts just like a bullet. When it impacts something, a huge amount of kinetic energy is almost instantly turned into heat and shock waves capable of shattering even the hardest steel.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why the US Navy uses aluminium slugs in its railgun. At Mach 7 it will cut through thick armour plates like a hot knife through butter.</p>

<p>80,000 kilograms of aluminium and plastic moving at 500 miles per hour has much more energy than a bullet, and when it impacts something, half of that energy is transferred into the object it hits. That&#39;s how the perimeter columns of the WTC were cut so easily.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;d splat against the side and fall down</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it wouldn&#39;t. For a start, you seem to think the walls were solid steel plate. They were not. They were steel columns surrounding glass windows. Much of the aircraft would have passed through glass, not steel. For that reason alone, most of the aircraft would have disappeared into the building.</p>

<p>But the steel columns themselves also could not withstand the impact energy so they failed too.. essentially shattering at the point of impact like glass does.</p>

<p>Force equals mass times acceleration. That&#39;s Newton&#39;s Second Law of Motion. It means if you have less mass, but more acceleration, you can have the same impact force as more mass with less acceleration.</p>

<p>The &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_empty_weight">Operating Empty Weight</a>&quot; of a 767 is at least 80,000 kilograms. If an impact slowed a 767 from 500 miles per hour (223.52 metres per second) to 0 mph in one second, its acceleration would be 223.52 metres per second per second.</p>

<p>Plugging those numbers into Newton&#39;s equation, we get 17,881,600 Newtons of force.</p>

<p>A typical .50 BMG bullet weighs 52 grams (0.052 kilograms) and has a muzzle velocity of 882 metres per second. If we assume the bullet stopped in 1/10th of a second, we get an acceleration of 8,820 metres per second per second.</p>

<p>Plugging those numbers into Newton&#39;s equation we get 458.64 Newtons of force.</p>

<p>The 767 would hit with more than <em>38,980 times</em> the force of a .50 caliber bullet at point blank range.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how it can cut through steel like a hot knife through butter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so to achieve the desired effect, youd have to specially construct an &#39;anti-armor&#39; version of a 767 - similar to an anti-ship missile.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have just proved that all you need to do is ensure it is loaded with passengers, cargo, and fuel, and then fly it into the side of a building at 500 miles per hour (the cruising speed of a 767 is 530 mph, so 500 mph is very conservative, the 9/11 767&#39;s could have been doing over 600 mph at impact).</p>

<p>The people that flew those airliners into buildings were not on board the aircraft. They were not suicide bombers. They simply turned 767&#39;s into precision guided cruise missiles that carry many of their own victims with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. But they could still have had hijackers on the aircraft. They could have been told they were taking hostages, not committing suicide. But then the hijackers got hijacked.</p>

<p>In 2006, Boeing patented a new system it calls an &quot;Uninterruptible Autopilot&quot;. The idea is that if hijackers seize an aircraft, the government can seize it back and fly it anywhere they want. </p>

<p>The technology wasn&#39;t new... they were just the first to patent it as a complete system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Boeing Uninterruptible Autopilot is a system designed to take control of a commercial aircraft away from the pilot or flight crew in the event of a hijacking.[1] If implemented, the system would allow the craft to automatically guide itself to a landing at a designated airstrip.[2] The “uninterruptible” autopilot would be activated either by pilots, by onboard sensors, or remotely via radio or satellite links by government agencies, if terrorists attempt to gain control of a flight deck.</p>

<p>Because once the hijackers are on board the aircraft, you can&#39;t be sure they will not change their mind. You can&#39;t be sure they will not be overpowered. There is far too much at stake to leave it in the hands of unstable individuals.</p>

<p>Why <em>not</em> remove the risk simply by flying the aircraft yourself while sitting safely on the ground?</p>

<p>Remember all those phone calls from the aircraft? That&#39;s why they would put hijackers on the aircraft - so the passengers can tell the world that terrorists seized the aircraft. The terrorists get blamed, and the government gets what it wants: &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century#Rebuilding_America.27s_Defenses_2">a new Pearl Harbor</a>&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spectacle and Explanation.</p>

<p>The horror felt by people watching hundreds of passengers trapped on aircraft being flown to their deaths without any way of saving themselves. Even if the buildings had not come down, that would have been shocking to the core. The only reason it is not mentioned is the spectacle of the buildings collapsing was even more shocking.</p>

<p>But the reason the terrorists were there was to create the explanation; to point the finger of blame. It was a &quot;false flag attack&quot; designed to create a justification for war.</p>

<p>You need terrorists on the plane to blame terrorists, and you need passengers on the plane to tell the world that terrorists were on the plane.</p>

<p>It&#39;s perfectly logical. Evil, but logical.</p>

<p>And apart from anything else, there is practically no way of being discovered. The physical evidence would be destroyed in the crash and fireball.</p>

<p>If they used unmanned drones, it would be possible for somone to prove there were no hijackers on board, or that the claimed passengers didn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>They were intending to kill hundreds or thousands of people anyway, so why take the risk by faking the crashes when doing it for real was so easy?</p>

<p>More than your theory has. I can link you to the Boeing page that explains exactly how FANS works. It even tells you it is fitted to the 767.</p>

<p>Here is a link to the article:</p>

<p>Where is your documented evidence?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Nope. It assumes that the &quot;masterminds&quot; of the CIA front called Al Qaeda, that never went anywhere near those aircraft, simply lied to some patsies to get them on the aircraft. Those goons had no idea they were working for the CIA. They thought Bin Laden was genuine and not a CIA asset.</p>

<p>No one on those aircraft had any idea they were about to be crashed into the WTC. They didn&#39;t <em>need</em> to know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Were the dead pilots in on it as well? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope, they were taken out by the hijackers, remember? The hijackers had only a basic understanding of how to fly a 767. They probably didn&#39;t even know how to turn the autopilot off.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They might have noticed a bunch of &quot;turn this plane into a drone mid-flight&quot; equipment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For fucks sake... have you read a word I said? Why would they notice the equipment that <strong>came with the 767 as part of its standard avionics suite</strong>? Are you really that dense?</p>

<p>They did not need to change a single thing on the aircraft. They just had to make sure that the pilots did not turn off the autopilot when they uploaded a new flight plan. The terrorists disabled the pilots, remember? That may be the main reason they were there. To make sure the pilots couldn&#39;t interfere.</p>

<p>But even if the terrorists were not intending to die, and even if they knew exactly how to turn off the autopilot. The only change that would need to be made would be to add a few lines of code to the flight management computer so that once the autopilot was engaged, it could not be turned off... just like the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Honeywell_Uninterruptible_Autopilot">Uninterruptible Autopilot</a>&quot; Boeing patented in 2006.</p>

<p>The pilots would have no idea the FMCS had been sabotaged until it was too late to do anything about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The crew on the ground?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same thing. Short of a full decompile of the machine code stored in the FMCS, no one would be able to tell it had been modified. It&#39;s just like you have no idea how a virus hidden in your computer is behaving. Without special tools specifically looking for it, your computer can be hijacked and you have no clue. It&#39;s the same damn thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What happened to United 93?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The conspirators knew the passengers were attempting to seize the cockpit back from the terrorists. If they succeeded, it would become obvious the terrorists were not actually in command of the aircraft. So a new command was sent that told it to dive vertically into the ground. Problem solved.</p>

<p>You know how they say the aircraft that hit the Pentagon pulled a high G turn as good a trained fighter pilot would? They suggest the aircraft had been flown with incredible precision... kind of like a GPS guided computerised autopilot might, given the correct commands...</p>

<p>Remember, Boeing is a massive defense contractor selling hundreds of billions of dollars of weapons and equipment to the US government. They would be one of the largest beneficiaries of a war. They had every reason to help make it happen.</p>

<p>FANS is a communications system, it can&#39;t remotely fly a plane.

<p>You are literally saying that the US used remote controlled planes that they also decided to hijack.</p>

<p>No, The &#39;N&#39; stands for &quot;Navigation&quot;. Did you even read the link I posted <strong>as evidence</strong> that you claim I don&#39;t have?</p>

<p>Clearly not. And you claim to be &quot;skeptical&quot;? Let me quote the document as you are clearly too lazy to read it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 More Efficient Route Changes
Oceanic operations currently are based on weather data that are 12 to 18 hr old. By using the satellite data link that is part of FANS, however, the latest weather data can be transmitted to an airplane while it is en route. Flight crews can then use these data to develop optimized flight plans, or <strong>those plans can be generated on the ground and transmitted to the airplane</strong>. Such <strong>dynamic re-routing</strong> may allow airlines to consider reducing discretionary fuel, which further reduces fuel burn or allows an increase in payload.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AIRLINE OPERATIONAL CONTROL DATA LINK.
The AOC link gives airline data systems <strong>the ability to transmit new routes</strong>, position reports, and updated winds through the data link network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (ATC) DATA LINK.
This function replaces the tactical communication between the flight crew and air traffic controller, allowing the flight crew to request deviations to, or replacements of, the filed flight plan. <strong>The air traffic controller also has the ability to directly request tactical changes to the airplane flight plan.</strong></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, you keep insisting that, without explaining at all why you think that.</p>

<p>The hijacking wasn&#39;t redundant. How many times do I have to say it. Having hijackers on those planes was the whole point of doing all this. They wanted to blame Al Qaeda for the attack, so they had to put Al Qaeda hijackers on the aircraft. Simple. They couldn&#39;t trust the utterly incompetent fools to be able to actually hit any of their targets, so they had to make sure <em>they</em> weren&#39;t flying the aircraft. They had to be there, but they could not be trusted.</p>

<p>How fucking hard is that to understand?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not making a claim.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, you are. You&#39;re claiming unmanned drones did it... but they looked exactly like 767&#39;s and they had to kill off a bunch of real people to say they were on them. That&#39;s the point I am making.</p>

<p>The only thing that explains the eyewitness and video evidence is that real 767&#39;s hit the WTC. The only thing that explains the absence of the people said to be on those aircraft is that they <em>were</em> actually on those aircraft.</p>

<p>I have shown you a perfectly reasonable way that could happen, but you simply refuse to accept that what I am saying is possible because <em>you</em> think it is illogical, without any explanation as to why.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not a single piece of evidence for any of this.</p>

<p>More than for any other theory, including holograms, drones, CGI... and even that Al Qaeda terrorists planned and executed this attack without the knowledge and assistance of sections of the US government.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Oh for fuck&#39;s sake, no, FANS doesn&#39;t fly the plane itself, the Flight Management Computer System flies the flight plan via the autopilot. FANS allows the flight plan to be changed by ATC or the airline, or anyone else with the correct codes and frequencies.</p>

<p>FANS is the system that allows the waypoints the autopilot follows to be changed by someone that is not on board the aircraft. Is that clear enough for you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s just that you provide no evidence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is pure bullshit, and you know it. No, I have not provided evidence that someone actually modified the flight plans of the aircraft involved, but I <em>have</em> provided evidence that it is possible. I assume that you&#39;ve heard the other evidence from pilots that said barely trained idiots would not have been able to execute the maneuvers seen with the precision of a certified pilot, and explained that the idiots that hijacked the aircraft did not need to be able to fly a 767 with such precision because the autopilot could do it, given the right commands via FANS.</p>

<p>Simply put, the hijackers were not flying the aircraft, the FMCS was. The hijackers did not need to know how to get an airliner to hit a precise target three times in a row without a single miss, because the autopilot on the 767 and late model 757 was able to fly the aircraft from take off to landing. The FANS system (coupled with the FMCS) meant that the aircraft could fly itself to any location (within range) with the sort of precision a cruise missile has. All &quot;they&quot; needed to do was set waypoints for the FMCS to follow that would fly the aircraft into the side of a building, and that could be done without anyone on board doing a thing. I never mentioned that not only can the 767 FMCS land the aircraft, it can actually taxi it from the runway to the terminal. The 767 with FANS is capable of becoming a remotely operated drone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would a plan this nefarious add so many unnecessary redundant moving parts and extra opportunities for leakage and failure?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seriously? That&#39;s a fucking stupid question. Compared to any other theory, this one requires the <em>least</em> amount of  &quot;moving parts&quot;. Nothing that happens on the aircraft can change the outcome. The hijackers don&#39;t need to be able to fly. The pilots and passengers <em>can&#39;t</em> interfere. A small change in software, and after the pilots activate the built in autopilot, the plan is as good as accomplished. There is no fear the public will find out that no one died on the aircraft, or that there were no hijackers, because both actually happened. There is no fear that poorly trained pilots will miss their targets, because they aren&#39;t flying the aircraft. The variables are minimized as far as is possible.</p>

<p>No need to create fake drones. No need to fake video footage or flight manifests. The aircraft involved would be normal civil airliners flying their normal route, until the the plan went into action, and the only evidence that something unusual happened would be destroyed when the aircraft crashed.</p>

<p>No one at the airline, ATC, or even on the aircraft, had to know what was going on. It would all happen without <em>any</em> of them knowing. Nothing could be <em>less</em> complicated, other than if the hijackers themselves suddenly figured out how to fly a complicated aircraft with incredible precision, despite all their teachers saying they couldn&#39;t if they tried.</p>
