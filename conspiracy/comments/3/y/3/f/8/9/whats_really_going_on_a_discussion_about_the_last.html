        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>These are some pretty big questions, and I&#39;d like to know your opinions.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been awake and learning since 2004, and I still don&#39;t really &quot;know&quot; anything; I have some strong suspicions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just smart enough to realize just how much I don&#39;t know, how much I&#39;ll never know, how much I COULD never know, and how much NOBODY EVER COULD know, that I&#39;ve given up on the concept of &quot;knowing.&quot;</p>

<p>There are certain somethings called &quot;facts&quot; but don&#39;t know what they are.</p>

<p>How hot does water need to be to boil? 212 degrees fahrenheit? Yet there are so many exceptions, can you still call it a rule? Is it a fact?</p>

<p>How fast breaks the speed of sound?</p>

<p>I&#39;m just thinking nonsense here, but I can&#39;t seem to figure out what&#39;s REALLY going on even in the present day, much less piece together what&#39;s true about history.</p>

<p>At the base of all this is a question that man has probably asked himself since he became bright enough to question it: who are we, as the human race, and where did we come from? </p>

<p>And there are other questions: Do we have a purpose, and if so, what is it? Is there something we should or shouldn&#39;t be doing, and if so, what? And a lot of the answers are self-evident, and some are probably one way or another, but that one question, or that double question I should say, &quot;who are we, and where did we come from?&quot; is something I always come back to.</p>

<p>And I think it&#39;s man&#39;s nature to hope there&#39;s a God or a Great Spirit or something out there, maybe because it&#39;s so frightening to consider that maybe we&#39;re all alone in a bubble in a dark endless sea and there&#39;s nothing that anybody can do about anything.</p>

<p>I think the question for me becomes, is there really some higher power, some higher cause? If there were for sure, I&#39;d want to worship it and please it, if it were such a thing to care what I do. If not for sure, I wouldn&#39;t want to waste my life as a priest or a nun, or even to follow strict religious laws. The uncertain reality makes me very frustrated.</p>

<p>I understand I&#39;ll never know these answers if brighter folks than me can&#39;t figure it out, and couldn&#39;t throughout time (excepting Buddha, Jesus, Allah, and whoever else) but I still can&#39;t stop myself from asking.</p>

<p>And I think to try and get as close to an answer as I can, I have to first understand what&#39;s REALLY going on, now, in the near past, in the further past, and back, and back, further and further, as far as I can.</p>

<p>I want to know who invented the spoon and the candle, who invented bows and arrows and how cultures spread so far apart all seem to figure such a complex weapon system out and use it the same way. Same question could be applied to pyramids.</p>

<p>I want to ask all the right questions and receive all the right answers.</p>

<p>But I&#39;ll take whatever you got.</p>

<p>TL;DR: The title of the thread is the best I can do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding boiling of water: yes there are rules and exceptions.  Water books at 212f at sea lelel or 1 atmosphere.  It boils at a lower temp in a vacuum.  Regarding facts and numbers, Rupert Sheldrake pointed out the fact in his banned ted talk that the speed of light had changed many times depending on when measurements were taken and who you asked.  With this he postulated that the speed of light may be changing, so the idea of cosmological constants he concluded revealed a deep problem with science, which is the assumption that constants are in fact constant.  He hypothesized that 20m year ago the speed of light may have been very different from today.  Just because we can experimentally get the same answer within a limited spectrum of time, doesn&#39;t mean we can extrapolate the assumption of same results <em>irrespective of time</em>.</p>

<p>Because he dared to ask this question of the science community, he was banned.  This is the disgusting politics and sociology of science that undermines legitimate pursuit of knowkedge, IMO.  It makes me sad.  Sheldrake is an evolutionary biologist that seeks the boundaries of human knowledge and for that he is punished by intellectually spineless status quotarians.</p>

<p>Then again, everything&#39;s like that now--politicized into absurdity.</p>

<p>I think if there IS a God, it would WANT us to use our minds as fully as we possibly could, and if there ISN&#39;T a God, then using our minds to their fullest potential is our only hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a God, God is the combination of forces and matter that allow us to exist.</p>

<p>There is a purpose and that is what we do with each moment we have. This is our eternity, it is happening, and your actions resonate through all that is around you and through time. </p>

<p>And the rules are pretty simple, don&#39;t harm others because harming others only harms yourself. God made the impossible possible by brining all the forces and matter together in a platform that we may enjoy as the highest form of known existence and we are not capable of rectifying the harm that we do to ourselves when we bring harm to others and should avoid it at all cost.</p>

<p>If you ignore the manipulation of Jesus by the Church, then you have a guy who essentially said, we are all children of God, don&#39;t hurt each other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a theory. A crazy one.</p>

<p>God is a corruption of Good.
Devil is a corruption of Evil.</p>

<p>Doing Good = Doing God(&#39;s Work)</p>

<p>Doing Evil = Doing Devil(&#39;s Work)</p>

<p>Hmm. Just a thought I&#39;ve been kicking around. But wouldn&#39;t God be pleased by folks doing Good? Wouldn&#39;t the Devil be pleased by people doing Evil? It adds up is all I&#39;m saying. Words get corrupted over time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not what I meant. I meant what I wrote.</p>

<p>The church utterly corrupted the teachings of Jesus.</p>

<p>Jesus stated clearly that we are all his brothers and sisters. As such, we are all &quot;sons of man&quot; or children of God.</p>

<p>This is a huge distinction. More of a distinction than that of killing a beggar or a prince, because a son of God is above the son of a king. </p>

<p>We are all children of God and cannot escape the consequences in life or after. You may get away with killing a prince. You may have valid reasons for killing a prince. But there is no getting away or valid reason for killing a child of God.</p>

<p>In the view that all are children of God, it encompasses both the beggar and the prince, but in the view that &quot;we don&#39;t hurt each other&quot; there can be many loopholes. Loopholes aren&#39;t moral and it&#39;s merely a justification to engage in the immoral.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty much where you are on that. I can&#39;t prove or disprove that Jesus was actually as the Bible says he was, but even if, let&#39;s say, a guy called Jesus never even existed, and in reality a group of people made him up to teach people to be good. Even then, the things he said would still be just as important and make just as much sense. I don&#39;t necessarily consider myself a Christian, but I&#39;m something like one. I try to follow the commandments as best I can. But I also appreciate other religions, like Buddhism, and Yoruba, and many others, which I pick and chose from at will.</p>

<p>One thing I don&#39;t believe is that the Bible is the unadulterated word of God. I know that man has adulterated it, even if it once really was the word of God, because there are many different Bibles. That means someone, somewhere, is editing.</p>

<p>I treat it like a history book. It has a very deep... depth... that makes it great reading if you like history and want to know about the past. </p>

<p>And Jesus taught people a lot of good lessons, if he really did exist or not. Harry Potter teaches people things too, and everybody agrees HE never existed. He still means the world to some folks.</p>

<p>Pointless Rambling:</p>

<p>I have a Bible that has every single word that Jesus actually was supposed to have spoken in red ink, and everything else, every single other word, including things about him and his name, were in black ink. It gives the effect that, as you turn pages, you instantly see where Jesus spoke. It&#39;s my most prized possession. My friend gave it to me when I was about 14.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. In utmost sincerity I have taken the Bible for granted. The intent that you speak with to convey that Jesus is in red- holy spirit is in black is humbling. Most people in the protestant world know, no matter red ink is not holy but it sells a lot of deluxe bibles. </p>

<p>I for one cannot read the Bible as if it as history, be it my upbringing or what when I read the new testament I am in awe. The wisdom that is there is all of love and selflessness.  If that&#39;s how we live then how can we be judged negatively by any god?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Almost every common narrative that exists throughout society is a lie. It&#39;s an advertisement for an ideology not necessary for human life or success. As you are lying on your death bed and you close your eyes, if someone says the word McDonalds you will picture the golden arches one last time. You will never live another moment on this earth not knowing what McDonalds is/was. </p>

<p>There are so many false narratives not related to commerce that are created this way as well. Humans are not naturally afraid of the dark, but Pavlov sure had an easy time engineering the fear into us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about McDonald&#39;s is chilling. It reminds me of an episode of Futurama where a character called Fry gets frozen and wakes up in the year 3000.</p>

<p>He soon realizes that corporations now beam ads directly into people&#39;s brains while they sleep, putting ads for products into people&#39;s dreams.</p>

<p>He becomes disgusted by this violation, and starts making a fuss. Then his new friend Leela says, &quot;Didn&#39;t you have ads in the 20th century?&quot; and he says &quot;Well, sure, but not in our DREAMS! ...Only on TV and Radio, and in magazines and in movies, and at ballgames, ...and on buses and milk cartons and t-shirts, and bananas, and written on the sky. But NEVER in our DREAMS!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A grudge is probably the the best way to put it. I have many mental quandries that seem to only unfold into more complex multi-headed dilemmas once a question is answered. It seems as if the &quot;person in charge&quot; or &quot;good guys&quot; fully understand how inept I am at trying to wrap my head around our entire reality but either don&#39;t care that I am hopelessly ignorant or have no way of actually assisting me if I even deserved help. Meanwhile I can&#39;t help but feel as though this force of good has gotten lazy or isn&#39;t as competent as it previously thought it was and has been taken advantage of by an unforseen entity or energy that only seeks to deceive and spread hate through many forms. I feel as though our current situation in this universe couldn&#39;t be possible unless we have been forsaken or condemned as a species. We have this lemming mentality but disguise it by telling ourselves that &quot;we&#39;re just doing what we have to do&quot; or we are just too complacent with this horrendous quality of living to stop it. Nothing is what it seems and I&#39;m afraid that once this illusion is pulled away there will only be another &quot;veil&quot; behind this one that is just as hopeless as its predecessor. I believe we are in a perpetual state of apocalypse but we&#39;ve become so accustomed to it that we don&#39;t notice it or don&#39;t care; I think most of you have gotten sucked in by these delusions of grandeur and &quot;oneness&quot; to the point of believing that things will just happen to work out in our favor or maybe you think that praying for things and just meditating or loving shit in general will be enough to slip through our spiritual judgment unscathed if there IS any judgment. What is worse? The idea that our wretched actions can go unpunished or that god himself might not be a benevolent being. Or that these terrible events are actually allowed to happen because &quot;the ends justify the means&quot; and god would much rather allow you to act poorly so he can lecture you and belittle you for your pettiness instead of stopping it when it happens and teaching us a lesson before it&#39;s too late to apply it in our own lives. I&#39;m afraid the cosmic dice are loaded and even if they aren&#39;t &quot;the house always wins&quot; even if that requires our loss. I&#39;m sorry if you actually took the time to read this wall of ramblings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of it&#39;s truth (I feel like &quot;veracity&quot; is the word generally used here but I&#39;m not sure enough to chance it) the way it was presented was compelling and awe-inspiring. That movie changed my already-changing mind in deep ways. I paused it after about 10 minutes, went out, bought a bottle of whiskey, went home, unpaused, and drank it straight from the bottle, as the narrator sensibly explained SO MUCH that I didn&#39;t understand before quite that way. So many disconnected things suddenly connected.</p>

<p>And the stuff about The Son being The Sun and about the solstices, et cetera, was very haunting and riveting, and the entire movie was frightening in a good way.</p>

<p>I wish there were more like it, even with all it&#39;s many flaws.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m just smart enough to realize just how much I don&#39;t know</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The true sign of intelligence :) Never let go of the microscope brother.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How hot does water need to be to boil?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depends on the pressure. Water boils at lower temperatures with lower pressure. Boiling potatoes on the top of Everest will not cook them ;) </p>

<blockquote>
<p>who are we, as the human race, and where did we come from?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are the result of billions of years of evolution as are all living things. We are upright, hairless apes with an astonishingly large brain which allows us to form extremely complex social structures. Through mutual co-operation and transfer of information we have transcended many of the usual evolutionary pressures that would normally dictate that our progeny becomes more adapted to the local environment. Instead we fashion tools to help us overcome these pressures, allowing us to expand across the planet into many <em>vastly</em> different biomes. Sadly we seem to have a strong superiority complex as a result and seem to think we are somehow above or better than nature when in fact our lives revolve around <em>numerous</em> unhappy compromises.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do we have a purpose</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably not. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is there something we should or shouldn&#39;t be doing, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the face of the infinite void the only meaning is that which you create. Enjoy life, there&#39;s no other reason to put yourself through it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it&#39;s man&#39;s nature to hope...maybe because it&#39;s so frightening to consider that maybe we&#39;re all alone in a bubble in a dark endless sea</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Precisely. <em>&quot;If you look long enough into the void, the void begins to look back through you&quot;</em>. It doesn&#39;t make the void any less real though. Given our objective insignificance in the face of the Universe it seems the height of absurdity to suggest that it should in any way conform to our expectations, let alone wishes. There is only chaos. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there were for sure, I&#39;d want to worship it and please it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why? What would it matter? Why would an infinite eternal being go to all the trouble of creating the <em>entire universe</em> and then be so insecure as to be upset at people&#39;s choices? God is nothing but a reflection of our own insecurity and fear of the void.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to know...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wikipedia and Google are your friends. We live in an <em>amazing time</em>. Literally there are days when I am just in awe at the power we all have at our fingertips. <strong>Ignorance is a choice in the age of the Internet</strong>. Check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns,_Germs,_and_Steel">Guns Germs and Steel</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_West_Rules%E2%80%94For_Now">Why The West Rules</a> these are great books exploring geographic determinism and the development of civilization(s). More generally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_materialism">Historical Materialism</a> does a lot for me, it seems to make an awful lot of sense. </p>

<p>Great post mate really enjoyed this :) </p>

<p>edit: Feel the need to point out though that questioning for the sake of questioning is not <em>necessarily</em> good. As a thought exercise sure but there comes a point when we have to recognize that we&#39;re building a house made of bullshit on a foundation of... more bullshit. <em>So much</em> of philosophy is based around the musings of old men without <em>any</em> reference to evidence or data. The Scientific Method is the best process we have developed for separating aspects of the true reality that exists beyond our subjective experience from statistical noise and bullshit. Use it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In no way are you below it, maybe I expressed myself with unfamiliar concepts. A baby or a bird knows/experiences what we&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>We&#39;re trained to <em>look</em>, which implies intent.

While we&#39;re <em>looking</em> we cannot <em>see</em>. &quot;Seeing&quot; being free from intent.</p>

<p>The brain is dissecting the pure experience of being into tools through abstractions (history, maths, models, time, opinions, ...) which are only rough representations of reality.</p>

<p>What you&#39;re really looking for never left you, so it can&#39;t be &quot;found&quot;. It&#39;s the only thing we really <em>know</em>, but every intent in the world is trying to steer away from it.</p>

<p>Just a theory</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Existence, e.g. What is the answer to the question, &quot;What is the Matrix?&quot; There is most certainly an existential quality to all life forms and there is a constant struggle for survival. A great leader emerges (think- the first murdering-ape from the intro to 2001:A Space Odyssey) and gains control of a group of individuals who are dependent on that leadership for survival, again, survival of a tribe, a race, a state, a religion, a philosophy, or a meme. The Matrix is a meme, perhaps the only meme that matters in reality, and it is the answer to your question &quot;What&#39;s REALLY going on?&quot;</p>

<p>See the NSA taking every bit out of the bit stream and saving it in cybercenters &amp; clouds all for later use? That&#39;s the agents working for the system, that system is the Matrix. </p>

<p>The Matrix is why we look at sub-particles we keep find smaller particles and hidden forces, and why, when we look beyond ourselves as far as we can see into the universe - it is just an endlessly vast menagerie of super-cosmic ideas of floating energies in space. </p>

<p>But is the Matrix a neutral venue? Is it neutral good or evil? That is what bugs me. Obviously, the human players are programmed to go either way - this adds diversity to the game and pretty much an endless succession of challenges until you die or your program gets deleted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read the Law of One if you ever get a chance. It&#39;s supposedly a channelling of a higher dimensional entity, specifically the Egyptian god of the sun Ra. </p>

<p>A breif summary: the point of life is to reunite with the creator, God, the logos, intelligent infinity, whatever you want to call it. In order to do so, you must move up through each dimension (referred to as densities in the book). This will take an enormous amount of time and span thousands of lifetimes. We humans on earth are currently in the 3rd density, the density of karma and suffering.</p>

<p>The book also gives an explanation for why the cabal/illuminati are here. Once the public wakes up to their evil, it will usher in a time of utter happiness for humanity, and hopefully ascension to the next density. </p>

<p>If this doesn&#39;t sound too crazy to you, I highly recommend checking it out. It is absolutely enlightening and gives an answer to just about every question you could have. </p>

<p>As best as I can tell, we can truly know nothing as we think of knowledge. Facts are merely points in time and space with descriptives attached to them, but they are round and different from every angle. Imagine two opposing cones, joined at their point, sharing an axis. If one cone is the external material world and one cone is the interior mental world, our consciousnes is the point where both cones touch. We can only see down the cones, but never to the true center. It&#39;s like trying to say where the mirror&#39;s plane meets the air. They are the same thing, but we name divisions that do not exist to make sense of the world. At some point our brains got fucked up and now here we are acting out an insane multi-millennium comedic drama of the ages and no one will ever know why. We do not even begin to glean how, let alone why.  </p>

<p>Why ? Is this based on some fear of yours or you want to become some all-knowing being simply by asking questions and expecting true answers ?!</p>

<p>What you need is The Nexus (where All Information and Knowledge that ever was, is and will be is stored), it is said that any sentient being can accesses it by simply being in the &quot;right state of mind&quot;. I believe when one achieves this goal, the ability to learn and experience mystery will simply cease to exist or maybe even become something completely different... so it seems that extremes in any sense of the word are bad no matter how you look at it, the balance is the key.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious, how do you see God (not the religious one but THE GOD or maybe religious one is the only kind you see ?), as the apex sentient being of all things within space and time or something beyond our imagination or what we cant even comprehend... or maybe you have your own version ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well when I search it, I instantly find answers stating things like how atmospheric pressure changes it. Apparently the boiling point of water at the top of Mount Everest is 150 degrees fahrenheit because the pressure up there is different from normal places. I also suspect there are other exceptions.

    <div class="md"><p>The boiling point is lower when pressure is lower. Pressure is lower on Everest because of its high altitude, so water boils at a lower temperature than at sea level pressure. The boiling point inside a submarine or space station would depend on the atmospheric pressure, but both are likely pressurized to around sea level air pressure. Water in space would vaporize or sublimate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For someone who hates Jews, you sure seem to put a lot of faith in their writings. Jesus was a Jew so he couldn&#39;t possibly mean all Jews are in league with the devil when he called a group of Pharisees (jewish religious leaders) a synagogue of satan. Many had secretly maintained and practiced the forbidden teachings of mystery babylon and worshipped gods forbidden to their peoples. They did terrible things in the name of god for their own selfish gain. Most Christians/Jews are actually closer to Luciferians than they realize. The essence of Christianity/Judaism is supposed to be doing good and giving glory to god, the essence of Luciferianism is to give all the glory to yourself, to become god, in spite of the creator god that didnt want you to eat from the tree of knowledge/good and evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus read, studied, and followed the Torah. Most Jews have never even heard of the Babylonian Talmud nor do they follow it. Sure elements of it have permeated into society, much like perverted elements of Christianity permeate American society. There are many different forms of Judaism, most of which have nothing to do with the &quot;Satanic Talmud&quot;. </p>

<p>Like I said previously however, the elites of the Judaic hierarchy potentially preserved the teachings and traditions of the Babylonian or as you call it &quot;satanic&quot; Talmud. There is great evidence to suggest that it has been used to bastardize Israel as Pagan/Occult traditions have bastardized Christianity here in America.</p>
