<p>He had breakfast at the towers every morning, but luckily for him, he and his entire family took the day off work! What a lucky guy!

<p>So I guess we shattered all of newtons laws that morning huh! Now 10% of a building can absolutely pulverize the 90% of steel and concrete below it and turn it into a smoldering lava pit that stays hot for months. And, for the first time in history, three steel skyscrapers collapsed due to fire. I guess we should have rewritten some safety codes, huh? And fired some people, right? Oh, wait. Funny story, the engineers who designed the buildings actually designed it so that planes could hit it. Yeah, they said that. These buildings were monsters, with a huge steel core. I&#39;ll link an example of when a B-52 hit the Empire State Building, even worse fire. It was fine. Seriously, read what the engineers say. They say that a plane could hit it, tear off the whole side, and it would still stand. Here, ill save you the effort:</p>

<p>&quot;We looked at every possible thing we could think of that could happen to the buildings, even to the extent of an airplane hitting the side… Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed. [But] the building structure would still be there.&quot; </p>

<p>or the Pentagon ONI that &quot;lost&quot; 2.3 trillion dollars on 9/10/01</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry to link to 911myths, but the $2.3 trillion was a known issue since at least 1999: <a href="http://www.911myths.com/html/rumsfeld__9_11_and__2_3_trilli.html">http://www.911myths.com/html/rumsfeld__9_11_and__2_3_trilli.html</a></p>

<p>Please do not cite wikispooks. The article states, among other things, that a retired IDF officer overheard some Jews planning 9/11 in a cemetery 11 months before it happened. This story is certainly little more than internet copypasta. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What did &quot;lucky larry&quot; silverstein mean when he said &quot;pull it&quot; in relation to building 7? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can people retire Larry Silverstein&#39;s &quot;pull it&quot; already? Since the official story on WTC 7 has always been that it collapsed from fire, there&#39;s no reason why Larry would try to fool people into thinking that it was rigged for safety purposes. Nobody has been able to find any sources for &quot;Pull it&quot; being a term for explosive demolition (it could refer to when a structure is demolished by literally toppling it over with cables). However, it is possible that Larry&#39;s statement was a cleverly ambiguous bit of disinformation to imply that the building really was rigged in 5 hours. </p>

<p>Whatever the reason the WTC could&#39;ve been demolished, and Larry&#39;s role in it, it was probably more nuanced than that.</p>

<p>Larry is as dirty as they come, if it was up to me we&#39;d all go to his house, burn it down with the kids and wife inside, and torture him for some fucking names as to who was really behind this.  </p>

<p>Looking into the names behind the short sale stocks and insider trading on the airliner stocks would be a good first start, unfortunately 9/11 was also a financial crime that destroyed its own evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, what? What evidence is there what anything other than a 757 crashed into the Pentagon? Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m on your side. The WTC was probably demolished. Like everyone here, I question why Hani Hanjour would choose to crash into the SIDE of the Pentagon, perfectly level to the ground, when the roof is the perfect bullseye. The exact side of the Pentagon that was hit was recently rennovated for missile impacts, which is actual evidedence pointing to conspiracy.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing the point, the reality is there&#39;s no evidence ANYTHING crashed into the pentagon.  I see a hole where a bomb blew up, a bunch of photoshopped pictures, a CIA team confiscating every camera in the area and security &quot;footage&quot; that doesn&#39;t show anything close to a plane, not to mention that seasoned pilots will tell you a turn that sharp at that angle, coming in perfectly flat, is totally fucking impossible.</p>

<p>Maybe a plane did hit the pentagon, we&#39;ll never know.  But it did hit in just the right spot where the DoD and the Office of Naval Intelligence was investigating some very serious financial crimes.</p>

<p>VOCs....And exactly what I said before. The official story combustion can account for ~30 ppb of the 610,000 ppb of benzene measured at Ground Zero. Not to mention the 990,000 ppb propylene.You really need this information again? OK...</p>

<p><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The occurrence of such extreme, sharp spikes in VOCs in air at GZ indicate something other than the behavior of a typical structure fire. Oxygen influx as a result of shifting of materials within the pile might have created an increase in combustion of material in localized areas. But these spikes in VOCs, at levels thousands of times higher than seen in other structure fires, suggest extremely violent but short-lived fire events. Probably the most striking spike in toxic air emissions, found in EPA monitoring data, occurred on 9th February, 2002. Note (Table 1 ) that this was nearly 5 months after 9/11, and after nearly all the debris had been cleared from GZ. In fact, the levels of some species, like toluene and styrene, were some of the highest observed at the site. But the levels of benzene and propylene detected on that day were far above previous measurements, at 610,000 and 990,000 ppb, respectively. Other VOCs were measured at their peak levels on this date, including 1,3-butadiene at 400,000 ppb.&quot; &quot;EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion. Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite&quot;</p>

<p>Youre asking to prove a negative. How can I present something that hasn&#39;t been researched </p>

<p>Think about the asinine nature of your request. For me to present what you are asking. Some researcher must&#39;ve read this paper or was interested in this particular field, and then decided to spend their time, money and resources on 9/11 conspiracies. Why would someone do that?</p>

<p>What you are asking for, probably doesn&#39;t exist because no one is going to waste their time and money on dumb 9/11 conspiracies particularly on this one area when they could spend that money on actual meaningful research. </p>

<p>Which comparisons are those? </p>

<p>The Plastimet fire was a single floor building that was able to vent all emissions openly into the air and was fully extinguished in 3 days. That&#39;s nothing like 267 stories of collapsed office building, 1.7 million tons of rubble left smouldering for weeks. </p>

<p>Every single VOC reading in your paper was at <em>least</em> 1900 times higher than this &quot;~30 ppb&quot; figure you keep throwing out. Does that mean that <em>thermite</em> was burning uninterrupted from September to February?</p>

<p>Besides, the benzene levels in the Plastimet fire peaked at <strong>250 ppb</strong>. It seems the authors of your paper couldn&#39;t even get that part straight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re expecting someone to write a paper to refute this nonsense, don&#39;t hold your breath. The paper had zero impact and the thermite hypothesis has been thoroughly discredited. No scientist is going to waste time and funding to refute a silly myth, and no reputable publication is going to publish a paper dealing exclusively with debunking crazy conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>When Mark Basile gets off his lazy ass and submits the results of his crowd funded independent study of the dust, and those results <em>from a completely independent lab</em> confirm the presence of thermite, then you might get the attention of actual scientists. Until then they will be content to laugh at you from the peanut gallery. By the way, what&#39;s taking so long on that front? It&#39;s been 3 years since he started fundraising, and it&#39;s been 2 years since he hit his $5000 goal, and we haven&#39;t had a single actual update from Mark Basile himself. What&#39;s the hold up? He could singlehandedly shut up all the <em>faithers</em> and <em>coincidence theorists</em> in one stroke, but has produced absolutely nothing. </p>

<p>And you still haven&#39;t told me what part of my completely common sense explanation you disagree with. There are really only 3 parts, so I&#39;ll split them up for you and you can tell me which one is wrong. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The VOCs identified in your paper are all common components of combustible materials that would be found in office buildings. </p></li>
<li><p>Combustion borne gasses can become trapped in air pockets </p></li>
<li><p>The 1.7 million tons of smouldering rubble at Ground Zero would have had a lot of air pockets. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Do you disagree with any of the above 3 points? If so, which one do you disagree with and why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait a sec...you don&#39;t actually think thermite was the <em>source</em> of the VOCs, do you?</p>

<p>Hell man, your own paper doesn&#39;t claim that. It claims that the massive VOC spikes were related to violent, short lived combustion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. Therefore, <strong>the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of combustion. Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You know what else has <strong>violent and short lived combustion, similar to the effects of energetic material</strong>? </p>

<p>Thousands of litres of fossil fuel.</p>

<p>Burning fossil fuel is also <strong>the most common source</strong> of benzene and propylene. Neither of those are expected components of a thermite reaction.</p>

<p>So, I guess according to my peer reviewed and published rebuttal, I&#39;ve accounted for the VOCs using the exact logic of your paper. Actually, I&#39;ve accounted for them better, since burning fossil fuel would create benzene and propylene as a byproduct (with no associated PM), where burning thermite <em>would not</em>.</p>

<p>Better luck next time</p>

<p>OK, so the claim from your paper is that the VOC spikes were created by &quot;violent, short lived&quot; forms of combustion. </p>

<p>Thousands of litres of fossil fuel produce violent, short lived combustion, AND would <strong>also</strong> have <strong>created</strong> the very same VOCs listed in your paper. </p>

<p>The VOCs are accounted for with a combustion source that we know for a fact was at Ground Zero to the tune of likely a million litres or more. </p>

<p>See that? I explained the VOCs and didn&#39;t have to invent anything to do it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And no, you&#39;ve provided 0 peer reviewed, published rebuttals.</p>

<p>Actually I produced a peer reviewed published source showing how much VOC creating, violently burning, energetic fossil fuel was on site. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And no, burning of fuel is not as energetic as thermite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it&#39;s not enough that burning fossil fuel is violent, short lived and energetic, it has to be <em>as</em> energetic as thermite now? </p>

<p>What value of &quot;energetic&quot; does your paper assign to these violent short lived fires? Or does it not actually specify that at all, just say that the fires &quot;appear to be similar&quot; to energetic material? </p>

<p>Three underground floors had been used as a

with the cars’ fuel tanks being anywhere from near
empty to full, the explosive potential was extraordi-

<p>Several thousand? The capacity was 2,000. And a &quot;conservative&quot; estimate would put the number at 1,000.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So....not even all of the conservative estimate. </p>

<p>The American Society of Safety Engineers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>72,000 gallons of diesel fuel were stored in a tank (on basement level 7) for
the WTC complex backup generator/power sys-
tems. <strong>Final status: The tank was eventually located and inspected. Although slightly damaged, no leaks were found. The fuel was removed.</strong></p>

<p>And of course, none of this matters anyway since (despite your attempts at deception) we now know that this is all in reference to fires &quot;that persisted from September 11 through <strong>December 20, 2001.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Actually your paper doesn&#39;t say that at all. The exact quote is &quot;additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM2.5 emissions rose more gradually, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics <strong>as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials</strong> previously thought to exist in the WTC.&quot; No mention at all of the burning of potential fuel sources. No mention of transformer oil, or heating oil, or diesel fuel, or gasoline. </p>

<p>As per your paper, the VOCs are explained by &quot;violent, short lived combustion&quot;, exactly like fossil fuels. </p>

<p>And the largest VOC spikes are from byproducts commonly produced by burning fossil fuels.</p>

<p>You said this:</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s super cute that you keep pretending you accounted for <strong>both the quantity and energy levels of the VOCs</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;re claiming the VOCs have &quot;energy levels&quot;, and you&#39;re claiming I haven&#39;t accounted for them. </p>

<p>Firstly, airborne volatile organic compounds don&#39;t have &quot;energy levels&quot;, secondly there is nothing in your paper that lists any &quot;energy levels&quot; associated with the VOCs at Ground Zero. </p>

<p>You made it up. </p>

<p>So, I ask again, what are the &quot;energy levels&quot; of the VOCs as shown in your paper? Just a page number will suffice, thanks. </p>

<p>There&#39;s as much evidence linking fossil fuels to those astronomical levels as there is thermite. </p>

<p>Actually that&#39;s not true. There&#39;s <em>less</em> evidence linking thermite.

<p>I don&#39;t need to refute it. </p>

<p>The paper doesn&#39;t actually prove thermite was at Ground Zero. None of the VOC levels are specifically linked to thermite in any way. The paper doesn&#39;t even attempt to do so. The only point it <em>tenuously</em> makes about those VOC levels is that they <em>appear to be</em> a result of violent, short lived combustion. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve provided a source for a substance that has violent, short lived combustion and that was most certainly present on site, unlike thermite. It just so happens that my example also creates benzene and propylene when burned. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t even <em>attempt</em> to refute the paper, I just offered an <em>extra</em> source of combustion that the paper <em>never even considered</em>. </p>

<p>You&#39;re claiming that the largest VOC spikes are from <em>thermite</em> that burned after and separately from the rest of the combustibles.</p>

<p>Explain to me how that&#39;s different. </p>

<p>Dude, that&#39;s EXACTLY YOUR THEORY TOO! You&#39;re claiming that the VOCs are from very small, separate <strong>thermite</strong> combustion. </p>

<p>Explain to me how that&#39;s different. </p>

<p>I just showed you that&#39;s false, using the very EPA data your paper does. </p>

<p>PM levels rose and fell at different sites all the way to June of 2002, indicating that combustion was still occurring at Ground Zero. Materials expected to be involved in combustion continued to burn for <em>months</em> after. It&#39;s right there in the data, which I&#39;ve helpfully provided. </p>

<p>Appendix C of the EPA report. </p>

<p>Already was, in the EPA data. </p>

<p>Why am I not surprised you&#39;ve never actually gone through it before? </p>

<p>Pm peaked at 400 just before, and into October.  In fact, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The five stron-
gest peaks in PM2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th
September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to
the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the
dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is
clear that the levels of PM2.5 emissions rose more gradu-
ally, and died down more gradually, <strong>indicating slower fire
dynamics</strong> as might be expected from the burning of the
organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC.</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>Therefore,  the  extreme  spikes  in  air  concentrations  of
the   five   VOCs   noted   above,   particularly   on   3rd,   8th

<p>Oh no, you don&#39;t need to be convinced of anything. Have you ever seen conversations with truthers. Regardless of how much data and facts you give them, you can&#39;t convince them against their already pre-conceived notions </p>

<p>But we already knew truther don&#39;t care about science. </p>

<p>No worries...I&#39;ll keep reminding you all of this science that you can&#39;t refute every time you come here claiming the science is on your side. </p>

<p>Actually no, it has been shown that the combustion available in the official story <em>cannot</em> account for them. So you continue to believe a story based solely on faith. A story that does not account for the evidence. A story that doesn&#39;t fit the science.</p>

<p>But since we <em>do</em> have the peer reviewed, published paper showing that the official story combustion cannot account for the VOCs, let&#39;s see what those peer reviewed, published authors have to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To clarify your comments on our paper published by The Environmentalist, those interested should note that the peer review process was completed and the paper had been accepted for publication in the print edition before the optional open access choice was discussed. Open access was then made available through a generous donation from a supporter. <strong>The authors never paid anything to publish this paper and it would have been published without any fees if we had chosen to let readers pay their own fees.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok I&#39;ll answer your question: I am asking that question because if what you are asking for is a peer reviewed research paper on a specific topic, if that costs money, then someone has to decide to spend money on that project.

<p>If it&#39;s just a matter of science, then what you are asking for is much easier. Because asking for a scientific explanation doesn&#39;t require money, but rather knowledge of that specific area</p>

<p>You see the difference.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a difference between asking someone for a scientific explanation and asking someone for that explanation to be in the form of a peer reviewed research paper.

<p>I&#39;ll ask my question again, hopefully you stop the habit of just ignoring what people actually said in favor for your straw man </p>

<p>When did I try to invalidate it? What opinion did I give?</p>

<p>Here we are again, your replies are not on topic. </p>

<p>The topic was about if a difference exists between a scientific explanation and a peer reviewed paper.  Instead of addressing that, you go on tangents about opinions on VOCs which I never gave. </p>

<p>The authors never paid anything to publish this paper and it would have been published without any fees if we had chosen to let readers pay their own fees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s for that specific publisher, not for all. And I&#39;m not just talking about just the publishing, but rather the whole process, from the drafts to the actual resources used to conduct the research. That costs money </p>

<blockquote>
<p>already known knowledge </p>

<p>That&#39;s what you believe, I have yet to give my opinion on the matter</p>

<p>For that specific publisher. And the key word there was produce. Publishing is part of producing, but there are other parts involved.</p>

<p>So please answer the question, not just publishing, but the entire research paper process: would that cost money?</p>

<p>Ok, let&#39;s take that answer, regardless of whether it&#39;s correct or not. So to refute your paper they also have to produce a paper. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is correct. Regardless of your unqualified opinion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To refute your paper, they would have had to read your paper and care enough to want to spend money to refute it through another paper.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To refute the paper, &quot;they&quot; have to produce one. This paper has already been accepted. You need one as well. Which you lack.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then the next logical question is how many researchers have read this paper and care enough about 9/11 conspiracy to waste money refuting it?</p>

<p>That&#39;s my question </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answer it yourself. No one is going to help you prove your own unsupported theory. And you now what? The paper read read, and cared about. As it is peer reviewed and published </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When did I claim such</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just pointing out the facts. You have no science. Glad we agree on something.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What speculation? It&#39;s weird how your replies are never on topic. Is anything I said incorrect? That if someone asks for a scientific explanation what is required is knowledge, not so much money. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speculation that the reason the paper hasn&#39;t been refuted is that no one cares to do so. How many times do you need that explained to you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like I said earlier, your replies are not on topic. I have yet to give an opinion on the matter. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your opinion is that the paper hasn&#39;t been refuted because &quot;no one cares.&quot; No one wants to spend money to refute. You haven&#39;t proven this. Just more unsupported speculation.
The topic is that the science of the paper remains unchallenged.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll ask my question again, hopefully you stop the habit of just ignoring what people actually said in favor for your straw man </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answered already. You can go ahead and account for the VOCs now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Question; do you see the difference between a peer reviewed paper and a scientific explanation of an issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see the difference between supported, sourced, accepted, peer reviewed, published science and the unsupported, unpublished, failed explanation. Yup.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How one simply requires knowledge while the other money?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. Your knowledge remains unsupported. Unlike the knowledge in the paper.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When did I try to invalidate it? What opinion did I give?</p>

<p>Here we are again, your replies are not on topic. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are. </p>

<p>What a long, drawn out non-response that you can&#39;t support. Again, typical</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was going to individually respond to each one, but what would be the point, your replies would not be on topic.</p>

<p>For example: here, I ask a very specific and simple question. A question about whether or not you see the difference between X and Y.</p>

<p>Instead of saying yes or no about seeing the difference between X and Y,  you respond by saying I see the difference between X and Z. </p>

<p>Completely off topic.</p>

<ul>
<li>Question; do you see the difference between a peer reviewed paper and a scientific explanation of an issue.</li>
</ul>

<p>This was the question I posed. Do you see the difference between X (peer reviewed) and Y (scientific explanation)</p>

<p>You reply:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>see the difference between supported, sourced, accepted, peer reviewed, published science (X) and the unsupported, unpublished, failed explanation (Z)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who asked about unsupported, unpublished, failed explanation? Nobody was asking about that. You read the question as between X and Y. </p>

<p>And you turned into between X and Z</p>

<p>This is why it&#39;s impossible to have discourse with you, nothing you reply is on topic and you make the individual replying to you have to ask the same question over and over again because instead of answering a simple and direct question you answer something that wasn&#39;t asked.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like if someone asks: what&#39;s 2 + 7?</p>

<p>And you reply: 2 + 4 = 6.</p>

<p>Regardless of if that answer is right, it&#39;s not what was asked. </p>

<p>&quot;Regarding the actual topic...&quot;</p>

<p>Or:</p>

<p>&quot;Regarding the science since you won&#39;t participate in blind, unsupported speculation...&quot;</p>

<p>So you&#39;re aware of pvt&#39;s theory, but not my response? It isn&#39;t going to change now that a different person is asking the exact same question. But we can pretend you didn&#39;t read it if you like.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Could millions of liters of fossil fuels</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Already wrong. pvt didn&#39;t do enough research. He included diesel fuel and gas from cars from a parking garage. Here is his quote/source</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://m.pnas.org/content/101/32/11685.short">http://m.pnas.org/content/101/32/11685.short</a></p>

<p>&quot;fires started with the ignition of 91,000 liters of jet fuel (from the two commercial aircraft that initiated the collapse of the WTC) and spread to an estimated 100,000 tons of organic debris, 490,000 liters of transformer oil, 380,000 liters of heating and diesel oil, and fuel from several thousand automobiles (stored in subterranean structures of the WTC) (4–6).&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here was my response <strong>(Actually, before I get to my response to him. Let me add something that I forgot to <del>laugh at</del> ask him about originally)</strong></p>

<p>91,000 liters of jet fuel papi? Are you/pvt including that in your millions? Because I don&#39;t think that number is accurate, do you? What are we basing that number on? Because FEMA estimates &quot;that each aircraft contained about 10,000 gallons of jet fuel upon impact into the buildings.&quot;</p>

<p>So....10,000g x 2 = ?L</p>

<p>A. 91,000 liters</p>

<p>B. 75708.236 liters</p>

<p>Answer B. So we&#39;re already starting off incorrectly. What else does FEMA say?</p>

<p>&quot;Calculations indicate that between 1,000 and 3,000 gallons of jet fuel were likely consumed in this manner. Barring additional information, it is reasonable to assume that an approximately similar amount of jet fuel was consumed by fireballs as the aircraft struck WTC 1. &quot;</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>&quot;If one assumes that approximately 3,000 gallons of fuel were consumed in the initial fireballs, then the remainder either escaped the impact floors in the manners described above or was consumed by the fire on the impact floors. If half flowed away, then approximately 4,000 gallons remained on the impact floors to be consumed in the fires that followed. The jet fuel in the aerosol would have burned out as fast as the flame could spread through it, igniting almost every combustible on the floors involved. Fuel that fell to the floor and did not flow out of the building would have burned as a pool or spill fire at the point where it came to rest.&quot;</p>

<p>And we know NIST agrees with these numbers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“No evidence or analysis emerged that significantly altered the FEMA estimate” (NCSTAR 1-5F, p 56)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So ~4,000 gallons per plane/tower inside. Let&#39;s pretend that <em>didn&#39;t</em> burn in the resulting fires somehow. </p>

<p>And ~4,000 gallons that flowed away per plane/tower. Best case for you (which is also the most implausible) gives you 16,000 gallons, no? ~60,500 liters. </p>

<p>And the more realistic option for fuel burning in February (although still unrealistic) would have to be the fuel that didn&#39;t burn in the immediate fires. The fuel that &quot;flowed away.&quot; ~4,000 x 2.</p>

<p>8,000 gallons / 30,283 liters. So....<em>not</em> 91,000? I really hope you weren&#39;t including that number.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to my response to pvt: Here is his source again (for reference to my immediate comment to follow)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://m.pnas.org/content/101/32/11685.short">http://m.pnas.org/content/101/32/11685.short</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Very interesting! Looks like that paragraph starts off in the middle of something. Let&#39;s see. Ah-ha! According to the sentence you cut off that occurs <em>right</em> before the quote about the fuels, we see that it is in reference to &quot;fires that persisted from September 11 through <strong>December 20, 2001.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>No wonder you left that off. December 2001 comes <em>before</em> February 2002. Correct? Pretty dishonest of you. Glad you debunked yourself though. I always enjoy that. And you&#39;re quite good at it!</p>

<p>The American Society of Safety Engineers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Three underground floors had been used as a
parking garage with a total capacity of 2,000 cars. 
Assuming (conservatively) the garage to be half-full,
with the cars’ fuel tanks being anywhere from near
empty to full, the explosive potential was extraordi-
nary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Several thousand automobiles? The capacity was 2,000. And a &quot;conservative&quot; estimate would put the number at 1,000.</p>

<p>sev·er·al
sev(ə)rəl/
determiner &amp; pronoun
determiner: several; pronoun: several</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>more than two</strong> but not many.</li>
</ol>

<p>Not to mention the factor of the full/emptiness of the tanks. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Final status: The cars were eventually located
and removed. Some had exploded and were completely
burned-out <strong>while others were in pristine, drivable condition.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So....not even all of the conservative estimate. </p>

<p>The American Society of Safety Engineers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>72,000 gallons of diesel fuel were stored in a tank (on basement level 7) for
the WTC complex backup generator/power sys-
tems. <strong>Final status: The tank was eventually located and inspected. Although slightly damaged, no leaks were found. The fuel was removed.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And of course, none of this matters anyway since (despite your attempts at deception) we now know that this is all in reference to fires &quot;that persisted from September 11 through <strong>December 20, 2001.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p><em>Now</em> back to you papi. Do <em>you</em> think they caused the spike<strong>s</strong>? Because if so, you have to link them to the dates. Pvt couldn&#39;t do it. Can you? Do I think <strong>&lt;</strong> millions (because you don&#39;t have millions - why the need for exaggeration?) could cause the spikes? No. Not without the PM match. According to the scientifically accepted data:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. <strong>None</strong> of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. <strong>Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>pvt&#39;s own source corroborates this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The concentrations of very fine silicon, sulfur, and many metals, as well as coarse anthropogenic metals, decreased markedly during October, probably in association with the cooling of the collapse piles.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>pvt&#39;s own source also makes this statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;However, the continuing emission of these plumes, especially after the heavy rains of September 14 and the increasingly effective efforts of fire suppression in mid- and late September, are not fully understood.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course not. Not with the official story combustion.</p>

<p>This is also taken directly from pvt&#39;s source. Of course, he decided to cut off everything after the &quot;WTC buildings.&quot; But no worries, I found it for you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The presence of fuels, including diesel and electrical insulating oils and combustible materials in the WTC buildings, and lack of oxygen were two factors that allowed the fire to burn for over <strong>3 months.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fires were declared officially extinguished on 12/19 - 12/20. And whadda know? 9/11 - 12/19-20...Just over three months. Not four. Not five. No wonder he cut that part off.</p>

<p>The insane spike(s) took place after 3 months. </p>

<p>So, to recap, if we are to believe this hypothesis:</p>

<p><em>You</em> need to place the fossil fuels on those dates. You can&#39;t without the PM. Which you don&#39;t have.</p>

<p>If you <em>could</em> put them there on those dates (which we already know you can&#39;t) <em>you</em> need to prove how much was actually there (we know millions was never correct to begin with)</p>

<p>And if you <em>could</em> do both of those things, <em>you</em> need to prove that whatever amount you actually ended up proving (which thus far is 0.00) is capable of achieving those levels.</p>

<p>So...now I&#39;ve answered this question, yet again.</p>

<p>You know you could have, like um idk, answered my question.</p>

<p>I specially worded my Q for a reason </p>

<p>Instead of answering someone else&#39;s question. </p>

<p>I asked a very specific question, instead of responding specifically to it. You responded to something else. Let me give you an example of what you just did</p>

<p>I asked </p>

<ul>
<li>Could millions of liters of fossil fuels</li>
</ul>

<p>You respond </p>

<ul>
<li>Already wrong. pvt didn&#39;t do enough research. He included diesel fuel and gas from cars from a parking garage. Here is his quote/source</li>

<p>You could have responded, no, and this is because XYZ</p>

<p>Could millions of liters of fossil fuels when they burn releasing benzene and propylene, could they release VOCs?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When tremendous amounts of fossil fuels burn, do they release benzene and propylene?</p></li>
<li><p>If large amounts of benzene and propylene are released, are VOCs present due to this release?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>The theory is well supported. </p>

<p>Elements found in trade center aerosol sampling were typical of fuel oil fires (vanadium and nickel). </p>

<p>Of course, the authors of your paper <strong>discounted fuel oil as a source of combustion</strong> because the only source of fuel oil <em>specifically</em> named by another researcher in a <em>different paper</em> came from WTC7...so apparently they never looked further than that...if they had they would have found the million litres of fuel oil in the Twin Towers. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t take my word for it. It&#39;s right in the paper. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only fuel oil source suggested by Cahill and his team was under WTC building 7, across the street from the towers (Cahill et al. 2004). But it should be noted that government investigators have suggested that the fuel oil in question was burned to create the fires that caused WTC building 7 to collapse. If one assumes they were correct, that fuel oil would no longer be available as the source of vanadium and nickel more than 1 month later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much science! </p>

<p>Oooops. Looks like your authors didn&#39;t rule out all sources of &quot;official story combustion&quot; as possible causes of the VOCs since they never even considered fuel oil in any places other than WTC7.</p>

<p>&quot;fires started with the ignition of 91,000 liters of jet fuel (from the two commercial aircraft that initiated the collapse of the WTC) and spread to an estimated 100,000 tons of organic debris, 490,000 liters of transformer oil, 380,000 liters of heating and diesel oil, and fuel from several thousand automobiles (stored in subterranean structures of the WTC) (4–6).&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very interesting! Looks like that paragraph starts off in the middle of something. Let&#39;s see. Ah-ha! According to the sentence you cut off that occurs <em>right</em> before the quote about the fuels, we see that it is in reference to &quot;fires that persisted from September 11 through <strong>December 20, 2001.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>No wonder you left that off. December 2001 comes <em>before</em> February 2002. Correct? Pretty dishonest of you. Glad you debunked yourself though. I always enjoy that. And you&#39;re quite good at it!</p>

<p>The American Society of Safety Engineers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Three underground floors had been used as a
parking garage with a total capacity of 2,000 cars. 
Assuming (conservatively) the garage to be half-full,
with the cars’ fuel tanks being anywhere from near
empty to full, the explosive potential was extraordi-
nary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Several thousand automobiles? The capacity was 2,000. And a &quot;conservative&quot; estimate would put the number at 1,000.</p>

<p>sev·er·al
sev(ə)rəl/
determiner &amp; pronoun
determiner: several; pronoun: several</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>more than two</strong> but not many.</li>
</ol>

<p>Not to mention the factor of the full/emptiness of the tanks. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Final status: The cars were eventually located
and removed. Some had exploded and were completely
burned-out <strong>while others were in pristine, drivable condition.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So....not even all of the conservative estimate. </p>

<p>The American Society of Safety Engineers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>72,000 gallons of diesel fuel were stored in a tank (on basement level 7) for
the WTC complex backup generator/power sys-
tems. <strong>Final status: The tank was eventually located and inspected. Although slightly damaged, no leaks were found. The fuel was removed.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And of course, none of this matters anyway since (despite your attempts at deception) we now know that this is all in reference to fires &quot;that persisted from September 11 through <strong>December 20, 2001.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Like I said - there&#39;s a reason you aren&#39;t published. </p>

<p>Oh I do love when you attack your own sources! But don&#39;t blame me. Blame your own source. As the fuel oil fires mentioned in your own source are in reference to &quot;fires that persisted from September 11 through December 20, 2001.&quot;</p>

<p>Looks like that date is pretty accurate indeed. And you certainly don&#39;t get February for your <strong>&quot;small&quot;</strong> hot spots.

<p>Were all the hot spots out by February? I haven&#39;t seen anything indicating that. </p>

<p>If there were still pools of unignited fuel in February, and still hot spots in February, that&#39;s all that&#39;s needed. No evidence at all that all of the fuel was burned up by then, and no evidence that the hot spots were out. </p>

<p>Who says you need the original number? I never said anything to that effect. A pool of a hundred litres would create quite the flare up. You don&#39;t need anywhere near a million litres to create a split second voc spike (which is all a grab sample represents). </p>

<p>I&#39;m snipping the rest of your longwinded response on the vehicles and diesel in WTC 7 because it doesn&#39;t address the 900 thousand litres of heating oil and transformer oil in the twin towers.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s full of holes and mistakes. Massive ones. It claims that nearly all of the debris at Ground Zero had been cleared by February of 2002 when in fact it was only 2/3rds cleared, with at least 500 thousand tons still remaining onsite. It claims that the peak Benzene level at the Plastimet fire was 26ppb when in fact it was 250ppb. It doesn&#39;t even consider the million litres of fossil fuel in WTC1 and 2 as potential sources of combustion, by its own admission.</p>

<p><em>&quot;The only fuel oil source suggested by Cahill and his team was under WTC building 7, across the street from the towers (Cahill et al. 2004). But it should be noted that government investigators have suggested that the fuel oil in question was burned to create the fires that caused WTC building 7 to collapse. If one assumes they were correct, that fuel oil would no longer be available as the source of vanadium and nickel more than 1 month later.&quot;</em></p>

<p>...so they don&#39;t even bother investigating for <em>other</em> fuel oil sources at Ground Zero? </p>

<p>That my friend is a MASSIVE hole, and you know it is. Benzene and propylene are strongly indicative of burning fossil fuels, fossil fuels we <em>KNOW FOR A FACT</em> were onsite, and we now <em>KNOW FOR A FACT</em> the authors of your paper never even considered as sources of the VOC spikes by their own admission.</p>

<p>If you had (which you clearly hadn&#39;t), you&#39;d have seen that VOCs and PM weren&#39;t measured at the same locations...hell, they were BLOCKS APART! VOCs were grab samples taken from smoke plumes directly at Ground Zero, PM readings were taken blocks away from the site.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying they didn&#39;t consider the fuel sources from WTC1 and 2 when it comes to volatization of metals, but they DID consider those fuel sources for other sections of the paper???</p>

<p>I&#39;m not making inferences I can&#39;t prove. That&#39;s all you. Cahill isn&#39;t referring to VOCs there and neither are the published authors. Reaaaaaach much?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cahill is referring to fuel oil sources. Cahills fuel oil sources are the only ones the authors considered, and they don&#39;t include the fuel oil in the twin towers as part of those fuel sources, even though we know for a fact they were there.</p>

<p>So certainly <em>the authors conclusions about the volatilzation of metals is dead wrong</em>...just one more massive mistake. And by extension, if the only fuel sources they considered in their calculations were the ones specified by Cahill, then the VOCs assumption is also wrong.</p>

<p>Just like you trying to link PM taken blocks away to VOCs taken directly from smoke plumes onsite. Laughably wrong.</p>

<p>I <em>love</em> watching you cut quotes off. 9/11 - 12/19-20...Just over three months. Not four. Not five. Amazing!</p>

<p>Moar!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;By September 14, three days after the initial World Trade Center collapse, efforts at fire suppression and heavy rainfall had extinguished the immediate surface fires. <strong>From then until roughly mid-December,</strong> the collapse piles continuously emitted an acrid smoke and fume in the smoldering phase of the event.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mid-December. Not February. Got it. Thanks! I love confirmation!</p>

<p>WTC buildings....pretty general. What about them?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The presence of fuels, including diesel and electrical insulating oils</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ok</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>and combustible materials</strong> in the WTC BUILDINGS</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Need more specificity to clarify. Does he get specific? He does. Yup.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The largest energy sources available are the combustible materials present in the buildings and furnishings and a significant body of fuel, especially under WTC #7, in the form of diesel fuel for emergency electrical generators and large quantities of oil in various forms in the Consolidated Edison substation, also under WTC #7</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Best to be specfic, huh? WTC #7 is one of the WTC buildings. Correct. And combustible materials <em>were</em> &quot;in the WTC BUILDINGS...&quot;</p>

<p>Not so worried about the rest, huh? And still not linking them to the VOCs, huh?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;However, the continuing emission of these plumes, especially after the heavy rains of September 14 and the increasingly effective efforts of fire suppression in mid- and late September, are not fully understood.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course not. Not with the official story combustion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The concentrations of very fine silicon, sulfur, and many metals, as well as coarse anthropogenic metals, decreased markedly during October, probably in association with the cooling of the collapse piles.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well whadda know?! Corroboration with the peer reviewed, published paper!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. <strong>Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October.</strong> Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s why <em>they are</em> published. And you are not. </p>

<p>Tiny PM in February = VOCs are not from the official story combustion. </p>

<p>You <strong>still</strong> can&#39;t match the levels. You admit you don&#39;t even know if/how many liters <em>can</em> achieve the levels. Especially with June having higher PM levels than February. Although both are tiny. Your theory fails. Which is why you&#39;ll never be published. Looks like those PM are most likely from &quot;the pulverized WTC structures&quot; like your original source stated.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t. That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to get specific pvt. Out of all the WTCs...there was fuel and combustibles. WTC7 was the major concern to Cahill. And he debunked your February claim. </p>

<p>As far as Cahill goes, here is the passage from your paper. Tell me, is this an accurate representation of what Cahill says? </p>

<p>(I&#39;ll even highlight the key bit for you) </p>

<p>&quot;<strong>The only fuel oil source suggested by Cahill and his team was under WTC building 7</strong>, across the street from the towers (Cahill et al. 2004). But it should be noted that government investigators have suggested that the fuel oil in question was burned to create the fires that caused WTC building 7 to collapse. If one assumes they were correct, that fuel oil would no longer be available as the source of vanadium and nickel more than 1 month later.&quot;</p>

<p>No, just asking follow up questions on your theories. See, you say so much stupid shit, I&#39;m hoping that by asking you follow up questions, you&#39;ll see how stupid some of it actually is. I try the same trick with my elementary school aged children.</p>

<p>Like your stubborn insistence that all of the fires at Ground Zero were extinguished by December, not for a second realizing that you too need those same fires to ignite the unreacted thermite in order to make it a viable explanation for the VOCs.</p>

<p>If the fires were completely extinguished as you vociferously argued, then your thermite explanation goes out the window.</p>

<p>Too bad, so sad, bye bye.</p>

<p>As far as Cahill goes, let&#39;s dumb this down a little further for the slack jawed yokel in the room. Here is what Cahill says:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;The presence of fuels, including diesel and electrical insulating oils and combustible materials in the <strong>WTC BUILDINGS</strong>...&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>The largest energy sources available are the combustible materials present in the buildings and furnishings and a significant body of fuel, especially under WTC #7, in the form of diesel fuel for emergency electrical generators and large quantities of oil in various forms in the Consolidated Edison substation, also under WTC #7</p></li>
</ul>

<p>and here is what your paper paraphrases that into...</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;The only fuel oil source suggested by Cahill and his team was under WTC building 7&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Nowhere does Cahill say that fuel oil was ONLY present in WTC 7, just that it was especially present in WTC 7.</p>

<p>So the authors of your paper dishonestly misquoted yet another source.</p>

<p>So where&#39;s the major fuel oil?</p>

<p>That was fun! Glad you broke it down for yourself. </p>

<p>You still can&#39;t place the VOCs on the correct dates.</p>

<p>You still don&#39;t have the matching PM</p>

<p>You still can&#39;t even prove the fuel oils produce the VOC levels.</p>

<p>And you still have higher PM on dates after Feb 9th. </p>

<p>You still have an unpublished, failed theory.</p>

<p>You still &quot;don&#39;t have a clue&quot;</p>

<p>I really want you to refute the peer reviewed, published paper with a peer reviewed, published paper. As is required. You couldn&#39;t support those other ones either. If I recall correctly, I picked <em>one</em> and you refused. But let&#39;s stay <em>on</em> topic, shall we? Those other papers are not refutations of this one. You should know. You <del>lied about reading</del> read &quot;the vast majority&quot; of them.</p>

<p>So, a peer reviewed, published theory is required. You came here to refute the paper. Don&#39;t get cranky because you are not a source of refutation. </p>

<p>Because you &lt; important. </p>

<p>Still no official story combustion available for the VOC spikes. </p>

<p>Still no peer reviewed, published refutation</p>

<p>Still more begging.</p>

<p>Still waiting...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. Not asking you to prove a negative. Asking you to scientifically account for the VOCs using the available combustion within the official story. And you can&#39;t do it. Because fire/jet fuel only accounts for around 30ppb. As is shown in the <strong>peer reviewed, published paper.</strong> And you need 610,000ppb. </p>

<p>Peer reviewed, published science is not asinine. And I didn&#39;t give you a peer reviewed, published paper about Obama. Your comparison doesn&#39;t work.

So I guess we shattered all of newtons laws that morning huh! Now 10% of a building can absolutely pulverize the 90% of steel and concrete below it and turn it into a smoldering lava pit that stays hot for months. And, for the first time in history, three steel skyscrapers collapsed due to fire. I guess we should have rewritten some safety codes, huh? And fired some people, right? Oh, wait. Funny story, the engineers who designed the buildings actually designed it so that planes could hit it. Yeah, they said that. These buildings were monsters, with a huge steel core. I&#39;ll link an example of when a B-52 hit the Empire State Building, even worse fire. It was fine. Seriously, read what the engineers say. They say that a plane could hit it, tear off the whole side, and it would still stand. Here, ill save you the effort:
&quot;We looked at every possible thing we could think of that could happen to the buildings, even to the extent of an airplane hitting the side… Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed. [But] the building structure would still be there.&quot;

I mean, Obama I could understand, but Cheney?  Come on</p>

<p>Get back to me with those sources, sport.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t mention 9/11.  I mentioned your error re: Cheney&#39;s &quot;earnings&quot; from Iraq via stake in Haliburton.  </p>

<p>I tell you one thing tho, and I think you&#39;ll like what I found when going back to historical charts for the company.  HAL stock was verrrry low near the end of 2001.  That war was just what they needed to get their business rolling along nicely again.</p>

<p>As for the other comment, yes it was years ago....when HAL market cap was even lower, which further kills the claim.  It peaked last year, and is down heavily in the last year.</p>

<p>You seem to be fond of logical fallacies, especially appeals to authority.  Here, I can do that too here&#39;s almost 2500 professionals with degrees in engineering and architecture that can tear the NIST a new asshole, send them an email about building 7 or the pentagon engines, not to mention conservation of momentum and the towers themselves.

    <div class="md"><p>I would suggest removing the negative intonations in your conversation. You may find that your opinion may be accepted more readily or your interactions may stay a bit more civil.</p>

<p>For instance, &quot;truthers&quot; can be interpreted as a derogatory statement inferring specific traits upon a large group of individuals who don&#39;t necessarily share those attributes. It may be advisable to refrain from using that term or other words that could be considered derogatory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people are just stupid like that though. I&#39;ve literally seen people engage in fisticuffs over whose sporting team is better than the other&#39;s. </p>

<p>My issue with giant walls of text like this is that they&#39;re incredibly impersonal, often irrelevant to the specifics of whatever conversation is taking place, and they come with a certain air of smugness - either &quot;I can&#39;t be bothered to read and/or address your specific points&quot; or &quot;here&#39;s a canned response because I&#39;ve transcended the need to have this conversation.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not meaning to be rude, just, as someone who&#39;s been on the receiving end of these sorts of things in the past (not just about 9/11 either), it&#39;s not an effective means of making your case. It&#39;s pretty much the same thing, in my opinion, as a street preacher singling someone out and barking scriptures at them and telling them they&#39;re evil and going to hell. It&#39;s simply not effective in converting people, or even getting them interested in what you think or believe. </p>

<p>What I think is more effective, however, is what people like <a href="/u/Akareyon">/u/Akareyon</a> do - respectfully engage, address points and counterpoints, and carry on a conversation. I realize though that not everyone has the gumption or the patience to do this sort of thing, and that&#39;s certainly fine. </p>

<p>But pasting a wall of text like this (which is often only tangentially relevant, at best) generally only accomplishes 2 things: derailing any conversation that may be taking place (currently or potentially in the future), and turning the recipient off to any legitimate points to counter their arguments. </p>

<p>Which comparisons are those? </p>

<p>The Plastimet fire was a single floor building that was able to vent all emissions openly into the air and was fully extinguished in 3 days. That&#39;s nothing like 267 stories of collapsed office building, 1.7 million tons of rubble left smouldering for weeks. </p>

<p>Every single VOC reading in your paper was at <em>least</em> 1900 times higher than this &quot;~30 ppb&quot; figure you keep throwing out. Does that mean that <em>thermite</em> was burning uninterrupted from September to February?</p>

<p>Besides, the benzene levels in the Plastimet fire peaked at <strong>250 ppb</strong>. It seems the authors of your paper couldn&#39;t even get that part straight. </p>
