        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><ol>
<li>Does God have a name?</li>
</ol>

<p>Although God has many titles, he has only one name. In each language, it is pronounced differently. In English it is usually pronounced “Jehovah.” But some people pronounce it “Yahweh.” (Psalm 83:18)</p>

<p>God’s name has been taken out of many Bibles and replaced with the titles Lord or God. But when the Bible was written, it contained God’s name some 7,000 times. Jesus made God’s name known when he taught people about God. (John 17:26)</p>

<ol>
<li>What is God like?</li>
</ol>

<p>Jehovah is love. He cares about us all deeply and wishes that not one of us take the path of destruction. (Peter 3:9) We can discern God’s personality from the things he has created and the emotions we possess. For instance, the variety of fruits, flowers and animals, the beautiful landscapes and the warm sun that accompanies them. Joyful tears, love, kindness, compassion etc etc tells us of his love and wisdom. The size of the universe tells us of his power. (Romans 1:20) Jehovah knows us better than we know ourselves. He knows exactly how many hairs we have on our head. (Luke 12:7)</p>

<p>Jehovah creates rules not for his own benefit, but for ours. If we follow the rules outlined in the Bible. It helps to prevent us from experiencing pain and darkness. He allowed his most beloved son Jesus Christ to die for us.. That should tell us how much Jehovah loves us.</p>

<ol>
<li>How can we draw closer to God?</li>
</ol>

<p>In-order to draw close to the creator of the universe. We need to try and show Love, Honour, Dignity, Loyalty, Humility, Integrity, and most importantly help out your fellow humans.</p>

<p>Jehovah invites us to draw close to him by speaking to him in prayer. He is interested in us individually. (Psalm 65:2; 145:18) He is willing to forgive. He recognizes our efforts to please him, even if we sometimes fail. So despite our imperfection, we really can enjoy a close relationship with God. (Psalm 103:12-14, James 4:8)</p>

<ol>
<li>Why does Earth suffer from so much corruption?</li>
</ol>

<p>All of Jehovah’s works are perfect; he is not the author of unrighteousness; so he did not create anyone wicked. (Deut. 32:4, Ps. 5:4) The one who became Satan was originally a perfect spirit son of God. When saying that the Devil “did not stand fast in the truth,” Jesus indicated that at one time that one was “in the truth.” (John 8:44) But, as is true of all of God’s intelligent creatures, this spirit son was endowed with free will. He abused his freedom of choice, allowed feelings of self-importance to develop in his heart, began to crave worship that belonged only to God, and so enticed Adam and Eve to listen to him rather than obey God. Thus by his course of action he made himself Satan, which means “adversary.” (Jas. 1:14, 15)</p>

<p>Why did not God destroy Satan promptly after he rebelled?</p>

<p>Serious issues were raised by Satan: (1) The righteousness and rightfulness of Jehovah’s sovereignty. Was Jehovah withholding from mankind freedom that would contribute to their happiness? Were mankind’s ability to govern their affairs successfully and their continued life truly dependent on their obedience to God? Had Jehovah been dishonest in giving a law that stated that disobedience would lead to their death? (Gen. 2:16, 17, 3:3-5) So, did Jehovah really have the right to rule? (2) The integrity of intelligent creatures toward Jehovah. By the deflection of Adam and Eve the question was raised: Did Jehovah’s servants really obey him out of love or might all of them abandon God and follow the lead being given by Satan? This latter issue was further developed by Satan in the days of Job. (Gen. 3:6, Job 1:8-11, 2:3-5 see also Luke 22:31) These issues could not be settled by merely executing the rebels.</p>

<p>So although it may seem horrible that Jehovah couldn&#39;t just destroy his enemies on the spot and prevent all this evil from befalling the planet. Jehovah had to allow it in-order to prevent any future questioning of his right to rule, and thus create a perfect paradise free from opposition or doubt. This 6000 year time period has proven without question that any attempt for humans to be peaceful and live in harmony with one another is impossible to achieve without Jehovah lovingly guiding us.</p>

<p>6000 years of pain &gt; 100,000,000,000,000 years x Infinity of awesomeness.</p>

<ol>
<li>Is the end of the world really near?</li>
</ol>

<p>THE BIBLE’S ANSWER: “When you see these things occurring, know that the kingdom of God is near.” (LUKE 21:31)</p>

<p>The Bible prophets were inspired by God to describe conditions that would indicate an imminent end of the world. Consider some of those prophecies and decide for yourself whether they are being fulfilled in our time.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Wars, famines, earthquakes, and epidemics of deadly disease. (Matthew 24:7, Luke 21:11)</p></li>
<li><p>Significant increase in crime. (Matthew 24:12)</p></li>
<li><p>The ruining of the earth by mankind. (Revelation 11:18)</p></li>
<li><p>People who love themselves, money, and pleasures but do not love God. (2 Timothy 3:2, 4)</p></li>
<li><p>The breakdown of the family. (2 Timothy 3:2, 3)</p></li>
<li><p>General apathy toward the evidence of the approaching end. (Matthew 24:37-39)</p></li>
<li><p>The preaching of the good news of God’s Kingdom worldwide. (Matthew 24:14)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As Jesus said, seeing “all these things” lets us know that the end of the world is near. (Matthew 24:33) Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that the evidence is convincing, and they share their faith with others by preaching in 236 lands.</p>

<ol>
<li>What happens at the end of the world?</li>
</ol>

<p>THE BIBLE’S ANSWER: “The world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.” (1 John 2:17)</p>

<p>“The world” that is to pass away is, not the earth, but the world of mankind whose lives are not in harmony with God’s will. Just as a surgeon might remove a cancerous tumor to save a patient’s life, God will “cut off” the wicked so that good people can truly enjoy life on earth. (Psalm 37:9) In that sense, “the end of the world” is a good thing.</p>

<p>Jesus called that future period “the renewal of all things.” At that time, he will restore humanity to the conditions that God originally intended. (Matthew 19:28) We will then enjoy:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>He will swallow up death forever, And the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces. (Isaiah 25:8)</p></li>
<li><p>A paradise earth with security and prosperity for all. (Isaiah 35:1 Micah 4:4)</p></li>
<li><p>Work that is meaningful and satisfying. (Isaiah 65:21-23)</p></li>
<li><p>The curing of all disease. (Isaiah 33:24)</p></li>
<li><p>The reversal of aging. (Job 33:25)</p></li>
<li><p>The resurrection of the dead. (John 5:28, 29)</p></li>
<li><p>Find exquisite delight in Jehovah, And he will grant you the desires of your heart. (Psalms 37:4)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Basically we will be invited to spend eternity in the coolest place imaginable free from pain, death and ageing. We’ll be granted immortality to spend having fun and relaxing under Jehovah’s loving protection.</p>

<p>And to all those who say living forever would be boring. Perhaps you’re right when you use this current world as a reference. But in Jehovah’s new world there will be everlasting content to enjoy. Jehovah’s creative abilities are infinite. </p>

<p>If we do “the will of God,” what he asks of us, we need not fear the end of the world. Instead, we can look forward to it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>

<p>We must try our best to help out our fellow humans and to love God as Jesus commanded.</p>

<p>We need to try and avoid harmful practices such as: Sexual immorality, Greed, Arrogance, Hatred, Selfishness, Anger, Jealousy etc etc</p>

<p>We must try and promote values of righteousness including: Love, Honour, Dignity, Loyalty, Humility, Integrity, and most importantly help out your fellow humans.</p>

<p>Religion, skin colour, wealth, beauty, power etc are irrelevant. Your heart is all that matters.</p>

<p>The Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses are currently the only organization on earth who are preaching the coming of Jehovah&#39;s Perfect Kingdom as Jesus instructed. They contain many key truths about life. I suggest you visit their page and have a peruse of the Bible Teachings / Answers section. It&#39;s very enlightening.. I don&#39;t want to break any rules by posting links so please Google JW bible answers if you would like to find out more.</p>

<p>Fictional characters do not &quot;allow&quot; anything. You may as well say &quot;why does Superman allow suffering?&quot;</p>

<p>Not really. Human beings have been pretty much the same for our entire existence - we use bullshit religions to create social groups that are then encouraged to abuse the &quot;other&quot; in the name of that religion.</p>

<p>I doubt that will ever change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t confuse God with being a &quot;he&quot;...or a &quot;she&quot;...or even an &quot;it&quot;, for that matter.  God is volitional energy permeating everything that exists.  There is yin and yang, light and dark.  One tends to not be able to exist without the other - at least not in the third dimensional sphere we&#39;re currently in.  As such, it seems there is always going to be a dark and a light.</p>

<p>The task is not to <em>not</em> have evil in existence, but to mitigate it and be able to deal with it as best as possible while in this dimension.</p>

<p>Additionally, what exactly is light and what exactly is dark can tend to depend upon a lot of relativistic things.  Light and dark might be on opposite ends of the spectrum, but they&#39;re still both on the <em>same spectrum</em> - and there is a nearly limitless myriad of gradations between the light and the dark, both being infused with each other to different extents depending upon where you fall on that spectrum.</p>

<p>We humans are very, <em>very</em> ignorant babes, and there is significantly more that we don&#39;t know with regard to how things work than there is that we do know.</p>

<p>God is an ocean of existence within which we are all tiny, tiny drops.</p>

<p>All is one - the good and the bad, the light and the dark.</p>

<p>All is one.</p>

<p>How convenient. A &quot;god&quot; that exists without existing. Rather than admit there is no god, you instead choose to call everything god.</p>

<p>The result is the same. There is no &quot;god&quot;, it <em>can&#39;t</em> &quot;love you&quot;, it <em>can&#39;t</em> punish you. It can&#39;t do <em>anything</em>... It may as well <em>not</em> exist.</p>

<p>If you think permeating energy does’t exist, then you don’t know what “existence” means in the first place.  At all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rather than admit there is no god, you instead choose to call everything god.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  You’re just ignorant.  Seriously.  I don’t say this as a put down or in any aggressive way.  You’re just ignorant - i.e. “do not know”/are not aware of how intelligent energy works.  In your case, your ignorance is also turning into hubris, however - i.e. thinking that the little you know is the way things actually are…which is <em>really</em> bad.</p>

<p>Your thinking that you can’t be “loved” or “punished” by volitional energy means, again, that you don’t understand how volitional energy works.  Don&#39;t ever confuse your ignorance as any sort of causal factor.</p>

<p>No, I think the &quot;permeating energy&quot; that you claim is some sort of god doesn&#39;t exist,</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m just not stupid enough to believe that there is such a thing as &quot;intelligent energy&quot;. That shit only exists in acid trips and the minds of fools.</p>

<p>Then not only do you not know what permeating energy is, but you also don’t know what God is.  It’s not the fault of the phenomenon that you know not how to properly describe it.  That’s a failing in your own understanding.  Nothing else.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Correct.  And?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only thing that ever stops evil is the efforts of real people doing real things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s laughably incorrect - especially since “light” and “dark” (what you call “good” and “evil”) are forces that human beings are most definitely <em>not</em> the only purveyors of.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No one ever prayed a dictator away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your ignorance of what’s even being talked about here is very, very deep.  What’s worse is that you don’t even know that you’re as ignorant as you are.  No one’s talking about any sort of “praying”, little one.</p>

<p>No. You’re just ignorant.</p>

<p>Nope. I just don&#39;t make up bullshit to hold onto the stupid notion that a vast universe gives a flying fuck what any or even all of us do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>lol.  Nope.  You’re ignorant.  Your every word illustrates that there are huge swaths of consideration your mind doesn’t even know exist or is even aware of, let alone actually grasp.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, I&#39;m just not stupid enough to believe that there is such a thing as &quot;intelligent energy&quot;.</p>

<p>Yep.  You’re pretty stupid.  It’s sad that you don’t understand it, but you are.  Oh well.</p>

<p>Calm down, little buddy.  I understand that there is some deep seeded animosity going on with you.  That much is obvious.  It matters not that you have the angst that you have.  Intelligent volitional energy has already proven its existence.  It matters not that you don’t understand it.  It matters not that you might not be aware of gravity or how it works, for example.  It still exists.  Same with volitional energy.</p>

<p>Go back to sleep, little one.  It’ll be okay.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as either, so no one <em>knows</em> what they are. They simply make up bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You can&#39;t describe something that doesn&#39;t exist. You can <em>imagine</em> it, but that isn&#39;t the same thing. There is <em>no</em> phenomenon. You&#39;re just making up bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>And those are the only &quot;pervading energies&quot; that exist. Period.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That’s laughably incorrect - especially since “light” and “dark” (what you call “good” and “evil”) are forces that human beings are most definitely not the only purveyors of.</p>

<p>Bullshit. We invented the concept of good and evil. And funnily enough their definitions have changed many times over the course of human history.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t long ago that murdering millions of unbelievers was considered good. Now it&#39;s considered evil. Funny how good and evil are in the eyes of the beholder rather than actual objective truths.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your ignorance of what’s even being talked about here is very, very deep. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you keep saying. I admit, I am totally ignorant of the bullshit &quot;god&quot; you have invented to make yourself feel better. It&#39;s not an objective truth either so there is no way for me to even tell if it exists, until you try to convince me your stupid ideas are real.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yep. You’re pretty stupid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not the one that believes in fantasies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Calm down, little buddy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m perfectly calm. I&#39;m not the one crying about their precious fantasies being laughed off.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I understand that there is some deep seeded animosity going on with you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure... did you learn that in Psychology 101? Why don&#39;t you save your diagnoses for people that give a shit what you think?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Intelligent volitional energy has already proven its existence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit. The complete opposite is true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It matters not that you might not be aware of gravity or how it works, for example. It still exists. Same with volitional energy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can show you a simple experiment that proves gravity is real, whether you believe in gravity or not. Try doing that with your &quot;volitional energy&quot; bullshit.</p>

<p>It should be easy, right? I should not be able to prove your experiment doesn&#39;t work... right?</p>

<p>So, oh wise one.. put up or shut up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Go back to sleep, little one. It’ll be okay.</p>

<p>Pathetic. I&#39;ve heard better insults from 5 year old children. Try harder.</p>
