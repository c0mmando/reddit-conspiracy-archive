       I have been a long time lurker on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , wanting to learn about the perversion and corruption of governments and oppression on their own people. However, I am surprised to see little discussion on the oppression of animals by factory farms, which represents, in my opinion, one of the most hidden conspiracies on our planet. In this post, I would like to expose you to the torture and suffering that farm animals encounter on a daily basis, the terrible environmental impacts of factory farming and health risks associated with the regular consumption of meat.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Animals are objectified as a commodity
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that
       <a href="http://awfw.org/factory-farms/">
        90 billion farm animals
       </a>
       die each year to satisfy the world's increasing demand in meat and diary products? Farm animals are raised in confined and inadequate stalls, where they have high risks of developing infections, wounds and atrophy of their muscles due to the lack of exercise. In
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArL5YjaL5U">
        Lucent
       </a>
       , a documentary mainly about pig farming in Australia, it is said that sows are usually killed at the age of two years old due to their deteriorating health condition. Pigs normally live up to 20 years old. Their meat is commercialized regardless of the potential infections they could have. Another documentary, called
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_ZMiYy_OQ">
        Earthlings
       </a>
       , exposes how farm animals are mistreated during their whole lives, from their birth to their slaughtering. For example, male chicks are crushed alive shortly after their birth and the beaks of the remaining chicks are slightly cut so as to prevent them to hurt each other in their confined environment. Earthlings also shows footage of different types of slaughtering practices : halal, kosher and “conventional”. Independently of slaughtering practices, animals suffer tremendously. The halal practices are particularly barbaric because it requires that the animal dies from losing all its blood. As critical thinkers, I find it inconceivable that we allow ourselves to be insensitive to the pain felt by these animals. Animals are sentient beings and that has been extensively demonstrated in scientific studies. In scientific studies, mice are used as models of autism, depression and anxiety (If you are interested, I could elaborate more on that topic, having a scientific background). If we can use animals as scientific models to understand human thought and experience, how can we say, on the other hand, that it is morally acceptable to let go the intrinsic values of animals in factory farming practices?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Factory farming is an environmental disaster
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that factory farming accounts for 32,000 million tons of CO2 per year, or
       <a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/node/6294">
        51%
       </a>
       of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions? In light of this statistic, is it surprising to see that leaders at the COP21 summit have not adopted resolutions intended to reform factory farming practices.
In the
       <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09.pdf">
        Paris Agreement text
       </a>
       , one of the resolutions is to “[recognize] the fundamental priority of safeguarding food security and ending hunger”. If the consumption of meat was drastically reduced, more land would be available for growing vegetables and legumes to end hunger. In this context, the COP21 summit seems highly biased at not addressing the issues related to meat consumption. For more information about the environmental impacts of factory farming, I suggest you watch the
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRQ3Nmnu9yw">
        Cowspiracy
       </a>
       documentary.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Meat consumption leads to various illnesses
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of
       <a href="https://www.organicconsumers.org/news/were-eating-less-meat%E2%80%94-using-more-antibiotics-farms-ever">
        antibiotics
       </a>
       administered to farm animals in the US is on the rise and contributes to the increase in antibiotic-resistant pathogens that kill thousands of people every year. In addition, growth hormones are being given to livestock and cows also receive sexual hormones. These hormones could have developmental effects in children. Growth hormones could also favour the progression of
       <a href="http://www.buzzle.com/articles/hormones-in-food.html">
        cancer
       </a>
       . A vegan diet, on the other hand, is more beneficial for health since it implies a reduction of fat and protein intake. The following website lists
       <a href="http://www.nursingdegree.net/blog/19/57-health-benefits-of-going-vegan/">
        57 health benefits of adopting a plant-based diet
       </a>
       . In addition, the Standard American Diet encourages a protein consumption that is too high for our physiological needs. The human body is best suited for the digestion of carbohydrates: for example, their digestion begins with the amylase found in the saliva and continues in the intestines with the pancreatic amylase. Proteins, on the other hand, require the activity of several proteases that act in the stomach and intestines. In opposition to carbohydrates, the digestion of protein produces ammonia and urea, which must be treated and excreted by the kidney, because they contain nitrogen. Carbohydrates, on the other hand, merely contain carbon and oxygen atoms and thus do not produce toxic byproducts. If we look at fruit, vegetables and grains, some of them contain molecules that regulate insulin resistance, such as
       <a href="http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&amp;dbid=54">
        oats
       </a>
       . An adequate modulation of insulin resistance leads to a better control of blood glucose levels and fat formation and retention. Such compounds do not exist in meat.
      </p>
      <p>
       To conclude, animal suffering in factory farms is widespread and as rational beings, it is our moral duty to condemn this oppression. By adopting a plant-based diet, you drastically reduce your carbon footprint and by eating plenty of vegetables and fruit, you will see positive changes in your health and your life.

       People fail to understand how much agriculture effects culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       People on this sub and elsewhere complain how stupid people are all the time. The "stupidity" is completely traceable to diets high in sugar and processed foods. Considering insulin was used as shock treatment (and still is), filling your body with refined sugars is a form of self-abuse that affects and impairs cognitive function.

       I don't think it's a metaphor anymore, I think high amounts of many sugars (fructose, sucrose, dextrose, maltose) act as a poison in the body just as ethanol does.  It's how my body reacts to them, anyway.

       The barbaric cruel treatment of animals happens because people are full of cruelty and lack compassion. The consumption of cruelly treated animals transfers the energy into the body. It's a cycle that gets worse through time. A vicious downward spiral. The more sick meat that is consumed the sicker the society becomes. You are what you eat. We are dosing ourselves with our own medicine of darkness. By their fruits you will know them.

       This may literally be true given that animals that are under prolonged or extreme stress before slaughter have flesh that is flooded with cytokines, among other nasty things.  Animals raised to live better end up tasting leaps and bounds better than their factory comrades.

       Humans didn't thrive on earth by not eating meat.

      <p>
       But, all those foods were drastically different from what we eat today. Our diets and foods have become so atrociously poor, and with no exercise involved in obtaining our food, it's not shocking to find that modern foods cause health problems.

       Humans need a variety of foods to be healthy. There are situations in which this means having to eat meat, but now we have supermarkets and easy access to vegetables, nuts and beans so we don't need animal products anymore.

       Unless you feel like we've evolved passed eating meat, it has always been part of our diets. Definitely not in the way we consume meat nowadays.

      <p>
       I'm not really qualified to debate our diets further as I have limited knowledge in that area.

       If we were meant to be vegetarians we'll get there eventually, evolutionary speaking. Otherwise we'll either adapt to lower quality foods, or continue dying of heart attacks.

       I don't think it's interesting to debate what is natural for humans to do. We've always have had strict gender roles and we died from infections until recently. Should we have ignored the penicillin and kept repressing women because those things are natural? Of course not. What is natural isn't always what's desirable, and it certainly isn't something to base your morals on. What we do know is that all the major dietetics and health organizations in the world agree that vegan and vegetarian diets are just as healthy as omnivorous diets, animal products are just for taste. Here are links to what some of those organizations have to say on the subject:

       You do not acknowledge that penicillin's efficacy is now close to zero as are many of its derivatives.  Also society's concept of female and male equality is explicitly inegalitarian.  Neither of the issues you've referenced have been resolved.

       Vegan diets are all lacking B12.  They are not a viable replacement for a healthy diet that includes animals products that are not necessarily meat.  However, even milk and eggs contain only small amounts of this molecule that is vital for proper neuronal function.

       You're missing my point. Dying of infections is natural, curing them in a hospital is not. However when we have an infection we go to the doctor instead of waiting for evolution to fix it. There is nothing noble about doing what's natural if there is a better, unnatural choice available. 'We're natural omnivores' isn't a good argument to keep eating animal products.

       B12 supplements are vegan, and every vegan should take those. This is perfectly healthy. Bio-availability of B12 from supplements is the same as from animal products. People over 50 are even recommended to use supplements as their main source of B12 as well (

       Once could argue that humans thriving is a problem, therefore you may be unwittingly making a point that meat powers a fucked up overpopulated world where people will easily kill another by pressing a button, because they were told to, in order to steal their resources that were made scarce to begin with, by the success of technology that originally only enabled easier meat eating.

       I am finding that black beans soaked overnight, rinsed and then put in a crock pot of 5 hours on high is a much more satisfying meal than any steak. Mind you I have eaten many steaks in my life, but am completely satisfied now with beans. This is not my normal M.O. but something in my gut, my intuition, tells me that it is time to either buy local meat from a farm (that I know for a fact is local meat) or not eat meat at all. This is intuitive, if you listen to yourself, you will hear this.

       There's a lot of money behind animal agriculture. The documentary Cowspiracy is a must watch. When we are so far removed from the process of raising animals and processing them into food stuff, we can justify the commodification of feeling, intelligent life. If we shifted towards insect protein it would be better for the environment and I think it is morally less reprehensible.

       I became vegetarian 2 yrs ago for this reason and for my own health.  I think it is more healthful, and certainly has more heart and integrity.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is something everyone should know about switching to vegetarian diets and it's a big thing. There is a
       <a href="http://chriskresser.com/what-everyone-especially-vegetarians-should-know-about-b12-deficiency/">
        problem with not getting enough B12 in a vegetarian diet
       </a>
       .  Try to find enough

        B12 in a vegetarian diet.
       </a>
       -- can't be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       arguing against it, but if you switch you must take B12 supplement, otherwise you'll run into real medical trouble.  I had severe anemia (b12's needed to absorb iron) last year from not paying attention to the B12 thing....and it caused me to hallucinate and become very paranoid.  I was almost hospitalized until I figured out what was happening.  I reversed all the high weirdness around me by chewing up several B12 supplements, although if we had a better healthcare system I'd just have asked for a b12 injection and that would be that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a chronic illness that contributes to a B12 deficiency at an even higher rate than normal, so a regular person would not have the issues I had quite so quickly.  If the world collapsed though, vegetarians would have no choice but to supplement with meat.

       The other issue is a lack of carnosine, a dipeptide that's only found in meat.  The problem with trying to supplement for this is that it gets excreted too fast and the supplements provide too little.
      </p>
      <p>
       But probably my biggest problem with being a vegetarian (and I was one for a while) is that soy simply has no nutritional value.
       <strong>
        All soy
       </strong>
       is heavily processed by default since it's toxic in its natural form, and almost 100% of soy in the US is GMO.

       Good call on the carnosine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding soy: soy is also kind of gross.  Tastes gross and makes nonvegetarians fart.  I soaked and cooked just soybeans and thought they tasted absolutely awful compared to regular Phaseolus beans (nearly all other pinto/kidney style beans).  When you learn how to make beans from scratch in a pressure canner, you discover that food industry has lied to you all this time and convinced you that beans were lifeless and gross, when they are actually amazing, esp cranberry beans.  The key is 1 tbs brown sugar and 1 bay leaf per qt of canned beans and before that to soak them overnight in just water, drain and replace water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steamed edamame are good though--that's about all I can take.  And the morningstar products, esp the buffalo chicken and the grillers originals.  They are amazing for fake meat foods; everything else is terrible imo.  Actual vegetables are better and better for you anyway than that processed garbage.

       Vitro meat is on it's way. Perhaps in 25 years the meat will taste better than conventional meat.

       There's wild hogs who're an invasive species who out number hunters. There are catfish who're also an invasive species.

      <p>
       Death by a bullet is a less painful method  of slaughter than what factory slaughter houses use. Hunters don't want to track down a animal who has ran off,so bullets that are designed for hunting are designed to kill swiftly.

       Society would be better off if families had their own cows,and these cows would live on open range farms that are  a a co-op. Instead of a cow being sent to a slaughter house,farmers would use a hunting rifle to deliver a quick and humane death.

       cruelty to animals should not be allowed. i'm gonna assume that in the past, before animals were injected with antibiotics &amp; other chemicals (&amp; before corp. farms), meat wasn't harmful to health.
      </p>
      <p>
       imo, there could be a 'better way', corp. farming is not it. i'm not anti vegan, as i'm eating way less red meat. i don't think it's possible to "persuade" people to stop eating meat, but maybe if it's possible to change
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       people eat. i like to think if more people demanded organically grown produce, that would be a good start.

       This is why we need to embrace and plant more hemp and weed. It's the only plant capable of sustaining the planet that provides complete sources of protein and fatty acids. It's the natural solution to meet everyone's nutritional needs, and it's one of the few plants that a human being can survive on entirely. It will reduce our dependence on the meat industry for meat as well as heal the environment, as the plant itself is capable of purifying the air and soil.

       There is nothing wrong with eating animals and I will to continue to do so however eating animals that where mistreated and are laced with infection is certainly dangerous and morally bad. The issue is factory farming, the solution doesn't lie in avoiding all meats but rather purchasing or hunting animals in the wild that have been treated in a humane manner.

       The issue with that is that there isn't enough wildlife to sustain the population at the rate they are consuming animal products. Hunting is preferable over buying meat in the store and always will be, but not everyone can live like that.

       They do in a way, I'm not arguing that they feel pain or it's comparable to animal suffering. It has been proven though, that when plants are harmed they release chemical pheromones signaling to nearby plants to ramp up defenses or to send help through root networks.

       That's right. Why do people think living things are not worthy of respect and compassion. All living things have life. They are just as much alive as you or I are. Be it a virus, a blade of grass, an ant or mold. They are all living beings. Life is the miracle. Life is what ties us all together, through the boundaries of the species or forms. We share life here on earth.

       Nature is brutal, and this is about as humane as you can go. What's your suggestion for killing them in a better way? (Not killing them is not an answer, as people are going to eat meat whether you agree with it as a choice or not)

       Animals in nature rape, fight each other for power and enforce strict gender roles. Unnatural things include vaccines, schools, and the internet. What is natural isn't always what is desirable and it's certainly not something to base your morals on. A vegan diet is just as healthy as an omnivore diet, animal products are just for taste. So we don't need to be using and killing animals at all.

       I understand your view point on the morality of the situation.  But that really avoided the question I asked:  "what is a better/more humane way to kill animals for food"
      </p>
      <p>
       I can guarantee you with absolute certainty that you will not see the end of meat consumption by humans in our lifetime, which is why I added that "not killing is not an answer" it's just not going to happen. It's like saying people will stop using oil tomorrow. Great dream but incredibly hard to transition into. So while that is a fine stance and I can respect NOT wanting to use animals in this way,  how do we best manage these animal's care in the meantime?

       I understand that people don't go vegan tomorrow, but neither will they implement a new, humane way of killing if we came up with one. Everyone can choose for themselves to live a more peaceful lifestyle but only a handful of people can make changes to the way we treat animals. That's why I think promoting a plant based diet will do more good than thinking about the way we kill animals.

       You could also just not eat meat. Not killing them

       You're right.  YOU can choose not to, just like I can choose to. You can't force an ideology on people, what you're asking is similar to getting people to drop their religion or for everyone in the world to quit using oil because you don't agree with it.  It's a fantasy.. and it WILL NOT happen in our lifetime, more likely ever. So since I live and think in the real world that exists today, I was responding to the poster who claimed that we don't try to diminish the suffering of animals when they are killed, and I think that's absolutely false. My question was "how do you think it(suffering) could be diminished further?" There's been tons of work into how animals are handled, killed, and processed. It's not perfect and I understand that, but it gets better all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while your answer is noble and makes sense to you, you have to understand that this is how things are, your response gets no one anywhere unless you can convince every human on earth not to eat meat.

       The answer to how could it be diminished further is to stop eating meat. It's happening every day, and there are more and more vegans everyday. Plenty of documentaries are out exposing the environmental and ethical impact of the meat industry. People are making the change a step at a time, and ignoring it and saying "well
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       isn't so why bother until everyone does?" is the opposite of progress. My answer isn't noble, and neither is my cause, it just is logical.

       You're assuming that because there's a growth in vegans that eventually everyone will become one? That's quite the stretch.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you state that my argument is the opposite of progress when it applies to 97% of the population? Even if we assume you are correct in saying eventually everyone will convert, you aren't addressing the fact that a smaller volume of animals will still be processed in the same way until that happens. So we should not improve those conditions in the meantime? THAT seems like the opposite of progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like if I tasked you with finding better fuel economy in vehicles, but since you don't like them your answer is "well, don't drive then" and we keep the shitty cars until hopefully 97% of people agree, instead of working to improve future vehicles.  It's a  strange argument.

       The argument isn't don't do anything until people convert, the argument is if you want to help improve their conditions don't eat meat. That is actively reducing the amount of demand on the industry, and vegan activism is improving awareness to the meat industries cruelty which is waking more people up to it. You can't humanely slaughter something raised only for consumption. You are making a life a commodity.

       Ok, I stop eating meat and now 999,999 animals are slaughtered instead of 1 million. That doesn't improve conditions, that's just less volume in the same conditions. By that logic, YOU personally have improved conditions in some factory by not eating meat. But really you didn't have any impact other than financially.  they just project for 1 less animal to be raised. That animal doesn't get to just run free since you didn't buy the meat, it just never exists. Conditions are the same.

       Killing is killing. Quick, slow, bloody, or clean, you are ending the life of a living thing. I know if I don't eat other living things, I will die myself. So I don't pretend I am Jesus Christ reborn trying to save all living things. Life feeds on life, it's nothing to cry about.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are sad about killing things in order to live, you should kill yourself and allow everything else to go on living and dying without you.

       Have you considered that perhaps it is better to die then live in the hell that we created for ourselves? In order for you to live  something else must die. In order to please yourself someone else must suffer. And you are okay with that?

       Yes I am ok with that. I didn't choose this, I did not create this world, I was born into it. Why do I have to die so that you can feel good about your own life? Why are you still alive if you feel that your life brings death and suffering to others? Are you a sadist? Or just a hypocrite?

       Animals don't need to eat grain. We feed them grains to fatten them up. Many animals would be happy eating grass, but that doesn't fatten them up fast enough. Meat is sustainable. The meat industry as it is today is not. Now do you see the agenda hidden in your goofy statement?

       No, I don't. If you have access to grass-fed beef go on ahead, but that's not what is sold in supermarkets. You can't say "well sometimes meat is sustainable, therefore it's ok to let everyone buy cheap beef from walmart".
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is no attempt to regulate the meat industry to
       <em>
        make
       </em>
       it sustainable, then overall we're better off without meat. Either reform, or no meat. But "it could theoretically work so let's just not worry" is not a good solution when there is nothing to stop factory farms pumping cows full of grains and antibiotics and people don't even care.

       Here's your "logic":"Schools are failing to produce enough students who are ready for college or full time employment. We should get rid of schools, they aren't working."

       We don't have to get rid of meat, we only have to get rid of the unsustainable ways to produce it. If people aren't willing to stop producing meat in unsustainable ways, then we're better off not eating meat vs eating unsustainable meat and pretending everything is fine.
       <em>
        To me, at this point in time
       </em>
       , it appears that people are not willing to care about food production standards, so going after that is a waste of time in comparison to going after meat consumption as a whole. I don't know how to make that more clear.

       You could try being clear from the start. That would have made your point better understood. Had you said "the meat industry is not sustainable" I would have agreed with you. But you wanted to make a bigger, bolder statement, that meat itself is unsustainable (which is wrong).

       Farmed animals eat plants to produce the meat. It's an very ineffective way to produce food if you have to feed something 10+ pounds of food to produce 1 pound of edible meat. That's wasteful and even if vegetables could feel pain, it would be better to eat them directly to cause less suffering.

      <p>
       Dogs Have a Natural
and Undeniable Carnivorous Bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       From DNA studies, we know dogs evolved directly from the timber wolf somewhere around 15,000 years ago1.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, of course, it should come as no surprise. Wolves are clearly carnivores.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, by their very genetic pedigree, dogs also demonstrate similar and noticeable carnivorous traits. Their teeth, their digestive systems and their behavior clearly confirm this fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet dogs must also be recognized for their significant omnivorous ability. Their proven ability to digest carbohydrate-based foods has been known for many years.
      </p>
      <p>
       After all, modern genetic research has proof that ten canine genes play key roles in starch digestion and fat metabolism.2
      </p>
      <p>
       However, a dog still shows unmistakable evidence that its body is optimized for eating meat.

       Just because they can digest vegetarian meals doesn't mean they prefer them.

       Give a dog a celery stick and and a bully stick and see which one 99% of dogs prefer.

       Veganism has nothing to do with starving yourself of vital nutrients. It has everything to do with an egotistical belief that you are better than everyone else merely because of the molecules you shove down your food hole. I can tell you without a doubt that the food you are withholding is going to be your downfall. Joint pain, sterility, slow metabolism, lower body temperature, hair loss, severe muscular and skeletal deficiencies–not to mention the mental and emotional problems that will arise as a result. Upton Sinclair, author of The Jungle, had to abandon veganism because his mind and body were not able to function on a diet of mere fruits, vegetables, juice, nuts, and seeds. Gandhi, once a proud supporter of the vegan movement, declared their ideas were fraudulent, stating, “No wonder that mortality figures are on the increase and there is a lack of energy in the people. It would appear as if man is really unable to sustain life without either meat or milk products. Anyone who deceives people in this regard or countenances the fraud is an enemy of India.”

       Cows and pigs are basically as smart as dogs (especially pigs). Would you support subjecting billions of dogs to those very same "living" conditions (i.e. factory farming)?

       Factory farming is awful, wasteful and quite literally a holocaust. Eat meat to your hearts content but don't act like the primary method for delivering it to your table wont likely kill all of us through pollution or disease.

       All that shit that is produced is spread on the fields which then helps grow the plants and grains you eat. We have muskeg bogs up here in Canada that produce more Co2 then all the cattle herds, what should we do about them? I haul logs to a mill and guess where all that chemical laden sludge ends up?

       Have you considered that perhaps it is better to die then live in the hell that we created for ourselves? In order for you to live  something else must die. In order to please yourself someone else must suffer. And you are okay with that?

       All that shit that is produced is spread on the fields which then helps grow the plants and grains you eat. We have muskeg bogs up here in Canada that produce more Co2 then all the cattle herds, what should we do about them? I haul logs to a mill and guess where all that chemical laden sludge ends up? On your precious "organic" fields. Please just be aware.

       Humans need a variety of foods to be healthy. There are situations in which this means having to eat meat, but now we have supermarkets and easy access to vegetables, nuts and beans so we don't need animal products anymore.

       I like your tone, but the "human's didnt thrive on earth by not eating meat" implies that you are sure that this is the final stage of our dietary evolution.

       I don't think it's a metaphor anymore, I think high amounts of many sugars (fructose, sucrose, dextrose, maltose) act as a poison in the body just as ethanol does.  It's how my body reacts to them, anyway.

       Once could argue that humans thriving is a problem, therefore you may be unwittingly making a point that meat powers a fucked up overpopulated world where people will easily kill another by pressing a button, because they were told to, in order to steal their resources that were made scarce to begin with, by the success of technology that originally only enabled easier meat eating.

       You're assuming that because there's a growth in vegans that eventually everyone will become one? That's quite the stretch.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you state that my argument is the opposite of progress when it applies to 97% of the population? Even if we assume you are correct in saying eventually everyone will convert, you aren't addressing the fact that a smaller volume of animals will still be processed in the same way until that happens. So we should not improve those conditions in the meantime? THAT seems like the opposite of progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like if I tasked you with finding better fuel economy in vehicles, but since you don't like them your answer is "well, don't drive then" and we keep the shitty cars until hopefully 97% of people agree, instead of working to improve future vehicles.  It's a  strange argument.
