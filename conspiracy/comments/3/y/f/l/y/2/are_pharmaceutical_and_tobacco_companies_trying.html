       There seems to be a very large smear campaign against e-cigarettes and vaping.  Countless web pages with scare stories of formaldehyde and popcorn lung (all easily discredited and explained). Cities taxing them out of the market (Chicago) and preventing stores from opening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ecigs, batteries, tanks, juice, and all things vape related have been deemed "tobacco" by the FDA and pending regulations will force all these products to be pulled and go through a lengthy and costly approval process before it can be sold.  Forcing thousands of small companies out of business overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chicago has taxed the industry out of the market and turned a $35 bottle of juice in to $132 as they try to collect lost revenue from lost cigarette tax revenue after they taxed them out of the market years ago.  Other large cities with mayors in bed with pharm/bacco lobbyists are sure to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing that these regulations do is set up the tobacco Cigalikes for a comeback since these coming regulations seem to all benefit the failing cigalike products owned by all the big players
      </p>
      <p>
       A new billion dollar industry is putting a huge dent in smoking suppression medications and gas station ecigs produced by big tobacco that have failed miserably. The combined efforts of thousands of small businesses are hurting big pharma and tobacco and it seems like they are fighting back.

       This is the sort of thing the FDA was invented for: to 'regulate' any new thing that comes along, so that the government can wet its beak, or, if the new tech is disruptive enough, to regulate it out of existence.

       I'm coming up on 2 years without a cigarette after 19 years of smoking. Because of vaping they are scared.  Not just big tobacco. As you said, the vice lords have scared the population into allowing them to tax the shit out of tobacco. They are loosing their golden goose. All vices are used to run a racket of some form, in the current reality in which we live.

       It's possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       But consider also that it's also a new form of addiction, and hasn't been around for very long, has quickly become very popular, so of course there's going to be a lot of talk and work conducted around the health aspects of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it bad for you? Probably.
      </p>
      <p>
       As bad as cigarettes? Probably not, although that doesn't mean it's harmless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'm based in the UK, where none of these measures have had any effect whatsoever. Loads of people vape here now.

       I'll tell you hwhat though, it's about the lesser of the two evils because my as I type right now I have my vape right next to me and am currently 8 months without a cigarette which is 7 months longer than I had ever gone without one before I investigated this technology. I can smell food again, I can run up the stairs without getting bogged down and winded like an old man -- and I don't smell like shit. Oh, also no more damage to my lungs, eyes, skin, and reduced risk of cancer. Now I'm sure there are probably some negatives, but whatever they are they seriously can't be half as bad as traditional cigarettes.

       I'd agree, so I'm at a loss why people have downvoted me. I've seen two long-term smoking friends move to vaping and they seem a bit healthier.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "natural" fallacy was in strong effect though, and some people just have to get personally attached to their addictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I daresay in a few years we'll know a lot more about the possible health issues. It's obviously not going to be as good for someone as not vaping, after all. But it certainly seems a lot more healthy than cigarettes.

       Here in the US we look up to the UK whose experts are the few in the world that recognizes vaping is at least 95% safer than cigs.  When our "experts" are obviously in bed with the big players, UK is recommending people use them to quit smoking,

       Well, that's nice to know! As I've said previously I don't know 100% if vaping is without health consequences, but from what I've seen they would likely be minor compared to that of cigarette smoking.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a comparison, I'd use the metaphor that we don't need to cure AIDS, just keep extending the survivability to long enough. If we got it up to 60 years, it would have essentially no major impact any more.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the same way, if vaping was going to cause issues, but it took that long for the issue to show up, it's essentially harmless by most definitions.

       The answer is yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you research the master agreement, 46 states suspended the legal right to class action Sue tobacco manufacturers for smoking related illness in exchange for future tobacco profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's proof the government doesn't give a shit about our health and well being. They are in it for the cash.
      </p>
      <p>
       Between the government smear campaing, the government funded shills that are funded from master agreement money, and the big tobacco funded smear campaigns, vaping has no chance to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FDA will regulate, effectively knocking out all but a few non tobacco sponsored companies, keeping smokers smoking and funding all that income.

       Honestly, considering the contents of vape liquid, I'm surprised more people aren't standing up and going "Wait a fucking minute here. You want me to put WHAT in my lungs?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Contents taken from one of my own vape flavors:
      </p>
      <p>
       Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Nicotine, and flavors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Propylene Glycol.  Also known as the deadly shit in anti-freeze that kills you if you drink it.

       You realize propylene glycol isn't the shit that kills you in antifreeze right?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a medically safe humectant that has a super low freeze point ( -37) That's used to lower the freeze point of antifreeze.

       You'd think someone in the conspiracy forum would educate themselves instead of spitting back what the government machine has told you blindly like a fucking robot.

       Also known as the completely safe non toxic anti freezing agent added to toxic anti freeze to make it less toxic.

       This is like saying water is toxic because people add it to antifreeze.
