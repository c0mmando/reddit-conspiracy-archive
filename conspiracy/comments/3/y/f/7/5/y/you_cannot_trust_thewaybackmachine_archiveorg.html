        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I can prove either one of 2 things, that archive.org (&quot;The WaybackMachine&quot;) </p>

<ol>
<li>) has a deep state backdoor (and they do / don&#39;t know it)</li>
<li>) is an information gatekeeper for the establishment.</li>
</ol>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed this several times.  You find a &#39;sensitive article&#39; that you just <em>know</em> the establishment doesn&#39;t want you to read  (eg: &quot;how to build a proxyham&quot; article another one of our awesome friends here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> found and posted just yesterday) because of the implications, and it&#39;s gone.  You think, &quot;oh, that&#39;s fine, just go to waybackmachine&quot; -- archive.org and you get one of three results:</p>

<ol>
<li>) Hmm...we don&#39;t have that link archived --OR--</li>
<li>) Page cannot be crawled due to robots.txt --OR--</li>
<li>) Archived links that go to 404 / blank / not found pages</li>
</ol>

<p>Seems like this is a legit failure of archive.org to archive those pages. Yet you have bookmarked them <em>for a reason</em>--you have seen content there before.  These &#39;failures&#39; of prominent pages (it was worthy enough for you to bookmark, and you learned about it from the thousands of upvotes of the link on reddit)  are a form of <strong><em>plausible deniability for absent content</em></strong> that Archive.org has literally <em>scrubbed from the Internet</em>.</p>

<p>You may think that archive.org is some kind of politically agnostic site that works dutifully like a software machine &#39;spider&#39; that goes out and copies the internet.  That would be half wrong.  So long as information keeps &#39;disappearing&#39; then they are hypocrites or they are failing at their mission to keep a copy of the internet.  Which is it?</p>

<p>Ok so finally my proof.  It&#39;s actually bad proof in that it requires your help.  I need your memory to be evidence.  </p>

<p>I wrote this article on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3shst6/hillarys_mspaint_logo_is_by_nycs_pentagram_design/">Hillary Clinton&#39;s stupid logo being designed by a company PENTAGRAM in NYC</a> one month ago.  In it, I included links to Pentagram&#39;s work and staff.  Did any of you take a look? <strong><em>I know what I saw. I saw many pictures of their logos and a working website only one month ago</em></strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Now that website seems to be gone.  It loads a white page now for the first two links (&quot;Pentagrams work&quot; and &quot;Pentagrams art genii&quot;)</li>
<li>Ok, so I go to the wayback machine and try those links, and they load white pages, well beyond one month ago. </li>
<li>Well before that and on snapshots going back to mid 2000&#39;s there are 404s on all those pages I referenced, even though those pages have been archived as far back as 1999  ( <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.pentagram.com/#/our_works">https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.pentagram.com/#/our_works</a> ) and (<a href="http://pentagram.com/en/portfolio">http://pentagram.com/en/portfolio</a>) and (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.pentagram.com/#/partners/list">https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.pentagram.com/#/partners/list</a>).</li>
<li>And <a href="https://archive.is/s73mN">here&#39;s an <em>archive.is</em> backup of the last one</a>...note how there&#39;s a LOT of activity in december of this year, maybe because of the hillary article I wrote in November of this year??</li>
<li>Notice how several archive.org &#39;snapshots&#39; go totally blank: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151206024555/http://www.pentagram.com/#/home">https://web.archive.org/web/20151206024555/http://www.pentagram.com/#/home</a></li>
<li>Notice how Pentagram has been scrubbed from Archive.org almost entirely.  You couldn&#39;t get a list of which designers were there if you tried.</li>
</ul>

<p>Archive.org touts itself as an independent non-profit but look who they get their funding from: Alexa, an Amazon.com company.  Amazon is as establishment as you can get:  in fact, at this moment, they are running the CIA&#39;s software on their amazon elastic compute cloud, an arrangement that makes many people very uncomfortable (the integration of big business with big spying / intelligence). They are also aligned with Library of Congress (gov) and Smithsonian and are members of the American Library association-- this is about as establishment a gatekeeper as you can get.</p>

<p>I believe that Archive.org is an establishment tool to give the appearance of vanguarding information while actually doing no such thing.  By selective scrubbing and giving the appearance of software failures or caching 404s, they are able to control the spectrum of &#39;free information&#39;.  This one example of PENTAGRAM is <em>not</em> the only example by far.  I&#39;ve noticed this trend and at first I thought it was simply a mistake (see plausible deniability above), but in this case, <strong><em>I got you dead to rights mfkas</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://archive.org/about/">on their about page</a>, they attempt to aggrandize themselves as a modern day, digital <em>Library of Alexandria</em>, which--from an occult symbolic read--is really telling of who is actually running this enterprise at the topmost levels. Library of Alexandria was a gnostic library burned by christians (see film Agora or a documentary on library of alexandria).  This is more evidence of global gnostic cabal underpinnings.  And I would respond to that by saying this: the original gnostics may have been onto something with universal magic and beauty in nature, something they believed would elevate all of humanity--they hosted the recipe for <em>soma</em> and that&#39;s why it was destroyed (multiple times actually).  If you guys actually believed in original gnostic goals, you would be true to your Alexandrian aspirations and not destroy information--that&#39;s something Christians uniquely do (edit: well, and ISIS who are probably being paid by christians to destroy zoroastrian and manichean shrines in syria). Making your use of the Alexandrian library trope a complete hypocrisy--you need to clean that up.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t understand that last bit it&#39;s ok.  To most of you, the alexandria bit will be a weaksauce argument.  I understand why you don&#39;t understand.  As a person with a background in science and software engineering, I used to not have the eyes with which to see these things until I saw the pattern and started taking them seriously as &#39;things the elite believe whether you do or not&#39;.  </p>

<p>And clearly I struck a nerve with pointing these things out with Pentagram in my Hillary mspaint logo diatribe.  Sorry if this appears I&#39;m patting myself on the back with this, but you would&#39;t be wrong.  &lt;pat pat&gt;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Memory_Hole_(web_site)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Memory_Hole_(web_site)</a></p>

<p>The Memory Hole used to be a valuable website for rare/404/missing documents.</p>

<p>Then it went 404.</p>

<p>I used to cite the Wikipedia page for &quot;Strategy of Tension&quot; (part of Operation Gladio) as a link on a weekly basis.  But I never saved a copy.</p>

<p>Then it got scrubbed and re-written as &quot;Strategy of Tension was a hoax.&quot;</p>

<p>Bottom line:  If you see a news item or website that is significant, screenshot it for yourself immediately.  Archive it.  Expect it to be changed or removed or Gone Forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was recently talking about something similar to this when someone in another sub noted that some celebrity had used SEO to push some embarrassing things about him down off of any search engine. I think this would be a valuable idea for issues of more importance, too.</p>

<p>Not to come off as overly paranoid here, but I would personally doubt that a screenshot is enough. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s outside an adversary&#39;s power to wait until you&#39;re asleep, take control of your computer, replace the screenshot file with a scrubbed one, and leave you looking like a fool and doubting yourself with none the wiser. If by &quot;archive it&quot; you meant to also burn it to a non-rewritable disc &amp; hide the disc, or even print it off, then hell yes.</p>
