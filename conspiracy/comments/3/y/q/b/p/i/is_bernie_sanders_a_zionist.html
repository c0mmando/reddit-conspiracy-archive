He could talk about how USA is fascist now as defined by all the torture and spying. He can say Israel does not have a right to exist . . . I can&#39;t fit his good words on economics with saying Israel has a right to exist . . . do the rich have a right to keep stealing from us to? The logic doesn&#39;t fit.

<p>Supporting an aid bill for Ukraine.
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/28/world/europe/senate-approves-1-billion-in-aid-for-ukraine.html?_r=1">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/28/world/europe/senate-approves-1-billion-in-aid-for-ukraine.html?_r=1</a></p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The House and the Senate voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to approve a $1 billion aid package for Ukraine, but Congress’s near unanimity on its modest package of aid and sanctions on Russia masked deep divisions on what the government should do next to confront President Vladimir V. Putin.</p>

<p>The bills, which were nearly identical, passed by 399 to 19 in the House and by 98 to 2 in the Senate. President Obama has said he will sign the legislation, which includes new sanctions against Russians and Ukrainians who provided support to Russia in its annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Kosovo was a NATO operation and there was a lot of bad info flying around about genocide.  I&#39;ll need to dig deeper on this one.</p>

<p>no, i get the point:  it&#39;s all pointless (basically)</p>

<p>w/ due respect, i believe you are stuck on your point (which i do get), and missing my point -- which is: </p>

<p>&quot;so?&quot;  ...what are you going to do about it?  (vote for your penis??)</p>

<p>that doesn&#39;t sound like a solution to me, mate.  that sounds like something a defeatist/quitter would say. </p>

<p>to make a point:  if you are in prison (as we are in america), and the prison guard offers you a choice of the following food for the day:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>a pint of cow blood</p></li>
<li><p>a teaspoon of cow sperm</p></li>
</ol>

<p>... which would you choose?  (lemme guess:  your penis??)</p>

<p>ok well those are basically the words of a defeatist (by my definition).  frankly, you sound like someone who has never served in her country&#39;s service -- in which case, it&#39;s  very likely we hold different definitions &quot;defeatism&quot;.</p>

<p>The system is corrupt, which is what we need to be screaming from the roof tops and trying to change.</p>

<p>by NOT voting?</p>

<p>/and your seriously not joking?!</p>

<p>ok ok... fine.  let&#39;s assume i am on board.  cool.  and now let&#39;s assume we get enough people to not vote.  then what ?  someone still wins the official elections, right?</p>

<p>at the very least, our families (well, mine at least) fought and died for the right to vote -- when the system was so corrupt, there was no right to vote.</p>

<p>my sincere apologies, but i just don&#39;t get what you are trying to accomplish by NOT voting!!?</p>

<p>maybe more to the point, i don&#39;t get what you are trying to accomplish by trying to recruit others to not vote. (frankly, that sounds very foreign/suspicious to me.)</p>

<p>bottom line:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>if voting doesn&#39;t matter, why do candidates spend billions of dollars to win votes?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>what do you achieve by getting millions of people to not vote??  what&#39;s your end game?</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>/serious questions.  hope you don&#39;t mind responding.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>whats your take on the bush/kerry election in florida?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>thanks for asking... </p>

<p>my take is...  bush stole both 2000 and 2004 elections.</p>

<p>but thievery is only possible if the election is &quot;close&quot; - and the right elements (e.g., Jeb) need to be in place (which they often are, but not always).</p>

<p>which is why i believe it&#39;s incredibly important to vote.  when masses turn out, the potential for an impossible-to-thieve spread emerges -- as i believe occurred in 2008.  (i still believe the powers that be wanted either hillary or mccain to win in 2008 -- would really take a lot to convince me that obama was the status quo&#39;s first or even second choice. i.e., the people&#39;s choice did actually win over the status quo&#39;s top two choices.)</p>

<p>edit: yes we are fed a fixed menu one way or another... it&#39;s like airplane food.  of course it will suck -- but not always -- and your odds of relative satisfaction improve when you pre-select the dish (i.e., fucking vote!)  </p>

<p>to be clear:   <strong>voting doesn&#39;t guarantee satisfaction.  voting slightly (but absolutely) improves your odds of getting your government to spend YOUR tax dollars in a way that benefits YOU and your family the most.</strong></p>

<p>as i see it (with the above in mind):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>if you and your family would benefit from more and bigger wars in the middle east, then vote for hillary/trump.</p></li>
<li><p>if your family would benefit from free (paid for by the taxes you ALREADY pay the government -- i.e., no EXTRA cost to you) college education for your (and/or your kids), then vote for bernie sanders.</p></li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Zionism&quot; just means &quot;Jewish Nationalism.&quot;</p>

<p>So, yes, Bernie Sanders is a Jewish Nationalist, thus, he is a Zionist.</p>

<p>But Bernie Sanders ONLY support nationalism for Jewish people. He is against nationalism for European (&quot;white&quot;) people, he is against nationalism for Arab people, he is against nationalism for Japanese people, Chinese people, all African peoples, Latin American peoples.</p>

<p>He&#39;s for &quot;globalism&quot; for all those people - he supports &quot;diversity&quot; and &quot;multi-culturalism&quot; and &quot;unite one world&quot; etc.</p>

<p>But ONLY for people who aren&#39;t Jewish.</p>

<p>According to Bernie Sanders, Jews get special rights - ONLY Jewish people should be allowed to have their own nation.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because Bernie Sanders is a Jewish Supremacist.</p>

<p>He claims to be a real civil rights leader and a fighter for the poor and downtrodden, but then he&#39;ll turn around and try to use poor ethnic communities as dumping grounds for his state&#39;s nuclear waste.</p>

<p><a href="http://social-ecology.org/wp/1998/10/the-texas-vermont-maine-nuclear-dump-bringing-environmental-racism-home/">Source</a></p>

<p>He&#39;s a huge warmonger. He tries to disguise this by playing dumb about foreign policy and deflecting to climate change and his irrelevant economic stump speech whenever he&#39;s asked about it, as he knows the truth would alienate his &quot;progressive&quot; base, but his history is one of consistent cow-towing to the war lobby:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alternet.org/election-2016/bernie-sanders-troubling-history-supporting-us-military-violence-abroad">Source</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.libertyunionparty.org/?page_id=363">Source</a> </p>

<p>He promises all the &quot;glorious&quot; free handout programs of Europe, yet neglects to mention the extremely regressive taxes, the key differences in culture and population size, and the fact that none of those countries actually fund their militaries because they rely on us to fight for them (freeing up money to go towards their welfare states instead). He also leaves out the part where nationalist parties and conservative welfare reform parties are becoming more and more popular in Europe because they&#39;re finally realizing that socialism doesn&#39;t work in the long run. Even scarier than his deranged views are the Modern Monetary Theory kooks he surrounds himself with.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/7ORjJ">Source</a></p>

<p>He&#39;s an SJW. He&#39;s released a &quot;racial justice&quot; plan, but he won&#39;t release a tax plan. He&#39;s still pushing the phony and discredited wage gap myth.</p>

<p><a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/racial-justice/">Source</a></p>

<p>He has deranged ideas in general. For example: He wants to bring back illegals who were deported.</p>

<p>Supporting an aid bill for Ukraine.
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/28/world/europe/senate-approves-1-billion-in-aid-for-ukraine.html?_r=1">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/28/world/europe/senate-approves-1-billion-in-aid-for-ukraine.html?_r=1</a></p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The House and the Senate voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to approve a $1 billion aid package for Ukraine, but Congress’s near unanimity on its modest package of aid and sanctions on Russia masked deep divisions on what the government should do next to confront President Vladimir V. Putin.</p>

<p>The bills, which were nearly identical, passed by 399 to 19 in the House and by 98 to 2 in the Senate. President Obama has said he will sign the legislation, which includes new sanctions against Russians and Ukrainians who provided support to Russia in its annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Kosovo was a NATO operation and there was a lot of bad info flying around about genocide.  I&#39;ll need to dig deeper on this one.</p>
