<p>I think bubble universe and multiverse theories are only as valid as ancient aliens and religion. There is no evidence to suggest anything existed before the big bang. In fact it&#39;s totally unscientific for science magazines to run those things as serious stories rather tham acknowledge that it is, in fact, sci fi.</p>

<p>Of course that&#39;s part of the paradox that makes all of existence absurd and the real reason that I&#39;m a radical skeptic and ontological relativist in the first place. </p>

<p>Does no evidence of anything before it mean there was nothing before it? Then what started it? I&#39;ve seen some new theories calling upon virtual particles smaller than a planck length expanding forever essentially saying that our universe is smaller than a planck length in reality. Okay and what created those virtual particles?</p>

<p>If I&#39;m honest I think the big bang is flat out wrong as well. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there was nothing before the big bang, nor do I think there was something. The answer lies with new information we don&#39;t have yet or will maybe never have. It&#39;s fun to speculate but that&#39;s about it.</p>

<p>Well as you admitted early we can probably never know the answer. You seem to think this is just some technological limit and I disagree. No matter how much tech we develop you will never understand where it all came from or what the cause is. Probably due to some Godelean system limitation. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t make any statement about being able to see beyond the bounds of our universe. Maybe we develop technology to do so, maybe we don&#39;t. If we can, we can develop a great theory of how the universe came to be. If we can&#39;t, we&#39;re stuck with what we have. These events don&#39;t make the big bang more or less likely to have happened, either it did or it didn&#39;t, it only affects our ability to know.</p>

<p>I think I may have misunderstood what you were thinking, but you&#39;re still wrong, the big bang is not an unfalsifiable theory.</p>

<p>You can never convince a believer in god that he doesn&#39;t exist despite all the evidence you want, because it doesn&#39;t apply to their belief system of &quot;oh god can do anything, he doesn&#39;t have to play by the rules&quot;.</p>

<p>The big bang is not like that. If it turns out there is evidence against the big bang, we can just create a new theory. For now the big bang is the best explanation of what happened in the early moments of the universe where we&#39;ve observed it expanded rapidly, but if there is evidence to show something else actually happened, that&#39;s fine, we can dump the big bang theory <em>because it&#39;s not unfalsifiable</em>.</p>

<p>There is <em>zero</em> observational evidence to support Lamarck&#39;s theory of hereditary acquired characteristics.

<p>Kropotkin</p>

<p>There is nothing about evolution via natural selection which prevents or even disfavours mutualism. Check out Dawkins&#39; <em>&#39;The Selfish Gene&#39;</em> for a better analysis than I can provide here but suffice to say competition occurs between genomes, not individuals. Why else would symbiotic relationships be so common? </p>

<p>You realize the application of his theories was a major contributing factor to famines in the USSR right? </p>

<p>More generally I think you might have the (not uncommon) misconception that &#39;survival of the fittest&#39; means survival of the strongest or what-have-you (or maybe are confusing the theory of Evolution with Social Darwinism which is something quite different and also not a scientific theory) when in fact it means survival of the organism best adapted to its local environment.   </p>

<p>You know that sterile worker bee larvae will become queen bees if fed royal honey? Bacteria and even more complex organisms like sponges to centipedes have been shown to have horizontal gene transfer. Darwin had a Lamarckian theory called panspermia himself. </p>

<p>I&#39;m unconvinced by modern synthesis hand waving of epigenetic and envrionmentally induced evolution. Either way my point is that evolution is not a stand in word for modern synthesis theory of biology, well my bad they recently started calling it &quot;extended&quot; synthesis because of epigenetic factors. That is of course an ad hoc rationalization. </p>

<p>As for Kropotkin I mentioned him because he was a Lamarckian in the sense that Darwin was. </p>

<p>Lysenko is an interesting character but his ideas although failures weren&#39;t just pulled from his ass. </p>

<p>Because caste the divide is <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000532">largely epigenetic</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So? This is not inheritance of acquired traits but exchange of genetic material. This fits in perfectly with the idea of the gene as the base unit of evolution rather than the whole organism. Again, check out <em>&#39;The Selfish Gene&#39;</em>, it covers all these pretty thoroughly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So you&#39;re point is what...? That the early theories of evolution didn&#39;t manage to come up with a comprehensive theory that fully explains how speciation and evolution occur before we had a full understanding of how the genome operates and interacts with the environment? </p>

<p>Yeah, relevant bit is that extreme morphological changes occur from the same basic organism due purely to environmental factors. The larvae do not have different dna or genes but develop differently according to their diet. </p>

<p>The dna is the base and the genes for the varying morphology and traits are all there, but the expression is epigenetic. It&#39;s not a primitive Lamarckian inheritance of acquired traits no but it&#39;s nothing like what neo-Darwinism suggests that nearly all evolution is random selection and genetic drift. All of the attempts to fit epigenetics into modern synthesis are ad hoc realizations and if we&#39;d have known about them in the 30s perhaps neo-darwinism would have lost out to more updated Lamarckian theorists. </p>

<p>The competing idea is that the DNA in every species to evolve is already there and just needs to be expressed either naturally through environment or artificially by us. </p>

Isn&#39;t it easy to believe that they have close to infinite resources?  At least when discussing the amount required to pay hundreds of individuals to maintain shill-ish behavior across the entire internet?  How much could this possibly cost?   </p>

<p>Even if they paid $100,000 per year to each shill, it would cost $100 million per year for 1,000 shills to run rampant with psy-op objectives.  Is that a lot of money for wealthy elite organizations?  I&#39;d suppose if the objective was worthwhile (tainting the web and the people&#39;s trust in it, or general subversion of the mass-mind opinion,) I&#39;d think 1 billion would be more in order, which would buy an army of 10,000 shills (whom may be assigned multiple websites/forums to hang around.)  I think the point and effect of shills is quite worthwhile if I put myself in the shoes of an organization which seeks general control and order of their liking and benefit.  </p>

<p>If you have strong beliefs that something grand is being hidden from us (the public) then this money is rather a requirement; a mandatory investment to keep knowledge hidden, obfuscated, tangled in a twisted information web .... and ultimately blocked from meaningful consensus (which is needed for action, change, revolution etc).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yes I&#39;d agree there is some optimum number of shills to start the fire and then some other optimum (less) to maintain the fire.  It seems your point is that the damage is already done when the community is cognizant that shills are a real thing, thus devolving the internet into a much more uncertain, tangled territory of information and discourse...</p>

<p>I completely concur, while adding the notion that the number of shills might have reduced since the program(s) inception.  It still is happening with an unknown number of participants to maintain the uncertainty.</p>

<p>What&#39;s interesting is that some shills might even be hired to be &quot;caught&quot; or be told tactics which only more perceptible individuals pick up on.  This would duly serve the purpose of confirming in the community&#39;s collective psyche that we simply can&#39;t trust everyone.  </p>

<p>What&#39;s the best way to handle this when the potential to trust is already in flames?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get down voted so much its hard to speak freely about the topics I want to because the system does not allow it, you are limited to how frequent you can post with very low or negative Karma.</p>

<p>Reddit is all about community voice and you can speak about as much &quot;free thinking&quot; and tolerance as you like, but it isn&#39;t true. Lets look at this from the sidebar rules:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This subreddit is a thinking ground. Above all else, we respect everyone&#39;s opinions and ALL religions. We hope to challenge issues which have captured the public’s imagination, from JFK to 9/11. This is a forum for free thinking, not hate speech. Respect other views and opinions, and keep an open mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the biggest load of crap, it is not enforced and it is not adhered to. There is a gang mentality here and very obvious. </p>

<p>I have only posted a few topics but have recieved more than 500 downvotes for my &quot;free thinking&quot; about the Flat Earth.</p>

<p>People even said they wished I was dead.</p>

<p><strong>Sub stats: 333,481 free thinkers.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what it&#39;s worth, I get sad seeing every flat earth post at zero points. Every. Single. One. The top comments are always derisive and hateful. It&#39;s abhorrent. I won&#39;t argue either way on the subject because I do not have a rocket ship to prove it one way or the other, but so many feel they have some intellectual high ground on the subject and their haughtiness shows. It also shows that the majority of the &quot;free thinkers&quot; here would rather not go much further down the rabbit hole than seems necessary. 9/11 and political conspiracies are about as far as most will go. Hell, most won&#39;t even consider the false flags/hoaxes/staged shootings concepts. They stay where the consensus is nice and comfortable...and I think that&#39;s shameful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for expressing your dismay. I&#39;ll start speaking up in your threads and other controversial ones when I see them. Those of us who wish to protect other users&#39; right to express their ideas without being attacked should do the same. If the mods won&#39;t do their jobs, I will try to make sure the users who break the rules know we are aware of their disgusting behavior. I know it won&#39;t do much, but I won&#39;t stand by any longer. I know that the mods tend to stay out of things unless someone reports a user, so maybe I&#39;ll also start being annoying and sending reports for the users I see who won&#39;t keep an open mind.</p>

<p>I get a small amount of this kind of negative attention for trying to raise awareness of geoengineering and chemtrails. I see the shills come in to detract, but I expect them. The users that bother me are the ones who go along with the shills in their character assassinations of me and the others who try to share this information.

<p>Agreed, I think in the end though we are going to discover that all of these ancient, unexplained wonders are actually the direct works of super ancient humans that made it pretty damn far before being hit by some sort of extinction level event that brought us back to square 1.  That or they are the works of super ancient peoples that gained this knowledge from even more ancient peoples.  I&#39;m talking civilizations for 100-300k years ago <em>possibly</em>.</p>

<p>The more I learn about the concept of such ancient structures being &quot;time capsules&quot; meant to cast the collective mathematical/spiritual/historical knowledge of mankind out into the future for tens of thousands of years if not more, for those with the tech n&#39; brains to figure the clues out.  The more the puzzle pieces start to fall together.  Check out Graham Hancock &amp; Randall Carlson on all of the recent Joe Rogan Podcasts they have done if you haven&#39;t seen/heard them yet.</p>

<p>tl;dr for the video - Two points: i) Those monolithic structures you speak of were often build over decades or <em>centuries</em> of hard, back-breaking labour by <em>armies</em> of dedicated slaves doing nothing but work on their construction. We <em>greatly</em> underestimate the ingenuity and resourcefulness of our ancestors imo and ii) What the hell would be the point?

<li>The problem is that some of these structures such as the great pyramids and the temple of Osiris are pretty much impossible no matter how many people or years you dedicate to the task. 1000 tonne blocks are just too big to move especially in that environment. I&#39;ve heard about the wet sand theories and my response is okay reproduce it to scale then let&#39;s see it. </li>
</ol>

<p>You have to assume some pretty advanced technology which is a conspiracy in of itself. </p>

<p>two) If they&#39;re roughly our size then these buildings aren&#39;t relative small they&#39;re fittingly big. </p>

<p>My bad on the wording. The three 1000 tonne blocks were used in the construction the Trilithon of course, not the pyramids. The point remains. </p>

<p>Problem is that no such contraption has ever been found in Egypt or depicted anywhere on the walls. In fact apparently there is nothing around the pyramids showing how or who constructed it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually a radical skeptic and so I don&#39;t actually believe aliens did but being a skeptic I have to see proof and so far no one has reproduced. That means we have to reason with pure logic, the field of philosophy is often criticized for this reason (no experimental evidence needed) </p>

<p>So being a skeptic I have to conclude that no science thus far is satisfactory for explaining it. </p>

<p>You seem to have different values than me because I consider using alloys and polymers that can be welded and melded to be a lot less impressive than &quot;piling big(BIG) stones&quot;. </p>

<p>Alright i&#39;ll watch it if you take a look at Nassim Haramein&#39;s lecture on this subject on youtube titled The Pyramids and Orions Belt. </p>

<p>The funny thing is that like you I recently had a shift in opinion. Days ago I thought this wasn&#39;t even a question that we built these things. Now my paradigm has shifted and I can&#39;t logically make sense of how ancients could do it unless they were just more advanced than us. </p>

<p>Yes and I completely agree this is a very interesting mystery. I&#39;m actually a big fan of some of Graham Hancock&#39;s (and others) theories about the history of civilization probably being several thousand years older than the current narrative suggests. The Sphinx especially seems to bear this out given the water-erosion marks, inconsistencies in the dimensions and amount of erosion of the head compared to the rest of the body etc. </p>

<p>Well you said it yourself, they require the use of far more advanced technology to put together and then also consider the design elements involved. The Burj Khalifa, for example, is designed such that it can sway with the wind without placing undue stress on the structure etc. It requires a <em>far</em> better understanding of mechanics and physics to even contemplate building such a structure. </p>

<p>I see what you&#39;re saying but I feel like my point hasn&#39;t been addressed satisfyingly; because what I&#39;m saying is that despite the more primitive approach of building a pyramid like a giant playing with lego blocks, there is no giant to appeal to here. </p>

<p>Technically speaking the technology for making polymers and buildings that sway is actually easier to develop than a technology that can place stones that big with such accuracy. </p>

<p>For instance, if you wanted to put the moon on top of a giant wooden cylinder it&#39;d be harder than synthesizing a new element to do advanced nuclear technologies, even though technically all you would need to put the moon on top of a wooden pole is a REALLY big person with a really big space helmet. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the one. I&#39;m not familiar with Robert Bauval&#39;s work actually, like I said I&#39;m just getting these idea because I found it through Nassim first. Once I watch your video I&#39;ll hit you up with my thoughts or reconsiderations but it might be a while as i make my reddit argument rounds haha</p>

<p>As for human contact with aliens? I want to believe. It&#39;s really difficult explaining ancient monoliths. The ones in South America are amazing! Ancient aliens are a compelling argument for what may have been human ingenuity ( or psychic powers! Or magic! )  </p>

<p>Then there are all the modern day sightings. Those are on par with ghosts and spiritual phenomenon for me. There may be a scientific explanation for many.

Secret government programs to time traveling humans.  Who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I would agree completely I wouldn&#39;t make you disavow anything. This is what you call a slippery slope. That&#39;s why people make stances about absolutes like this.  </p>

<p>Suggestion: don&#39;t participate. If you can see it&#39;s bullshit and don&#39;t comment collectively it will be super evident. After all how much can you get from a thread like that? It&#39;ll just be a bad improv reality internet tvshow forum thread of botsNshills n shit. A spectacle.</p>

<p>Lizard people and flat earth conspiracy proponents have no place in the conversation. </p>

<p>Sure they do.  Keep in mind, I&#39;m not defending these ideas but making more of a censorship point.  </p>

<p>Shouldn&#39;t we encourage all types of topics lest we censor out a topic that later proves true?  Isn&#39;t it better to keep an open mind?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These &quot;theories&quot; are blatant counter operations against people asking legitimate questions concerning the global leadership. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait so <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is only for people asking legitimate questions concerning the global leadership?  That&#39;s not true at all.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You don&#39;t have to be a reptile-human hybrid to abuse a position of power. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed but just because you don&#39;t want to read about that stuff doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t have a place here.  </p>

It could either mean those who are psychopaths and use the reptilian part of their brain. There are also theories (imo credible) of the two bloodlines of Cain and Abel (occult/esoteric).

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with most of those fringey theories, but oh, do I enjoy them. Sure, most of them seem to serve a fear mongering  agenda, subconsciously scaring gullible people into a state of complacency by making them and foreign forces believe the powers that be are too smart and technologically advanced to stand up against. But with a grain of salt fringe politics comes off as the new science fiction, I&#39;m the vein of Orwell and Huxley. It gets people to question authority, which at the end of the day is the whole point of this sub. Think of it at the gateway drug to more reasonable alternative media. I like hearing about Obama Stargates to Mars and subterranean aliens, its a nice break from the depressing bleakness of the IDF spraying Palestinians with sewer water. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is your proof for that to be true?</p>

<p>You have no proof. Anything and everything can be questioned.</p>

<p>Whether or not they are &quot;counter operations&quot; doesn&#39;t mean they should be banned from a thread which seeks people to ask the question.</p>

<p>What should be banned are blatantly political posts (eg the circle-jerk ones that are posted about making sure to vote for Bernie Sanders nightly and daily).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t comment on whether you <em>need</em> anything else. I know NOTHING about the true workings of reality and will readily admit that. I do know that you can&#39;t assume a lack (or the non-existence) of something else just because you already have something you understand. You don&#39;t necessarily need a self-aware God for adaptation to work, but that doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t one behind the introduction and evolution of life. And that also doesn&#39;t mean that natural selection, i.e. adaptation, is the only driving force behind evolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re both discussing a problem of language really. Mixing up evolution and Darwinism or neo-Darwinism. </p>

<p>This is partly because the dominant ideology (modern synthesis neo-darwinism) deliberately words their ideology in a way that makes it seem like a complete synonym with word evolution when i reality is just an interpretation.</p>

<p>But as we know Lamarck, Kropotkin and Lysenko believed in <em>a</em> theory of evolution as well. </p>
