       . New privacy rules aimed at silencing dissent and fracturing the community? I for one will delete my reddit account before I agree to the new privacy/stalking policy... but the need for a network like /r conspiracy is obvious.. and an obvious threat to the powers at be... edit: how much will using Tor help avoid the stalking policy?

       I absolutely believe this is true.  We've become "radicalized" by
       <em>
        their lies
       </em>
       .  But really we're truth terrorists, our weapon is the truth.  I can't wait for them to say that they will fight truth terrorists until there is no truth left.  I can't
       <em>
        wait

       for that.  Anyway Merry Christmas.

       Voat is the KKK of news aggregators.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I have hope, as they grow, more normal people will join and they will be forced to change. Unless, of course, the founders and owners are racist and sexist and don't want it to change. Which more and more seems likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compared to voat
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is downright fluffy. Which tells you how harsh voat it.

      <p>
       But at least they don't censor submissions and you can see the votes.

       Last year I published a movie that culminated with me starting a whitehouse petition trying to change the 13th amendment of the constitution and abolish slave labor even if the person has been convicted of committing a crime. Changing that wording would change our country's definition of "justice". No more running from the police if they're not here to enslave you. I also published a list of elected officials next to the amount of money the received in the form of campaign donations from the private prison corporations in return for their votes enacting harsher sentencing laws against their constituents.... The laws they're allowed to enslave you for if you break. I was permanently banned from r/politics within 5 minutes.

       The first 16 minutes is me dressing up like a superhero and filming myself running up into a courtroom to troll some cops that wouldn't quit harassing me but once I cut scene to the American flag in the background I explain everything I mentioned before. The petition is actually dead right now because I need 100,000 signatures.in 30 days and I didn't get it but if there happens to be a stupid amount of attention given to this post I'll restart it.

       I'm sure others can contribute but things like: hiding unpopular comments, promoting group agreement vs controversial discussion,  using PR to control narrative, restricting content based on "sub reddit rules", developing profiles on commentors, hiding the actual number of up and downvotes to promote vote manipulation in their favor.. Top down management of an originally bottom up site

       I've noticed that anything I post that's critical of freemasonry or specifically the occult as applicable to secret societies is downvoted.  I dont' expect those to be extremely upvoted as they are only mildly interesting or simply something people think here is 'barking up the wrong tree' (like israel or 'jews' controlling the world), but expecting them to be anywhere from 10-50 is reasonable; when they get upvoted to 12 and then I come back and the post is down to '0' or '1' then I suspect these are gamed.  Same with comments along those lines.  It's very specific.  Here's stuff I find is more downvoted:

        Critical of gnosticism

        as most people have already decided this the imaginings of paranoid schizophrenics; same with satanic ritual abuse.  Personally I suspect the vast majority
        <em>
         are
        </em>
        schizoids, but I bet 10% have legit gangstalking claims.

       Also, they will release films specifically to either acclimate the public to gnostic beliefs (maze runner comes to mind.: "wicked is good"; also 'as above so below", nearly every sci fi movie;), or to bury search engine leads.  They are making films whose publicity will squash any legitimate informational web pages in the search engine results.  I made a post this morning about the number 33, which is the highest rank of the freemasons, it's also the number of discs in the spine and a club at disney.  YOu would never know those things because the first 3 pages on google now is about the new Film '33'.

       Oh they have lots of dirty tricks, the people with unlimited money and an army of effectively free labor.

       edit:  all the problems I had with being brigaded on past reddit accounts, with wild downvoting and going through 30 paginations of comment to attack me from one thing I said taken out of context...it started with this post I made.  Figure out why.

       You are 100% correct. Any topic that touches on the occult is heavily downvoted even on this sub.

       BTW what is wrong with the red hat society? Isn't it just a group of weird old ladies or is there something more sinister going on?

       There is no threat to the "Powers that be".  You've long since past the point where action could be taken to secure you're freedom.  You spent that time pointlessly cooing on the internet.  Writing books no one would read.  Doing nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now there is no action that can save your future generations.  If you woke up today and tried to fight back you would be branded a terrorist and eliminated.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one will defend you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are all cows.  You always have been, but now there is nothing you could ever do about it.  If you had revolted in the late 80's you may have had a chance.  If you had physically stormed your houses of government and taken back your laws before 2000, you would be in control of your own destiny today.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you didn't.  You all sat on your fat asses and did nothing but piss in the wind to make yourselves feel better, just like you're doing now.  Words will never change anything.  Information is useless without action, and now that action is useless as well.
