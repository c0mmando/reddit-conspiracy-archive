       Firstly, I liked it.  It was entertaining.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was nothing more than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The original Star Wars spoke of truth, the power of good over evil.  The force.  How the Force can be harnessed -- and used to manipulate reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the scene where they "blew up the (new) Death Star" was pure mechanics/tech -- zero Force was used.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disney's version was visually stunning (benefitting from 40 years of technology advances), but spiritually soulless -- like most Disney movies.
      </p>
      <p>
       bottom line: the new Star Wars was simply an ad to embrace the dark side.

       honestly if anything it was pentagon propaganda to  further "girl power" and how girls should get on the front lines, be independent from men since they dont need them (being independent is good but to an extreme it starts to break down the family) which may be leading to this

       I think we don't have all the information. -spoiler warning- Ray was left on Jakku, by her parents who left in a ship. We don't know who her parents were but since she is so strong in the force we can probably assume she is the daughter of a strong force user since it seems to run in families. The whole Star Wars series is basically about the Skywalker family, so it's a safe bet to say that Ray is related to Luke, maybe his daughter. Luke was creating a school to teach a new generation of jedi, until the knights of ren wiped them out. It's possible that Ray was a student of Lukes, when she was very young, since Jedi are trained from a very young age (in the prequels at least) It's possible she has training but doesn't remember it since it happened when she was very young, followed by a traumatic event where all the jedi students got murdered and she was smuggled away to a desert and abandoned. Traumatic childhood events can be forgotten as a defense mechanism. Even if none of that is the case, she is a strong force user, and Obi wan said to use the force that the force would guide luke. It's possible that the force itself was helping her out, showing her what to do. The force gives a jedi powers of premonition where they see the future, she could have gotten information from her own future where luke had trained her. There are a variety of plausible reasons she learned so fast. She also had direct experience with Kylo Ren trying to mind-trick her and she was able to turn the tables on him.

       So much of what we saw before this film led us to believe that Jedi powers are the result of strong genetic predisposition AND a monastic life of intense training and study.

      <p>
       Her spontaneous transformation as depicted in VII is an insult to that tradition.

       If you were trying to be insulting, I'm pretty sure you meant "goyim" - but even then that is amusing since that is the plural form.

       I thought they should have gone with the storyline where the galaxy gets invaded by those aliens that are unaffected by the force, and virtually undetectable with it either. It was supposed to be some huge war where Coruscant gets destroyed, and trillions die by the end. Had a good plotline too with Sidius turning out to be building the Empire and amassing the buge army  and building Death Stars not to fight the rebels, but to fight the coming invasion. But no, let's just have another Death Star get blown up.

       Oy vey, there's a lot of Jews in Hollywood. Surely this is a revelation for the ages. Next you'll tell me that there's a lot of jews among intelligentsia too, and they get a lot of Nobel prizes.

       Think of the premise: this is supposed to be 30 years after the battle of Endor - which destroyed the empire. As a result, most people dont know about the force - or dont know exactly how it works. Rey wants nothing to do with it and Finn doesnt understand how it works. That's a far cry different than in past films where everyone knew who the Jedi were and what the force did.

       Not every fiction writer was a personal friend of Joseph Campbell. And it stands to reason that influence of these story archetypes before Campbell studied them is far different that the influence that comes from personally knowing and learning from Campbell after he connected the dots.

       i do think the movie has a subversive (and maybe unintentional?) "join the dark side" message - hidden under the "good wins over evil" surface. sure, they blow up the death planet and the good guys celebrate...but overall the feeling is that the bad guys are everywhere and minor victories will not change the unavoidable future of destruction for good guys, or at the very least perpetual struggle.
      </p>
      <p>
       it feels morally bankrupt to me - since there is no allusion to any way that the bad guys are benefitting other than power for the supreme leader and generals. because there is no hint of capitalism or a wealthy elite, it's totally un-relatable for current humans. it's just two armies battling...the "citizenry" can only stand by and wait to be killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       the biggest negative impact of the movie, in my opinion, is that billions of people will internalize the images of planets (full of regular families) being blown up, and grow accustomed to it as "no big deal". we might feel it's sad, and that was perpetrated by evil forces, but still, we've seen it, and glorified the makers of it. and the collective consciousness will spend years and ridiculous amounts of resources imagining and preparing for a future of hopeless struggle ending in destruction. not an idea that will inspire revolution.

       One thing that was not made clear to my parents who got dragged there (and don't care about SW), was that you have to be a Jedi to operate a light saber.  This means black stormtrooper dude was also a Jedi, but he sucked compared to a girl because of his inferiority to GIRLFORCE.  The movie didn't explain that either; he just picked it up and it came on.  No force needed.  If that's something new, then Abrams changed it and it's non cannon.  Oh god I've got the nerd on me, get it off!!

       The lightsabers that the Jedi use are made when the Padawan apprentices travel to some special planet and select a special crystal that is force-sensitive. The Jedi picks the crystal that they feel has the most match to them (or the crystal chooses THEM or something) and they go about building their lightsaber.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sith dont have access to these special crystals so they figured out a way to synthesize them instead - which is apparently why they glow red. Kylo Ren who has SOME training in the force, but is not complete, built his saber using parts he cobbled together and a very old design he found, along with a fractured/faulty synthetic crystal, which is why it sparks and sputters and requires extra venting in the hilt (which creates the quillions/ crossguards you see)
      </p>
      <p>
       In the hands of someone who doesnt know the force, its just a lightsaber. But in the hands of a Jedi, its something more.
