        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Two and a half years ago I began working construction, surrounded by Mexicans all day speaking Spanish. I only did this for roughly 6 months as a temporary job until I could continue with my goals. I used Pandora as my primary means of music entertainment (and still do) and I have never had advertisements in Spanish, until about a week into working construction.</p>

<p>For the duration of this time working construction I continued receiving every other advertisement in Spanish. Coincidentally, after I stopped working construction the Spanish advertisements stopped and have not returned ever since. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know for sure, but I am thoroughly convinced that the microphone is accessed without our knowledge.</p>

<p>When I would attend classified briefings in the military, we were always instructed to remove our cell phones or turn them off before entering the room; I believe this correlates with my experience receiving invasive advertisements. If advertisement companies have access to this kind of infringement without our ability to prove it definitively, imagine who else does or what they&#39;re using it for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That can work a car GPS and a Phone with GPS disabled like an old phone or take of the satellite out of the smartphone. That way it would be more of an effort to make a connection between the two. I would just go with the phone because you are still being tracked by carrying the car GPS. You would not have to deal with this problem if you are near alot of payphones. Its less inconvenient but more secure than mobile phones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks to my having a linux machine going I can answer. My reddit mail is broken on my windows machine.</p>

<p>All phones can hear and track you. They even set up secret towers for the police to investigate you without a warrent. They can find you if the phone is off and the battery is in it. The only safe way to avoid this is to remove the battery. They can hear everything you say whether you are using your phone or not. </p>

<p>There are many articles about this that can be found on google.</p>

<p>Have phun. I don&#39;t give a shit what they hear. I&#39;m old and an arrest (if there was a need to) would kill me since my health isn&#39;t the best and locally the county jail 
 practices medicine like it was 1890 or before.</p>

<p>Cell phones, all of them are not secure. I just read that iphone has been hiding over 270 problems with security...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, it really hits home when you get an ad for an off-the-wall product.  This happened to me once with a Stihl hedge trimmer ad on Facebook, except I don&#39;t own a home where I&#39;d need this and we weren&#39;t talking about trimming <em>that</em> kind of hedge only moments earlier.</p>

<p>Another time I was talking about getting tennis lessons, open up Facebook 5 minutes later and boom, ads for tennis lessons.</p>

<p>FWIW, I&#39;ve been able to avoid this by closing down the Facebook app every time I&#39;m done using it.   The microphone eavesdropping seems to happen when it&#39;s allowed to run in the background.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said the word &quot;keychain&quot; today because I was pretty excited about this laser pointer/led flashlight keychain someone got me. Stupid little thing but I like things on keychain so I verbally said the word a few times. Log on to this Reddit app and sure enough there is an add for keychains featuring some such crap. I&#39;ve noticed the voice thing pops up here and there thinking I&#39;m trying to search for something. It does it often but not everyday and today it didn&#39;t come up. This is just the most recent incident but I frequently get ads for things that I&#39;ve only said or worse, only texted to someone. I think this has gone way past confirmation bias as reached the realm of testability. </p>

<p>that doesn&#39;t sound believable, try again.</p>

<p>edit: this guy is trolling the uninformed serfs, looking to believe some baseless bullshit. <strong>If it was possible to do this sort of targeting on listeners, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/23/pandora-loses-more-than-a-third-of-its-value-as-it-battles-apple-music-for-listeners/">Pandora would be worth 100X more than it&#39;s worth now, rather than LOSING <em>$86 Million</em> last quarter</a>.</strong> That said, there is validity to some form of listening on certain apps <em>(Facebook, for example, is testing this in certain markets)</em>, but as a whole the idea is a stretch. </p>

<p>What&#39;s listening to what you say and consume is Amazon Echo, Google Now, Siri and Cortona...apps that uninformed consumers volunarily allow into their homes that are always listening. Wake the fuck up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See it like this: you were both in a relationship with each other for some time at least. So they know that you are xx years old and in a relationship. If you already lived together they have that as well. Now they have a shitload of other things about you too. Interests, friend circle, even how you behaved for the last couple of years. Now they have that data not only for you but for a couple of million other people in a similar age and with similar character traits. People that are close to you will probably have married before you assuming you are in the age range where most people start to get married. So basically they know a lot of things about a lot of people that are similar to you. </p>

<p>Now maybe you or your girlfriend watched proposal videos Googled around a bit had a look at rings and this is all data you chose to share with them. If you did not tell Google how old you are they can still guess it and the same thing happens to a lot of other things. You share data and they use it. So what happened now is that they either knew that you proposed (since you went shopping for a ring, searched for related stuff and so on) or they just guess that since you two fit together nicely and are in the right age and have the right friend circle and have the right family situation and, if you were following me, a lot of similar things they already know about you and the people you are close to. There guess could have been wrong as well but since you did propose it was correct. And now you have confirmation bias as well. </p>

<p>It is scary how much they know and how good they are at things like this but then again it is their job and you do share most of your information and agreed to do it. Search for it you will find it. They do not hide what they are doing. The scary part is that they might as well manipulate you into proposing. The other things are mentioned are old and boring.</p>

<p>Conspiracy starts as soon as you find something which is not known to everyone that is interested. And manipulating you would be a great business. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s early for me so I can&#39;t remember exactly but there was a thread somewhere, don&#39;t think it was a conspiracy one.  But the basic idea was multiple people were posting stories about having a conversation irl with some one about a specific topic, like chocolate cake and then shortly after while browsing face book they would see ads for cakes and recipes for cakes.   Google has been doing this for years by reading the contents of your emails people were assuming that facebook was doing the same thing with the mic.   </p>

If you leave it unlocked you can check the logs and see when your microphone turned itself on. I did the other day, it was basically listening to me all day long. It made me feel like a whore. I have never in my life felt that way. I encourage everyone to get at least the trial version. Apple does have an equivalent to Jon McCafee&#39;s D-Vasive. i haven&#39;t tried it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have left reddit for <a href="https://voat.co/">Voat</a> due to years of admin mismanagement and preferential treatment for certain subreddits and users holding certain political and ideological views.  </p>

<p>The situation has gotten especially worse since the appointment of Ellen Pao as CEO, culminating in the seemingly unjustified firings of several valuable employees and bans on hundreds of vibrant communities on completely trumped-up charges.  </p>

<p>The resignation of Ellen Pao and the appointment of Steve Huffman as CEO, despite initial hopes, has continued the same trend.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what its called. I&#39;m not sure if apple will truly allow you to stop being monetized and spied on. All I found was this and it sucks dicks. It only allows you to lock or unlock the device, where as dvasive will keep all apps other than you calling and using the microphone, locked out of your camera and micro phone keeping it locked constantly and allowing you to use the device however. without use of the camera until you unlock it. No quick wifi blue tooth or stingray lock downs. Basically you can do this with the settings. How can you trust apple settings, because the pics they take of you don&#39;t get stored in the gallery. I&#39;m so glad I went to android. Its so much faster and I have way more piece of mind. Apple was big brothery.    <a href="http://appcrawlr.com/ios/anti-spy">http://appcrawlr.com/ios/anti-spy</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe I read am article talking about a new method of linking devices together for ad companies. They install scripts on apps that will emit am ultrasonic tone while simultaneously listening for an ultrasonic tone. When two devices with this script come near each other, the script picks up the tone, recognizes that there&#39;s another device nearby, and then attempts to alter ad services to better target the individual. </p>

<p>Not saying this is what happened. I&#39;m sure there are other means of collecting data like this or like others have said, it may have had something to do with GPS and what not. </p>

<p>Regardless, your phone does collect data on you, your search history, location, location habits, etc. Hell, some phones have actually detected and predicted work schedules. A coworker was freaking out one day when he notices his phone started to inform him of his travel time from work to home and he&#39;s never entered information like that into his phone before nor did he do anything to initiate any feature like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s quite easy to get around much of this on a rooted Android phone if you&#39;re willing to ditch Google. I say rooted because your Pandora app is using the microphone so you can use an app like XPrivacy or AppOps to deny the Pandora app permission to use the microphone or location services or something but this app requires a rooted phone.</p>

<p>The best thing to do is install a custom ROM for your phone from the XDA forum, I originally did it just for better battery/customization but it&#39;s useful for privacy. The app instructions might say something like &quot;after you&#39;ve installed the app, install GAPPS&quot; but avoid doing this because this installs all that google bloatware on your phone. It&#39;s possible to install the rom and run the phone well without google stuff on there, for example, you can use NewPipe instead of YouTube to watch Youtube videos or you can use Lightning Browser instead of Chrome or use Maps.ME instead of Google Maps. Now stick to using mostly open-sourced apps much of which are found on F-Droid (an open source app store). AdAway is a good Privacy app along with SecDroid, AFFirewall+ (can block an app like your camera or keyboard from having internet access), and some combination of either I2P or Orbot+TorBrowser to better encrypt stuff.  An app like Greenify which is meant for battery saving, can prevent an app from running in the background when you don&#39;t want to use it which is also good for privacy imo.</p>

<p>Overall, it depends on how far you&#39;re willing to go but you can definetely limit your ad tracking and whatnot if you further research it. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/3s6hlv/a_list_of_opensource_and_material_designed/">Here&#39;s a list of some open-source apps recommended via Reddit including a Reddit Reader</a></p>

<p>Another thing that I would recommend is getting a phone unlocked and using a pay-as-you-go service instead of monthly contract. When you buy the sim card and topups, use cash and not your credit card, don&#39;t activate it with real ID when activated online, etc.</p>

<p>On android you must disable the always listening &quot;feature&quot; of google now. The one that lets you search by voice by saying &quot;OK Google&quot;. Better if you uninstall those applications (Google search and Google now) Same with Siri on iPhone</p>

<p>Also just uninstall Facebook, that shit is always listening. In case you still want to use it, you can find better opensource apps for Facebook that don&#39;t need microphone permission</p>

<p>Police forces have the option to remotely activate the microphone of every phone, not for advertising purposes, that&#39;s more scary</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, your phone is always listening to you. Facebook, Twitter, and other major social apps are using audible conversations to target ads to you. </p>

<p>I noticed this about three years ago. I was taking to someone about basketball, and started to get Facebook ads about tickets to the NCAA tournament the next time I used the Facebook app. I had a separate conversation about buying a house, and then got ads for mortgages the next time I used the Facebook app. I had a few more odd coincidences, and then I deleted the app. I use Facebook through Safari on my iPhone now, and haven&#39;t had the same problem.</p>

<p>My girlfriend talked about candy, and got an ad for Skittles on Twitter. Sometimes it&#39;s common to get promoted posts for tweets that have thousands of favorites and retweets, as the Skittles one did.</p>

<p>But then one event happened that made it undeniable that Twitter was listening. I was watching a financial documentary (Maxed Out, I think) and then got a promoted tweet about financial management services. The tweet only had one favorite, and no retweets. I clicked on the account that &quot;posted&quot; the tweet, only to find a small handful of tweets. The promoted tweet was not on the account&#39;s page at all. It&#39;s like it came out of thin air.</p>

<p>Many others have corroborated that smartphones are listening to you, in this post, in previous posts, and in other conversations and articles outside of Reddit. It&#39;s definitely happening, you aren&#39;t crazy!</p>
