       I want to pay for the things that I actually use in society.  I also don't want to pay for things I strongly disagree with in principle.  If we really are to be respected by our society, we should have this choice.  No one should have us pay the government for things that violate our principles, otherwise it violates our life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.  I can tell you stress is a killer of men, all medical studies show this easily.  I am stressed out a lot by having my taxes fund illegitimate wars, NSA spying on me and my family, and it also makes me happy.  I have a right to happiness and the governemnt steals that away from me with mountains of news stories of recent let-downs, gov failures, gov mistakes, inadequacies, crimes and intrigues.  I'm tired of this shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want an a-la-carte government.  I think many others do to.  We should demand it.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        I want to pay for social security
       </li>
       <li>
        I want to pay for the elderly services
       </li>
       <li>
        I want to pay for roads, bridges
       </li>
       <li>
        I want to pay for the EPA if they do their job correctly and stop releasing toxic orange superfund sludge into colorado communities.
       </li>
       <li>
        I want to pay for the FDA, if they do their job correctly and don't try to remove health supplements of any kind from the market, including ephedrine / ma huang (I'm not a child).
       </li>
       <li>
        I want to pay for the USDA, if they stop denigrating
        <em>
         organic
        </em>
        and other labels, stop preventing GMO labelling, stop sneaking GMO agendas into their services and politics.
       </li>
       <li>
        I don't want to pay one more dollar to the military, except for their health benefits and reintegration into civilian live expenses.
       </li>
       <li>
        I don't want to pay one more dollar to the NSA, CIA, FBI, DEA, DOJ, DOE, NRO, TSA, DIA, Apple computer, Microsoft or Google.
       </li>
       <li>
        I don't want to pay one more dollar on a nuclear weapon of any kind, or any kind of space energy weapon, or psychotronic weapon.
       </li>
       <li>
        I don't want to pay one more dollar on astroturfing brigading social media trolls that infiltrate reddit and warp people's opinions.  (NSA, HBGary, Booz-Allen-Hamilton, others)
       </li>
       <li>
        I don't want to pay for traffic lights, but I will pay for roundabouts and safety studies to mandate car safety equipment.
       </li>
       <li>
        <em>
         I want to pay for police bulletproof vest
        </em>
        , but
        <strong>
         I don't want to pay for tanks, assault rifles and flash grenades for police!
        </strong>
       </li>
       <li>
        I don't want to pay for speed limit signs.
       </li>
       <li>
        I want people's cars to be able to shoot paintballs of demerit at offending cars, cars that get too many paintballs in a window of time lose their license for a window of time.  If a car is extremely reckless, I want 3 nearby cars to have authority to power that car down and boot it, until the police can remove the boot.  That's how you deal with DUIs
       </li>
       <li>
        I want agorism
       </li>
       <li>
        I want the government to stop fighting bitcoin
       </li>
       <li>
        I want to let banks and businesses fail when they are 'too big to fail' -- this is what a free market actually is.  Otherwise it's elite-only socialism.
       </li>
       <li>
        I want to pay for a single-payer healthcare system, regardless of the costs.
       </li>
       <li>
        I want insurance of all kind to go away (maybe liability for auto accidents and property damage can stay)
       </li>
       <li>
        I want the small business administration to finally go away.  It helped me 0% on 3 occassions when I was financially stable, willing, able and driven to open 3 different businesses.  This says to me they are a fraud enterprise.
       </li>
       <li>
        I don't want to spend another dollar ever on the FCC
       </li>
       <li>
        I want the government to admit that AT&amp;T is actually a government run corporation, used for spying both broadly (room 641A) and locally (utility trucks that mill around, appearing to be doing nothing)

       It's a good idea. I envision a voluntaryist form of government in which we use a sort of direct democracy. No more corrupt representatives. We all get to vote on what we want and our vote includes us in a group. So maybe you vote for roads to get fixed up in your area, and you contribute money voluntarily to this road fund, which would then be used to hire private contractors to do the work. All associations would be voluntary and exist within a free market where those who provide the best service for the lowest fee will win out.

       Ok so the first requirement is an incorruptible, internet-based voting platform that is a) secure, b) durable, c) distributed, d) anonymous-vote ; authenticated access, e) citizen tallyable, f) whose code is open-source; and g) whose code is security audited by a large group of sec experts.
      </p>
      <p>
       tails os + voting software + give to every citizen + they vote when they want within a window of time and can save proof offline as stub to verify via qrcode when national tally happens.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Then they all vote and cannabis is legalized next day.

      <p>
       Republicans use age-old argument of tyranny of majority because that's twilight language for 'I actually hate democracy and want to control you'

       Sweet.  Have fun with that.  If you want a good, well-written tripping book:
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tryptamine-Palace-5-MeO-DMT-Sonoran-Desert/dp/1594772991/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1451124833&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=MEO+dmt">
        "Tryptamine Palace: 5meodmt and the Sonoran Desert Toad"
       </a>
       .  The part about quantum physics (zero point energy field) suggest he is one of the few lay people who actually get the science.

       If my post history was defending vaccines, would arguments I make to anti-vaxxers be less credible?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't it make sense that someone who is passionate about a subject would have a lot of posts? Now, obviously there are some problems if I didn't provide sources but as you can see I often provide links to peer-reviewed research. Not links to naturalnews, foodbabe, truthout, commondreams, that sort of bullshit spread by Sandy Hook deniers like ragecry or anti-corporate nutjobs like henrycorp.

       I'm not a "lone warrior". I dispel myths, I don't defend big businesses.
      </p>

       There are lots of other users (eg. on
       <a href="/r/GMOmyths">
        /r/GMOmyths
       </a>
       ) who dedicate time to dispeling myths around GE crops. Often that degenerates into dispeling myths about Monsanto because anti-GMOers have no credible arguments about GMOs.

        "Tryptamine Palace: 5meodmt and the Sonoran Desert Toad"
       </a>
       .  The part about quantum physics (zero point energy field) suggest he is one of the few lay people who actually get the science.
