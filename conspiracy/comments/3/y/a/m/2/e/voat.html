       With reddits new privacy policy I suggest everyone affiliated with this sub moves to voat. I find it just as easily to maneuver around in as reddit without the spying and what not. They have a pretty damn good privacy policy that keeps it's users safe. I'm on board what about you guys? Farewell reddit it's been a good run

       Complain all you want about numbers or content, regardless of politics voat attracts the sort of people that, in general, prefer less authoritarianism in the expression of ideas.  Those people are the ones that I want to interact with.

       Also since FPH got banned I checked it out and lost 20 pounds.  If a forum is an authoritarian "echo chamber", it might as well promote something like healthy living instead of Cultural Marxism.

       A lot of us post here to spread ideas, problem with Voat is there's nobody to spread ideas to.  There are people who are desperate to get us out of Reddit, they'll be rubbing their hands together if a significant portion of /conspiracy leaves

       But how do you ever expect there to be people on Voat to help spread ideas if you won't join and you actively discourage people from moving?
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is dead man, we have lost any and all semblance of control we ever had over it and it's time to move on.  Whether that's to Voat or back to forums or wherever you want to go is fine but trying to salvage this site is like trying to put out a tire fire.  The best you can do is find a new place to share ideas while trying as hard as you can to keep this sinking ship afloat until they finally put the clamps down hard.

       We need to go after the herds of sheep go, those are the people we need to influence, for us to leave now only benefits TPTB, they are desperate to quarantine us.  It's not our job to move people around, if Voat one day becomes popular it will be victim to the same corruption as Reddit.  We have to focus on our job which is influencing the masses and waking them up, the masses are on Reddit, whereas Voat only has a handful of people there.

       Yea. With the numbers, it just tried to grow to fast and every tried to create all the same subs on Voat that existed on Reddit. So a lot of them are empty without any posts for the past month.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure over time Voat will get their own subs totally different from Reddit. Over time, it too will hae to do a lot of the same thing Reddit does though to not turn into a chan-anonymous sess-pool.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as I hate the censorship in Reddit, anonymity leads to trolls. Just look at YouTube comments. I'm not saying that's a bad thing. It's just a reality. I've been working on an article about it; will post when I'm done.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yea, everyone should be on Voat...and here...and other sites. Don't put everything in one bucket. Go. Explore. Remember the time when people went to Lycos..then Hotbot...then Yahoo...back and forth to get different results.

       That doesn't do anything, as your connection is decrypted on reddits side. You might as well use a fax machine.

       Isn't that exactly what Reddit wants in the first place?   Migrate all the "controversial" users off so they can have their safe space for advertisers?   You'd be playing right into the corporate take over of Reddit by migrating there in masse.

       What makes reddit valuable (what they want) is content. Although we might all be "controversial" but we also participate, and thus add value, to not only this sub, but others. They are losing their valuable users and trading them for page views (shit users), and we should embrace that and gtfo.

       The migration of people from digg to reddit was epic. I believe the same thing is getting ready to happen to reddit. It will be left a mainstream wasteland of propaganda and corporate filth.

      <p>
       What's keeping a lot of people from making the permanent move over to Voat is the perception that there is a  lot of riff raff over there. Well, when everyone makes the move, it will be more or less drowned out and become what reddit used to be.

       What they don't realize is all the "controversial" users are the ones providing the really interesting content.  Oh well, they'll have their corporate-safe baby for 6 months to a year, then it will die from lack to interest, and they will blame misogyny, since the only users left will be SRS thugs.

       What surprises me is how more and more bluepilled the place has become. I mean for a while there was a perfect balance of not all complete hard core dollar-bill-conspiracy-folks but then something changed. It's more as if this has become an alternative to
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news

       etc. as they've started to ban people from having opinions.

       As far as Voat being a Reddit clone, I think we can agree that most of us got our mega forum cherry popped here. We love the site. What we dont love is Censorship, Mod abuse, Political agenda, and sell outs. It makes sense that the community would migrate and replace what it lost. I have a new user name here every few months. I dont need that at voat.

       It's not much better.  Most of the stuff here is mirrored there.  Also what's a better way to get all the true believers from here in one place to catalog and tap later on.

       The whole point of going to a site like Reddit, or Voat, or whatever else - Is the content, discussion and community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Voat lacks all of those. It's too small.

       The content and community on Voat is pretty damn good.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for discussion, what do you think Reddit was like 4 or 5 years ago? This sub had less than 10,000 readers, most major subs had less than 5,000. If you're saying that you like to follow the crowd then so be it, but don't confuse quantity with quality.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, I use both for now, but I have dramatically cut back my Reddit use. I only visit a hand full of subs now and pretty much spend my time 50-50 between the two with my time on Voat increasing every week/month.

       oh, in that case i apologize, there are so many people on reddit that make the accusations you are, but have never been to voat. IMHO it was really bad right after every influx but after people were done stretching their abilities things came back down. For example, the people that use racial slurs are now not upvoted like they used to be; and those comments are becoming more rare.

       Realist?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Realism" is an untenable view of the world. We can only experience the world via our senses and we make models of the world based on that subjective experience. The best we can do is know what is evident to our senses... claims about "the real world" are dubious. But very dogmatic people like to assert that they have somehow transcended the limitations of knowledge... they call themselves "realist" when in fact they are anything but.

       Realism has more than one definition, Mr. Kant.  A big hint is the context in which a word is used.  I highly doubt epistemology was the object of discussion in a thread about voat.  We're not discussing metaphysical presuppositions today. :/

       You asserted that voat was for "realist" in response to my description of the racists views and attitudes of many of the contributers to voat. I assume you are saying that people who believe that white people are persecuted in Europe and the USA, who believe that muslims are taking over the west and who believe that men are oppressed by woman hold views that conform to the "real world" which is absurd on many many levels. The most basic way it is absurd is that nobody can know anything about the "real world", we only know our perceptions of it.

       I think the best way to interpret his use of  "realism" is as an affirmation of his worldview as somehow "normal."  If he sees reality as a clash of cultures or whatever, that isn't the same as asserting he is interpreting reality without epistemic intermediaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       A belief in a clash of cultures implies the irreconcilable nature of intersubjectively-constituted
       <em>
        ways
       </em>
       of viewing the world.  He's culturally-biased, not a proponent of the philosophical position sometimes called "naive realism."

       What surprises me is how more and more bluepilled the place has become. I mean for a while there was a perfect balance of not all complete hard core dollar-bill-conspiracy-folks but then something changed. It's more as if this has become an alternative to
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       etc. as they've started to ban people from having opinions.

       As someone who is banned from /r news for editing a title that more accurately described a link I was posting.. I whole-heartedly agree.
