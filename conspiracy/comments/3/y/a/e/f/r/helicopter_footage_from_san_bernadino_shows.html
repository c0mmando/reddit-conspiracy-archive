You have police on video arresting people in body armor, but then letting them go as &quot;they didn&#39;t have anything to do with it.&quot;  It was just random dudes wearing body armor.

    <div class="md"><p>In defenses of the masses I should say they are not really that interested. In the end all that will remain in the collective memory is &quot;attack, death, San Bernardino, terrorism&quot;.</p>

<p>Also, there might be a lot of people who actually go &quot;something is afoot here&quot;, and yet there&#39;s probably nothing that can be done about it. It&#39;s not like you and I have our hour long show on FoxNewsCNNBC to point at all the inconsistencies of the story.</p>

<p>The media is only interested in ratings and advertizement filled rate. It&#39;s not that they are lazy, they are just greedy. And possibly dumb. Like the masses. They&#39;re just as happy spewing out the Official Story<sup>TM</sup> and not interested in the least by the Truth.</p>

<p>Gee that was a depressing rant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You did bring up a good point of you that I&#39;m not thinking about here. Which is the fact that the &quot;idiot masses&quot; are just straight up not interested, kind of kills the whole idiot part of it I guess. It&#39;s not necessarily that they are stupid (though far too many are), it is the fact that they don&#39;t even know most of it&#39;s going on because they cannot alter their basic notions of obtaining knowledge and how to process reality on a fundamental level vs. living in some Rich Mans Matrix and being spoon fed every single thought and idea that ever occurs to you. </p>

<p>I guess I have to wait until the bottom falls out and see how everyone reacts whenever  there is no denying the main general points we have been trying to get across all along. Only whenever they STILL watch CNN, eat some processed garbage bought at the store, take something or another to tune them out of how fucked there life is, fuck, then go to bed...only then can we officially call them idiots I suppose. Too bad that if I ever get the answer to that little life mystery, the world will already be ablaze and probably won&#39;t give a fuck if everyone I knew was actually that dumb or not. </p>

Hell, maybe there was a third shooter, I dont know one way or the other. I just don&#39;t try to fight the uphill battle like you apparently do, ya know?  I also thought the interaction was hilarious so I decided to point out what you did.</p>

<p>Just so we&#39;re on the same page; the commenter I replied to stated &quot;I&#39;ve come to accept that the masses are idiots&quot;</p>

<p>I replied with &quot;we(the masses) feel the same way about you(conspiracy theorists) so I guess the feeling is mutual&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh god, I really shouldn&#39;t have to explain it.  You responded to a comment that was saying, &quot;I don&#39;t know how the average idiot doesn&#39;t look at this and yada yada yada&quot;.</p>

<p>You then said something like, &quot; Well we think the same of you&quot;.  Basically saying you are the average idiot.  It was a funny linguistic flub and its not meant to reflect your intelligence or anything, I just thought it was funny.  So I guess just ignore it if you aren&#39;t capable of laughing at yourself.</p>

<p>Edit: I get that you were responding to the last part now, but it can be interpreted either way without more context.</p>

<p>A person has been caught speeding away from the scene of a mass shooting, away from the pursuing police, crashing through a fence before smashing in to white truck at high speed. He then flees the crash on foot but is captured a short distance away wearing body armour. </p>

<p>is everything as we are told it is? if no, and if there is just a chance that 1 out of every 10 &quot;events&quot; is aided by people other than the perpetrators, then it is fair and right to question all events and look for inconsistencies. some will be absolute tragedies,  some will be absolute tragedies that were helped along by an outside influence. It seems not only reasonable, but dutiful, to scrutinize events instead of just swallowing them hook, line, and sinker. </p>

You&#39;re looking for anything that will make it fit your narrative which is that it&#39;s a false flag. So much stuff is posted on here that is just plain bullshit (not something you can be skeptical about, just complete proven lies) and so many of you eat it up because it either comes from non mainstream news or because it fits your view. The people in this subreddit tend to believe everything that is mainstream news is a lie and anything non mainstream has to have truth to it.

<p>very fair. 1 in 10 is high. just was using it as an example. maybe not even 1 in 100, but the point attempting to be made is that there may be that one instance where something just isnt right. </p>

<p>and, for all the people here that buy into everything being a false flag there are an equal number number of people who belive that absolutely no events have external influences. there are though a number of people who are in the middle of that inverted bell curve. those are members of /conspiracy that use this sub becuase there isnt really another sub that acts as an outlet for this kind of discussion. </p>

<p>San Bernardino specifically though is a really sketchy event so yeah, most of us say it&#39;s a false flag, and rightfully so. </p>

<p>Edit: And don&#39;t throw on the &quot;nobody died&quot; thing. Only a small percentage of people think nobody died at all events like this.

    <div class="md"><p>My friend and I have an idea about what happened at Sandy Hook, but I don&#39;t see this particular scenario talked about often.</p>

<p>My best theory about it right now is that Sandy Hook was a witness protection type situation. High value targets and their families lived in that town, and their kids all went to the same school. That&#39;s the reason for the security doors, and the routine evac drills. (I think they were routine, IIRC.)</p>

<p>What happened was some kind of professional &quot;hit&quot; in retaliation against either the  feds or the families themselves. The government couldn&#39;t let the truth out for various reasons.  Among them, it would have revealed the nature of their witness programs along with their vulnerability. The reputation of the witness program would be sunk, and no one would ever cooperate with the gov since safety could not be guaranteed.</p>

<p>In the cover up, actors were substituted for the real victims to preserve anonymity of the survivors and families still in the program. Furthermore, a false shooter had to be created to explain the shooting and &quot;save face&quot; for the feds from having fallen victim to an organized hit.</p>

<p>As far as other possible false flags, they may have been totally staged. But this cover-up scenario makes sense to me as far as Sandy Hook is concerned.</p>

<p>It seems possible that SB is similarly a combination of some elements committing the act and others simply supporting the subsequent cover-up out of necessity.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but being a person who is aware of this, you are able to discern which things they say hold value or which things are just hearsay, ignorance, opinion etc. Also, you can compare ALL of the raw data pouring in against itself, to determine which themes and narratives are most common among people in a specific area etc, which is far more accurate than a one-sided news reported written by one person and regurgitated by an actor.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the problem with the &quot;conspiracy&quot; argument. People just look at the facts of each independent event as if it doesn&#39;t take a large sample of information from a variety of incidents and sources to understand when something is even out of place.</p>

<p>The narrative is so much more broad than an individual attack. To insist that of all the things we have witnessed recently none of them had a covert purpose or were perpetrated by subversive bureaucracies or politicians is naive and downright wrong.  You think these liars and criminals are going to come out and tell you the truth? Why? If you think some random innocent civilian tweeting keywords who barely understands how internet surveillance or search engines work who is naively sharing their opinion is lying for a person to find it by searching that&#39;s highly doubtful. You can also search their post history to set a context of their ideologies or beliefs to see if they are reasonable or have one-sided biases. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the shitty thing about it is i completely agree with you, and this case... this case right here has the only evidence i&#39;ve seen so far of some seriously hinky shit going down... yet these goofballs have cried wolf so many fucking times in the past that nobody takes them seriously.</p>

<p>i was listening to the scanner audio from the start of this thing, they were clearly looking for 3 people in body armor... multiple witnesses said they saw 3 different people in body armor before the cops got there moments before the shooting started.</p>

<p>weather all 3 went into the room where the shooting went down, i dunno... but they were looking for 3 people.</p>

<p>then suddenly it was 2 and everyone who thinks otherwise is crazy...</p>

<p>if the last 87 cases of anything happening weren&#39;t accompanied with a wackjob conspiracy theory... it might be possible for people to view this one and entertain alternative explanations...</p>

<p>but even me, a guy who knows something ain&#39;t right here... am put off by fact that it puts me under the same tent as people who think there were no kids at sandy hook, or that george bushes brother in-law was painting walls of the twin towers with thermite paint or whatever the fuck the theory of the month is on that pile of horseshit theory is going with lately...</p>

<p>it sucks... the one time i want to believe there is a &quot;conspiracy&quot; i find myself not wanting to be associated with the only people who would ask the right questions.</p>

<p>you fuckers have done this to yourselves with all your nonsense.</p>

<p>So because I easily dismiss your nonsense, you want to put it on me to bring up witness statements saying that they saw TWO shooters and that nothing shown to us shows them saying THREE shooters.</p>

<p>We&#39;re talking about low level county civil servants and office staff from San Bernardino. San Bernardino County Sheriffs and San Bernardino Police. Not NSA operatives that plan and execute complicated &quot;false flag&quot; operations (that&#39;s where I assume you are going with this, you always do) and keep it secret for a lifetime.</p>

<p>EVEN more so, people that will keep it a secret that they were part of an operation that had their friends and co-workers killed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DID you even read my posts, AT ALL?</p>

<p>We sat at work and instead of working we watched the coverage on the local news stations - CBS 2 and 9 and ABC7 as everything happened 60 miles away.</p>

<p>YES...they were looking for 3 unconfirmed shooters. But nobody knew what was going on at the time. Chaos. Confusion. Rumor. 2nd hand information. </p>

<p>Until they could get a picture from the witness statements, once they had evac&#39;ed everybody to a triage area, they put the word out that there were TWO shooters.</p>

<p>During the chase and shootout that afternoon, after they wacked out the jihad wife and her idiot husband, there was a guy that happened to be right there who ran from that scene. He was not in the Ford SUV with the terrorists. The weren&#39;t sure where he came from. It later turned out that he was running to get clear of the firefight and the general area. He happened to be right there when it happened and just split.</p>

<p>They also had two other guys handcuffed and sitting on  curb just down the street from the firefight. Two boneheads that ran across the pursuit and followed along shooting cell phone video. They were stopped about a block away from the shootout. The cops didn&#39;t know who they were at the time and detained them.</p>

<p>CONFUSION. CHAOS. FEAR. SHOCK. ADRENALINE. RUMORS. UNCERTAINTY. LACK OF SOLID INFORMATION,...ETC....</p>

<p>It happens right after ALL of these mass shooting/stabbing events.  </p>

<p>Its funny that you guys think that if there were a 3rd shooter, that they would be able to keep it secret...again, you aren&#39;t talking about NSA/CIA agents...you are talking about low level county civil servants and local cops...</p>

<p>Give it a couple more weeks and the </p>

<p>No. Not 2nd hand information. 3 different <strong>first hand witnesses</strong> said they saw 3 men. That&#39;s court admissible evidence, eyewitness testimony. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I listen to eye witness reports, live Twitter feeds, unedited photographs and other sources of RAW information. That&#39;s the difference, consume your veggies raw not cooked.</p>

<p>The mainstream media coaxes entire nations into war against one another murdering millions of people. but yeah  totally default your opinion in that direction.</p>

<p>Furthermore, when did I say I trusted any particular sources? All I stated was a distrust for mainstream news. Both sides can be liars, why believe either? Again circling back to my point. Why does your opinion use mainstream media as a measuring stick for truth?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So since authority is not always reliable which is more important, evidence or what an authority says?  If the evidence and an authority were each telling you two different things which would you choose to trust?</p>
