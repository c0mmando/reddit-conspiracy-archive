       I've never been more utterly flabbergasted, over and over again, because while watching it you just cannot fathom how BLATANTLY corrupt they're behaving.

      <p>
       It is truly unbelievable. There is so much insanity regarding so many aspects of these cases. How that  judge was able to flat out deny an appeal is beyond me. Small town justice at its finest.

       I swear your mouth will be hanging open at multiple times. Just when you think you've seen it all, NOPE. The tampered blood samples and the kid's lawyer's investigator making the dude draw pictures of the "scene", admitting guilt that was never there. Total conflict of interest because he was also working the other case. And it's sad because half of the skeezy shit they pulled could've been solved by having the defense be able to properly communicate with each other. Like the mom of Steven's nephew being unable to put a stop to their own lawyer's coercion tactics. Their jail-to-mom phone conversations were so cringeworthy and detrimental because they were both so dumb (neither knew what "inconsistent" means, shit like that). Then of course you get blessed with a whole jury made up of that same class of folks. You mix small-town ignorance of bureaucracy with the save-our-ass-no-matter-what determination of both the law enforcement and the courts, and this is what happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't understand how a case like this can just be buried at the local level because they somehow give the only power to appeal approval to the motherfucker judges who were the problem in the first place. I never realized until watching this how such an ass-backwards case that stinks to high heaven can simply stop at that level.

       The most obvious part for me of the massive level corruption throughout was the interrogation and subsequent confession of the nephew. I mean the kid barely registers a normal I.Q, yet they pin him down on his own repeatedly and feed him coercion for three hours until he breaks, then to top it all off, the judge allows his confession and flat out denies any coercion or low emotional intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       At that point I was emotionally sick and knew something dirty was up. That kid was clearly fucked over by two manipulative assholes until he was exhausted and caved in. He didn't even understand what he'd done or said, asking ten minutes later if he could go home and finish his school work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Double it up with the fact that the nephew was Avery's one true defence witness...

       I mean, you can literally walk out of the United States so as long as you can get away before you get locked up, it is that easy. Are your job choices limited without proper documentation? Sure. Do millions of people live just fine with it? They do indeed. It's not an ideal scenario, it's a "the man decided to do his best to lay my ass out, I gotta bail or die". I actually would probably try live in the far north in the woods (I used to work in the Northern Territories and loved it up there), but there are plenty of places in south America that would work.

       I was thinking more on the lines of leaving the country officially...but if you're escaping the police and judicial system then you wouldn't want to leave officially..you'd want to disappear.

       I figure if the law is really setting you up and doing it in a big way like this, they'll be keeping close tabs on your movements, possibly tracking your finances or your phone. But if they're not doing direct surveillance, there's not much they can do to find you if you cut all your modern ties. Ditch the phone, leave the plastic. I keep a bit of cash in my bug out bag just in the rare circumstances that I would be unable or unwilling for some reason to drain my bank accounts. If you go south, the dollar is still strong in many countries, you could live relatively comfortably for a bit on not much. I have really bad paranoia and one of the ways I deal with it is preparing myself to handle scenarios that make me paranoid. A whole lot of my plans do end with me sneaking my way up north, procuring traps and basic equipment to set up a small log shack. No one finds you up there, even if they know you're there, if you get lost you are fucked and they'll do a local search but I was literally told on my first day, if I left the facility on my own and entered the woods and got myself lost, there was virtually no chance of them finding me because the woods are so sprawling. If no one knew to look there, there is no doubt in my mind you could disappear until the day you die, and you can have a fine life if you enjoy the outdoors like I do. Occasionally slip into a small town to pick up supplies you can't make, maybe make it a few different towns to avoid raising suspicion, sell pelts if necessary for a bit of money. I've never been to south america, but I assume it can't be very difficult to find agricultural work of some sort on a farm where they don't ask questions and maybe throw a hot meal and a cot in an outbuilding your way. I do speak decent conversational spanish and I try to keep it fresh just in case. Because you never know when someone will decide to deep six you.

       Honestly majority of the young people now think the town is dirty. That's just because they are letting it blind them from all the good the town has to offer. It was a raw mistake on the city itself but the world goes on.

       Your favourite laywer, Ken Kratz, is apparently receiving death threats.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was also dismissed for inappropriately texting a sexual abuse victim... aka dick pics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate every second I hear him speak in the series and now that I know he's as slimy as he seems... UGH.

       Kratz should never be allowed to use the word science again. I have never wanted to punch through my TV so bad. So much cringe throughout, fucking horrifying. Only started yesterday and I'm on episode 9 now. I need a mental break

       This whole SHOW is a conspiracy. It's a meta conspiracy, but it definitely is a great example of compartmentalization.

       The most obvious part for me of the massive level corruption throughout was the interrogation and subsequent confession of the nephew. I mean the kid barely registers a normal I.Q, yet they pin him down on his own repeatedly and feed him coercion for three hours until he breaks, then to top it all off, the judge allows his confession and flat out denies any coercion or low emotional intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       At that point I was emotionally sick and knew something dirty was up. That kid was clearly fucked over by two manipulative assholes until he was exhausted and caved in. He didn't even understand what he'd done or said, asking ten minutes later if he could go home and finish his school work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Double it up with the fact that the nephew was Avery's one true defence witness...
