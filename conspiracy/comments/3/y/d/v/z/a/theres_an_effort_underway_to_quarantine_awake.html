You&#39;ll see there&#39;s an effort underway to move us to Voat, a place with very few posters and readers, compared to Reddit which is one of the biggest sites on the Internet, in fact Voat is actually on the decline, people are now leaving them.  </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/RgiJwP1.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/RgiJwP1.jpg</a></p>

<p>And if Voat ever does get popular through some miracle, the manipulators will move there too, they go wherever the people go, just as we too need to be whether the masses are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess this is the reality we all have to face. Fuck it, speak out. I know I&#39;m probably on a few lists as it is. Reddit selling my info, doesn&#39;t really mean shit, if the audience is greater here and people can hear what I have to say and possibly learn or correct me. Maybe, it would be more symbolic? IDK, I see what you are saying though, divide and conquer and Voat is questionable (imo). Interesting times we live in....</p>

<p>I agree. </p>

<p>Although I think he was coerced into coming forward with this information. It wasn&#39;t truly his idea. He was pushed into doing it much the same way the FBI radicalizes people. Give them the idea, give them the tools, let them take over from there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s likely that google is already selling your info. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to learn that what reddit is announcing they will start to do has already been happening and they just decided to make it public. 
It&#39;s basically the same as facebook and the product is the user. 
Voat sucks. Reddit has sucked for the past few years. The good news is that I&#39;m sure something else will come along that&#39;s better. Until then I will continue to not give a shit and express my opinions here and break down the ignorance. The same has been gamed for a long time but people are continually being woke up and that has the owners worried. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s one: All these shootings are fake. Look how many have happened during Obama&#39;s terms compared to all other Presidents and you&#39;ll notice a significant anomaly.</p>

<p>Nobody really shot up Sandy Hook or San Bernardino. Actors were used. The point is to push the gun grab. Which apparently Obama has already agreed to give away in some trade deal with the UN. If so, an excuse would be needed to separate us from our right to bear arms. A very very good excuse, like how children are being shot and marathons are being bombed, so because innocent people are being hurt, they must register us and crossfile us and monitor us and remove our guns. </p>

<p>So that we can&#39;t resist in any meaningful way when they get worse and worse and act more and more violently. </p>

<p>We have innocent citizens being killed and maimed by police here at home while our military does the same to innocent citizens on the other side of the planet, all in the name of more and more profit for the already too rich Elites, and we&#39;re the ones who must be disarmed?

<p>I feel that needed to be applied more generally. It doesn&#39;t matter which platform we use. The pressure against us has increased progressively everywhere on the internet since at least 2009.

<p>A hell of a lot more than you think.</p>

<p>One of the features of any online forum is that the majority of people that read never post. The &#39;Lurkers&#39; are the &#39;silent majority&#39;, and they can be influenced by the &#39;vocal minority&#39;.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve <em>never</em> been able to speak to a potential audience of millions. Neither have you. The only <em>chance</em> you have of speaking to so many people is on sites like this.</p>

<p>Bullshit. They haven&#39;t spent millions of dollars and man-hours manipulating sites like this because they have no real world effect.</p>

<p>What paranoia? You seem to have mistaken me for someone else.</p>

<p>The &#39;real world&#39; <em>is</em> the Internet now. No library within a thousand kilometers of me has as much information available for me to read as the Internet.

<p>No, I&#39;m linking to the source documents on government websites (for example), while you&#39;re telling people on the street that if they go dig out the document in person they can read the same thing... the difference is I make it so easy for them to read the truth that there is practically no effort at all.</p>

<p>Most protests today are organised and publicised on social media sites like this... but carry on... tell us how being &quot;kettled&quot; on the street is so much more effective than talking to thousands and potentially millions of people online?</p>

<p>Reddit is one of the biggest sites on the net, if a post gets to the top of /conspiracy that means 10&#39;s of thousands of people read it.</p>

<p>Nope. No amount of body language could make that sentence make sense. I see you&#39;re one of those people that can&#39;t explain themselves with words.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have that problem, so I can&#39;t really empathise.</p>

<p>One of the ways I know that something is &quot;what [I] actually believe&quot; is because I believe it. How do <em>you</em> know something is &quot;what you actually believe&quot;? When someone tells you?</p>

<p>Not really. I have been banned from <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> simply for saying the things I say here. Clearly someone else thought silencing me was rather important. </p>

<p>Many thousand. What is your point?</p>

<p>Most of them, yes. The few banned for spam or simply trolling aren&#39;t, but the ones banned for sharing their opinions are very important. They are the people that show not everyone has swallowed the coolaid.</p>

<p>Hell no. When the ants are in the hive, a bit of gas and one match will do the job. Try killing a million ants one at a time. They breed faster...</p>
