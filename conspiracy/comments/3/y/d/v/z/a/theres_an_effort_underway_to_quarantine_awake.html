       One of the key goals of the manipulators here is to move /conspiracy away from Reddit altogether, they're constantly attacking us here using all kinds of tactics, they don't like us being nextdoor to subs with millions of compliant propagandized people, often influencing them.  You'll see there's an effort underway to move us to Voat, a place with very few posters and readers, compared to Reddit which is one of the biggest sites on the Internet, in fact Voat is actually on the decline, people are now leaving them.

      </p>
      <p>
       And if Voat ever does get popular through some miracle, the manipulators will move there too, they go wherever the people go, just as we too need to be whether the masses are.

       I get what you are saying (and agree). But, the one thing that pisses me off, are the new policy changes. I know other sites sell my info, but I don't talk about some of this stuff (we all do) on other sites... Voat is not viable, so what do we do?

       Myself I assumed I was already on their list somewhere, but hopefully too far down to be worth going after.  Even if I do end up assassinated for exposing the truth about vaccines, it will have been for the greater good of humanity.

       I guess this is the reality we all have to face. Fuck it, speak out. I know I'm probably on a few lists as it is. Reddit selling my info, doesn't really mean shit, if the audience is greater here and people can hear what I have to say and possibly learn or correct me. Maybe, it would be more symbolic? IDK, I see what you are saying though, divide and conquer and Voat is questionable (imo). Interesting times we live in....

       We are hard to deal with in great numbers, I always suspected this was why the Edward Snowden story was fed to us i.e. "We are watching everything you do!", it's an old strategy used by religions "God is always watching!" to scare people into doing what they are told.  Fear like that can cut hugely decrease the number of people posting and emailing conspiracy/whistleblower information, in chess terms it's like taking the queen.

       I truly think Snowden was a part of that paralysis. But, apparently, some people (even here) do not think that. Who knows, I'm moving more an more away from the digital/technology. I like nature..

       I'd agree that the media response to Snowden has "framed the debate" to push people to the conclusion "they're watching everything, so we must be careful not to be seen doing/saying ... ", but I do not think Snowden himself was part of a 'conspiracy'.

       They can't control Snowden, but they
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       control how he and what he says are perceived.

       Although I think he was coerced into coming forward with this information. It wasn't truly his idea. He was pushed into doing it much the same way the FBI radicalizes people. Give them the idea, give them the tools, let them take over from there.

       There is certainly a possibility that happened. But I doubt it. Snowden exposed techniques and capabilities they would rather not have exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of the media does a great job of letting people know they are being watched, without giving them concrete information that could be used to avoid it.

       It's likely that google is already selling your info. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that what reddit is announcing they will start to do has already been happening and they just decided to make it public. 
It's basically the same as facebook and the product is the user. 
Voat sucks. Reddit has sucked for the past few years. The good news is that I'm sure something else will come along that's better. Until then I will continue to not give a shit and express my opinions here and break down the ignorance. The same has been gamed for a long time but people are continually being woke up and that has the owners worried.

       If we were on the street holding signs, instead of being on a website posting comments, it would be called "
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettling">
        Kettling
       </a>
       ", and VOAT would be called a

        Free speech zone

       .

       It may be online rather than on the streets, but it is essentially the same thing, IMHO.

       Here's one: All these shootings are fake. Look how many have happened during Obama's terms compared to all other Presidents and you'll notice a significant anomaly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody really shot up Sandy Hook or San Bernardino. Actors were used. The point is to push the gun grab. Which apparently Obama has already agreed to give away in some trade deal with the UN. If so, an excuse would be needed to separate us from our right to bear arms. A very very good excuse, like how children are being shot and marathons are being bombed, so because innocent people are being hurt, they must register us and crossfile us and monitor us and remove our guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that we can't resist in any meaningful way when they get worse and worse and act more and more violently.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have innocent citizens being killed and maimed by police here at home while our military does the same to innocent citizens on the other side of the planet, all in the name of more and more profit for the already too rich Elites, and we're the ones who must be disarmed? It's a damn joke.

       So one group says Voat is better, go to Voat. The other group says Reddit is better, stay at reddit. Why not just do BOTH and force the manipulators to work harder and spend more money. In fact you should be trying to push truth into every possible corner of the internet. The more light we shine on this fiasco, the less shadow these fucking cockroaches will have to hide in.

       So wait, your logic is that because the sidebar never shows more than about 700 people on this sub
       <em>
        at any one time
       </em>
       , that no more than 700 people could possibly visit here?

       I can be visiting this sub every 15 minutes, but in between those visits I'm not counted as "being here". The sidebar shows people who have hit the sub in the last few minutes. It doesn't count how many different people visit in a day.

       I frequent both.   Voat inflates and deflates based on reddit internal struggles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Voats main core is something of an 8chan/old reddit hybrid.   Much more willing to say literally anything.  Its refreshing to get an unsmoothed version of peoples opinions.
       <br/>
       Reddits downvote brigades and the SJW Overthrow have made it relatively inhospitable for anyone who doesnt fit the mold.

       I feel that needed to be applied more generally. It doesn't matter which platform we use. The pressure against us has increased progressively everywhere on the internet since at least 2009. In my experience the resources spent on each site are usually dependent on popularity and traffic.

       With that said however, I believe you are right that Voat is particularly heavily compromised. I bought into the hype about it too, and discovered the disparate reality with a thud.

       Oh please OP n putin, get a room. Who gives two shits about internet "posts". This whole site like all the rest are echo chambers. People come here after they had some real world experience that led them to want more information and or perspectives.

       Anything anyone posts is preaching to the choir by default. How many individuals do you honestly think your electronic communications have touched?

       One of the features of any online forum is that the majority of people that read never post. The 'Lurkers' are the 'silent majority', and they can be influenced by the 'vocal minority'.

       No, I'm linking to the source documents on government websites (for example), while you're telling people on the street that if they go dig out the document in person they can read the same thing... the difference is I make it so easy for them to read the truth that there is practically no effort at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can stand on the street yelling your head off, and people will just assume you're a nut and move on.. I can link to the source document and all they have to do is click.

       Jesus, at least I know you're the peddler and not the peddled to.  In case anyone can't see the obvious logical fallacy above, even in 2015

       Funny, I never said they weren't. I said I have no access to them. It's kind of hard to dig through American government archives in New Zealand.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A soapbox is a raised platform on which one stands to make an impromptu speech, often about a political subject. The term originates from the days when speakers would elevate themselves by standing on a wooden crate originally used for shipment of soap or other dry goods from a manufacturer to a retail store.

       Most protests today are organised and publicised on social media sites like this... but carry on... tell us how being "kettled" on the street is so much more effective than talking to thousands and potentially millions of people online?

       I will struggle to believe that your post is serious as all of it is so easy to debunk, but it's so easy I don't even think it's worth my time as everyone here will have already seen right through it.

       I've been posting here on and off for some time. The reality of the situation is that all the time myself or anyone else spends "online" is time wasted in cyberspace.

      <p>
       Except for occasional comments now and then I find that having real world face to face interactions are much much more effective at learning/teaching.

       But by all means, don't mind me. I'm sure you're different and most of the things you write online are meaningful and we'll received by thousands. You certainly aren't being misinterpreted or broadly generalized by those who disagree with your online writing.

       As a matter of fact I bet you write such eloquent prose that you have no need for emotional inflection or contextual tone coupled with body language. Yeah you're right you caught me, I tried to squash your postings power.

       It's impossible to take you seriously, all the awake people I know gained their knowledge online, from people who you believe were 'wasting' their time in cyberspace.  Without the Internet I'd believe in vaccines and think that the West needed to send troops to Syria

        Great... you keep teaching the tens of people that talk to you face to face, while we'll keep teaching the tens of thousands that read online forums like this.

       I travel for a living asshole, I meet strangers everyday. If you weren't such a reclusive autist maybe you could talk to someone you don't know about your beliefs and not have a panic attack.

       simply for saying the things I say here. Clearly someone else thought silencing me was rather important.

       You seem to think

       Most of them, yes. The few banned for spam or simply trolling aren't, but the ones banned for sharing their opinions are very important. They are the people that show not everyone has swallowed the coolaid.

       Hell no. When the ants are in the hive, a bit of gas and one match will do the job. Try killing a million ants one at a time. They breed faster...

       If we were on the street holding signs, instead of being on a website posting comments, it would be called "
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettling">
        Kettling

       ", and VOAT would be called a
