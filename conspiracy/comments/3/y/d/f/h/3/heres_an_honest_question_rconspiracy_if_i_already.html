<p>There is skepticism about the war on drugs, war on terrorism, political/financial corruption, etc. There&#39;s just more evidence to raise skepticism there. It&#39;s not a vendetta, it&#39;s data. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to trust others sometimes. Maybe you don&#39;t agree philosophically, but that&#39;s a lonely, lonely road if you don&#39;t. Human civilization is over without others. </p>

<p>So now the question is: how do you decide who to trust? You need to set some standards or figure out a method.</p>

<p>Personally, I value logical consistency. And do you know why? That&#39;s what I think my best quality is. You end up trusting people you <strong>already</strong> empathize with. </p>

<p>So to answer OP&#39;s question, it&#39;s more about <strong>sharing</strong> the distrust for the government than it is trusting the faceless idiot. </p>

<p>Who is banning encryption gonna help? Who is CISA gonna help, huh? Who do free rectal exams on every fucking airport benefit, huh?</p>

<p>So, if they&#39;re not listening to the people and experts on the respective fields, and are quite literally swimming against the stream trying to enforce these policies, why if not because of corruption or incompetence? Either way, then need to go, not just out of the office, but to jail!</p>

<p>It&#39;s very simple. You don&#39;t need evidence... booohohoh there is no evidence, just because they got good at hiding doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re innocent.</p>
