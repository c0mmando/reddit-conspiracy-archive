       How come magazines like Skeptic are never really skeptical about anything they should be, like the official story of 911, the Holocaust, Pearl Harbor, the war on drugs, or whatnot.  All these so-called skeptics really just reinforce a new orthodoxy of pseudo-scientific belief.

       That's not really true. Skeptics have spent time on those topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is skepticism about the war on drugs, war on terrorism, political/financial corruption, etc. There's just more evidence to raise skepticism there. It's not a vendetta, it's data.

       I disagree. There is skepticism about topics the elite don't care about, and then there is skepticism about the things they do.

       Honestly, you cannot trust anyone really (but your self), whether on the internet or IRL. But, you can listen to people and do your own research. Genuine people are pretty easy to weed out from liars/mis/disinfo artists. Anyone who says they are "the authority/a specialist/trust me/blah blah", I would take what they say with a grain of salt.

       Sure, but you (your self) are really the only one you can fully trust (in the end, we come into this world alone, we die alone). That was my point. You do not need to isolate yourself, but listen to others and come up with your own opinion on various things. You do not need to trust others, in order to hear what they are saying.

       Never entirely subscribe to someone else's b.s. Also, never entirely subscribe to your own b.s. because in an ever changing universe you're almost certainly, sooner or later, going to prove yourself wrong.

       You have to trust others sometimes. Maybe you don't agree philosophically, but that's a lonely, lonely road if you don't. Human civilization is over without others.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now the question is: how do you decide who to trust? You need to set some standards or figure out a method.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I value logical consistency. And do you know why? That's what I think my best quality is. You end up trusting people you
       <strong>
        already
       </strong>
       empathize with.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to answer OP's question, it's more about
       <strong>
        sharing
       </strong>
       the distrust for the government than it is trusting the faceless idiot.

       Well yeah, we evolved to have instincts because they are helpful at some point. Our instincts are hyper vigilant. - you might jump if you catch a spider on you, but it's probably not venomous. You might see a face in the bushes in your peripherals, but it's probably not a tiger.

       If our politicians are not corrupt and are working in the best interest for the
       <em>
        majority
       </em>
       then they are the most useless, incompetent bunch of retards you have ever seen employed anywhere. Not just in America, the whole western world basically, EU is the same.

       Who is banning encryption gonna help? Who is CISA gonna help, huh? Who do free rectal exams on every fucking airport benefit, huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if they're not listening to the people and experts on the respective fields, and are quite literally swimming against the stream trying to enforce these policies, why if not because of corruption or incompetence? Either way, then need to go, not just out of the office, but to jail!
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very simple. You don't need evidence... booohohoh there is no evidence, just because they got good at hiding doesn't mean they're innocent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't trust me, but if you can't see they're all corrupt, we have nothing to talk about

       Perhaps because I would have nothing to gain?  I'm not going to push info on anyone.  Also, it's not really about "trust."  This whole section of reddit is about making up your own mind, anyone who says it's not is selling something.

       I'm pretty sure no one here asked you to
       <em>
        trust
       </em>
       them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people attempt to provide evidence, or at least logical arguments for their beliefs/actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only governments tell you to just "trust" them. They know what you don't (because they keep it secret) so you
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to "just trust them"... according to them.

       Nobody wants you to believe here, so your question is meaningless to be honest.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub honest preachers ( yes, there is disinfo spread around but that is because there is also quality ) will even tell you, please, don't believe anything. Read, explore subjects via other means, confront yourself if you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your argument is easily applied to anyone or anything if you wish so, we can't be totally sure about our beliefs no matter what, only quality self-research can fix that to a healthy degree. In the end it's your life so trust who you want lol.

       The bellwether for me is the Holocaust. If someone here considers himself awake and aware, but he doesn't understand that the Holocaust is a modern myth, and that much of it is absurd and untrue, I can't take anything he says seriously. Anyone who has truly broken free from the mind control would know that the Holocaust is mythology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another bellwether is man-made global warming. If a person claims to be awake, but still things AGW is real, I can't take him seriously. Anyone truly awake knows that AGW is a total scam and a fraud, and has been from Day One.
