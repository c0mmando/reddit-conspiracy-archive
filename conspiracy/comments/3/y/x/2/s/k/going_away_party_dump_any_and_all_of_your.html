       </strong>
       A comprehensive link explaining the whole picture in the middle east and peppered with videos. We train extremists, use them, and discard them when we're done. It started with the mujahideen against the Soviets, we installed Saddam Hussein, we created Al qaeda and now they've been re-branded as "ISIS".
      </p>
      <p>
       My question: If the beheading videos are fake - are any stories of them in combat real ?

       Turkish support of ISIS and oppression of journalists:
      </p>
      <p>
       Stories critical of the Turkish government took off in 2013 with the Gezi Park protests:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gezi_Park_protests">
        'A wave of demonstrations and civil unrest in Turkey began on 28 May 2013, initially to contest the urban development plan for Istanbul's Taksim Gezi Park. The protests were sparked by outrage at the violent eviction of a sit-in at the park protesting the plan. Subsequently, supporting protests and strikes took place across Turkey, protesting a wide range of concerns at the core of which were issues of freedom of the press, of expression, assembly, and the government's encroachment on Turkey's secularism.'
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the Turkish government banned youtube and twitter:

       Because the Turkish government was planning on staging a false flag attack to justify intervention in Syria:

       Truth about life in Libya and the 2011 military intervention:
      </p>
      <p>
       By: Garikai Chengu
      </p>
      <p>
       Contrary to popular belief, Libya , which western media described as “Gaddafi’s military dictatorship” was in actual fact one of the world’s most democratic States.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1977 the people of Libya proclaimed the Jamahiriya or “government of the popular masses by themselves and for themselves.” The Jamahiriya was a higher form of direct democracy with ‘the People as President.’ Traditional institutions of government were disbanded and abolished, and power belonged to the people directly through various committees and congresses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nation State of Libya was divided into several small communities that were essentially “mini-autonomous States” within a State. These autonomous States had control over their districts and could make a range of decisions including how to allocate oil revenue and budgetary funds. Within these mini autonomous States, the three main bodies of Libya ‘s democracy were Local Committees, People’s Congresses and Executive Revolutionary Councils.
      </p>
      <p>
       Source: “Journey to the Libyan Jamahiriya” (20-26 May 2000)
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2009, Mr. Gaddafi invited the New York Times to Libya to spend two weeks observing the nation’s direct democracy. Even the New York Times, that was always highly critical of Colonel Gaddafi, conceded that in Libya, the intention was that “everyone is involved in every decision…Tens of thousands of people take part in local committee meetings to discuss issues and vote on everything from foreign treaties to building schools.” The purpose of these committee meetings was to build a broad based national consensus.
      </p>
      <p>
       One step up from the Local Committees were the People’s Congresses. Representatives from all 800 local committees around the country would meet several times a year at People’s Congresses, in Mr. Gaddafi’s hometown of Sirte, to pass laws based on what the people said in their local meetings. These congresses had legislative power to write new laws, formulate economic and public policy as well as ratify treaties and agreements.
      </p>
      <p>
       All Libyans were allowed to take part in local committees meetings and at times Colonel Gaddafi was criticised. In fact, there were numerous occasions when his proposals were rejected by popular vote and the opposite was approved and put forward for legislation.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, on many occasions Mr. Gaddafi proposed the abolition of capital punishment and he pushed for home schooling over traditional schools. However, the People’s Congresses wanted to maintain the death penalty and classic schools, and ultimately the will of the People’s Congresses prevailed. Similarly, in 2009, Colonel Gaddafi put forward a proposal to essentially abolish the central government altogether and give all the oil proceeds directly to each family. The People’s Congresses rejected this idea too.
      </p>
      <p>
       One step up from the People’s Congresses were the Executive Revolutionary Councils. These Revolutionary Councils were elected by the People’s Congresses and were in charge of implementing policies put forward by the people. Revolutionary Councils were accountable only to ordinary citizens and may have been changed or recalled by them at any time. Consequently, decisions taken by the People’s Congresses and implemented by the Executive Revolutionary Councils reflected the sovereign will of the whole people, and not merely that of any particular class, faction, tribe or individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Libyan direct democracy system utilized the word ‘elevation’ rather than‘election’, and avoided the political campaigning that is a feature of traditional political parties and benefits only the bourgeoisie’s well-heeled and well-to-do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike in the West, Libyans did not vote once every four years for a President and local parliamentarian who would then make all decisions for them. Ordinary Libyans made decisions regarding foreign, domestic and economic policy themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several western commentators have rightfully pointed out that the unique Jamahiriya system had certain drawbacks, inter alia, regarding attendance, initiative to speak up, and sufficient supervision. Nevertheless, it is clear that Libya conceptualized sovereignty and democracy in a different and progressive way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democracy is not just about elections or political parties. True democracy is also about human rights. During the NATO bombardment of Libya , western media conveniently forgot to mention that the United Nations had just prepared a lengthy dossier praising Mr. Gaddafi’s human rights achievements. The UN report commended Libya for bettering its “legal protections” for citizens, making human rights a “priority,” improving women’s rights, educational opportunities and access to housing. During Mr. Gaddafi’s era housing was considered a human right. Consequently, there was virtually no homelessness or Libyans living under bridges. How many Libyan homes and bridges did NATO destroy?
      </p>
      <p>
       One area where the United Nations Human Rights Council praised Mr. Gaddafi profusely is women’s rights. Unlike many other nations in the Arab world, women in Libya had the right to education, hold jobs, divorce, hold property and have an income. When Colonel Gaddafi seized power in 1969, few women went to university. Today more than half of Libya ‘s university students are women. One of the first laws Mr. Gaddafi passed in 1970 was an equal pay for equal work law, only a few years after a similar law was passed in the U.S. In fact, Libyan working mothers enjoyed a range of benefits including cash bonuses for children, free day care, free health care centres and retirement at 55.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democracy is not merely about holding elections simply to choose which particular representatives of the elite class should rule over the masses. True democracy is about democratising the economy and giving economic power to the majority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact is, the west has shown that unfettered free markets and genuinely free elections simply cannot co-exist. Organized greed always defeats disorganized democracy. How can capitalism and democracy co-exist if one concentrates wealth and power in the hands of few, and the other seeks to spread power and wealth among many? Mr. Gaddafi’s Jamahiriya however, sought to spread economic power amongst the downtrodden many rather than just the privileged few.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to Colonel Gaddafi, King Idris let Standard Oil essentially write Libya ‘s petroleum laws. Mr. Gaddafi put an end to all of that. Money from oil proceeds was deposited directly into every Libyan citizen’s bank account. One wonders if Exxon Mobil and British Petroleum will continue this practice under the new democratic Libya ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Democracy is not merely about elections or political parties. True democracy is also about equal opportunity through education and the right to life through access to health care. Therefore, isn’t it ironic that America supposedly bombarded Libya to spread democracy, but increasingly education in America is becoming a privilege not a right and ultimately a debt sentence. If a bright and talented child in the richest nation on earth cannot afford to go to the best schools, society has failed that child. In fact, for young people the world over, education is a passport to freedom. Any nation that makes one pay for such a passport is only free for the rich but not the poor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Mr. Gaddafi, education was a human right and it was free for all Libyans. If a Libyan was unable to find employment after graduation the State would pay that person the average salary of their profession. For millions of Americans health care is also increasingly becoming a privilege not a right. A recent study by Harvard Medical School estimates that lack of health insurance causes 44,789 excess deaths annually in America . Under Mr. Gaddafi, health care was a human right and it was free for all Libyans. Thus, with regards to health care, education and economic justice, is America in any position to export democracy to Libya or should America have taken a leaf out of Libya ‘s book?
      </p>
      <p>
       Muammar Gaddafi inherited one of the poorest nations in Africa . However, by the time he was assassinated, Libya was unquestionably Africa ‘s most prosperous nation. Libya had the highest GDP per capita and life expectancy in Africa and less people lived below the poverty line than in the Netherlands . Libyans did not only enjoy free health care and free education, they also enjoyed free electricity and interest free loans. The price of petrol was around $0.14 per liter and 40 loaves of bread cost just $0.15. Consequently, the UN designated Libya the 53rd highest in the world in human development.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fundamental difference between western democratic systems and the Jamahiriya’s direct democracy is that in Libya citizens were given the chance to contribute directly to the decision-making process, not merely through elected representatives. Hence, all Libyans were allowed to voice their views directly – not in one parliament of only a few hundred elite politicians – but in hundreds of committees attended by tens of thousands of ordinary citizens. Far from being a military dictatorship, Libya under Mr. Gaddafi was Africa ‘s most prosperous democracy.

       Libya: 42 years of oppression?
      </p>
      <p>
       Having lived and worked in Libya from 2 weeks after the Revolution (or coup, as opponents call it) of September 1st 1969 for several years up until 1980, I feel I am able to provide some testimony as to the nature and achievements of the new regime that swept away a corrupt monarchy which condemned the majority of Libyans to poverty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever may be said about Gadaffi, I cannot understand how so many are referring to 42 years of oppression when, as I recall, the new leadership was greeted with something like euphoria in 1969 especially by the young some of whom I was teaching. I clearly remember my classes being cut short by my pupils eagerly streaming out of the classroom to join massive pro-government demonstrations. The new authority calling itself The Revolutionary Command Council initiated a socialist programme- first nationalising the oil companies, fixing a minimum wage, extending the welfare and health systems and slashing the obscene rents being charged by property owners. A limit was imposed on the rents that landlords could charge, fixing maximum rents at about one third of the pre-revolutionary level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tripoli untill then had been the most expensive city in the Middle East. Many large properties were taken over and let to the people at low rents. The vast sprawling shanty town just outside Tripoli was torn down and replaced by new workers' housing projects. The Kingdom of Libya became The Libyan Arab Republic and shortly after was re-named The Libyan Arab Socialist Jamahariyah (or State of the Masses). Later, a law was enacted making it illegal to own more than one house. I can recall an argument in one class with a student who attacked Gadaffi for this, with myself defending the law saying it would solve the housing problem in my country. With only about 20% literacy in 1969, by 1980 this had increased to over 90%. Education was given priority with a large proportion of the oil wealth being spent on new schools and colleges.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new government quickly demonstrated its anti-imperialist credentials by kicking the Americans out of the huge Wheelus Air Base for which they never forgave Gadaffi as it was their key base in the Mediterranean. Similarly Britain was expelled from its military base at El Adem, and the days on which these events happened became national holidays. In the first year the large Italian community which owed its origin to the fascist occupation was expelled from the country, and the commercial life of Tripoli which Italians had dominated came under the control of Libyans. Libya joined the socialist countries in giving support and aid to anti-imperialist movements, especially to the Palestinian cause and the struggle of the ANC against the apartheid regime in South Africa.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should be noted that Colonel Gadaffi was the first national leader whom Nelson Mandela visited after his release. When criticised for doing this, he countered by saying that Libya above all other countries had given the most support to the anti-apartheid movement and he wanted to thank the Libyan leader for this. Gadaffi outlined his concept of government in 'The Green Book', which essentially was an attempt to establish a form of government not based on representative institutions but on Peoples' Commitees which are supposed to deliver a form of grass roots directly participatory democracy. How effective this has been is difficult to assess, but it appears to have been a genuine attempt to empower ordinary Libyans.
      </p>
      <p>
       To say, as many in the media and Libyan dissidents are claiming, that Libyans have been enduring 42 years of oppression since 1st September 1969 is not borne out by my own experience of living and working in Libya. During the four years I spent there between 1969 and 1980 at different periods I never sensed any atmosphere of repression. In fact the few Libyans I did encounter who criticised the government did not appear afraid to voice their opinions and among the large number I mixed with, including the many Libyan friends my wife and I had, most expressed their support. There are claims that the east, particularly Benghazi, has not received equal treatment with the west of Libya and that a feeling of being discriminated against in more recent years has led to the growth of an opposition which saw the events in neighbouring Tunisia and Egypt as an opportunity to rise up against the regime. This may be the case, though it seems likely that Gadaffi still commands widespread support in the rest of Libya, especially Tripoli where the majority of the population live.
      </p>
      <p>
       The army, unlike in Tunisia and Egypt, has stayed largely loyal to the government and continues to fight bravely in spite of the airstrikes by NATO countries. Some will say that my experience of life in Libya was 31 years ago and that a lot could have changed since then and I have to accept that my knowledge of the history of the new Libya since 1980 is very limited. But I think that we need to be very suspicious of some of the negative propaganda furnished by the Western media.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conviction of Al Megrahi for the Lockerbie bombing is almost certainly unsafe as it is far more likely to have been the work of Iran and the evidence presented was totally inadequate, which is the view of some of the victims' families. Many of the stories we read about are unsubstantiated, though it does seem that an Islamist insurgency in the 1990's was put down pretty ferociously and that a number of prisoners taken during that conflict were shot during a riot at Abu Salim prison. The figure of 1,000 put out by dissidents is no doubt a huge exaggeration. The riot as far as can be ascertained started after some prison guards were held hostage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The assault on Libya has nothing to do with 'humanitarianism'. It has gone far beyond Security Council Resolution 1973 in taking sides with the anti-government forces in what is clearly a civil war. Now Cameron and Sarkozy are clamouring to actually arm the rebels, or should we call them insurgents, and US officials have admitted that CIA ground forces have been operating inside Libya for several weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an imperialist intervention, with the aim of regaining Western control of a Third World country.

       Gaddafi wasn't a dictator let alone even the leader of Libya when he died. He hadn't held formal office since early in the 70's shortly after the bloodless coup.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cult of personality that sprung up around Gaddafi was largely because he was idolized among many Libyans due to the democracy, prosperity and progress he helped facilitate, though he did play it up and used it to his advantage quite well.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an example of the positive roll Gaddafi had in Libyan society, he and the Libyan government had been slated to receive a reward from the UN for their economic and social progress and for their commitment to human rights just a couple months prior to the NATO destabilization of Libya. (See the following link)

       Libya had the highest standard of living in Africa as well as one of the highest literacy rates. Gaddafi also helped the government to devise a plan that turned a huge area of Libya's desert into useable farm land.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2010/0823/Libya-s-Qaddafi-taps-fossil-water-to-irrigate-desert-farms">
        http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2010/0823/Libya-s-Qaddafi-taps-fossil-water-to-irrigate-desert-farms
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Gaddafi was so loved for the reforms he created that many Libyans honored his contribution by calling him the 'brother leader'. (This is in part where the misconception comes in that Gaddafi was a dictator.) It was a fitting informal title because he was not the officially recognized leader but he was highly revered among Libyans.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was basically the Libyan George Washington, who not only overthrew a corrupt monarchy but his policies took Libya from being the poorest country in the world to the most prosperous in Africa and one of the most prosperous in the ME. And all in a few decades! That is amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gaddafi was a living hero.
      </p>
      <p>
       As another example
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeAIQSQp58A">
        this
       </a>
       video shows nearly 2 million Libyans (nearly one third the population of Libya) showing up in Tripoli at Green Square to support Gaddafi and oppose the NATO bombings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some important context to keep in mind is that prior to the Green Revolution, Libya was a monarchy and Libyans were used to having a prominent central governing figure, a king, before the peaceful coup in '69. So it was only natural that Gaddafi would be depicted by his supporters (the vast majority of Libyans) as such a figure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, Gaddafi was merely a statesman and adviser to the system of direct democracy known as 'Jamahiriya' that he helped create, and it is a tragic irony that he was doomed in some ways by the very adoration of his fellow Libyans.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the 2011 overthrow of the Libyan government is concerned, it was known that Benghazi was/is a stronghold of radical Islam in Libya and that this area has produced many of the radical insurgents we have fought against in Iraq and which are now threatening to setup an Islamic dictatorship in Syria. The central Libyan government and Gaddafi were opposing these same radicals during the revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       The following is an article with quotes from Alan Kuperman an associate with the University of Texas' at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. He has studied Libya and many other African nations by visiting them firsthand. This article refutes the assertion by the Obama administration that Gaddafi was a threat to the armed Islamic rebels. It states numerous historical incidents showing Gaddafi's willingness to peacefully resolve issues with the Islamists rather than using violence.

       Here's another bit of info that shows the true colors of the Libyan rebels. They like to fly the flag of Al-Qaeda over the courthouses in Libya.
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2055630/Flying-proudly-birthplace-Libyas-revolution-flag-Al-Qaeda.html">
        Here

       and

        here
       </a>
       they are doing it in Benghazi (not a big surprise really because Benghazi is the hotbed of radical Islamism in Libya and where the revolution began as I mentioned before).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Al-Qaeda flag flying over Benghazi is relevant because western justification for supporting the Libyan rebels was to 'save Libyan lives'. But we shouldn't forget how the US and European countries extrajudicially renditioned people off to Libya to be imprisoned and tortured prior to the 2011 uprising, but then out of the blue decided the government is violating Libyan human rights, even though the west had special operations units on the ground who were actively funding the destabilization of the region, arming and training the radical Islamist rebels prior to the uprising, provoking the government to defend the Libyan people from the Jihadis (just like is happening in Syria).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claims of human rights abuses though valid, did not warrant the destabilization of a functioning stable government that the majority of Libyans supported. And most importantly, the revolution ultimately resulted in the deaths and injuries of tens of thousands of people, which is a hundred times more than had ever allegedly been wrongly imprisoned, tortured, or killed (many times done on behalf of the CIA).
      </p>
      <p>
       Intervention failure in Libya has created a civil war.

        Destroying Libya and World Order: The Three-Decade U.S. Campaign to Terminate the Qaddafi Revolution
       </a>
       written by Francis Anthony Boyle, professor of International Law at the University of Illinois College of Law, who also served as legal council to Libya and filed lawsuits on Libya's behalf against the US with the World Court (he won both trials against the US), will give you a good idea of how reasonable and restrained Gaddafi and Libya was.
      </p>
      <p>
       A preview of the book provides a brief overview of US aggression towards Libya:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        After the Bush Senior administration came to power, in late 1991 they opportunistically accused Libya of somehow being behind the 1988 bombing of the Pan American jet over Lockerbie, Scotland. I advised Libya on this matter from the very outset. Indeed, prior thereto I had predicted to Libya that they were going to be used by the United States government as a convenient scapegoat over Lockerbie for geopolitical reasons. Publicly sensationalizing these allegations,in early 1992 President Bush Senior then mobilized the U.S. Sixth Fleet off the coast of Libya on hostile aerial and naval maneuvers in preparation for yet another military attack exactly as the Reagan administration had done repeatedly throughout the 1980s. I convinced Colonel Qaddafi to let us sue the United States and the United Kingdom at the International Court of Justice in The Hague over the Lockerbie bombing allegations; to convene an emergency meeting of the World Court; and to request the Court to issue the international equivalent of temporary restraining orders against the United States and the United Kingdom that they not attack Libya again as they had done before. After we had filed these two World Court lawsuits, President Bush Senior ordered the Sixth Fleet to stand down. There was no military conflict between the United States and Libya. There was no war. No one died. A tribute to international law, the World Court, and their capacity for the peaceful settlement of international disputes. Pursuant to our World Court lawsuits, in February of 1998 the International Court of Justice rendered two Judgments against the United States and the United Kingdom that were overwhelmingly in favor of Libya on the technical jurisdictional and procedural elements involved in these two cases. It was obvious from reading these Judgments that at the end of the day Libya was going to win its World Court lawsuits against the United States and the United Kingdom over the substance of their Lockerbie bombing allegations. These drastically unfavorable World Court Judgments convinced the United States and the United Kingdom to offer a compromise proposal to Libya whereby the two Libyan nationals accused by the U.S. and the U.K. of perpetrating the Lockerbie bombing would be tried before a Scottish Court sitting in The Hague, the seat of the World Court. Justice was never done. This book tells the inside story of why not.

       This book is not a light read, but it is not very long. Tthe first chapter is filled with highly technical legal jargon that goes into describing and critiquing the shortsighted and selfish Hobbesian nature of US foreign policy and international law. Past that point the book is much easier to follow as it is a chronological progression of events with numerous sources listing names, places, and dates that paint a very clear and detailed picture of the provocation and destabilization of Libya.

       Furthermore...

      <p>
       There is no hard evidence tying the Lockerbie bombing to the Libyan government. The government of Libya and Gaddafi were highly cooperative with the investigation. One of the men accused was acquitted, and the witnesses in Megrahi's case were bribed with two million dollars by the United States for their testimony. And then there is this:

        The BBC always raised an eyebrow at his conviction. If the trial had been in the UK in front of a jury he would of walked.

        They made a play based on transcript of the trial and interviewed key players willing to speak. They repeated the broadcast last week.

        All the players interviewed by the BBC, including the victims relatives thought that very odd. They thought some of the witnesses against him where guiltier and

       General summary because it really irks me - All of these theories about controlled demolitions, crisis actors and false flags... They are just not needed. It is
       <em>
        far
       </em>
       simpler for the government to make use of fringe, militant political groups to act in its stead. There is
       <strong>
        MOUNTAINS
       </strong>
       of evidence to support this yet it seems to get largely ignored even within the conspiracy theory community.

Because of this danger, or for fear of it, many parents and doctors are reluctant to vaccinate their children."

I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism."

       Key quotes below:
Dr. Johnston, pg. 14-15 &amp; 19-20: "The data on its toxicity (shows) it can cause neurologic and renal toxicity, including death.”
Dr. Weil, pg. 24: "There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest that we’ve got a serious problem." .... "the potential for aluminum and central nervous system toxicity was established by dialysis data. To think there isn’t some possible problem here is unreal.”
Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 31: "we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes."
Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 44: "Now for speech delays, which is the largest single disorder in this category of neurologic delays. The results are a suggestion of a trend with a small dip. The overall test for trend is highly statistically significant above one.”
Dr. Bernier, pg. 113: "So we are asking people who have a great job protecting this information up until now, to continue to do that until the time of the ACIP meeting. So to basically consider this embargoed information."
Dr. Johnson, pg. 198: "This association leads me to favor a recommendation that infants up to two years old not be immunized with Thimerosal containing vaccines if suitable alternative preparations are available.” ... "I do not want that grandson to get a Thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on."
Dr. Weil, pg. 207: "The number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant. You can play with this all you want. They are linear. They are statistically significant.
Dr. Brent, pg. 229 "we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits"
Dr. Clements, pg 247- 249: "that I am very concerned that this has gotten this far, and that having got this far, how you present in a concerted voice the information to the ACIP in a way they will be able to handle it and not get exposed"
Dr. Bernier, pg. 256: "just consider this embargoed information, if I can use that term, and very highly protected information"

       <strong>
        Vax additives:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a scientifically established fact in literally hundreds of studies that the preservatives and chemical additives in vaccines damage cells. Neurotoxicity, immune suppression, immune-mediated chronic inflammation and carcinogenic proliferation are just a few of several effects that have been observed on the human body. See a list of chemicals in vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately, the drug companies still tell us the damage vaccines have on the human body. People just don’t read them. All you have to do is look at the insert for any vaccine, and it will detail the exact ingredients, alerts and potentially lethal effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any medical professional who believes that it is justified to inject any type of neurotoxin into any person to prevent any disease is completely misguided, misinformed, deluded and ignorant of any logic regarding human health.
      </p>
      <p>
       An Example:
      </p>
      <p>
       Arepanrix H1N1 Vaccine Arepanrix™ H1N1 (AS03-adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine) is a two-component vaccine consisting of an H1N1 antigen (as a suspension), and an AS03 adjuvant (as an oil-in-water emulsion).
      </p>
      <p>
       The virus is inactivated followed by formaldehyde treatment and disrupted with sodium deoxycholate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Preservative content: 5µg (micrograms) Thimerosal USP per 0.5mL dose or 2.5 micrograms organic mercury (Hg) per 0.5mL dose
      </p>
      <p>
       Adjuvant: The AS03 adjuvant system is composed of DL-α-tocopherol, squalene and polysorbate 80 in a 3mL vial: DL-α-tocopherol: 11.86 milligrams/0.5mL dose Squalene: 10.69 milligrams/0.5mL dose, Polysorbate 80: 4.86 milligrams/0.5mL dose
      </p>
      <p>
       Analysis of Ingredients Formaldehyde According to the Australian National Research Council, fewer than 20% but perhaps more than 10% of the general population may be susceptible to formaldehyde and may react acutely at any exposure level.
      </p>
      <p>
       More hazardous than most chemicals in 5 out of 12 ranking systems, on at least 8 federal regulatory lists, it is ranked as one of the most hazardous compounds (worst 10%) to ecosystems and human health (Environmental Defense Fund).
      </p>
      <p>
       Formalyn a 37 percent solution of gaseous formaldehyde which includes methano (used in vaccines as a tissue fixative) is considered a hazardous compound, and its vapor is toxic.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the body, formaldehyde can cause proteins to irreversibly bind to DNA. Laboratory animals exposed to doses of inhaled formaldehyde over their lifetimes have developed more cancers of the nose and throat than are usual, as have workers in particle-board sawmills… Formaldehyde is classifed as a probable human carcinogen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and as a known human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sodium Deoxycholate
      </p>
      <p>
       Sodium Deoxycholate is a water soluble ionic detergent/bile salt which causes cell death and symptoms such as burning, redness, and swelling. It has been shown to weaken the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and subsequently activate seizures. It has demonstrated synergistic toxicity with antifungal drugs. Detergents and emulsifiers promote tumors and cause cells to leak or explode by weakening their walls, with no mechanism for regulating destructive activity. These chemicals are not completely purified out of the final vaccine product, so they enter the body at the time of injection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Detergents are used extensively in cell research precisely because of their ability to break cells open for further analysis. This catastrophically mimics the membrane attack complex (MAC). Detergents hit cells at random and continue destroying cells regardless of which call off the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sodium Deoxycholate is completely foreign to the relationships that define and make up the delicate balance of the immune system. It systematically disrupts these relationships to negate the optimal function and design of immune responses. Thimerosal Note: 10 Times More Thimerosal in the Canadian Non-Adjuvanted H1N1 Vaccine recommended for Pregnant Women
      </p>
      <p>
       Thimerosal has powerful and damaging effects on cells of the nervous and immune systems in mammals including humans. Its effect may vary depending on the dose, the genetics of the individual, and the timing of exposure. The mercury dose from thimerosal produces acute and often deadly ethylmercury blood levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Organic forms of mercury are well-known neurotoxic agents and far more dangerous than inorganic mercury sources. Exposure to organic mercury produces predominantly central nervous system (CNS) effects that are commonly severe and can induce prolonged unconsciousness, coma and death. (See: Acta Chim. Slov. 2004, 51, 361-372)
      </p>
      <p>
       -After only 2 hour exposures, thimerosal at micromolar concentrations causes neuronal membrane damage and alterations leading to cell death in immune T-cells.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Thimerosal alters the functioning of critical neurotransmitters necessary for proper brain functioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Thimerosal causes DNA fragmentation of neuronal cells and disrupts neuronal growth factor signaling at micromolar and even nanomolar concentrations. It also causes DNA methylation and attentional pathways at nanomolar concentrations, leading to alterations in brain function.

       Squalene Too dangerous for human use, Squalene is not officially licensed for use in the United States or Canada. Oil adjuvants like squalene have been ordinarily used to inflict diseases in animals – for experimentation and study. According to anthrax vaccine expert Gary Matsumoto and other reliable sources, the US military used an unlicensed, experimental anthrax vaccination laced with squalene, with disastrous consequences, including Gulf War Sydrome.
      </p>
      <p>
       "There are now data in more than two dozen peer-reviewed scientific papers, from ten different laboratories in the US, Europe, Asia and Australia, documenting that squalene-based adjuvants can induce autoimmune diseases in animals, observed in mice, rats, guinea pigs and rabbits. Sweden's Karolinska Institute has demonstrated that squalene alone can induce the animal version of rheumatoid arthritis. The Polish Academy of Sciences has shown that in animals, squalene alone can produce catastrophic injury to the nervous system and the brain. The University of Florida Medical School has shown that in animals, squalene alone can induce production of antibodies specifically associated with systemic lupus erythematosus" writes Matsumoto.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oil-based vaccination adjuvants like squalene have been proved to generate concentrated, unremitting immune responses over long periods of time according to a 2000 article in The American Journal of Pathology. The study demonstrated that a single injection of the adjuvant squalene into rats triggered a chronic, immune-mediated joint-specific inflammation, also known as rheumatoid arthritis. The researchers concluded the study raised questions about the role of adjuvants in chronic inflammatory diseases.

       Polysorbate 80 Polysorbate 80 is similar to Sodium Deoxycholate in its ability to increase cell permeability, damage, and bursting. After injection it can rapidly metabolize into sorbitol and ethylene oxide which is much more toxic than the original chemical. When Polysorbate 80 breaks down there are 20 moles of ethylene oxide for every mole of sorbitol. These polysorbates have been shown to cause dangerous, sometimes fatal effects, when given through a needle. Changes in heart function can occur immediately. The blood-brain-barrier (BBB) can be weakened and penetrated, followed by seizures and even death. Polysorbates demonstrate synergistic toxicity with a wide range of chemicals.

       Polysorbate 80 has been found to negatively affect the immune system and cause severe anaphylactic shock which can kill. According to Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, Volume 95, Number 6, December 2005 , pp. 593-599(7), "it is of current relevance as a 'hidden' inductor of anaphylactoid reactions", and "Polysorbate 80 was identified as the causative agent for the anaphylactoid reaction of nonimmunologic origin in the patient. The study included a pregnant woman who suffered anaphylactic shock after being given a IV drip of multi-vitamins containing polysorbate 80. In addition to this, there have been studies in Food and Chemical Toxicology which showed that Polysorbate 80 causes infertility. Baby female rats were injected with polysorbate 80 at days 4-7 after birth. It accelerated the maturing of the rats and caused changes to the vagina and womb lining, hormonal changes, ovary deformities and degenerative follicles. According to the World Intellectual Property Organization, which is part of the United Nations, scientists from the organization are developing vaccines specifically to damage fertility as a method of contraception. A suggested ingredient for the vaccine is Polysorbate 80 (also known as tween 80). As it is a preferred ingredient, scientists are obviously aware of its ability to cause infertility.

       The bottom line is that nobody actually knows what causes Autism yet, and if they did, we'd know they did, know what caused it, and know who's working toward a cure or preventative.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do! There is already a good understanding of what autism is and how to treat it. Autism is heavy metal and chemical poisoning of the brain. I'll let the MIT scientist explain:

       Chelation therapy is an effective treatment/cure of autism and has been reversing the symptoms of autism for thousands of kids all over America. Proof:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx_ZCNpu_z4%5B2%5D">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx_ZCNpu_z4[2]
       </a>
       Wonder why we haven't heard much about Chelation out of the mainstream media huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever heard of Dr. Bradstreet? He was all for vaccines until his son got autism from one. Instead of going on TV, he doubled down on his research and came up with an effective Chelation therapy that he had begun giving to hundreds of autistic kids. He reversed many of his sons symptoms and his practice was just beginning to take off in a big way.

       several weeks ago he was found dead in a river with a gunshot wound to his chest. Of course he committed suicide though right? (right as he had made the biggest breakthrough in his life's work). His family says he would never have committed suicide. Funny how that works isn't it? Cite:

       US has been behind a campaign to create turmoil in Ukraine since 2004 according to The Guardian.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        …while the gains of the orange-bedecked “chestnut revolution” are Ukraine’s, the campaign is an American creation, a sophisticated and brilliantly conceived exercise in western branding and mass marketing that, in four countries in four years, has been used to try to salvage rigged elections and topple unsavoury regimes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Funded and organised by the US government, deploying US consultancies, pollsters, diplomats, the two big American parties and US non-government organisations, the campaign was first used in Europe in Belgrade in 2000 to beat Slobodan Milosevic at the ballot box.
       </p>
       <p>
        Richard Miles, the US ambassador in Belgrade, played a key role. And by last year, as US ambassador in Tbilisi, he repeated the trick in Georgia, coaching Mikhail Saakashvili in how to bring down Eduard Shevardnadze.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ten months after the success in Belgrade, the US ambassador in Minsk, Michael Kozak, a veteran of similar operations in central America, notably in Nicaragua, organised a near identical campaign to try to defeat the Belarus hardman, Alexander Lukashenko.
       </p>

       US neocons also had plenty of help from the media in whitewashing the backing of rightwing extremists in

       US State Dept representative Victoria Nuland pimping out Ukraine to the IMF, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Ukrainian oligarchs, and also talking about how the US has spent 5 Billion dollars to destabilize the country since 1991:

       And in order to justify all that they launched a propaganda campaign:
      </p>
      <p>
       "We can certainly help our friends and partners debunk lies, get the straight story out. So we have redirected a great amount of public diplomacy funds to mounting our own truth telling campaign."

       Very important to note that Victoria Nuland's husband is Robert Kagan (see the following for more details:

And whose brother is Fredrick Kagan who works for the Neocon foreign policy analyst group the Institute for the Study of War (the organization who sponsored the Syrian analyst, Elizabeth O'bagy (who lied about her credentials and now works for John McCain, the US Rightwing Senator who praises Qatar and Saudis for supporting Jihadists).

       As far as Russia's role in Ukraine...
      </p>
      <p>
       Another point to consider is the humanitarian crisis in Eastern Ukraine created by the Ukrainian military indiscriminately shelling and bombing civilians. There are over a million refugees fleeing away from the Ukrainian military and into Russia. Russia is the only country offering aid, asylum, and protection for these people, but the US and NATO has shown no interest because these people identify ethnically as Russians, so they are margianalized and ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, considering just logistics and the nature of the ethnicity of the refugees, Russia is the best country to handle the refugee crisis.

       To put things in perspective, just considering recent events of the past year, Russia has done far more good in Ukraine than harm. That's not saying things can't be done better, but any sane person would support the actions of Russia, Crimea, and the Eastern Ukrainian separatists over those of the US and Kiev.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what is the rest of Europe or the US doing to help?

       And as far as Crimea is concerned...
      </p>
      <p>
       Crimea was an independent and autonomous country adjoined to Ukraine and the majority of Crimeans support their government and joining Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       What has transpired has been a result of the will of the Crimean and Eastern Ukrainian people, for better and worse. And their actions have merely been a reaction to the US destabilizing their country and creating a situation of chaos and crisis in order to profit. In those circumstances a lot of mistakes and lapse in judgements will most certainly be made, but any group of people should be entitled to the right of self-determination.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "With over half the votes counted, 95.5 percent had chosen the option of annexation by Moscow, the head of the referendum commission, Mikhail Malyshev, said two hours after polls closed. Turnout was 83 percent, he added - a high figure given that many who opposed the move had said they would boycott the vote."

       <p>
        "In a press conference last Tuesday Sergei Aksyonov, who was named Prime Minister last week, said the new government in Kiev was illegal and “mad”.
       </p>
       <p>
        When asked about the legality of his position, Mr. Aksenov said he had been voted prime minister by Crimean members of parliament. He said the government in Kiev came to power much the same way."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       For us Americans you'd have to be a freedom hating hypocrite to oppose the Crimean people's right to self determination, as their decision to be annexed by Russia had the support of more of their population (85%) than our own revolution for independence (30%).
      </p>
      <p>
       Note the response by Putin in an interview segment when a journalist asks him about Crimean annexation:
      </p>
      <p>
       Journalist to Putin:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        First, Mr President, do you believe that the actions of Russia in Ukraine and Crimea over the past months were a reaction to rules being broken and are an example of state management without rules?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Putin's response:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The second point has to do with our actions in Crimea. I have spoken about this on numerous occasions, but if necessary, I can repeat it. This is Part 2 of Article 1 of the United Nations’ Charter – the right of nations to self-determination. It has all been written down, and not simply as the right to self-determination, but as the goal of the united nations. Read the article carefully.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do not understand why people living in Crimea do not have this right, just like the people living in, say, Kosovo. This was also mentioned here. Why is it that in one case white is white, while in another the same is called black? We will never agree with this nonsense. That is one thing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other very important thing is something nobody mentions, so I would like to draw attention to it. What happened in Crimea? First, there was this anti-state overthrow in Kiev. Whatever anyone may say, I find this obvious – there was an armed seizure of power.
       </p>
       <p>
        In many parts of the world, people welcomed this, not realising what this could lead to, while in some regions people were frightened that power was seized by extremists, by nationalists and right-wingers including neo-Nazis. People feared for their future and for their families and reacted accordingly. In Crimea, people held a referendum.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to draw your attention to this. It was not by chance that we in Russia stated that there was a referendum. The decision to hold the referendum was made by the legitimate authority of Crimea – its Parliament, elected a few years ago under Ukrainian law prior to all these grave events. This legitimate body of authority declared a referendum, and then based on its results, they adopted a declaration of independence, just as Kosovo did, and turned to the Russian Federation with a request to accept Crimea into the Russian state.
       </p>
       <p>
        You know, whatever anyone may say and no matter how hard they try to dig something up, this would be very difficult,
        <strong>
         considering the language of the United Nations court ruling, which clearly states (as applied to the Kosovo precedent) that the decision on self-determination does not require the approval of the supreme authority of a country.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So why hasn't the UN ruled yet that Crimea has no right to self-determination?
