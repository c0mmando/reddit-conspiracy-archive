    <div class="md"><p>Touche. But it also doesn&#39;t fit the idea of Apple. They make money from hardware. Over priced hardware. So much money in fact that they don&#39;t care about selling users data or giving it away. It&#39;s a selling point on why you pay a hard price for their devices.. Of course it is only a matter of time. Especially with CISA passing. (Side note... My phone autocorrected and capitalized that when I typed it 0.o) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not familiar with other smartphones, but the first chip in Apple phones that could do fingerprint scanning (the A7 processor and up starting from the iPhone 5S) was from a nerd&#39;s point of view, an engineering marvel.  </p>

<p>It is <em>physically</em> (not software, but actual hardware wise) <strong>impossible</strong> to access the fingerprint data in the phone&#39;s <em>processor</em> (yes, the processor has it&#39;s own small sectioned off portion for minor memory called the <em>Secured Enclave</em>).  The Secure Enclave is separate from all software running and it&#39;s process for use can only be <em>called</em> (not accessed and manipulated).  It&#39;s an ARM processor the literally has to be accessed by the exact match fingerprint scanner hardware (unique to each device), for each processor, and if you don&#39;t have the match, it won&#39;t work and the data is inaccessible. At any point the software can only ask for the secure enclave to do it&#39;s process, but that entire process is seperate from the running operating system and software.  It was waaaaay ahead of any other fingerprint scanner when it came out and I&#39;m still not aware of any processor replicating this process from intel or others (the processor has to be built with an entire seperate section and ARM&#39;s TrustZone was the only manufacturer I&#39;m aware of that has done that).  edit: Qualcomm <em>does</em> have a processor with dedicated crypto hardware but I don&#39;t know if anyone is taking advantage of that.  and 2. </p>

<p>So, TL;DR - for someone to access the iphone&#39;s fingerprint data, they would have to have 3 pieces together at once for the actual process to even be possible 1. the unique fingerprint scanner part that matches with 2. the unique processor with the data, and 3. a custom serial scanner that could somehow kick on the secured enclave to spit that data out.  It is not possible to access the data in any way remotely.</p>

<p>Most other data security up to this point has been almost completely based on <em>Software</em>, which means encryption, including most fingerprint scanners from android and others, and that means it&#39;s still susceptible to the same old tricks (like brute force attacks, or RNG predictability curves, etc...)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To what end? Bring you to justice if you&#39;re a criminal? I don&#39;t understand why this is wrong.</p>

<p>To <em>frame</em> you for a crime is conceptually unethical and i don&#39;t agree with, but why the fuck would the government/jews/lizard people frame me? They gain nothing from framing anyone. I feel they are much more savvy than that. Look at Snowden; he did the right thing and told the truth, but that put him in breach of convoluted laws and now he&#39;s off on the run. They didn&#39;t need to frame him for some bullshit crime because they have their own bullshit laws in place to not have to frame anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is close, but not as literal as you might be thinking.</p>

<p>Biometrics prove where we are and what we&#39;ve done.  There are schools where students carry IDs with RFID chips.  An administrative database shows not only the last checkpoint, but generates patterns which can be algorythmicaly analyzed to estimate student location.  Our cellphones can do practically the same thing.</p>

<p>But what&#39;s missing is the precise ability to tie someone&#39;s identity to their cellphone.  Biometrics tie us to our devices and those devices become an extension of our identity.  </p>

<p>In the 90&#39;s, conspiracy theorists thought an implanted RFID chip was the mark of the beast.  Before that it was probably an ID or social security number.  We&#39;re living more of our lives online and what we do is more and more easily tracked.  What&#39;s missing is the ability to directly identify an individual with their technological interaction.  Biometrics is one step towards that.  Another will likely be personalized IP addresses or something to that effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Impossible, the chip was created so that it is literally, as in hardware and not just some software, impossible to access the fingerprint data with the phones software.  It&#39;s reference name is <em>secure enclave</em> and it is a fascinating piece of engineering.  The data is set securely in a seperate zone of the processor.  The data has to be read by the hardware scanner (which has its own unique id and is paired <em>only</em> with that individual phone&#39;s chip), the hardware scanner then begins the process of scanning the finger and commuincating with the secured zone of the processor (which is seperate of any of the running software).  It either passes or fails, which is then sent back to the normal operating software (a 1 or a 0).  <strong>No data from the fingerprint can ever actually be accessed by the software at any point, ever, the software running only knows whether it passed the match test or not</strong>.  </p>
