       Because pot threatens too many powerful industries. People use it for sleep aid, appetite aid, as a pain killer, as a social lubricant, as a recreational drug, as a spiritual enhancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       That threatens many different pharmaceutical manufacturers. Like, there are a lot of people who wouldn't be hooked on opiates if they could safely and legally smoke weed. And- unlike opiates- you can (relatively) easily grow weed. If you can't, your neighbor could.
      </p>
      <p>
       The potential for pot to replace many industries, and the relative ease with which it could be obtained... well, why sell someone a product that can solve all their problems when you can sell them many products that save the same amount of problems, and create more problems which you can then sell solutions for?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not good business for weed to be legal.

       Don't forget: paper, clothes and string. Textile companies lobby against legalization as much as pharmaceutical companies do. It's one of the most versatile cash crop in existence. Most people don't know that these textile companies played a big hand in making marijuana illegal.

       Because it's bad business for the state to let it go untaxed.

       EDIT: And because keeping it illegal is like trying to catch the deluge in a paper cup.

       So they kept it illegal because it's bad for business.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they legalise it because now they can tax it, making it good for business.

      <p>
       It depends on the business, doesn't it? That's kind of the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's good business for pharmaceutical companies to keep it illegal. IT's bad business for the state to keep it illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both of these points have
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       been the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a long time, the power of companies over legislators using lobbyists has kept it illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to mainstream social changes, the power of said lobbyists has weakened. And politicians have realized that they have more to gain (in terms of soft power) by pretending to push for legislation. There has never been loyalty with politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Society bought into "Reefer Madness." This combined with pushes from lobbyists dictated that the politician keep it illegal. Society no longer buys into "Reefer Madness." The clamoring of the people is now set against the lobbyists. And the tests that have been Colorado and Washington have made it harder and harder to pretend like it's useful to keep weed illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now the lawmakers will switch their positions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not any different than Hillary being against gay marriage up until the majority of society supported it. Do you understand now?

       If pot is a psychedelic then so are cigarettes.
      </p>
      <p>
       In which case, tobacco is the most accessible psychedelic. Realistically, pot is not  a psychedelic. At high doses, to some people, it can function as a psychotomimetic. I don't gaf what the FDA tells you, that's just propaganda.

       Chemically, pot is a CNS depressant.

       I don't care what the FDA says, I've had pot give me a mild trip.  It's effects have changed my view on life.  You can argue the technical terms, but my reasoning for its illegality stand.

       the fda says it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a psychedelic, just so you know.
      </p>
      <p>
       look up what a psychotomimetic is. what you experienced was not a psychedelic "trip."
      </p>
      <p>
       the fact that people argue about whether or not pot can give you trips is evidence that it is- at best- only subjectively psychedelic. real psychedelics are not subjective.

       Pot is illegal because it opens people's minds to new ideas, not because of financial reasons.

       fair point.
      </p>
      <p>
       pot is not illegal because it opens people's minds to new ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       a lot of people try pot for the first time and it
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       change their perspective- because they realize they can't trust everything they are told. because they are told pot is bad and they realize its not. that makes them second guess preconceived notions.
      </p>
      <p>
       but that is not an effect of pot. that is a consequence of anti-pot propaganda. it would not exist without the anti-pot propaganda. its like if you told a child that swearing would send them straight to hell, and then they swore and that did not happen, they would "wake up" to new possibilities. but that was not an actual effect of swearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       so pot works like that. some people believe it puts them in a superior mental state- but that's placebo at best. i love marijuana. i've smoked it for 10 years now. i've had a medical card for 2 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       i've smoked with hundreds of people. there's not a single person i've ever smoked with who was actually smarter or more creative because of weed. all of them were more stupid. some of them thought that they were more clever on weed than they were, because they overestimated the intelligence of stupid thoughts and ideas. kind of like how people think they sing better than they actually do when drunk.
      </p>
      <p>
       next time you want to manipulate someone, get them stoned and see for yourself. weed (remember, i  love it) dulls your senses. if anything, it would be easier to control a stoned population. people are more susceptible to brainwashing when in a relaxed, disassociated,
       <em>
        complacent
       </em>
       state.

       Not everybody has the extra space to dedicate to that kind of project.  Plus it takes several months to get a harvest.  My point being, most people will just buy it a the store.  Personally I don't care about the taxes.  Here in CO, the money goes towards schools.  It's still cheap if you shop for a deal.

       If ten friends chipped in and there was a space to grow, the investment is minimal. While I applaud the state for using the revenue for education, eventually the consumer will move away from convenience for savings. Probably why McDonald's isn't doing so well right now. There is more control over a product when you are the boss.

       Do you realize how cheap pot is in CO?
You can get top shelf 8ths for $30-$40 if shop around.  You can frequently find an ounce for less than $150.  How much cheaper do you think a home grow makes it?
      </p>
      <p>
       The initial investment is around $1500 for the tent, lights, water filter, air filter, depending on sizes and models.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add in the cost of nutrients and soil per a grow.  Plus you'll want good genetics.  Also the work involved in caring for the plants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now wait for several months before you have any bud and pray you actually get good product.
Or walk down to the corner and buy a legal sack...
