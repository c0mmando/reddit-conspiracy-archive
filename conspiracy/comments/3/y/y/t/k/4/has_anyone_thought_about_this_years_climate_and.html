       In Illinois, this is the strangest winter I can remember. A few days ago it rained so much that roads and fields were flooded. I had to take an alternate route to work. I don't think we've had 1 snow storm that has stuck. It's just rain. The grass is green in many places. It feels like august much of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I acknowledge that there is a probable political agenda in implementing a global tax on economic activity under the excuse of curbing carbon emissions, it's hard to deny that weather is very weird lately.

       Thanks for admitting you don’t have the first fucking clue what you’re talking about. My chart, which shows that you are wrong, can only prove any result you want to dredge up wrong… or correct, but in contradiction to your claims.

       Your reading comprehension sucks.

      <p>
       I wasn't wrong about the climate change. That is well evidenced.

       I was wrong about your level of intelligence, your ability to comprehend things, and by assuming that you are a reasonable person with whom I could have a reasonable argument.

       What can I say? I'm an optimist and always think highly of people. But every now and then somebody like you reminds me of the burden of stupidity that the humanity has to carry as we started prioritizing social good over natural selection.

       Either disprove what I have presented or go fuck yourself. That’s all that can be said. You can’t disprove actual temperature measurements.

       Seems you are getting somewhat aggressive. Did you forget to take your pills? Or stopped doing your anger management exercises? That's not good. You need to control that. Too much anger can lead to heart palpitations, high blood pressure, headaches...

       Plenty of other temperature measurements in my link that directly contradict your one chart. Seriously man, you remind me of a very spoiled child. Do you really need everything digested and served for you? Or have you managed so far to reach the level of independence to click on a link or two on your own?

       You seem to like "reporting" people a lot, but in all threads you are the one that keeps insulting people. You just called me a "fucking lunatic" above. Are you that much lacking self-awareness? Do you need to call on mods to help you deal with people you don't agree with? Are you now going to report me to your mommy?

        It tends to scare people in the wrong direction(that is, AWAY from the status quo) and I don't think tptb have fully figured out how to use it for their benefit yet, so it's in their interest to just downplay or ignore it so people keep mindlessly consuming and driving.

       The reality appears to be that the world is significantly warmer on average now than it was 15 years ago.
To deny the existence of the concept of "Global Warming" is to deny the fact that the world has not gotten warmer, which it indeed has.

       Yeah, we shouldn't be polluting, I agree. But the thing is, man is not affecting the climate like these charlatans are saying we are. It's a scam. The carbon trade stock market is going to make the elite even more wealth. It's not about the climate. It's about power/control/money. That being said, even if we add to and already natural cycle, there is nothing we can do about it. For all we know, doing something like HAARP, chemtrails, weather modification, etc etc. Could make the natural cycle even worse.

       Can you elaborate on the carbon trade stock market and how it will make the elite wealthier? I don't disagree, you've actually swayed my view a little, and thank you for taking the time to reply.

       Your welcome. Basically what the cap and trade tax market would do is, give out a certain amount of credits to various industries/corporations. These credits can be bought/sold/and traded on a new "wall street". We all know that wall street is a bubble/ponzi scheme.

       This new market, however will be in the trillions. Just because a company sells off a credit, doesn't mean they will be obliged to actually not pollute to the cap set. They can make money buying selling/trading, and still pollute. It's a scam and does nothing for the environment. It's a scam and will make companies even more money.

       This is kind of an eli5 explanation. There is a great short doc explaining it further. I'm looking for it, so you can get a better understanding. Will edit when I find it.

       Hope that helps, a little.
