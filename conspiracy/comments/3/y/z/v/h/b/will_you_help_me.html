       Technology creates better living conditions for everyone. We have the ability to fight war with peace through education with this technology. The single most important advancement in human history is the Internet. It can bring entertainment, education, win wars, and bring the world together like none before it. It is constantly being threatened, and we have a responsibility to defend it against anyone who wants to spy, hackers, and any one else that wants to destroy the single most important piece of technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have an idea that sparked through casual conversation through the Internet to maybe help. Here's some of my thought process
       <em>
        (bear in mind that this isn't complete and I'm looking for the world's help with this. Also, it may be all over the place. I'm still orangizing. Thanks for your patience with me.)
       </em>
       :
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to create a Constitutional Nonprofit that works in a way to keep the longevity of it and can be ended when it has outgrown its usefulness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the Nonprofit would serve as three functions. A world class educational institute, ISP, and an open source/open patent research and development department. I want to build state of the art schools and Univerities to better educate the kids of the world. Then in between the districts build a fiber optic network to connect them. From there the ISP side would spread a grid available to the people of the world at no cost to them. The third function would be to use the facilities to research and develope new technologies to better serve the world. If we can automate the entire work force, people would be free to explore new ideas and ways of governance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm thinking it could sell cellular devises at an affordable cost, but I would like to provide all service areas with a free choice of hardware. To also help with operation costs, I'd like to set up a way for the world to donate and help shape this Nonprofit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that there are many obstacles in the way of doing this. I'm asking, would you donate your time to help me work out and set up the finer details of law, projection of business stability, and any other ideas and input you may want to contribute? Trolls of the world are welcome to the conversation. Leaders of Industry and the World are welcome. Obama. Bernie. Trump. We need wise minds on this. Neil. Bill. Stephen. Where my Dawgs at? We need the scholarly, the lovers, the dreamers. We need the rich. We need the poor. We need the attention and affection of the world to focus for just a few days on this. We are all in this together. Without activley trying to help everyone with the things we know will help us all, we are all destined for failure as a species.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will you help me?

       Sure. Why not? I think technology will help us all. Why are we as people not just saying fuck it and doing what we can to help. I know progress
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       happening, but there are so many things in the way. Lives can be better. I've been told that insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results. I just feel so disillusioned by politics and the massive corporatization of the world. I don't even think a Sanders or Trump will actually help the situation. We as a people need to get off our butts and do
       <strong>
        something
       </strong>
       . It won't stop life. I'm still zombie slaying on COD3. Haha!
      </p>
      <p>
       I think your right. Why stop there? We shouldn't. Nanobot tech, space travel, health care, world hunger...they are things the majority of the world care about. We have the Internet at our fingertips. I mean, I feel really dumb. I had this thing here the whole time. We could have been talking about this along time ago. Thanks for the thoughts. Keep them coming.

       I said it may be all over the place, but I want to change the world. We can agree education and access to the Internet are important, right? Shouldn't everyone have access to them? I'm not trying to diminish other problems of the world, but doesn't education make lives better?

       What's stopping us? If starting smaller is a better option what do we start smaller with? Let's figure it out. It's all just semantics, right? We could set up a way to donate to it. It's been done before. The law maybe complicated, but it can be figured out. These giant corporations pay lawyers to figure out legal issues. We could do the same. We just need to organize and keep the momentum going. It would benefit us all.

       Yes I will. I don't think the idea of physical buildings is that great, and I think the "ISP side" should seriously look into that early 2000s tech -- mesh networks! -- but otherwise I'm totally on board :)

       First off, I'm not afraid of
       <em>
        terrorists
       </em>
       like that. The most they can do is kill me, and they are already doing that. So, what do I have to lose? I mean, I have family, but they're killing them too. So shouldn't we be trying to do something about that? I don't believe war solves anything but more war. Can We try something different? Maybe educate the world. Fight war and bigotry with peace and education.

       The way towards automation is 3D printing.

       The ink is the primary concern. Some inks will be hemp, earth, sand, stone. These are all available worldwide and can be had cheaply.

       Next is a platform for designs. The designs will allow people to customize their building to their local conditions/culture.

       Some items will include using mushrooms to decompose waste and turning it into a feed-stalk for agriculture. For example, one guy grew 25 fish and filtered the water with an oyster mushroom. About 2 ft

       First of all, you should know John McAffee is working in this space you are suggesting with a product called Dcentral (as in 'decentralize').  I believe it will be a peer-to-peer wifi mesh network that works from the phone.  That's nice but I am remote so this won't work for me at all, and also since all my towers have gone away because of the economic downturn, I don't even have a cellphone, just a landline.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what you want is an all-inclusive network that doesn't rely on cell towers, and may use wifi or ethernet routers, but can also be built over distance; otherwise this 'new internet' will only work in dense enclaves of people and their phones--just the demographic of people who
       <em>
        absolutely do not care about this offering, because they live in the city with generally high skilled jobs and good compensation, and therefore are totally ok with paying 120/month on a cellphone bill because then they can get espn on their phone while they poop at work.
       </em>
       <strong>
        <em>
         These are the very establishmentarians who are asleep at the wheel of our future, the ones who jump at the new bendy iphone, contrasted with those who would laugh should hackers make all the apple factories in china spin out of control and burn down
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       ahem.  composure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your solution is this:  forget about a centralized monolithic model--it's too hard to keep the corporate interests from trying to cockblock it.  McAffee is right with decentralization...federate into 'cells' and make the very concept of terrorism work for YOU (at least we get something out of the last 15 yrs dark age).  It sounds like you want to build an agorism model of internet + education where no one is in control and it is enhanced, not diminished by the number of devices that add to the network.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find a couple of already worked-on open source projects working on peer-to-peer mesh internet system that are stagnating.  Finish those projects to an alpha version and then bundle it with TAILS or a custom, pared down version of MINT such that the p2p internet is preconfigured for off-the-shelf wifi devices (which mint is already).  This custom distro should really have only 1) the p2p infrastructure software that autoconfigures and joins the p2p network automagically, 2) tor, 3) secure and insecure browser, 4) secure communication apps.   The idea is: you stick it into a laptop cd drive and: GO.
      </p>
      <p>
       This organic open model has worked astoundingly well for a simple filesharing network run by kids in Cuba (although they use physical media--sneakernet). The organic approach reduces
       <em>
        your cost to build it
       </em>
       thereby lowers the barrier to entry in the internetworking market and also captures the future of a direction of techno-egalitarianism in a best-of-breed agorist-anarchic ideology.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You need thousands, not millions to do this.  But more importantly, you just need people to donate their time and effort.  Find the others.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As far as distance goes, there's the idea of the proxyham, and the rhonda (red light point to point technology), and laser visible light point-point systems, and low power microwave point-point systems for pushing the network beyond the very short limits of wifi.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could also present some of your ideas to John McAffee if you can find his publicist / contact.  I think maybe the most successful thing would be for mcaffee to launch a website that would invite people to help him build something even bigger than dcentral by cobbling together stuff that's readymade and good.  FOr example:
       <strong>
        <em>
         veracrypt
        </em>
       </strong>
       it's quite good and audited... also tails and tor are other examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real problem is going to be on the
       <strong>
        <em>
         hardware side
        </em>
       </strong>
       , cobbling together hardware that can allow mesh networks to expand from well beyond 1-2 houses but to whole neighborhoods.  Something appliance-like and easy to set up...as easy to set up as a dlink router or only slightly more challenging.    Something like : buy this raspberry pi, buy this specific antenna / daughterboard for it and burn this OS onto it, then run it.   Then, you have something.

       Exactly. You get it. Is it worth doing? Would we be in a better situation, if we provided Internet access and education wouldn't it make the world better? How can we do this? Let's find the answers. I'm sure the majority of the world can work together to make a tremendous impact in solving the major problems we have. We have proven that we can organize and accomplish many great feats. No other species that we know of has been to space in the way we have. Let’s keep doing that. Let’s break the expectations of what we think can be possible and strive to make a major difference in this world. We just keep pumping greenhouse gases into the environment, have the mentality to ignore world hunger, kill each other over bananas. I don't see why we can't try to fix this stuff.

       Captain Randy Cramer, Laura Eisenhower, Steven Greer, Corey Goode, Bernard Mendez, and many others would disagree with this and have testified extensively to that very effect.

       This is at least part of what you/we are up against, and I think it’s important to be aware of that.

       That sounds like something straight out of a movie. Freaky, but not really a concern of mine. Who ever is in charge of the world doesn't concern me one bit. Other intelligent beings on the planet are welcome to help, and if they put up road blocks we can figure out a way around. I'm not afraid of anyone with ill intent. They are always going to be there. There's a famous quote that says
       <em>
        There is nothing to fear, but fear itself
       </em>
       . Churchill, I think. We could use some superior minds on this. So, these beings you speak of are very welcome to join, and if they want me dead, I guess that'll happen. I could be killed by many of things. They don't stop me from being me.

       Thank you. I'm not exactly sure what I can do to help, but these problems are only getting bigger and will continue to do so. I'm not sure if education will help, but it can't hurt, right? This right here is the solution that I would back. It's simple and doesn't hurt anyone. Also making a world R&amp;D department that makes open source/patent technology, I think it would take away a lot of power away from the hoarders of the world. Knowledge should be free.

       I agree that it may be an impossible task, but can we try? I mean, we haven't tried that. If we don't try, it will not happen. I think we all agree that people should have at the very least access to education. I don't have all the answers, but I may have a few. So do you, and so does the rest of the world. With this glorious invention We have called the Internet, We could figure it out. Breaking the speed of sound was an impossible task, but we wouldn't say that to Chuck Yeager today. Let's do as the Beatles said and come together right now. Let’s sort it out.

       I'm with you, mate. I don't know why I got downvoted to hell. I was merely saying, stuff like this cost money. I suppose you could raise it via crowd funding.

       I don't know why you got downvoted either, but I'll sit in downvote oblivion with you. Here's an upvote, and the username is great. I got a chuckle out of it.
