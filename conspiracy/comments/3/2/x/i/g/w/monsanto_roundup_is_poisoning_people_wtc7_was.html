    <div class="md"><p>Larry Silverstein sucks because he profited from 9/11, and he said &quot;pull it&quot; to building WTC7. I think the US government is not helping Amerians anymore. Our constitution and amendments don&#39;t really apply anymore. Cops kill 3 Americans a day in the US. 80,000 people are in solitary confinement in the US, right now. 1% of America is in prison and another 1.5% is on parole. 3% are felons and can&#39;t vote, and most are black. Our justice system is racist. Our police system is racist. The democrats suck. The republicans suck. Both parties suck because they&#39;ve been bought out by big money. The stock market is a fed-inflated bubble because they offer money at 0%. Why do only banks get 0%? Why did banks get bailed out, but tons of regular people didn&#39;t, and lost their homes since 2008? Why didn&#39;t any bankers go to jail? Why are the police so violent and corrupt? Why are they being militarized? Is it so private military corporations can have the chance to privatize the police via federal contracts? </p>

<p>Zionism sucks because it is a religious shield that the Israeli government hides behind to cover its misdeeds. Israel partially owns the US, all the biggest lobbies are Israeli lobbies. Why are we always in the middle east, fighting their wars? Why did Bush and Obama do the whole Iraq and Afghanistan thing? Because of the military-industrial complex. Many people profited intensely off of these wars, and they are going to start more. The fact that it&#39;s most likely to be Bush v Clinton just shows we&#39;re back to the era of dynasties. </p>

<p>ISIS is stupid and CIA and MOSSAD inspired, Charlie Hebdo was fake, 9/11 was allowed to happen because of the Iraq war and the profit incentive. Dick Cheney oversaw the institution of the TSA, and he owns the company that makes the machines they&#39;re all required to buy. </p>

<p>Ok, that&#39;s every buzz-phrase I can think of. Shills, arise! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Proponents declare that vaccines have saved millions of lives. Critics claim that the success is overstated and that vaccines may even be dangerous. Many consider mandatory vaccinations a violation of individual rights or religious principles. Many in public health argue that vaccine mandates are critical and justified and that antivaccination sentiment has resulted in outbreaks of preventable childhood illnesses. Vaccine critics point to mainstream medicine’s denial of and underreporting of vaccine injury.</p>

<p>Vaccine injuries have happened in the past and continue to happen today, and neither the mainstream medical establishment nor the government has ever fully and transparently addressed the issue of vaccine injury. In the 1980s, the United States addressed individual cases of vaccine injury by establishing the NVICP—the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program—a controversial Department of Health and Human Services program. The NVICP was intended to be “non-adversarial, compassionate, and generous” to vaccine-injury victims. However, many vaccine-injury victims and safety advocates believe that the program is not functioning as intended. There are also concerns that the program is keeping the reality of vaccine injury from public inspection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scratch more! GMOs are what justify all the round-up spraying by Monsanto. Even wheat undergoes something called &quot;dessication&quot; where they spray it with round up after harvest, so the chaff falls more easily off the wheat grains. But then that poison seeps in to the wheat and isn&#39;t washed off and we eat it. That&#39;s why so many people have gluten allergies. </p>

<p>Pedophilia is a way to control the UK parliament, they entrap these politicians in parties after drugging them, video tape it, and then they&#39;ve got career-ruining blackmail, forever. This happens in the UK and also the US, and probably many other western countries. It&#39;s one way the intelligence agencies can blackmail the parliament or congress. </p>

<p>Uhhhhhh.... Scratching for more buzz-phrases... The CFR is a international organization that has been used to sell our rights to CEOs. This is what NAFTA and the upcoming highly-secret TPP is about. They&#39;re about outsourcing and visas. They&#39;re about lowering the cost of labor for corporations. </p>

They brought with them discoveries they made during the 1930s about interdimensional travel, gravity manipulation, and zero-point energy. Along with the Nazis, the WASP, Anglo-Saxon, and Zionist bankers (who had tried to profit off Hitler&#39;s rise anyway) and their Ivy League spy-wannabe children formed the core of the CIA/NSA, NASA and the National Security Council. </p>

<p>Satirized in Dr. Strangelove, they caused the Cold War with Russia in order to secure as much money and trust from the US people as possible.

    <div class="md"><p>There are leaked classified documents revealing &quot;Operation Northwoods&quot;, which was a plan approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the early 1960&#39;s to launch a campaign of terror against the US with the intention of provoking the American people to support an aggressive war against Cuba.</p>

<p>The plan calls for bombings, sinking ships, sabotaging aircraft, and other forms of terrorism.  &quot;We could develop a Communist Cuban terror campaign in the Miami area, in other Florida cities and even in Washington&quot;</p>

<p>One of the plots that stuck out to me was to be conducted as follows:</p>

<p>A commercial aircraft would take off as usual, full of some college students on a college trip.  The students were actually to be CIA people using false identities.  Meanwhile, a drone aircraft was to be painted up to look like the commercial aircraft, including it&#39;s numbers.</p>

<p>At some point during the flight, the plane would cross over a secret military base.  At this point, the drone aircraft was to fly up and meet the commercial aircraft, assuming it&#39;s flightpath.  The original commercial aircraft was to land at the base and safely unload it&#39;s passengers.</p>

<p>As the drone flew over the ocean, it was to broadcast prerecorded messages &quot;from the cockpit of the plane&quot; requesting assistance, as they are being attacked by Cuban MIGs (fighter jets).  The drone would then be remotely detonated over the ocean, exploding in to a million pieces.</p>

<p>The claim was to be that Cuba had shot down the commercial airliner full of students.  They even planned mock funerals for the &quot;victims&quot;.  This deception was to launch America to war with Cuba, which would have resulted in thousands of casualties.</p>

<p>Understanding the scope of this deception really makes you think critically about events that happen in the world.  If Northwoods would have gone live, we would have an apparently destroyed commercial airliner, that is otherwise unaccounted for.  We would apparently have dead victims and funerals, with grieving family members.  We would have voice recording of the pilots requesting help and explaining the attack is coming from MIGs.  We would have aircraft debris floating in the ocean.  It&#39;s overwhelming.  Surely anyone who would question an event with such an abundance of evidence must be crazy, right?</p>

Islam, Muslims, Judaism, Christians, Abrahamic Religions, Scientology (especially fuck Scientology and John Travolta and Tom Cruise for paying to support it), Mormonism, and so many others. </p>

<p>War is stupid. The CIA is making tons of money off the drug trade from mexico and the poppies/opium/heroin from afghanistan. The government sells arms to terrorist groups to overthrow governments in various countries. We fight Al-Qaeda in one place, and then fund and arm them in another place, whatever happens to serve the war-profit interests at that moment.</p>

<p>Really, most wars now are us doing this and then Russia doing the exact same thing on the opposite site. Russia and the US are the #1 and 2 arms exporters in the world. Ukraine, Gulf wars, Iraq, Afghanistan, all like this. And so many more. </p>

<p>You basically made as many claims as possible and asserted that anyone who may show up to contend any of the points is a shill. Why? Do you really think that anyone who shows up and disagrees with you on any of these topics is paid to do so? That seems seems excessively arrogant and misguided.</p>

<p>Let me guess... you have decided I am a shill now haven&#39;t you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would imagine it would be because I disagreed with you about something at some point or another. From my perspective, the best part about being accused of being a shill is that it immediately outs the accuser as being someone that requires zero evidence to make claims. See, I know I&#39;m not a shill, so when someone like you tries to tell me I am, I can be pretty confident that evidence or proof doesn&#39;t mean much to you.</p>

<p>The best shills are the ones who work against their fellow human&#39;s future for free without even knowing they&#39;re doing it, clever idiots.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I always had a more strict definition of the word shill, more in line with the commonly associated meaning. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A shill, also called a plant or a stooge, is a person who publicly helps a person or organization without disclosing that they have a close relationship with the person or organization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Something like that, and usually associated with monetary gain. </p>

<p>Your definition is far too subjective. For example, many will disagree what is in humanity&#39;s best interest. Many here will say that Genetic Modified Food are the devil, but all those people who have been saved from death or debilitating disabilities because of Golden Rice may say otherwise. </p>

<p>As I&#39;ve said multiple times in this thread, whether or not someone is paid in a conversation does not impact the truth of their statement. Shill or not, facts stand on their own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first is probably not a shill tactic. They can&#39;t ignore points that seem valid, else people might believe those points. They could ignore points that most would believe to be invalid, but just about anyone else who disagreed, shill or not, could easily do the same.</p>

<p>Re-framing the issue is a good one. I&#39;ve found a few who I thought were shills when they used this tactic, and at least one really convinced me they were after I dug in farther. This doesn&#39;t mean that everyone who does it is a shill. Anyone trying to &quot;win&quot; an argument could do it. We need to recognize this tactic and keep the conversation focused on topic when we see it.</p>

<p>Trying to make opponents look bad, it depends on how they&#39;re doing it. Insults would be counter-productive to a shill because it could increase sympathy for whomever they&#39;re insulting so I don&#39;t think that&#39;s part of the typical repertoire. Providing legitimate data, if it makes your position look &quot;bad&quot;, means your position could be inaccurate. The proper response to that one is to evaluate the data and, if it&#39;s legitimate and counter to your position, you should re-evaluate your position. (&quot;Learning&quot;.) That leaves providing psuedo-data, which would be shill-ish and I&#39;ve seen this, too.</p>

<p>WRT poor tone and quality of debate, I would think that people who are paid to support specific points typically can do so eloquently and with good quality writing. However, if you can continually counter their re-framing by keeping them on track and counter their psuedo-data with real data and evidence, eventually they get frustrated and either leave or flip out in the thread. That last one is the fun one. =)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there are many or any shills in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. To me, it seems like the organizations that employ them would consider this to be a &quot;lost cause&quot;. There will be no convincing us, and that&#39;s what they&#39;re paying to have done - convincing.  You&#39;ll find shills everywhere else around Reddit though. Most especially I&#39;ve seen them in discussions about GMO and Monstanto, but there are others.</p>

<p>Thank you for the shill accusation though. It works as a wonderfully easy confirmation of my initial suspicions that you simply identify shills based on the fact they disagree with your opinions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I guess that means you should be more careful about accusing people of being shills then?</p>

<p>As far as improving your methods, I would suggest looking into proven shills (through the methods I outlined earlier) on this site and do the work needed to study common behaviour among them. Then, your list of behaviours could have some basis in reality. </p>

<p>Realistically though, that can only get you so far. In my opinion, the best method is to not accuse anyone of being a shill until you have actual proof. As I already said, the motivation of an individual has no bearing on the truth of their claims, so the fact that they may or may not be a shill is irrelevant anyways.</p>

<p>I understand that proving things responsibly is difficult and accepting that people have different opinions is something you clearly have trouble with, but that is the reality you are going to have to face.</p>

<p>Why not? I only feel the need to comment when I feel my perspective isn&#39;t represented in the comment section.</p>

<p>If you have actual interest in conspiracies, then you might get more out of the community by discussing your interests. People might talk to you about those interests and give you some interesting perspectives or new reading material. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve learned plenty from conversations I&#39;ve had already. Rather than seeking out people to confirm my opinions, I feel it is more beneficial to confront and discuss things I don&#39;t agree with. Every conversation I have provides me with perspective and information. Sometimes it makes me question my beliefs, sometimes it strengthens them.</p>

<p>Do you see why only disagreeing with people might make them a bit unsure of your intentions or just generally frustrated? Imagine a real life social situation where all you did was dissent.</p>

<p>If people can&#39;t appreciate that someone else has a different opinion than them on an internet forum that is their problem. This isn&#39;t a real life situation... this is a <strong>discussion</strong> forum for conspiracies. I&#39;m not a guest and this isn&#39;t a dinner party. To turn it around, imagine a party where the guests call you a spy for the government every time you try to express yourself, then some other users take you aside and try to tell you why its wrong to express your opinions. Is dissenting from the status quo not the entire fucking point of this subreddit? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s a strange attitude that I don&#39;t fully understand</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I imagine that has more to do with the gigantic strawmen that members here build to cope with the notion that people disagree with them or find their ideas stupid. To most people, a lot of the content here (chemtrails, thermite demolitions, holocaust denial, etc) falls somewhere in the range of really fucking stupid to downright offensive. Some people like to talk about their opinions and laugh at those who hold beliefs they find silly. You don&#39;t have to like it, but the constant assertions that these subs exist as a means of silencing the real truth is ridiculous. The fact that people disagree with you or even laugh at you doesn&#39;t mean your ideas are wrong. Fuck, people in this thread are downvoting and making fun of me because I think you shouldn&#39;t call people paid shills unless you have actual proof. I havent made up a single theory about paid shills to explain it, I just recognize not everyone will agree with me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beginning with &quot;The Monsanto led Jewluminati ...&quot; is going to color people&#39;s perceptions of you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh well, seems like most people here just go through the comment history of anyone who dares question them anyway. People&#39;s perceptions would be coloured anyway. I get called a shill nearly every time I post here, so you&#39;ll have to forgive me for making a joke about it,</p>

<p>The fact that you are essentially encouraging me not to express my opinion on a sub <strong>dedicated to dissenting opinions</strong> is a perfect example of the completely fucked idealogy that exists here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly it&#39;s because the shills, the astroturf, the very elaborate and truly insane propaganda/disinformation campaign. This is why we suspect stupid fucks like you that spread &quot;dissenting&quot; opinions, this is a place where we aspire to determine real truth, real goings on, and actual happenings. Your dissent derails the thread, confuses the noobies who we steadfastly must show the dark stinky underbelly of this oh so celebrated existence. This world is a fucking snake pit, everything eats something at one point or another. Let&#39;s fucking evolve, grow up and give up your god damn toys, entitlement, and attitudes. We live in an age of decadence, possibility, abundance. We could all have it all. But don&#39;t mind me, I&#39;m just parking my boat in my boat with a blunt and two child strippers, and my fed buddies are up top waiting on me with the lobster, so you guys keep squabbling and chomping at the bit, just nibble on these. subversive statements, blame shifting,  deliberately hyper ambiguous, passive aggressive, &quot;based on current information&quot;, and the ilk nonsense. Just shake em up and confuse them, they&#39;ll settle down in a week or two, when the money starts to go dry, our 1%er special armed forces will keep the anti semetic, enemy forces from wreaking havoc in our oh so beloved neighborhoods until they get back in line. And now you have a politically broken and apathetic populace, successfully divided and conquered, confused, misdirected at every turn, omitted untold amounts of real information, understand what the term government approval, regulation, and licensing really means, it now means it passes under their eye, this is public knowledge, this is not, this is allowed by the sec for this bank, not for Dis one doe, this guy gets the level 3 license, you don&#39;t, Naw. </p>

<p>Your entire post was a suggestion that I should post less dissenting opinions and try to post when I agree more with this community, was it not? </p>

<p>I am asking what else do you have other than dissenting opinions?</p>

<p>And I explained to you that I have plenty of opinions, I just find that it is really only worth it for me to post when my opinion isn&#39;t represented in a thread. Usually this means I end up posting an opinion people here don&#39;t like.</p>

<p>The large oil companies are generally terrible Exxon Mobil is terrible, so is BP. Morally and environmentally terrible. They take over entire countries in Africa. Exxon is larger than many African nations in terms of dollars. They hire mercenaries, known as &quot;Private Military Contractors&quot; to defend their equipment as they pollute, so the natives can&#39;t do anything about it. Then they pay a nice bribe to the government to look the other way, and they&#39;ve got it in their pocket. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This would be such a smart post by a shill. Creating more distrust within the community and helping it tear itself apart. Also it distracts people from learning anything new and provides no benefit. 
 Also this post has been up for 9 hours and I&#39;m not seeing the wave of &quot;shill bots&quot; you were probably expecting, so does that mean they don&#39;t exist?</p>
