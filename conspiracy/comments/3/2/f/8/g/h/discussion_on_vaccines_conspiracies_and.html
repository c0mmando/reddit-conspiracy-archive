        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I really like this subreddit, and there are a lot of interesting theories: about the domination of the 1%, wars, corrupt politicians, NSA, Russia, USA, China, EU, Snowden, other whistleblowers, crazy scientists, aliens. I find it really useful that many people won&#39;t accept the mainstream media&#39;s opinion.</p>

<p>What about vaccines? I live in the European union, and most people don&#39;t have any problem with vaccines here. Most parents are happy that they can immunize their children, and thus protect them. But naturally this topic too has a lot of pro and contra arguments.</p>

<p>I listed some of the reasons below that I can think of, but feel free to share your own.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>PRO: They protect from viral and bacterial epidemics. (so they can save MILLIONS of lives)</strong> </p>

<p>Here is a summary of what vaccines achieved so far: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine#Landmarks_in_history_of_vaccines">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine#Landmarks_in_history_of_vaccines</a></p>

<p>And here is a polio victim, this is why we have them: <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/24859306/ns/health-health_care/t/us-woman-dies-iron-lung-after-power-failure">http://www.nbcnews.com/id/24859306/ns/health-health_care/t/us-woman-dies-iron-lung-after-power-failure</a></p>

<p>But &quot;banning vaccines&quot; just does not seem to be a logical option, otherwise we will have these, killing millions again: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_epidemics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_epidemics</a></p>

<p>Also, currently the &quot;status quo&quot; is that people get vaccines, so it is not some kind of pipe-dream. In many countries it is mandatory to have the children vaccinated, or otherwise they cannot go to kindergarten, school, families lose benefits and such. But these </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>CONTRA: They can also carry infections in some extreme cases, and can have some adverse effects rarely. (but they have negative effects on far fewer people than they can save)</strong></p>

<p>Like the below examples. Also, there can be adverse effects in case of some children, but they still protect the population as a whole.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV40">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV40</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.nvic.org/vaccines-and-diseases/measles/measles-vaccine-injury-death.aspx">http://www.nvic.org/vaccines-and-diseases/measles/measles-vaccine-injury-death.aspx</a></p>

<p>The main issue with the contra approach is this: how could anyone differentiate between a &quot;normal, protective vaccine&quot; and an &quot;infected one&quot;? Frequently not even the heal-industry can recognize the dangers, only when it is already too late (see the Thalidomide disaster:  <a href="https://helix.northwestern.edu/article/thalidomide-tragedy-lessons-drug-safety-and-regulation">https://helix.northwestern.edu/article/thalidomide-tragedy-lessons-drug-safety-and-regulation</a>).
I agree that medical and pharmaceutical companies should be monitored more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing that has shocked me: I was just then watching who is probably Australia&#39;s most esteemed female TV journalist, and one who is regarded as quite rigorous in her impartiality, say: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;it&#39;s been shown that anti-vaxxers are <em>not</em> acting rationally, rather they are basing their understanding on conspiracy theories&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet, it turns out that Australia has a 97% vaccination rate and that only 15,000 families in total are claiming the &quot;conscientious objector&quot; exemption.</p>

<p>So who gives a fucking shit? Is a tiny minority not getting vaccinated worth the venomous outrage everyone is expressing?</p>

<p>On another note, I find it incredible the degree of assuredness there is among this population considering that the majority of them would never have read any of the primary research. I really gotta try just telling people stuff that I made up and see how it goes.</p>

<p>That is what it really boils down to.</p>

<p>I will take vaccination for measles if they really insisted but what next? Ebola? Bird flu? HIV? Like I said before, my faith in the govts led by US has really taken a beating since 9/11.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;m into holistic medicine. Visited a doc maybe 5 times in my life. I grew up in Mumbai India, had malaria twice and can survive practically anywhere. Mosquitoes got nothing on me.</p>

<p>If us govt really cared about peoples health, they would make sure they are feeding them well. That&#39;s where it all begins. You are what you eat, quite literally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people need to do the research for themselves because nobody who is purporting to have done the research is publishing actual, real results.</p>

<p>On the one hand, you have doctors effectively parroting big pharma and the government telling you to take all the vaccinations, regardless the actual testing that has been done on some. For example, the HPV vaccination seems to be about as effective as no HPV vaccination. Also, what&#39;s the point, really, of a flu vaccination in a healthy adult? Between the chances you&#39;ll encounter a different strain anyway and the minor impact the virus will have if you catch it (<strong>healthy adult</strong>), why bother?</p>

<p>On the other hand, you have the anti-vac crowd shouting that <strong>all</strong> vaccines are evil, harmful, and ineffective which clearly has proved over time to be a blatant lie. There are some vaccines that have been used on literally tens of millions of people. They clearly are effective and not harmful.</p>

<p>Nobody&#39;s telling the whole, full, accurate story. Everyone has an agenda. The agenda is clearly not the safety of you or your children. So you have to figure it out for yourself.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re asking these questions when you could be researching for yourself.  It&#39;s pretty easy.  Just type your question into Google, and viola! You can get an answer!  </p>

<p>But here, I&#39;ll help you out since you don&#39;t seem to be very good at it, judging from your HPV vaccine comment earlier.  <a href="http://www.cochrane.org/CD001269/ARI_vaccines-to-prevent-influenza-in-healthy-adults">This paper</a> suggests that there&#39;s probably no point to a healthy adult getting the flu vaccine.

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccinations are not necessary for health. In the US at least, manufacturers are immune from being sued for side effects, there is even a special court in the US to pay civil damages. So taxpayers have to pay when vaccines kill or debilitate people.</p>

<p>Also, Americans receive more vaccines than any other country on earth. This correlates with the highest infant mortality in the world. SIDS aka &quot;shaken baby&quot; is a possible side effect of vaccination. Vaccines cause SIDs, plain and simple. </p>

<p>From jimstone&#39;s article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Squalene is an important molecule in the body. It is a precursor to many different oils and hormones, and is needed for proper brain function, fertility and also plays an important role in protecting cells from aging and mutation. Anything which affects your natural squalene can have a major negative impact on your health.</p>

<p>Because the squalene will be injected in the presence of a pathogen during the H1N1 vaccination, it will cause an immune response against not only the pathogen, but to the squalene itself. Squalene is a precursor molecule which is essential for the production of many hormones including all of the male and female sexual hormones. Squalene is also a precursor to many of the neurochemical receptors prevalent in the nervous system and when the immune system is programmed to attack squalene, it causes irreversible neuronal and neuromuscular damage which can range from a loss of intellect and autism to more serious disorders such as Lou Gehrig&#39;s disease and systemic autoimmune diseases and possibly brain tumors.</p>

<p>In independent studies where squalene laced vaccines were injected into guinea pigs, the resultant autoimmune disorders killed 14 out of 15. A later test, to verify the results had the same outcome.</p>

<p>When first injected via the anthrax vaccine in Gulf War 1, it permanently disabled many of the soldiers who received it, due to the effects now known as the Gulf War Syndrome. 95 percent of the soldiers who recieved the anthrax vaccine have been found to have antibodies to squalene. Few of the soldiers who recieved the vaccine remained healthy and do not have the antibodies whether or not they were deployed. None of the soldiers who did not receive the vaccine have the antibodies, even those who fought in Iraq. Squalene antibody related deaths total 6.5 percent of the vaccinated group.</p>

<p>It takes approximately a year for the effects to fully manifest themselves because that much time passes before the nervous system and brain deplete the reserves of Squalene that are out of the reach of the immune system and only after the reserves are gone will cell injury begin. This takes the pressure off vaccine manufacturers who deny any wrongdoing for a response so delayed. And with Congress passing legislation granting immunity to any corporations who cause damage with their vaccines, the outlook is evermore dark.</p>

<p>After examining the components of the H1N1 flu vaccine we can only conclude that it is not intended to treat the flu at all, quite differently, it is intended to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reduce intelligence </li>
<li>Reduce life span </li>
<li>Reduce fertility </li>
<li>Cause numerous deaths</li>
</ol>

<p>For if it was intended for any other purpose, Squalene and other adjuvants beyond the scope of this article would not be present. Furthermore, the scope of this article only covers squalene, and we believe that because there are so many ways to induce autoimmune responses equally devastating via other injectable formulations coupled with the obviously intentional shipment of a pandemic by Baxter that the credibility of vaccines is forever tainted and the trust in the greater medical community may have been irreparably broken. Baxter should be out of business, the fact that they are not is damning.</p>

<p>Many of the pro-vaxxers are basing their views on the &quot;healing at all cost&quot; model (elimination of polio, measles, etc.), and the anti-vaxxers are basing it on the &quot;reduce all cost no matter the healing&quot; model (tainted vaccines, ineffective/wrong ones)             </p>
