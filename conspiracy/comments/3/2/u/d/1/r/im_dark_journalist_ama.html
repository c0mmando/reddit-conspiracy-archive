       <a href="http://www.darkjournalist.com">
        video show
       </a>
       adds a new twist to Alternative Media.
I’m happy to answer any questions you may have on subjects such as Black Budget Economy, The Breakaway Civilization/Secret Space Program and UFO Secrecy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think in this crucial time we need a whole new way to look at the world and the levels of disinformation in our media institutions. I call this new approach “Dark Journalism” and feel it’s crucial we discover the truth and achieve transparency from the ruling elite in our culture. If ever we needed to unmask the forces controlling our reality, this is the time!
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m interested to hear what you think about this and maybe together we’ll come up with some inspiring answers.

       I believe it is a post-WW2 alliance between hidden financial interests that include post-war Nazi financiers, Black Budget intel programs and a network of shady global financial institutions.

       The United States began in 1776. George W. Bush's presidency began in January 2001. Many nations are quite old, while their current government is quite young. My interpretation of what was said (and I am possibly wrong here), is that the current situation began post-WW2.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you bring up a very good point though. If someone was to blindly repeat that the Fed began post-WW2, then their argument could easily be dismissed by noting the Fed began in 1913. By knowing what you stated, they could clarify their point that the current incarnation of the Fed comes from a post-WW2 alliance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am hoping my post is seen as building on what you wrote, not attacking it.

       But he said it was owned by post WWII/Nazi interests, which I think is true, but I think that WWII and the Nazi's came into existence because of the printing press at the Fed, not the other way around.

       Well the cult of Nazism ruled Germany from 1933-45 when Germany was defeated this cult left, many went to Argentina as is well documented. But the fact that we in the West worked with the post-war Nazi cult and how they are involved today is not so widely known!

       Well the Bilderberg group was founded largely to deal with all of the excess nazi loot they took with them to South America and elsewhere. They had a major role in our space program but also there is nazi involvement in the setting up of international political organizations. The post war nazi international were involved in secret finance and drug running out of South America. I'd refer you to my recent with Dr. Farrell for more:

       They are so deeply in the mix of these activities that I think one can gain a whole new perspective on the the two great world wars by studying the financial actions of the Rothschild money interests. An excellent book in this regard is "IBM and the Holocaust" by Edwin Black...

       Yes on Mckinnon! Brave guy, I've heard of this list from other sources also. As far as where they are now compared to what we think is going on: forget it. They are so far beyond what we can think because they have been reverse-engineering alien technology for sixty years!

       Well if an advanced craft from another world crashes here you can imagine the kind of exotic technology it would possess. We're pretty smart and reverse engineering technology is a way of life in industry. So that alien technology has been in our possession for over sixty years...think about it. Their motivations? Well right now they're having a great time keeping us on the oil standard and that's what our economy is built on. They certainly have more to gain by keeping this advanced technology to their breakaway group.

       Well we have high ranking retired military figures, intelligence whistleblowers, and industry figures telling us they do and a long list of what technologies were reverse engineered. As for the presence of off-world visitors, Astronauts have told us they are here, there's witness testimony, abduction reports, crafts hanging over major cities, like Phoenix and NYC, domestic pilots  seeing ships as wide as a mile at high altitudes, I find so much evidence wherever I look that I'm shocked that anyone could look at the same evidence and deny it with a straight face.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that there are some people who are waiting for an official announcement and the truth is they won't get it. So we exist is a kind of limited reality in the public consciousness because this secret is too hot to handle. The question is can we break through the official version of reality and see the truth ourselves?

       There was this guy who piloted to the comet elnin years ago and had an ama on it in theabovetipsecret forums. Supposedly the real budget is for the secret military and they've seen other planets with lights from other civilizations with the speed it can travel.

       I believe Schneider and I think his story touched upon the holy grail of intel projects: the building of extensive underground bases. I will also mention that Schneider's untimely death was most likely at the hands of covert intel operators. On that topic, not sure what podcast tackles it, I like listening to guys like Joseph Farrell.

       Well not so much a twist but the absolutely soulless mindset of the media and the people working there, who I have witnessed up close. I think realizing that they are hired guns, even if they are not always aware of it, is essential to a new view of the world. They are corrupt gatekeepers (in my opinion)!

       Well you've given me an opportunity to discuss my pet term, "Third Force." Here are a few examples of this in some classic disinformation stories:
      </p>
      <p>
       “ No planes used in 9/11!” This bizarre claim actually gets some traction and serves to discredit the plausible alternate stories, such as the planes were remote controlled etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The driver shot JFK.” This is another absurd piece of disinfo that attempts to discredit legitimate alternative research, such as evidence of an extensive assassin team firing from the front.

       Well two things on that. The Z film was altered to hide the full impact of the rear shot, the work by ARRB member Douglas Horne shows that. However, even in its altered state certain things, like the frontal headshot cannot be concealed. The driver thing was leaked by a former intel operator to a gullible set of researchers, exactly as you say.

       Well, you understand I come from Cambridge so I remember when this whole thing unfolded. There was certainly a lot of misinfo floating around about the brothers. In Peter Dale Scott's work he outlines what he thinks are clear ties from the older brother to the FBI. In fact he believes the FBI used him as an infiltrator of radical organizations. He's not often wrong...

       Thank you for reminding me! I will have full shows on both of these things coming in May. First, a very good inside source I have been using has told me that the CERN particle accelerator is being used to "repair a grave issue." The notion of a tech wonder project is just a cover.  More later on that. Also, I did touch on this in an early question. The October 2010 NYC sightings were a kind of disclosure from the visitor side, I've actually been working on this story for five years, in May a documentary video on it will be released.

       Well that's a great opener. It sure was a job alright. I'm not sure we know exactly whose job it was.  But certainly the lack of a robust response to the hijacking from the worlds greatest military instantly made it into a deep event!

       Well that's an interesting question. I certainly have always been a kind of Dark Journalist but only in the last year was I public about it. But I think the sightings of very unusual craft over NYC in October of 2010, and that I was told they would happen, made me realize I should make a bigger move.

       What do you think about the theory that the greys and other such "aliens" are the same creatures that are known as "demons" in many religions (ie, deceitful, malevolent creatures that seem supernatural to us humans and try to mislead humanity with lies and other forms of deception)?

       Interesting, well I think visiting aliens in those times, would have been taken for demons by superstitious folk. However, we are now the aliens they worried about, I guess. I don't think aliens are 'evil'  but I think there may be types that are not concerned about our future at all...

       that was a curveball that bent my mind a bit at first, too...but when you have a CIA guy stating on camera they did do body switches--it adds a little traction...The documentary's final breakdown of the JFK assassination is pretty out-of-the-box as well...

       also interesting to me are the 2 trucks parked at the corner which may have been used as

       which Jim Fetzer pointed out. (not too big on Fetzer--he goes too far quite often, but his JFK

       It's apparent Oswald was an asset, and more likely a patsy. The
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemstone_File">
        Gemstone File
       </a>
       had put forth an interesting, and entirely plausible hypothesis eluding to such. One of the more interesting aspects of the file was pointing to
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Roselli">
        John Roselli
       </a>
       as the second (or third) shooter. I find this portion of the theory increasingly plausible, considering he was involved with the mafia and had been recruited by the CIA to take part in
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Roselli#1960s">
        a plot to assassinate Castro
       </a>
       , and that he had later
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Roselli#JFK_conspiracy_allegations">
        admitted to others in taking part in the JFK assassination
       </a>
       , and considering
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Roselli#1970s">
        the circumstances of his death
       </a>
       just prior to continuing his testimony before Congress to that effect.

       There is interesting information in the Gemstone File. I tend to go more in the Torbitt Document direction on that one. No question Roselli was a major CIA asset, that's well documented. His position between the mob and the CIA would potentially give him access to some plot details  in the JFK Assassination. But I agree with you he was not part of the shooting team.

       Wow 2 interesting questions in one! I'd say it's important to try alternatives like StartPage and secure mail services. My work by nature requires some forethought around these things. But also it's important not to get too distracted by that. A good protocol put in place to start and boom we're looking good!

       Cooper eh? Anyone has to admit that he was early on talking about Bilderberg and the NWO and the ET/MJ12 aspect. He certainly had info no one else seemed to have publicly then I think he changed his public stance on UFOs which was really strange. I think he was troubled at the end also, before he was eliminated...

       If you're going to exchange critical data, that is extremely sensitive and/or dangerous in the wrong hands, consider using Tor over a VPN, and be sure to encrypt anything and everything worth encrypting, ideally using a combination of algorithms (i.e. AES-Serpent-Twofish).

       What is your opinion on DMT and the alien intelligences that are encountered on it. do you think that they are the same intelligence that the canadian defence minister and yourself speak of or do you think they are something else. i have experienced them personally multiple times and i cannot fathom them being an illusion, they have so much heart and character and genuine concern for me. it is baffling and beautiful and i'm curious of your views on the phenomenon

       Well that's very interesting. First off one does not disqualify the other. They may be an off world group that can operate inter-dimensionally. I think that what you say about them having a kind of positive vibration is echoed by many abductees. I think the actual abduction experience is what has injected the fear aspect here. Also there may be elements not as positive. Certainly an altered state like DMT makes observation of a reality like that possible, if done under the right circumstances. My interview with Linda Moulton Howe touches on this somewhat:

       Easiest way for them to make contact. They have some cool 'organic' tech. Had an experience w/ a female entity using an instrument with a lot of tendrils on my chest and throat. A whole weight lifted from me when she was done. I think we also exist on a higher level simultaneously. Meatspace seems to just be the default plane of existence.

       You can find plenty of very bright sciency types who postulate that our reality could be a simulation or a hologram of sorts. As above, so below.
It amazes me that the further science goes the closer it seems to get to religion/spirituality.

       No McCoy I don't think all hope is lost. But I think now is the time to get a handle on this runaway centralization and we certainly can. I think the guests on my show, like Former Defense Minister Paul Hellyer show us a glimmer of where we may go:

       Well I listen to everything, I think we are at risk for an event like that, and also for powerful earth changes, earthquakes, volcano activity etc. It seems like the early aspects of this are the weather changes, some engineered, and disaster accidents we're not up to the rest yet!

       Well I'm afraid neither you, nor I, nor our friends will be too happy with the answer. They may have had a legit reason to hide it at first, during the Cold War and post WW2. But then right around JFK's presidency it fell into the wrong hands, that is the technology and its progress. JFK was the last President to try and recapture the power over the advanced technology. They consider us as obstacles largely and feel unaccountable. As far as what they are building out there, they've had 60 years...what should we think?

       What would the end game be though? I feel like after 60 years of working with this technology they could have us all doing their bidding with ease. Then again...we pretty much are as it stands today, but you know what I mean.

       Hey you said Breakaway Civlization! That is a big term in my research now, of course it originally was coined by author Richard Dolan and fleshed out further by Dr. Joseph Farrell, you can guess they are high on my reading list. The Breakaway Civilization has the power over the secret space program. The public space program languishes and the secret one flourishes, that's what research tells us. We went to to the moon but were never told about what was there...

       Ahh it's coming! Hah, well I really believe an interesting place to start and this may sound like a cliche, is the actual testimony of Major Jesse Marcel the intel officer who was the first on the scene to the Roswell crash. You see the root of the Breakaway is there. Then I'd look at documentaries on Nazi occultism, then start thinking of these two together.

       That is a good question. We know Dornberger was working with Bell and was the main man on the Nazi V2. I believe he worked on the bell project but the actual name Bell Helicopter has been around. Strangely the roots of Bell Helicopter go back to a little mill town in Massachusetts and an early venture capital group from the 20s. That story would eventually involve Ruth and Michael Paine who worked for Dornberger. They had very interesting houseguests: Lee and Marina Oswald.

       Hello darkjournalist, you do great work. My question is, what do you think of the state of alternative media as it stands today? Do you see it blossoming amid the obvious propaganda in the main stream? Or do you think the cointelpro is doing a good job to discredit truth speaking? What has your personal experience been?

       Thank you! I'm not pleased too well with Alternative Media as it stands, although I'm hopeful we're seeing a new stream come in. I feel like we need new definitions around what we are dealing with. We may even need new titles for subject matter because the media has taken terms like 'conspiracy theory' and tried to paint them with a derogatory brush.

       Well they've taken this and hammered away at it for years to brainwash us. I call it "The Scorn Name." The scorn name is an unflattering term applied to a group you are trying to discredit. In a fair society, the media would object to these terms and try to show a neutral point of view in matters relating to intense differences of opinion. However, instead we get Truther, Conspiracy Theorist, Anti-vaxxer, Gun-nut, Extremist, Birther. I imagine when the pollution levels start to interfere with our normal respiratory function they will start to call anyone who points out that our corporations have destroyed the oxygen content in the air as a “Breather.”

       I've found 'conspiracy realist' or 'conspiracy researcher' to be preferable, or simply no label at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some background as to how and why the term exists, in its current form, within the popular lexicon:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.filmsforaction.org/watch/conspiracy_to_tell_the_truth_interview_with_lance_dehavensmith/">
        CIA Popularized "Conspiracy Theory" Term to Silence Dissent
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Abby Martin talks to Lance deHaven-Smith, Florida State University 
professor and author of 'Conspiracy Theory in America', about some of 
the US' most controversial events and how labeling truth-seekers as 
'conspiracy theorists' damages democracy.
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         "The use of “conspiracy theory” to deter citizens from 
investigating historic events is paradoxical, to be sure. It suggests 
that those who commit criminal conspiracies can only be relatively 
powerless people who happen to live on the most strategically important 
lands, and conspiracies among rich, powerful people are impossible or 
absurd.
        </p>
        <p>
         Basically, our entire legal system is based on the idea of 
conspiracy. Despite this fact we have been conditioned by the government
 and the media to blindly accept the official reports and to treat any 
questioning of those reports as “conspiracy theorizing.”  That is, you 
are a conspiracy theorist if you don’t believe the government’s 
conspiracy theory.
        </p>
        <p>
         This cultural phenomenon goes back to 1967. At that time, in 
response to questions about the Warren Commission Report (which 
President Ford helped create), the CIA issued a memorandum calling for 
mainstream media sources to begin countering “conspiracy theorists.”
 In the 45 years before the CIA memo came out, the phrase “conspiracy 
theory” appeared in the Washington Post and New York Times only 50 
times, or about once per year. In the 45 years after the CIA memo, the 
phrase appeared 2,630 times, or about once per week.
        </p>
        <p>
         Before the CIA memo came out, the Washington Post and New York
 Times had never used the phrase “conspiracy theorist.” After the CIA 
memo came out, these two newspapers have used that phrase 1,118 times. 
Of course, in these uses the phrase is always delivered in a context in 
which “conspiracy theorists” were made to seem less intelligent and less
 rationale than people who uncritically accept official explanations for
 major events.
        </p>
        <p>
         President George W. Bush and his colleagues often used the 
phrase conspiracy theory in attempts to deter questioning about their 
activities. When questioned by reporters about an emerging scandal in 
September 2000, Bush said the idea that his presidential campaign was 
flashing subliminal messages in advertisements was absurd, and he added 
that “conspiracy theories abound in America’s politics.” When in 
1994, Bush’s former company Harken Energy was linked to the fraudulent 
Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) through several 
investors, Bush’s spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, shut down the inquiry by 
telling the Associated Press — “We have no response to silly conspiracy 
theories.”
        </p>
        <p>
         Because Bush’s campaign had, in fact, been flashing subliminal
 messages in its advertisements, and Harken Energy was actually linked 
to BCCI, people began to wonder what Bush and his colleagues meant when 
they made diversionary comments about conspiracy theories.  More 
importantly, that track record raised questions about Bush’s statement 
after the 9/11 attacks, in which he said in a televised speech — “Let us
 never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of
 September the 11th.”
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no question that criminal government-sponsored 
conspiracies exist. History is replete with them and they usually 
involve the government claiming that the country was under attack from 
“terrorists.” This was true of Hitler’s Reichstag fire and it was true 
of the attacks that occurred in 20th century Western Europe under the 
guise of Operation Gladio. An example more relevant to 9/11 was the 
conspiracy behind Operation Northwoods, a plan drafted and approved in 
1962 by the highest levels within the U.S. military.
        </p>
        <p>
         Author James Bamford wrote of Operation Northwoods that it 
called “for a wave of violent terrorism to be launched in Washington, 
D.C., Miami, and elsewhere. People would be framed for bombings they did
 not commit; planes would be hijacked. [This would provide] the public 
and international backing they needed to launch their war.” The 
signed documents are available to everyone today and because of this we 
know that high level U.S. government representatives do conspire, on 
occasion, to commit crimes against the American people for 
the purpose of starting wars.

       <p>
        The origins and rhetorical function of the term "conspiracy theory" 
constitute an important subject matter for SCAD theory and research. At 
least since the 1970s, the conspiracy-theory label has been applied 
pejoratively to a wide range of suspicions and allegations of official 
wrongdoing that have not been substantiated by public officials 
themselves. The label suppresses mass suspicions that inevitably arise 
when shocking political crimes benefit top leaders or play into their 
agendas, especially when those same officials are in control of agencies
 responsible for preventing the events in question or for investigating 
them after they have occurred.
       </p>
       <p>
        Communication scientists Ginna Husting and Martin Orr, both 
professors at Boise State University, have studied the use of the 
conspiracy-theory label as a putdown and have explained how the label 
works to silence suspicion. The conspiracy-theory label challenges 
the very rationality of persons who voice suspicions and thus shifts the
 subject of discussion from the suspicions to the speakers’ competency 
or lack thereof.
       </p>
       <p>
        DeHaven-Smith has shown that the conspiracy-theory label was 
popularized as a pejorative term by the Central Intelligence Agency 
(CIA) in a propaganda program initiated in 1967. The program was 
directed at criticisms of the Warren Commission’s conclusion that 
President Kennedy had been assassinated by a lone gunman. The propaganda
 campaign called on media corporations and journalists to criticize 
“conspiracy theorists” and raise questions about their motives and 
judgments. The CIA told its contacts that “parts of the conspiracy talk 
appear to be deliberately generated by Communist propagandists.”
       </p>
       <p>
        SCAD scholars hypothesize that the CIA’s role in inserting the 
conspiracy-theory label into the American lexicon of political speech is
 only one of many instances when U.S. intelligence operatives have 
manipulated domestic opinion by structuring the terms of discourse. For 
example, deHaven-Smith has argued that the nomenclature surrounding the 
Global War on Terror—terms like “axis of evil,” “ground zero,” and 
“homeland security” that are associated with World War II - and the meme
 “9/11” used to denote the terror attacks in the United States on 
September 11, 2001 - emerged too quickly and were too sophisticated to 
have been developed without the expertise of public relations 
specialists.
       </p>
       <p>
        By their very nature, SCADs are events that present a profound 
challenge to citizens’ most closely guarded beliefs about government and
 democracy. Laurie Manwell has written extensively on the many 
attitudes, biases, and faulty beliefs which can prevent people from 
processing information that challenges these pre-existing assumptions 
about government, reasoned dissent, and public discourse in a democratic
 society. In contrast to other academics’ suggestions on how to deal 
with conspiracy-related speech (e.g., Sunstein and Vermeule’s 2009 
suggestions for taxing, fining, or banning conspiracy-related speech or 
for government-orchestrated cognitive infiltration of private and public
 beliefs) Manwell’s recommendations all involved more open 
discourse, greater public education and media literacy, and increased 
political knowledge, participation and tolerance. She argues that, 
for a functioning democracy to, at the bare minimum, survive, let alone 
thrive, “the right to dissent with the majority opinion, and the 
necessity to have this dissenting discourse within the public sphere, 
must be protected” (Manwell, 2010, p. 849).

       Good one. I am using the term 'Dark Journalism' because I think it suits the subject matter and is aligned with conspiracy research. I think we can differentiate it this way:
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy, Dark Journalism and Junk Conspiracy.
Let's define what these three thing are:
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy is research into areas where the media has failed in its role.  I think of Dark Journalism as aligned with this principle in the search for truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dark Journalism may be what we need to term conspiracy research eventually because the mainstream media has battered the term conspiracy in such a demagogue-ish fashion in order to try and keep sensible people away from the very tools they need to see through the matrix of political and corporate manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Junk Conspiracy is what I call 'Third Force' action.  An example of this like 'No planes used in 9/11,' gives us an idea of this approach. This type is meant to confuse the conspiracy research that challenges the official story.  It often adopts threads of the same conspiracy research it is trying to discredit as a way to co-opt the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can recall that it is the CIA that created the term ‘Conspiracy Theorist,’ to discredit individuals that were challenging their questionable practices.

       Well I believe this is an antediluvian culture that built it in 10,500 BC the archeo-astronomy data strongly supports that. I think it is the ultimate symbol of transformation from a physical to a spiritual existence. These 'Atlanteans' knew quite a lot about that and shared it with early Egyptian culture.

       There are some extremely convincing theories out there that the great pyramid is actually an ancient thorium nuclear reactor that was used by extraterrestrials, with the other pyramids in the area being attempts by humans of the time to recreate the technology. There was so much scientific basis for these claims that it is almost undeniable.

       That's interesting. I always ascribe a truly spiritual purpose to the Great Pyramid. There are books, like 'Giza Power Plant' and 'Giza Death Star' that are fascinating and show the pyramid as an energy grid. I have a feeling they were using something finer than modern nuclear energy at that point.

       Yes I do think Free Energy has been discovered and suppressed. I think they've had it since Tesla's work was backtracked and then we had reverse engineered alien technology. There is an interesting section in the movie documentary Thrive that discusses what happened to some of the people working on alternative energy, not too pretty what became of them, this we should bring to public awareness. Haramein is interesting I can't say I know him too well...

       I saw a guy on Joe Rogan's podcast talk about how free energy was suppressed and he said that they required (only) 20 million for all the proper lab equipment. 20 million is literally nothing, which is why I think it's bullshit.

       Ah, well the legislation about removing the religious exemption when the pharmaceutical companies have such a terrible track record is obscene! So often in debates around mandatory, excessive vaccines or GMO labeling we get pre-conceived memes trotted out to serve as the important one-liners that will allow our curious minds to go back to sleep. We often see terms like “don’t you believe in science?” Or “these things have been proven to be safe under expert supervision.” Of course we well know that scientific studies can be bought and real pressure can be brought to bear when a political or corporate force is trying to achieve a particular aim.

       Well there are two sides, their side and ours. Our side will never voluntarily give that information up. Too much hubris and human greed involved. Certainly I would not look to official institutions. I could tell you for hours about NASA and others spending our money on things we will never see. The visitors on the other hand...

       My parents knew a man who claimed to have been a White House guard during the Kennedy/Johnson years. He told them that he knew that Lyndon Johnson was behind the killing of JFK and that Oswald was framed. He also said that Oswald's mother was secretly flown to the White House in a helicopter, and that she met with LBJ behind closed doors. None of the guards were allowed in the room with them.

       Do you believe that his claims are likely to be true?

       What about his claims that Oswald was framed, and his mother was flown to the White House? And what possible reasons do you think there could have been for flying her there and LBJ having a secret meeting with her? Do you think it's possible that she was hired to help frame her son or something of that nature?

       Well they could have done that, fly her in, but there's no way to prove it. I don't think she was used to frame him. Of course I do believe Oswald was framed. I made a documentary called Agent Oswald: The CIA Patsy

       Thank you for mentioning 'Mr Global' this key term is used by Catherine Austin Fitts (you must know her work) to describe this shady group that is centralizing the economy. Much more appropriate than NWO somehow. Yes, he has the technology but we won't see it for a hundred years in their plan. Fitts talks about him in this video:

       Who do you consider to be in control of our election system and national presidential debates in the U.S.?  Do you support hand-counted paper ballots publicly counted in every polling place, an election day holiday, automatic voter registration, and a national popular vote with no electoral college?  Any other solutions to our corrupt and heavily influenced election process?

       Yes, haha. Still is. But I can say that I integrate everything into the shows I'm working on so even if I can't come on too strong on a sensitive topic until I know more... I publicly source these things in the interviews..

       Hi this is Sarah from Business Game Changers... I wanted to ask you more about the economy.  Catherine Austin Fitts has stated that the inequality in the economy has been caused by the black budget and the loss of trillions.  Do you think the black budget has this effect and is it causing the fragile condition that we are experiencing?

       That's a great question Sarah. Fitts is certainly the most insightful investment advisor and financial expert I've come across. What I think she has just nailed in a way that is undeniable is how the black budget, which finances itself largely with money laundering and drug money, can come in and literally destroy a neighborhood. This has an impact on the broader economy, housing values, loss of good jobs. She refers to this as harvesting our assets, I believe they are doing that and that they are making our financial future very precarious.

       Any advice for someone who wants to expand their audience and develop an alternative/media network?
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea would be to build upon a core group of people I trust to analyze MSM news (propaganda) in semi-real time to try and debunk the way they are currently shaking Western reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have toiled with a news website, but think that the best way to get information out there is through a downloadable podcast thing that you can listen to passively at your wage slave job while having an expanded resource website for those that want to learn more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any advice would be amazingly beneficial, as I think I have a large enough team to out together in the next few months that would be interested in doing some stuff in their free time, and really enjoy the donations/Value For Value model that has made No Agenda and more recently Jen Briney's Congressional Dish gain traction and become not self sustaining, but still provide an incentive to contribute high quality work.
      </p>
      <p>
       And full disclosure - it would be specifically geared towards increasing the transparency if government action in DC (since their not doing it anyway) in an end-game goal to produce a latfe group of motivated and a political active electorate if the Millenial Generation do challenge and hold accountable the most vulnerable (and I would argue most powerful since they control the funding) of the US House of representatives during an upcoming election cycle which should see a huge turnout (since it's not a midterm election).
      </p>
      <p>
       Any advice would be immensely helpful. Feel free to PM me if you think you can help point me n the direction I need to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for your time and all the work you've done.

       Not to smear this topic with my garbage but I started doing broadcasts with Mixlr and with a little funding it can be set up to do 24/7 broadcast and do skype calls etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       My platform is techno/ufo conspiracy but believe me it is in baby form--I have two broadcasts on my showreel, however the experiment phase is over and the lumbering beast is up and running. Hit me up let's get real real.

       There you can listen so far to my first two broadcasts. I plan on broadcasting tonight at 10pm MDT, (Monday April 27th) 12am EDT, so you can listen in. If you like it, let's take it a step further somehow. I'm open to things, my platform puts forth good music with some UFO news and the occasional stuff related to advertising my production company. I am twiddling with skype (have never used) and when that is running i will be able to do live calls via the program =)

       Just want you to know, i subscribed to your youtube channel, i love your interviewing technique, it's obvious by the questions you ask you are very well read and well prepared for each interview, i love Joseph P Farrel &amp; Richard Dolan, I'm a big believer in the Breakaway Civilization. You should get your content on iTunes in the podcast section. I have no questions, well actually, what made you want to start podcasting when there are so many doing it, what future plans do you have. Once again i love your stuff.

       Thank you! I'm glad you enjoy the show. I have some new episodes on the Breakaway Civilization coming up. Thank you for the iTunes suggestion.

       I started with the Dark Journalist show for a number of reasons, but mostly because I wanted to do something worthwhile and innovative around these topics. I was also concerned that important things were being overlooked...

       What is your most interesting conspiracy/event in history?

       In your interview with Linda Moulton Howe, she mentioned that our world’s atomic bomb testing could affect the other multiverses. Can you give us your take on this and what you think about the topic of multiverses.

       Ah I missed this earlier, interesting questions here. I think the chain of conspiracy events is what's most interesting. So if we go from the JFK Assassination to Watergate, to Iran Contra, to 9/11 and the Financial coup we can see a steady process building. When we combine the worlds of UFO secrecy and secret finance to these events they become more transparent. I think at this time in history it is particularly important to establish what the truth of our world is. That's why I'm a Dark Journalist now.

       What are your thoughts on the theory that Israel and the USA fund and support ISIS/ISIL so that this group can gain as much ground as possible  before it attacks Israel? Then Israel would have the excuse it needs to go into other Levant countries so that it can extend it's territory to the Euphrates river.

       It has to be bigger than Israel. But their funding etc is off the charts. Where does it come from? Those beheadings etc, quite horrific and nice stagecraft also. I think they are real and intended to keep us involved over there. Syria wasn't enough, Here comes ISIL, I really don't want to use the wonderful goddess name for that gang...

       Since you think the beheadings are real, do you have any opinion on why the videos appear to be 'sanitized' and don't actually show the act? Videos before and after that they released have been more brutal.

       Yes, but there are things out there they didn't tell us about. I always think of Ingo Swann's research on this. I did a show with Dr. Joseph Farrell that touches on some of what was found:

But I did and I will share my findings in that video in May. It happened on October 13th, 2010 and there are some things around the web on it. Although none have comprehensive answers...

       You're taking one thing (the financial bailout) and conflating it with something completely unrelated -- and completely failing to answer the question that was asked.

       Daniel - did you cultivate your own interview style? or.. was there someone who mentored you? It strikes me that your skill set sharpened up significantly from about 12-14 months ago, was that a significant time?

       Thank you! Well I really like talking with people and going deeper than a normal conversation, I always have and I feel that there are powerful things individuals will reveal and really enlighten you with if you are right there with their thought process and really focused. No mentor, I think maybe I just am more fully engaged... i appreciate that.

       What do you think is the motivation of tyrants, totalitarian schemers, and NWO types?  Why do they go through all of the trouble and stress of trying to control and change countries and the world for the worse? Why don't they just take enough ill-gotten gains to retire filthy rich and lead a life of ease, then leave everyone alone? Do they believe, in some twisted way, that what they are doing is humanitarian?

       It is my opinion that any UFO sightings/encounters that involve coherent humanoid entities or ships/flying saucers cannot be of extraterrestrial origin. This is because of the hypothesis of the technological singularity. Any civilization sufficiently advanced to visit earth from afar has without a doubt created artificial intelligence, has near infinite insight and the means to construct anything, be anything, and manipulate reality to the extent that it is possible for an intelligence existing within this universe could ever be capable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, it seems highly incongruous that members of said species would firstly adopt a disadvantageous form (greys/little green men/etc.) then fly, in person, around population centers on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even we as humans in 2015 have almost transcended that need, with the advent of drones and other autonomous craft.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly, if the crashed craft was indeed alien, packed with very interesting new technologies, it indicates at least that TPTB do not have access to strong AI technology, or else they would already have an army of robotic Einsteins who could rapidly reverse-engineer and capitalize on said technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, what would be the point, anyhow? Said army would no doubt be able to elucidate all remaining scientific and technological hurdles, obviating the need for the head-start of finding an alien craft.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess this is more a comment than a question, but the whole ET theory doesn't make logical sense in my opinion for the reasons I stated.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there are ETs, and I would say, rather that if ET intelligence is here, then it's everywhere and is more of a conglomerate 'presence'. I think we're more likely to find evidence of this presence at the microscopic level, in anomalies in our genes and cellular machinery, in anomalous electromagnetic energy configurations and signals, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its nature would not be easily understandable by us, and probably wouldn't be fully elucidated until we are able to transcend our present intellectual and perceptual limitations.
      </p>
      <p>
       ETs most likely exist, but any that have made their way all the way to Gaia won't be meeting the president and shaking his hand, they or it would most likely perceive humanity as a totality, as something to be instantly and comprehensively infiltrated (which, no doubt, it has been).
      </p>

       Thank you!  Interesting overview.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know that we can easily ascertain what the motives of the visitors are, but they are certainly coming here. The most convincing evidence for the fact we are being visited by extraterrestrials are the thousands of sightings, abduction witness testimony, and retired military and industry whistleblowers who have leaked that the national security state knows we have off-world visitors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Astronauts Edgar Mitchell, Gordon Cooper, Retired Intelligence Officer Phillip Corso, Major Jesse Marcel and so many more.  I guess at a certain point I have to weigh the accumulated evidence and testimony and come to the conclusion of an undeniable alien presence. My question is, "why do the media play along with the official story on this one?" Why does a profession which has at its very heart the concept of finding out the truth allow this sham and the known falsehoods to stand as the official version of reality...why? When we start to answer that question we can see other things falling onto place so we get a true picture of what is really happening.

       Well Rand decided to play ball you see, that's rough. I like the things he stands for but when he came out for an increase in defense spending as a way to secure the nomination I wasn't into it. So he has a better chance at the nomination but a lesser chance of being like Ron Paul, as it stands, I hope that changes!

       This is important to get right. There is climate change, no question. Will they use it to manipulate a tax? Yes. But it's real. If some conservative radio or faux libertarian figure says it's not, they are misinformed. By the way I say faux libertarian because a real one is better informed! Where it comes from? Pollution! No question and earth changes too.

       I couldn't say that better! It's like baseball teams really. Libertarians are probably some of the best out there, always loved Ron Paul, I don't know if we can deregulate on the level they want in this super techno world but decentralization is crucial!

       This.  I know it's a political football,  but blaming climate change on pollution really exposes you.  In order for you really believe this,  this means that you are believing (mostly) government scientists, the same government scientists who you are claiming are lying and covering up a secret space program. How can you be sure of the fact they are lying about the secret space program,  but then on the flip side be so willing to believe the same people when they say pollution is causing climate change?
      </p>
      <p>
       I too believe that the changes we are seeing in the climate are man made changes,  but certainly NOT being caused by pollution.  Instead I think we are in the midst of a weather war with China and Russia to melt the artic snow caps in order to pillage the resources underneath.   This is being done by a combination of things, including geo- engineering, and other secret technologies which are 1,000x more destructive to the earth then carbon emissions are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've lost a lot of respect for you actually when I read you believe pollution is causing climate change, while subtly attacking your political opponents.

       Well I appreciate that there are different points of view on this. I suppose if we both think it's man made we're in the same ballpark. I think in an AMA you really have to speak your mind. Honestly I believe it's a wonder that after years of burning fossil fuels, which the corporations knew would hurt the atmosphere, we think these issues would not occur due to the pollution of the atmosphere. So that's what I think.

       I used to like dutchsinse and his reports, I admit I haven't tuned in for awhile. We are looking at massive earth changes heading our way, there is no way around them. But we certainly can develop the kind of communities that will support a new paradigm. I have a show coming next week that involves society dealing with a pole shift. Not in a fear based way..hah...

       Always been interested in UFOs and since childhood followed the topic. All of the interesting stories like Betty Hill and Gulf Breeze, these are very real people and I always believed their stories. As far as sightings go yes, but nothing near even close to some of the great ones. I like the Phoenix Lights case as a real show stopper of a sighting. An entire city saw that. Linda Moultown Howe told me that after that incident UFO secrecy went into overdrive. That interview is here:

For Sci-fi I think 'They Live' has classic commentary on our modern world even though it's from the eighties, I like the original Total Recall, I also enjoyed the 'Taken' mini series that had some Spielberg involvement. The fifties episodes were great!

       Thoughts on Townsend Brown's research, and the weirdness associated with his reputation via the Philadelphia Experiment?
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally suspect that all the weird rumors about the PE were created to make Brown seem like a crackpot, so that people would not investigate his technology, which has immense potential when modified with newer (2012) metamaterials. I'll elaborate on that last part if anyone is interested.

       Well let's say first he is an interesting guy. He actually interviewed David Rockefeller, that alone is priceless. The strange White Dragon stuff which developed into bizarre 'cabal arrests' theme is just a dead end and has failed to materialize again and again.

       Oh hey, I just realized that I go by DJ_Mission on reddit, I am a big fan on youtube go by the name Broox Authement =) I am reading an article right now about how "power-mods" or moderators banned this guy from many many subreddits for posting material that they personally disliked. I am pissed because I got banned from r/UFO and one time for posting a link to a different social media site (they called it 'spam' which back in my day was done by a bot repeatedly) but then my posting privileges were reinstated. . . now I am unable to post again! I found out because I was gonna link your DJ interview w/ LMH.

       We are getting fucked up bad by a group or groups of people that have an agenda. Whether it is manipulating our money or hiding knowledge of ET contact, or wars of aggression that line the pockets of corporations, there is evidence to realize there is something there along those lines.

       Well I agree that it is a group of interests. It appears to me that they have warring factions and that we may see more conflict between them as they consolidate. My best analysis for who they are goes back to the secretive National Security group that slowly drained the power of the ET technology program from the executive branch. As they transferred that power to these military contractors like Boeing and others some separate or breakaway civilization came into being. That is I think the root of the modern wave of this power push. I'm sure the money powers/mystery schools and that aspect goes back much further.

       When do ou think the american public will demand the truth ? I remember reading about big brother 25 years ago, ie. project Eschelon,  The aurora project,kennedy assasination both John and Robert.  The list goes on forever ..UFO's were know in modern times from WWI till today.Our leaders can't even lie to us with any believability anymore. Ttey really think we are Sheeple, stupid sheep. What will it taketoreturn to truth and open communication with the people that elected them, not the special groups of influencial people that are funding these pet further thier own financial gain?

       Good points. I do think there are definite periods of overreach on the part of the power establishment and then the pendulum swings back in the other direction. The 70's and the 90s were better periods, historically for transparency in government and covert operations. We need this next renaissance of accountability to be the most powerful yet in the modern era...

       Yes.  Difficult to just "take his word for it".  Certainly.  One thing that helped me go from "this is just some guy talking" to "this might actually be valid and true information" is what he specifically said
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FbOiIdgbl0#t=154m56s">
        <strong>
         here
        </strong>
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       He said if he is a civilian saying what he is saying and he is lying, then there is no consequence for it.  His saying that he is
       <em>
        a military officer in the United States armed forces
       </em>
       and saying what he's saying, however, means that if he is lying, then he is committing a felony prosecutable by law and could be fined a few tens of thousands of dollars and thrown in prison for a few years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked this up, and
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ucmj+impersonating+an+officer&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8">
        he is actually telling the truth
       </a>
       .  He
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       be committing a felony if he were lying about how he has been comporting himself in all these videos.  The fact (as he himself says) that he has not been approached by any military superior and told to cease and desist is, it seems to me, pretty telling indeed with regard to all the information he has come out with.
      </p>
      <p>
       That bit right there kind of clinches all the other information that he has disclosed because it gives everything he's come out saying more weight than would otherwise be the case if he were just, again, "some guy off the street saying stuff".

       This is a great question! It is the probability that the trillions that went missing from the budget during the financial bailouts and before were siphoned off into a secret space program by a group that possessed advanced technology. We've been referring to that group here as The Breakaway Civilization.

       Wow you really do believe the super weapon theory? Paul Hellyer did mention the 500 page book that lady wrote about it, saying that it was chock full of evidence. . . There must be at least something to it, which turns my stomach another full notch from the already gutwrenching disgusting truths that the whole thing was vile sorcery much akin to Tower of Babel lore. . . yuck

       When it comes to UFOs and our government, there seems to be a great deal of secrecy. Information is kept from the public and even seemingly from those in the military and in high ranking government positions. Do you think we are dealing with a kind of shadow government that controls all knowledge pertaining to UFOs? If so, how long has this shadow government been active? Could there be a connection to reports of Men in Black?

       Great question! Well yes the topic of UFOs is according to several sources at a higher secrecy level than the Manhattan project was in the 40s. From the evidence it appears that they have no desire at all to tell the public and come up with expensive media campaigns to misinform and confuse the average person. I do believe that the term 'Shadow Government' is applicable to the group that controls this advanced ET technology. It may be hard to be precise but they started their ascent with National Security Act in 1947 and by the time of JFK they took complete control. On the Men in Black, I've heard two plausible explanations: First, that it's a covert intel agency trying to spook witnesses out of talking. Second, that it's actually an off-world group that is working with our government in order to keep their presence and their dealings from public view. They are certainly real...

       He's come up a few times. It seems a mixed bag, he certainly has the know how of a good journalist, but this White Dragon and cabal arrests stuff never seems to pan out. Hopefully a guy like that moves on to better subjects.

       There are all sorts of "essences" incarnating into human bodies. Some are aware because they are made aware. Most are not. As for why, well it depends on where they came from. I'm going to need to be vague for my own protection but I will say that there is usually an "invitation" involved, and a genetic tether needed to incarnate into a particular bloodline.

       Well, without knowing anything else about your friend, the first thing that pops into mind is "takes one to know one". Lol. If not that, then your friend was probably on the other end of a war type situation in the past with that type. No need for private message, those who know anything about this stuff know me already. Everyone else will just think I'm crazy, and that has its own type of protection. I feel the need to be vague for other reasons.

       Interesting, well I'm not trying to stop any particular company. I'm trying to expose information that is hidden from the public so they can have the ability to be informed and move forward with that knowledge. There are companies like Goldman Sachs and Monsanto that are so anti-human that in my opinion they represent a kind of negative paradigm that should be shunned.

       They are certainly visiting here, no question. The concept around a Jump Room seems like quite an interesting technological advance and there is a certain amount of persuasive logic behind it.

       However, I don't think there is as much evidence for that as for off-world visitors.

       Even independent journalists should get credentialed, because AP will just ignore your stories.

       I just wanted to say thanks for your work and you're doing a great job with the show, and kudos for being involved with the online community via reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some day people will look back on guys like you and see you as heroes of the species and intellectual heroes for just trying to access the (nearly) inaccessible and trying to make people of aware of what was really going on in the world - while so much effort from "the other side" is going towards keeping people unaware/entertained/distracted/busy with busy work and nonsense and anything to keep people "sleeping". The work of collecting the knowledge of all the other people you have on, like Hon. Paul Hellyer  and making it part of the collective social memory is a huge, huge deal and utterly important for someone to do, so thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good job, thanks, keep up the good work, your show is one of (if not the) greatest in my opinion in this whole field, for one thing because you don't do anything gimmicky, you're just in the 'dark journalism' field and you do a great job of it all.

       This is better than your first version of this question and I'll answer it for you. I think you're right that Hastings was eliminated because of the sensitive stories he was working on. The circumstances of his death were suspicious to say the least. Who did it? I think if we go into the details of the research he was doing before his 'accident' we'll have a clue.

       I don't read VT and Chomsky I gave up on after he said that 9/11 and the JFK Assassination and the web of deceit around them didn't matter.

       Jones has certainly broke some important stories but you have to wait through a lot of Iodine ads to get to them.

       He appears to be an innocent conduit to me. I think he was used by an intel agency to reveal things that would reduce the powers of the NSA. I think in this case the public has benefitted from the clash of these agencies. I believe his story. Yet he must have had more help to accumulate such data and possibly that assistance was from an anonymous source.

       Okay, so I have to ask.
      </p>
      <p>
       James Corbett has a theory about a fake alien invasion, false flag type thing. The technology to create these mass hallucinations exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this doesn't refute the existence of real aliens, it is plausible as a mechanism to ratchet down the freedoms while we do battle with an "alien menace", while the usual characters benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think of this? I for one don't doubt the existence of aliens, but this theory does hold water, and James is an excellent researcher. Do you plan to collaborate in the future?

       Well I like Corbett, he's done so many interesting things. Can I say with a grin that the UFO report he did was not so hot. The last thing the media or the government wants is alien disclosure and the the invasion thing, 'Project Blue Beam,' is actually not an official project at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is there is a comfort in saying that there is no evidence for off-world visitors, but it doesn't hold up to any scrutiny. Endless witnesses, thousands of sightings every year, I mean can the Rockefeller money buy honest people like Major Jesse Marcel or Betty Hill? See, there are limits to what that kind of disinfo program can generate. But his other stuff is certainly good... Thanks for bringing that up.

       Seriously of all the content this sub sees about 2% of it is UFO related so why then is the only stickied post a 75% UFO fan page?
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: case and point: In the interview with Catherine Austin Fitts as she's speaking about pedophilia extortion tactics used by opposing politicians/media DarkJournalist drops in with [paraphasing] "Arizona 1997 politician who said he saw the Arizona [UFO] lights got extorted". [approx 50:00min]. This is completely and utterly outside the scope of the Black Budget conversation about equity markets and debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: DarkJournalist don't use this sub to validate your ufo conspiracies or at least as a show of good faith do away with the stickie.

       A televangelist preaches, dark journalist doesn't do that at all, he interviews researchers and listens to their ideas and theories. It isn't his job to convince you or anyone else of anything.

       Isn't it his job to convince people?  He presents everything he discusses as fact, despite the fact that there's no actual, solid, unfalsifiable evidence to support either his claims or his guests' claims whatsoever.  Why should I put my faith in what this man's serving any moreso than, say, Benny Hinn?
      </p>
      <p>
       By doing nothing other than "listening to their ideas and theories" and not questioning them in a meaningful and honest manner, he's presenting a one-sided agenda based on faith.  And when was the last time he "interviewed" someone who disagreed with his views, or the views of his guests? And I say "interviewed" there with quotes, because, in real investigative journalism, an interview is supposed to be more than a circle-jerk of agreement between the subject and the interviewer.  You're supposed to be getting to the truth, not blindly accepting everything you're presented on faith.  Why doesn't he ever ask for proof?  Hard evidence?  Play devil's advocate (in anything other than a pedantic role)?  Ask dissenting questions?
      </p>
      <p>
       And why won't he take the time on this "ask me anything" to answer my dissenting question?
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, my question was intentionally abrasive (perhaps of the type an actual investigative journalist would ask).  Perhaps too much so, I'll confess.  But it's still a valid question, in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the difference between this Dark Journalist and a Televangelist?  Both are making fantastic, unfalsifiable, unsubstantiated claims that I am supposed to accept on nothing more than blind faith.  Both use their programs as an echo-chamber for their pre-existing agenda.  And both use their program to solicit money from their believers.  So I ask again, what's the difference?

       Watch any one of his videos.  Listen to how he presents everything.  Take this one
       <a href="http://www.darkjournalist.com/s-howe.php">
        here
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <p>
       Around :34 seconds in:
      </p>
      <p>
       "...she's covered the most controversial issues from cattle mutilation to contact with extra-terrestrial life and the government cover-up of advanced UFO technology..."
      </p>
      <p>
       Presenting these things like they're factual happenings.  Even putting the words on the screen because... I can't hear him say them? Honestly, almost seems like he's pushing propaganda with that sort of schtick.
      </p>
      <p>
       13:54, same video
      </p>
      <p>
       "...well, that is fascinating, the degree to which the perception has changed, and I think we can all agree that there's an agenda that's moving forward there..."
      </p>
      <p>
       We being she and he?  Or is he telling me what to think? Because it sounds like he's telling me what to think.  Honestly, the whole "I think we can all agree" thing is a big red-flag that says "propaganda" to me.  But I digress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's look at another video, from
       <a href="http://www.darkjournalist.com/s-scott.php">
        here
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <p>
       "...we're going to dive into the subterranean covert world of the deep state..."
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not aware that a subterranean covert world of a deep state exists.  But he's assuming it does. And he seems to be assuming that I know that it does, despite the fact that he's presented no evidence of its existence.  Which would be... presenting something he discusses as fact.  Precisely what I was talking about.  And again, those little captions next to his head.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the language he uses to discuss his subjects' work is dripping with praise, before they're even on the show:
      </p>
      <p>
       "...Now Professor Scott's new book...is a powerful crowning-achievement in his lifelong work..."
      </p>
      <p>
       Powerful crowning achievement?  That's not objective journalism.  That's telling me what and how to think.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...

       She won a regional Emmy award for sound effects and editing, nothing to do with the content or factuality of anything she talks about. Though him saying that she's an "Emmy Award winning..." without the actual facts about the Emmy award sounds better, right? Gives her more credibility?  Kinda like something that someone producing propaganda would say?

       It has to be bigger than Israel. But their funding etc is off the charts. Where does it come from? Those beheadings etc, quite horrific and nice stagecraft also.

       Well the cult of Nazism ruled Germany from 1933-45 when Germany was defeated this cult left, many went to Argentina as is well documented. But the fact that we in the West worked with the post-war Nazi cult and how they are involved today is not so widely known!

       That's a great question Sarah. Fitts is certainly the most insightful investment advisor and financial expert I've come across. What I think she has just nailed in a way that is undeniable is how the black budget, which finances itself largely with money laundering and drug money, can come in and literally destroy a neighborhood. This has an impact on the broader economy, housing values, loss of good jobs. She refers to this as harvesting our assets, I believe they are doing that and that they are making our financial future very precarious.

       This.  I know it's a political football,  but blaming climate change on pollution really exposes you.  In order for you really believe this,  this means that you are believing (mostly) government scientists, the same government scientists who you are claiming are lying and covering up a secret space program. How can you be sure of the fact they are lying about the secret space program,  but then on the flip side be so willing to believe the same people when they say pollution is causing climate change?
      </p>
      <p>
       I too believe that the changes we are seeing in the climate are man made changes,  but certainly NOT being caused by pollution.  Instead I think we are in the midst of a weather war with China and Russia to melt the artic snow caps in order to pillage the resources underneath.   This is being done by a combination of things, including geo- engineering, and other secret technologies which are 1,000x more destructive to the earth then carbon emissions are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've lost a lot of respect for you actually when I read you believe pollution is causing climate change, while subtly attacking your political opponents.

       The United States began in 1776. George W. Bush's presidency began in January 2001. Many nations are quite old, while their current government is quite young. My interpretation of what was said (and I am possibly wrong here), is that the current situation began post-WW2.

       I think you bring up a very good point though. If someone was to blindly repeat that the Fed began post-WW2, then their argument could easily be dismissed by noting the Fed began in 1913. By knowing what you stated, they could clarify their point that the current incarnation of the Fed comes from a post-WW2 alliance.

       I am hoping my post is seen as building on what you wrote, not attacking it.

       From Wikipedia, "The Nazi Party was founded as the pan-German nationalist and antisemitic German Workers' Party on 5 January 1919. "
