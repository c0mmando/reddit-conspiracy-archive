        compromised
       </a>
       for a very long time. But there are almost 300,000 subscribers to this subreddit alone. The President of the United States posts AMAs. The nation is watching reddit and the audience is what matters.

       The more they lie, the more they censor, the more dishonest tactics they display, the more people will start to wake up.

       Your mouth or fingers are a cesspool, you aren't the real Dale Gribble. He would never treat people this way, I demand you give your pretend name back, at once! You aren't even the slightest bit paranoid. Ha you suck at impersonations, do you know this? You seem to suck at being a human, considering the way you treat people. I imagine you don't get any pussy at all, ever. I hope you've invested in a good flesh light sir!

       This sub is a cesspool, I'm glad it isn't a default. "Disallowed" is not the correct term. The default list is a whitelist, not a blacklist. If it was disallowed from showing on
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all

       that would be a different story, but that isn't the case.

       You are claiming that "site rules prevent it from appearing on the default frontpage". But the default frontpage is a static list of subs that reddit, inc wants new users to see. So saying that they are "preventing" it is disingenuous. Again, this sub is a cesspool, of course they don't want new users to see it. Same reason they don't want new users exposed to

       Isn't that what this subreddit is about? Claiming things aren't true? Scrutinizing every time Obama takes a dump, and then citing a decrepency in White House toilet paper expenditures as proof of something amiss? Isn't this the same sub that had some posters with no knowledge of video posting that their viewing of the latest police shooting indicated to them that it was staged (because the victim didn't die like they do in the movies)? Yet you're suggesting it's outsiders who scrutinize everything, find trivial inconsistencies and then raise a stink about things?!? WOW.

       "Conspiracy theorizing" happens because of paranoia, we begin to scrutinize the world around us, aware of how much of it is oriented around parting you with your money, around self interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, in the end, without enough evidence or information, assumptions can only be made with a DEGREE of certainty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some in here completely indulge in the paranoia and thus make statements and posts that reflect this. They state things like fact, finding obscure blogs as key evidence, and as a result make the actual hidden crimes of humanity trying to see the light of day on here much less believable and I mean we're already starting out on the wrong foot by posting under a sub name that takes on a negative cliche against "unconventional ideas" so come fucking on.(Conspiracy)
      </p>
      <p>
       Others emphasize well cited evidence, documentation, and rigorous logic to any assertions made on here. Now the two groups of people aren't mutually exclusive, rumors on obscure websites do manifest into reality as much as headlines on national television erect placards of deception and manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key to it all is reason. We must have the intellectual discipline as a
       <del>
        generation
       </del>
       people that is interested in affecting its political destiny, to stomach text, to think critically and examine all assumptions, all statements and moves by stakeholders and both rational and irrational actors that have a claim on our future. This sub represents democracy by allowing full on speculation about power, even if it starts sounding ridiculous, even if it starts sounding threatening to the richest man or company on earth.

       Who cares if you spend your time being downvoted arguing with shills? The more you talk with them, the easier it gets to force them into displaying their true nature. They don't want to contribute insightful information, they want to win a point in an argument so they can present their platform.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignore the emotional attacks and inevitable death threats and continue spreading information. What you are telling them creates cognitive dissonance and strife and they direct that anger at you. Forgive them for that, it is a normal reaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone is confused, and tired of all the lies. We naturally defend ourselves from junk information when we are bombarded with such information density each day. But the truth resonates: each truth confirms each other truth, that's what makes an epiphany so beautiful. The more truths you spread, the more people will respond because it harmonizes with something they already know to be true.

       It's frustration. You get tired of hitting the same old pre-programmed barriers again and again. Most of the negativity here (and I'm speaking of the political and social threads, not the space alien and bigfoot threads) comes from conditioning implanted by the media over decades of television and movie watching. You can't break that conditioning for another person, you can only show them something that creates cognitive dissonance in their mind, and may cause them to question their conditioned assumptions.

       Conditioning exists, it's a genuine psychological field of study which is known to be used by higher entities such as governments and marketing campaigns to implant specifics into the citizen's minds (e.g. AXA Life Insurance for the elderly being advertised on Cartoon Network).

       That's not placing themselves above or below anyone. We're not, that's the point. We are equal members of what is an unequal society, and the only way to break out of it is for more people to begin questioning what the mass-media is feeding them. That's not aimed at claiming superiority, but a concern for society and wanting those who are still a part of the system (as we all have been) to 'wake up' for lack of a better term.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only difference between the sleeping and the awoken is that we question the stories more.

       Reddit has been compromised for a long time?

       It was astroturf from day one. There really is no denying that.

       As far as the nonsense in the other subs goes, I'll pass.

       I literally typed in the word "conspiracy" and then searched for a sub talking about conspiracy theory.

       The Snowden Affair was what brought me not just to r/conspiracy, but reddit.  Hadn't ever really cared enough to look for myself outside of official sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I knew I had to see what was cooking in r/conspiracy.  First of all, just to see the reaction.  That incident was to conspiracy folks what the Obama election was to liberals.  It was a mass awakening of hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people.  At dinner tables all across this country, there were a lot of awkward silences as the already-informed were able to proudly say "I told you so!"  This sub was basically jizzing in the air and making it rain, and it was a delight to see vindication en-masse.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened when I got here?  I found the best detailed information on the events that had transpired.  For a moment, everyone who had dismissed the members of this sub as the tinfoil hat brigade, they were showing up here asking, "
       <em>
        Hey, remember that thing that you were telling me about that I refused to believe?  Yeah, that thing.  Do you think you could, maybe, tell me the details and show me your research, and also, how did you never tell me about this?  Wow this is such a big deal, I can't believe this was going on to such a degree and with so much money and no one was looking at it.  Thank god we know now, I just wish someone had told us earlier.
       </em>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       When this sub briefly became highly respected and, for a moment, people's eyes were wide open, these ideas became less marginalized, and thus dangerous to the power structure.  Soon after there were massive brigade attacks, as well as a huge increase in the shill anti-semite accounts that make us look like hateful lunatics.

       I already do. But I use an alternate account so that the factual, verified, sourced refutation of people's claims isn't dismissed with "hurr I can see you're a

       I don't think it is. Judging someone based on where they post instead of their arguments is dishonest, and the more people start looking for themselves and finding their own examples of blatantly dishonest behavior, the more they'll start questioning the narrative.

       I didn't even watch it for more than a couple minutes, but it's been useful for pointing out users like yourself. I think it was an obvious hitpiece to discredit this community, just like the recent April Fools' joke from

       , just like the upcoming 'Dark Journalist' AMA.
