        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey, what&#39;s going on here?</p>

<p>I noticed this first when I tried to find a mention of the contents of the sign <a href="https://www.google.com.br/search?q=capitol+suicide&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">via google</a> (this link is to search for &quot;Capitol suicide&quot; on google). </p>

<p>Scrolling down the results, <a href="http://imgur.com/9v5f38a">only one link appeared to give detail</a>. The page that purports to be linked here is <a href="http://www.natmonitor.com/news/man-kills-himself-in-front-of-u-s-capitol-building-holding-tax-the-one-percent-sign/">http://www.natmonitor.com/news/man-kills-himself-in-front-of-u-s-capitol-building-holding-tax-the-one-percent-sign/</a>.</p>

<p>But when you click on it, google or some other re-direct sends you to here: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/u-s-capitol-lockdown-police-article-1.2181665">http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/u-s-capitol-lockdown-police-article-1.2181665</a></p>

<p>(In case it changes, it was <a href="http://imgur.com/u8f5Oph">this</a> and <a href="http://imgur.com/k1F9oC7">this</a>... using the same phrases to describe the protest that everyone has now:&quot;social injustice&quot; and a generic &quot;taxation&quot;).</p>

<p>So I went to <a href="http://natmonitor.com/">the National Monitor homepage</a> and <em>it</em> <a href="http://imgur.com/kl2InDT">still had, as its top article, the story</a> with headline (and url) mentioning the sign&#39;s content but <em>it too</em> goes stright to the NY Daily News article when clicked.</p>

<p>From my experience working on the web, I think it is most likely that the servers at nationalmonitor.com are actually receiving the right request but forwarding back off-site. However, it is in the realm of possibility that it is being grabbed at the level of the ISP.</p>

<p>Anyone with the chops to dig in and spot the difference, please take a look.</p>

<p>EDIT: Also, there was <a href="http://imgur.com/nmKo5SF">one other mention of the &quot;one percent&quot; part on the google result, higher up</a>. It was to the original reddit thread for the National Monitor article, which got 4855 points and 5857 comments so far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s one of the great American myths that we have a free media. People like to cling to things like NPR and even CNN, even though they are intentionally more progressive to seem alternative when really they&#39;ve been pulled into the same hard-line propaganda fold. </p>

<p>On the other side you have the Alex Jones and what not, which really do more to hurt the cause of progressives in the same manner as Rush Limbaugh or Pat Robertson. All three of those say what they have to for ratings and money. I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re true believes in what they say or not (and I&#39;m not sure which alternative is scarier)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t watch the news anymore. If you want good independent sources, the best you&#39;re going to get are Democracy Now or TRNN or what&#39;s left of the old American News Project (it changes names and ownership ever few years; I&#39;ve stopped keeping up)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Progressives&quot; look it up. &quot;Conservatives&quot; used to be called &quot;liberals&quot; and.  There were &quot;liberals&quot; and &quot;progressives&quot; at the turn of the twentieth century (1900s). The American people became disgusted with &quot;progressives&quot; after Woodrow Wilson so they stole the more popular &quot;liberal&quot; label and started calling themselves that. Keeping the same policies but hiding behind a brand that citizens liked.</p>

<p>The end result is that we have two parties now, both dominated by &quot;progressive&quot; ideology. It&#39;s the illusion of choice. The true classic liberal ideals are touted by Ron Paul, his son, Rand, Ted Cruz, Alan West, and a couple others.  This is why the democrat machine will go with Hillary and the republican machine wants Jeb Bush. They are both &quot;progressives&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Progressives&quot; don&#39;t believe in the constitution and have been working to make it irrelevant for over 100 years, they have always been playing the long game.</p>

<p>Read up on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure how this whole &quot;rag on SJWS&quot; came to be, but it&#39;s a significant problem on a linguistic framing level. Social injustice is a real thing, and it&#39;s something that all of us have a stake in trying to fix. The problem is in how so-called SJWs try to go about this. The tactic of trying to stamp out speech deemed to be hateful is counterproductive at best, and at worst a form of agent provocateurism. Hear me out.</p>

<p>Today, many young people&#39;s only or main interaction with the term &quot;social justice&quot;, especially on social media, is through this concept of the SJW. For the most part, they are persuaded to be in the camp that social justice is necessary and SJWism is the way to do it, or that these SJWs are ruining the internet and are the scum of the earth. Either way, they&#39;re not getting the crucial piece of information that social justice is impossible without economic justice. </p>

<p>From the two-tiered justice system, to poverty and its many ills, people suffer social injustice when they do not have economic justice, and do not have the means of fighting it. Case in point, there are many rich black or gay people that face little to no social injustice, because their class protects them. But for every one of these, there are hundreds of gay youths living on the streets or black people stuck in generational poverty in the inner city.</p>

<p>By us criticizing SJWs without making the nuanced argument that social and economic justice are things to strive for, and are intimately connected, I fear we may be playing into a narrative that ultimately hurts any cause we may have to improve the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Social injustice is real.  The sjws have nothing to do with it one way or the other.  SJWs are into justice like George Bush was a real cowboy. Eyerape and haranguing people into accepting  genders based on anime characters isn&#39;t social justice, it&#39;s insanity.  They&#39;re not fighting for anything other than the freedom to say that all failures in life are someone else&#39;s fault. It&#39;s pervasive idiocy.  Strong forceful women need a weak man so they can be who they are.  Strong forceful men are sexist. You don&#39;t need to go to TiA to see it either.  Idiot women have coopted the feminism title as a way to completely excuse all their terrible behavior and personalities under &quot;patriarchy&quot; and &quot;justice.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some examples from the Telegraph.UK dealing with women and equality.</p>

<p>&amp;gt;Why men aren&#39;t hardwired to be the dominant sex</p>

<p>&amp;gt;Why Women prefer weaker men</p>

<p>&amp;gt;Chilvary could indicate hidden sexism, study finds</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/11461901/Chilvary-could-indicate-hidden-sexism-study-finds.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/11461901/Chilvary-could-indicate-hidden-sexism-study-finds.html</a></p>

<p>What does any of this have to do with &quot;social justice&quot; or &quot;equality?&quot;   Feminists&#39; &quot;social justice&quot; isnt <em>just</em> in any way.  Is it uplifting to women?  Possibly if your an asshole woman or one of the aforementioned betas. These have a pretty clear theme to them-  and it has very little to do with empowering women with anything other than a list of stupid complaints and an inflated ego to boot.  </p>

<p>If people want to compartmentalize/no true Scotsman the feminists to avoid looking at what&#39;s staring them in the face, be my guest.  You can only see things like &quot;DAE hate that all men generalize women, like we aren&#39;t unique snowflakes?&quot; so many times (from multiple sources in many iterations) without thinking the movement as a whole is full of lunatics.</p>

At this point you&#39;d have to go out of your way to deny that corporations are running America. Not even the mainstream media tries to dispute it anymore, it&#39;s just that the public has ceased caring about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And if those risks and chances don&#39;t play out, they don&#39;t get more wealth. Millions of people in America today are taking <em>real</em> chances and <em>real</em> risks to just to survive.</p>

<p>For example, they have to give their infant spoiled milk because they can&#39;t afford another jug until Friday. So they take the risk.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a little different than investing a small portion of your large earnings that more than covers luxurious living expenses on a stock investment that has a <em>chance</em> for you to &quot;acquire wealth.&quot; Don&#39;t think for a second that that is a &quot;chance&quot; or a &quot;risk.&quot; It&#39;s a gamble for fun and profit, there&#39;s no real risk involved. If you lose, you lose out of your excess. You&#39;re still more than fine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Innovation, success, and skill in all fields are not the same.  Taking an extreme example, but Hitler was innovative, successful until the end, and skilled in many areas. But what he was doing was wrong. By taking lives and conquering sovereign nations, he robbed those people of liberty and life.</p>

<p>A lot of things that happen on Wall St for example, are morally wrong but take innovation and reward the people involved with success. Does that make them right? Just? Should we reward people for being innovative and successful no matter the consequences of their actions?</p>

<p>Bundling sub-prime mortgages and selling them as high rated securites was wrong - but legal - and the derivatives market surrounding these products was even moreso. The people who created this scenario made out like bandits, and were very rewarded. The people who were the losers - minorites, poor people, retirees, etc. - made out like the Jews and Poland. Robbed of liberty and life by someone else&#39;s &quot;success, innovation, and skill&quot; for which that someone else was rewarded by society.</p>

<p>So in my mind, no, we shouldn&#39;t base our rewards for people on those metrics but how they benefited society as a whole, not just themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I was being callous. I have specific institutions in mind. Investment banks. Wall Street speculators. Companies who export factories to other countries or to right to work states. Corrections Corporation of America who uses non violent drug offenders to make boots, helmets, and kevlar for the armed forces. The war on drugs is pointless and creates suffering comparable to Jim Crow laws south. Much of the defense industry is pointless. They who profit from death do not deserve their billions. I believe that banks should be public utilities. Whose profits are loaned back out to the people. Not used for gambling. Shut down the Fed and make state banks beholden to a truly national bank that has the power to print and adjust interest rates. Look up the balance sheet of the state bank of North Dakota (the only state bank) it&#39;s one of the only solvent banks of its size in the country. This system I propose would not be private in any way so the people could actually see how their money is being spent. Lots of things have to change. Especially an end to the corporate coup de&#39;tat of our government policy. I don&#39;t advocate theft just want happened to the middle class to be seen as detrimental to the many for a small increase in profit for the few. Namely inflation, trade deals, student loan debt, predatory lending, pension looting and the exportation of jobs by emotionless algorithms. Better than <em>go read a book</em>?</p>

<p>BECAUSE YOU CANNOT SUPPORT YOURSELF OR A FAMILY ON A MINIMUM-WAGE JOB. People in the &quot;land of opportunity&quot; are living in abject poverty and can only afford one, completely unhealthy, fast food meal a day, if at all. Are you completely unaware of this fact? or are you just a troll... yea thats probably it. go spread your uneducated drivel on 4chan</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your argument- basically anyone should be able to do what they want to do. And whats wrong with that? Well corporations were born this way. Some people wanted to become rich so they worked hard. (of course there are other skills besides entrepreneurship that are valuable but not rewarded by a &quot;free&quot; society, but I digress.) They wanted to stay rich so they hired mercenaries and made propaganda oppressed and exploited and eventually created a system that would keep them- and their offspring, and THEIR offspring- rich forever (capitalism), until the people would rise up and reclaimed what was theirs, and created a system where the wealth would be theirs, forever (socialism/communism).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Libertarians understand society through tiny fragmented chunks of the shattered lens of Liberty through which they myopically view every single political/social issue. We live in a causal universe. We&#39;re not and can&#39;t be &quot;free&quot; in any real respect so to appeal to the concept as though it&#39;s the end-all of political and social discourse is completely misguided. I have respect for the sentiment that what belongs to a person should not be trespassed upon, but to remove all utility and nuance from the statement and pretend as though it&#39;s an unassailable decree from on high is  asinine. Libertarians don&#39;t seem very complex to me, more often than not, they just attach themselves to a vague idea and forgo real utilitarian discourse. It&#39;s often a thin facade for intellectual laziness and self-absorption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The top .1% controls 90% of the wealth. These are your people making millions of dollars per year and they are the issue. The remaining .9% controls something like 5%. They aren&#39;t an issue at all. Don&#39;t focus your hatred at the wrong group of people. Also, anyone who holds offshore assets is without a doubt still considered in the 1% as the threshold is $500,000 /year. Most people who are at the cusp of this threshold (the majority of the 1%) don&#39;t need to load their money offshore as they don&#39;t have the real money that people usually do this with. People making $10+ million a year will inevitably move money off shore but to think they don&#39;t keep $500k in the u.s. is ridiculous</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the other problem too is that, &quot;Tax the 1%&quot; is very vague in terms of a message. Yes, the rich are getting richer but a lot of people fall under that 1%. Doctors, Lawyers, Entrepreneurs, etc. whereas, it&#39;s more of the .01% who are EXTREMELY wealthy who are the problem. Those who are so rich and powerful, they can essentially control anything and everything through their wealth. The message needs to be more concise to the real problem in order to get people on board. I agree that even the majority of the 1% need to pay more of their fair share but I don&#39;t think the hard working upper class is the main problem, imo. Occupy was close with their intent but a message as vague as &quot;Tax the 1%&quot; is not going to get the average working class people on board. In their eyes, calling to tax the rich is just hippies trying to get a free hand out.</p>

<p>I feel for the guy though because it&#39;s hard to imagine what finally drove him to be a martyr. He felt so hopeless in trying to change the world he felt the need to take his own life to incite a discussion on the issue and yet people are completely ignoring him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why the better solution is to tax capital gains at a higher rate than income from employment. Capital gains are currently taxed at <em>15%</em>! This is how Warren Buffet made the famous claim that he is taxed at a lower rate than his secretary. </p>

<p>Of course if you make this too high, big investors would likely pull a lot of money out of the stock market before it went into effect, crippling the economy. This just points out how broken the system is in the first place, and how a simple tax adjustment, even an extreme one, is unlikely likely to do more than ameliorate rather than fix anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IIRC, the highest single year income went to a CEO who was paid a total of around $600 million, most of which was in the form of stock options and a cash bonus in the region of 5 times their salary. I don&#39;t remember who it was, just that it was probably about 2-3 years ago.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/world/top-10-people-with-the-highest-salaries-in-the-world/?view=all">Tim Cook</a>, CEO of Apple , got $398 million in 2011.</p>

<p>Outside of certain families living on the compound interest of the billions they have invested into thousands of companies, there&#39;s only a handful of people that even come close to a $billion per annum, and that comes back to multiple companies, too. It must be nice to have a paltry $1 million salary from 500 companies.</p>

<p>EDIT: I might have been thinking of the highest paid <em>CEO</em>. I&#39;m watching a doco right now that showed the pictures of the five or six highest paid <em>Hedge Fund Managers</em>, all listed as between $1-4 billion in 2007. It didn&#39;t mention their names.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was watching the NBC national news while eating dinner and they mentioned it briefly, &quot;He was carrying a sign that mentioned taxes&quot;. I already knew what the sign said so I didn&#39;t think much of it... technically what they said was true, but then I realized most people would probably think that meant he was complaining that he didn&#39;t want to pay taxes or that his taxes were too high and it in fact had nothing to do with <em>his</em> taxes. </p>

<p>It was a very misleading way to report it when they could have quoted his sign without taking any more time... even though the content of his sign was far more interesting and important to the story than the multiple interviews they did with people who were near the scene when it happened.</p>

<p>On the bright side, the WP article covers the sign much better:</p>

<p>Police were also vague about the sign, saying only that it related to “social justice.” Bishop said two others who witnessed the shooting told him that it said, “Tax the one percent,” and that he seemed to raise it just before pulling the trigger. </p>

<p>The media could downplay this simply to prevent additional people from committing suicide in the name of whatever their just cause is. I believe that downplaying the name of school shooters is also something the media has tried to do with more recent cases in order to prevent other potential shooters from seeking glory and attention in this way.</p>

<p>I for one don&#39;t hold the media in that high of a regard and don&#39;t expect to see such high ethical standards from them.Odds are that if they&#39;re not reporting on something, that someone is telling them not to report on that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This happened to me a few years ago.  We had been on an NHS demo at Canterbury Cathedral (Carnival of Cuts) on the day of the inauguration of the new Archbishop.  An article describing the demo and quoting some of our people appeared in the Telegraph.  Later on that day the article was replaced with a trite account of the ceremony and all mention of the demo was removed (although the link title still referred to the demo and was purple where I had already visited it).  It wasn&#39;t even cached anywhere, just literally never seen again.  It was as though it never happened.</p>

<p><a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:UUp--REzNE8J:natmonitor.com/2015/04/12/man-kills-himself-in-front-of-u-s-capitol-building-holding-tax-the-one-percent-sign/+&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=us">Here</a> is the google cached copy of the article.</p>

<p>Notice how there are two links in the article? The first is to a New York Daily News article. In fact, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/u-s-capitol-lockdown-police-article-1.2181665">the same article</a> that you were redirected to. The second is to a Washington Post article. In fact, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/police-incident-shuts-down-us-capitol/2015/04/11/013caf8c-e074-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html">the same article</a> that I and other people were redirected to.</p>

<p>In addition, if you think that it was a malicious redirect in order to turn the sign from a &quot;tax the one percent&quot; into a generic sign about &quot;social injustice&quot; or &quot;taxation&quot;, the article it&#39;s now redirecting to (the Washington Post one) mentions the sign:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Police were also vague about the sign, saying only that it related to “social justice.” Bishop said two others who witnessed the shooting told him that it said, “Tax the one percent,” and that he seemed to raise it just before pulling the trigger.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I went through all the articles. The only piece of information that I can see that was in the National Monitor but not in the NY Daily News or Washington Post was that the man did not have any ID on him. Everything else is contained in one or both of the other articles, as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t read much of the 5 THOUSAND comments on the original <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> posting, but enough to know there is debate going on in there about this very point.</p>

<p>I think that debate is a good debate to have (what <em>are</em> the facts/stats about inequality? How many Americans <em>do</em> gain from (own the companies that perpetrate) obscene tax loop-holes, off-shoring income, exorbitant CEO bonuses...</p>
