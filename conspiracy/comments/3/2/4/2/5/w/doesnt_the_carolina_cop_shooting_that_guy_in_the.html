       Since your talking about physics here why not start talking some numbers?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your wikipedia link has the S&amp;W .40 bullet with the highest energy with a mass of 10g (I'm assuming that is the bullet itself and not the cartridge) with a muzzle velocity of 367m/s
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's assume a person weighs 90kg (that's about 200lbs).
Let's also assume a closed system where no energy is lost to outside forces like air resistance or friction (this will include any muscle forces that the person can generate to counteract the energy that's transferred to them.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If the bullet stops within a person then we can model it as an inelastic collision.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the system is closed then for two objects, object one is the bullet and object 2 is the person:
      </p>
      <p>
       m1 v1 = (m1 + m2) v2
       <br/>
       (0.01kg)
       <em>
        (367m/s) = (0.01kg+90kg)
       </em>
       (v2)
      </p>
      <p>
       solving for v2 gives us 0.041m/s or ~4cm/s.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the maximum change in velocity that would happen if a person were floating in a frictionless environment and all the energy was kept within the system. Why would you expect to see any 'visible shift in momentum'?
      </p>

       A .40cal bullet really has very little momentum.
      </p>
      <p>
       In simple terms, the amount it exerts upon another object is equal to the amount it exerted on the shooter. Which for a glock 22, isn't that much. Now, even if all the
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       circumstances were identical (force being exerted across the same basic biomechanical structure as a shooter's arms and shoulders etc) that translates to little discernable movement.  Let alone "shift in visible momentum".
       <em>
        Especially
       </em>
       not from a recording of such quality.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Having your momentum affected by another object requires at the least involuntary muscular compensation to prevent visible momentum alteration, which in turn should affect the victim's gait
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's a gross assumption.
      </p>
      <p>
       People get injured, even severely, without noticing it, indicating it or suggesting it with body language. People have been shot nearly point blank, moving
       <em>
        towards
       </em>
       the gun with no discernable change in behaviour. Shock is an incredible thing.

       I'm no firearms expert but doesn't that largely depend on the type of bullet used?
      </p>
      <p>
       A bullet with a hard tip can pass right through someone pretty cleanly depending on where it hits. It won't necessaily cause any recoil unless it hits a bone or something else. Bigger bullets obviously have more force too.

       That was a problem in the incident in Mogadishu, wasn't it?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Fired at short range, the M855 round is prone to pass through a body like 
a needle through fabric. That does not mean being shot is a pain-free 
experience. But unless the bullet strikes a vital organ or the spine, the 
adrenaline-fueled enemy may have the strength to keep on fighting and 
even live to fight another day.
...The bullet does exactly what it was designed to do. It just doesn't do very 
well at close ranges against smaller-statured people that are lightly 
equipped and clothed," says Alexander, who spent most of his 26-year 
military career with the 5th Special Forces Group.
Paul Howe was part of a U.S. military task force 15 years ago in 
Mogadishu, Somalia's slum-choked capital, when he saw a Somali fighter 
hit in the back from about a dozen feet away with an M855 round.
"I saw it poof out the other side through his shirt," says Howe, a retired 
master sergeant and a former member of the Army's elite Delta Force. 
"The guy just spun around and looked at where the round came from. He 
got shot a couple more times, but the first round didn't faze him."
With the M855, troops have to hit their targets with more rounds, said 
Howe, who owns a combat shooting school in Texas. That can be tough to 
do under high-stress conditions when one shot is all a soldier might get.

       Did you watch the video you linked? He responds to the shots sure, but his body doesn't twitch every time a round hits him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "impacts" you guys are looking for in the video aren't something you'll see in a grainy cell phone vid. The cop fired, the guy went down, but when a bullet impacts a fifty year old body that is likely pulsing with what little adrenaline it can muster it's not going to seize up at the first bit of pain. Fear makes people stronger than you'd think, physically.

       I have a feeling that you're unfamiliar with the actual visuals of a person being shot. Don't get me wrong, I agree that we should ask questions, but your original argument above is that the man's body should've responded differently to being shot. So, I'm asking the question:
      </p>
      <p>
       What is your familiarity with what it looks like when a person is shot? Have you been witness to a shooting? Are you a former police officer? Because (as I'm not one to pick through someone's post history on reddit to figure out who they are or where they're from) from what you've said, and your quoting of Wikipedia, I don't think you've ever been witness to a live shooting outside what you've seen on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly mean no offense, just trying to help frame the right questions here. If, that is, we're going to question the validity of this video.

       I agree with you on that I don't believe this to be fake. But I feel like you are projecting a false assumption that all of

       I support the freedom to question ANYTHING even when to me the motives would seem completely obscure and nonsensical or even counter intuitive. The moment we lose the desire to ask even what may seem absurd...you've lost a critical desire.

       I don't believe it to be fake. But I have no video analysis skills to weigh in on the conversation , only that I live in the se us and all of my beliefs are purely based on what fits my worldview.

       It tells a portion of the US and world population that the government as a whole is morally corrupt and gunning for them.   So when shit hits the fan the first thing that runs in your head is every action the government is taking is going to harm you.  That makes people irrational and they tend to act out because of it.

       OP, it is clear you know very little about firearms.  Gunshot wounds are not like in the movies dude. If the cop had a .44 magnum,  you would see what you are expecting. Cops generally shoot .40, which is somewhere between a 9mm and .45 with regard to stopping power. A 9mm will not knock anyone down, or even jostle them, unless it strikes bone or a vital organ.

       That depends entirely on the ammo used.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I shot you in soft tissue with a full metal jacket 9mm, it would pass right through you and you might stay mobile and not even register the shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might experience a sudden loss in blood pressure and drop quickly, but as your blood pressure stabilizes, you would regain mobility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if I shot you with the right kind of defensive hollow point ammo, then that could very well stop you with one or two shots, due to the bullet expanding, not leaving your body, and bouncing around tearing up everything in its path.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, some cops like .40, some like 9mm, and some like .357 sig.
      </p>
      <p>
       all are equally effective in defensive shooting.  Ballistics tests might show one being "better" than another, but for all intents and purposes, they are similar enough to be the same.

       I would find it disturbing if it was faked. That would lead one to think that their goal is to demonise the local police in order to justify nationalizing local law emforcement.... Which i believe is actually happening.

       Dude that's not how it works. Gunshots don't knock people down unless it hits their head and spine. People get shot while moving and sometimes don't even know they are hit. Every hunter knows that prey doesnt always drop the second you hit it.

       The lack of blood is puzzling, although admittedly I've never seen someone shot in the back five times before. Certainly, I would have expected his white t-shirt (underneath his polo shirt) to have shown up some blood when the two police officers inspect his body on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the event does look staged. A traffic cop and a motorist standing in the middle of some park, being filmed by someone less than 20 metres away? Wouldn't the cop have made damn sure the kid handed over his camera, seeing as it recorded him murdering someone, and planting evidence? Instead the cop is just going to pretend the kid isn't even there?

       It's possible that he was just a very bad cop. I'd say based on everything in the story that's the most likely. The guy was planting evidence clear as day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also check out his history. He's gotten away with this stuff before. He probably thinks he's untouchable.

       Watch the police officer frame by frame, his color tone changes slightly the moment you see his weapon firing, as well as the taser lines completely disappearing before the color shift.  Also notice that when he moves behind the tree after he's finished shooting.  As he crosses the camera pans up for a moment and then down after the officer returns from behind the tree.  Most likely, the tree in the foreground is computer generated and the camera being moved up is to prevent anyone from noticing inconsistencies when the officer crosses behind it.

       A .40cal bullet really has very little momentum.
      </p>
      <p>
       In simple terms, the amount it exerts upon another object is equal to the amount it exerted on the shooter. Which for a glock 22, isn't that much. Now, even if all the
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       circumstances were identical (force being exerted across the same basic biomechanical structure as a shooter's arms and shoulders etc) that translates to little discernable movement.  Let alone "shift in visible momentum".
       <em>
        Especially
       </em>
       not from a recording of such quality.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Having your momentum affected by another object requires at the least involuntary muscular compensation to prevent visible momentum alteration, which in turn should affect the victim's gait
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's a gross assumption.
      </p>
      <p>
       People get injured, even severely, without noticing it, indicating it or suggesting it with body language. People have been shot nearly point blank, moving
       <em>
        towards
       </em>
       the gun with no discernable change in behaviour. Shock is an incredible thing.

       Since your talking about physics here why not start talking some numbers?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your wikipedia link has the S&amp;W .40 bullet with the highest energy with a mass of 10g (I'm assuming that is the bullet itself and not the cartridge) with a muzzle velocity of 367m/s
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's assume a person weighs 90kg (that's about 200lbs).
Let's also assume a closed system where no energy is lost to outside forces like air resistance or friction (this will include any muscle forces that the person can generate to counteract the energy that's transferred to them.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If the bullet stops within a person then we can model it as an inelastic collision.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the system is closed then for two objects, object one is the bullet and object 2 is the person:
      </p>
      <p>
       m1 v1 = (m1 + m2) v2
       <br/>
       (0.01kg)
       <em>
        (367m/s) = (0.01kg+90kg)
       </em>
       (v2)
      </p>
      <p>
       solving for v2 gives us 0.041m/s or ~4cm/s.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the maximum change in velocity that would happen if a person were floating in a frictionless environment and all the energy was kept within the system. Why would you expect to see any 'visible shift in momentum'?
