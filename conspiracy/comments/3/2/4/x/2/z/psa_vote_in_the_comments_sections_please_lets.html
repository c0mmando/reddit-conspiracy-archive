It seems that some our less agreeable &quot;users&quot; would like to turn this place into <a href="/r/actualconspiracies">/r/actualconspiracies</a> Which in itself is a joke because it basically requires mainstream affirmation of a conspiracy.

<p>The reason we have a sub dedicated to &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is to have a place where unpopular theories and ideas can be discussed without having to nail them down with verifiable facts before the conversation even begins.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s also not forget that in the realm of deception and conspiracy, verifiable truth is not always easy to come by. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, so demands for &quot;prove it&quot; make me check which sub I&#39;m posting to.  The downvote brigade really doesn&#39;t like anything alluding to cern being a portal or stargate, even though their own documentation says they&#39;re looking for other dimensions, and for the record, I&#39;m really not cool with opening any portals to other dimensions, just saying.  Fukushima being an extinction level event in slow motion is trivialized. There&#39;s so much hatred for Israel it&#39;s palpable, when Israel is more than likely just another tool to manipulate, divide and conquer.  Bibi is supposed to be a 33rd degree mason, he&#39;s more than likely following the script too. Poor little Iran who never hurt anyone tweets out &quot;death to everyone&quot; every other day, which is also in the script.  It&#39;s CONFUSION and trauma based mind control.  Step back and look at a big picture. </p>

<p>I think there are limits to this, sometimes unpopular theories happen to delve into the realm of possible psyoperations where posts about Hitler or the Holocaust which have the purpose of trying to change opinion for the wrong reasons, I.E to set people against eachother. It is a step in the wrong direction. Its clearly trying to divide because even if the Holocaust didn&#39;t happen (which I do thing it did). Its going to cause massive divisions between the people in this sub and the world out there. This is a great way for provocaturs to destroy the creditability of this sub and I think its important that we stick to topics that are going to bring about real change in our world. People are not ready to go delving into the truth of hilter or the Holocaust especially with the fact that we have things we need to be focusing on at home right now that directly effect our lives, like exposing our government and private entities that work to enslave us.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, the idea of the police state is very real and there are a lot of bad cops who have abused and will continue to abuse their power, but we all face much bigger problems (and this includes the police themselves).  It all comes back to keeping people divided and fighting amongst themselves in my opinion.</p>

<p><em>We</em> may not, but I suspect there are some who do.  Certain topics almost never even reach the front page let alone the top 10 or number 1 spot (where they may actually reach a wider audience).</p>

<p>The other thing I see a lot is the top comment in a thread will have three, four, five times the number of upvotes as any other comment in the thread and will be &quot;debunking&quot; the OP.  It just doesn&#39;t look or feel organic at all, and it happens constantly (like in the one Boston Bombing thread from today).</p>

<p>The number of votes is visible when the total is positive. If the vote total goes negative, reddit hides how many voted. This is a &quot;feature&quot; that is open to manipulation, in my view.</p>

There are people that are using this information to cast this sub in a negative light for their own purposes. I feel like some of the mods are part of it which is why I asked the mods to have rules about how they use their powers inflate their own content.</p>

<p>Lately this thing with the mods is starting to feel like a take over of this sub. So if the mods were smart the would enact some rules on their powers so it doesn&#39;t look like they are abusing their position. This is my take on the situation.</p>
