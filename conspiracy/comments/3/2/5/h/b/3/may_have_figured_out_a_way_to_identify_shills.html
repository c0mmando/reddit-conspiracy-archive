I have been using Vote detective <a href="http://www.votedetective.com/">http://www.votedetective.com/</a>.</p>

<p>So I went to look the users up using <a href="http://snoopsnoo.com/">http://snoopsnoo.com/</a></p>

<p>What I noticed was the site was unable to pull in the user data of the ones that I felt may be shills.  Other users the site works as expected.  Is it possible these sockpuppet accounts are protected somehow from scraping the data on them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks! I noticed the server issue and while looking into the logs, I saw this thread in the HTTP referrer field, so I figured I&#39;d give an update. And yes, I am caching the results. This explains why you were able to see cached results by putting the username in the URL, but new users were not being processed due to the server issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might actually be on to something.  I was playing around with it and, you are correct, that &quot;regular&quot; users show up.</p>

<p>I put in the name of one guy who I figured was Stratfor based on his location and the consistent alignment of his policy positions with them.  </p>

<p>All I got was &quot;This will only take a minute&quot; for him.</p>

<p>&quot;Regular&quot; users seem to pop up immediately.  It&#39;s pretty inconclusive, all things considered.</p>

<p>edit:  The site is back up and the person from before is now showing up.  I don&#39;t think this method shows anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting approach. We should look into this further and see if it&#39;s a fluke or actually an indicator of something.</p>

<p>If so, I can create a bot to aggregate this data and do some kind of cross-reference analysis.</p>

<p>My only fear is turning it into a &quot;shill&quot; witch hunt with false positives. It might be best for the bot to post weekly reports into its own subreddit and subscribers here could reference the data.</p>

<p>Maybe the option to message the bot a username query and it&#39;ll reply to you with a report.</p>

<p>We need something to fight this very obvious nonsense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Smart shops will not use the posting accounts to vote brigade. They will have &#39;passive redditor bots&#39; which click on all the articles in reading patterns and upvote targets which are selected via heuristics, watch lists, or triggers added to queues by human analysts. (Who in turn might be the shills you have identified)</p>

<p>The only way to succeed here without having access to all of Reddits own data, is to create timeline models.of user activity over time and correlate the downvoting activity. </p>

<p>This takes months before any meaningul patterns are discernable. You must also take into account the patterns of heavy regular user traffic and develop a weighting system depending on time of day.</p>

<p>You must also maintain several accounts yourself, some of which are &#39;control group&#39; accounts. When an account of yours is added to a watchlist, the data becomes less useful.
Corporate sponsored shill rooms keep more or less 9/5 hours plus a small late shift. State sponsored outfits will use rotating shifts to cover 24/7 with slightly less aggressive activity but more intense data/intel collection.</p>

<p>Bots run 24/7.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they&#39;re in read-only mode (for maintenance, maybe?) - so you&#39;ll see data from people that have been searched before, but no new data. So probably not a shill-indicator, more like a &quot;hasn&#39;t been looked up before&quot; indicator, which could just mean a new account, which could mean anything.</p>

<p>FWIW, if you go to the user page, it looks like you can prompt it to refresh - but not sure if that&#39;s working or not, &quot;processing&quot; seems to go awhile, but that might just be normal.</p>
