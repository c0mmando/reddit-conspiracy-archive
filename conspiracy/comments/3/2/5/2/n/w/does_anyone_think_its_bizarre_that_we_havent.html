       Every single major court case is shown on the media with footage and pictures from inside the courtroom. OJ Simpson, Casey Anthony, major terror and crime suspects -- all except the Tsarnaev trial. We have seen and heard absolutely nothing of this guy since they pulled him from that boat last April. Not once. Only courtroom sketches that could've easily been faked. Now, he's supposedly been convicted and sentenced to death, so we'll never hear his testimony. How in the hell has no one picked up on this and think it's beyond bizarre?

       Tsarnaev has not been sentenced to death yet. He's been found guilty of 30 counts. 17 of those come with the possibility of the death penalty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another round of witnesses will now be called and the jury will decide if he gets life without parole, or death next week.

       Yeah they're Casting his brother as the more evil of the pair, with him just going along. They'll still put him away for life. But the death penalty seems a little harsh for someone who just went along with his brother.

       That was his lawyer that did that.   They, as in the court system did not do that so much.  Really the whole brother was the ring leader thing only comes from the guys defense lawyer.   The lawyer did that in hopes of a life sentence over the kill switch.

       Based on I think he is an evil man that chose to kill and injure a large group of people. He was not coerced by his brother and he had the choice to leave or prevent it whenever he wanted. He never tried to prevent anything and acted out of his own free will.

       it all depends on how he acts, if he's a good patsy and stays quiet and accepts his fate then he'll be locked away in the deepest darkest hole the can find. if he's all "i didn't do it, we were set up, this is a conspiracy, we were hired to play a role in the bombing practice exercise that was being held that day" then well....death sentence...

       Actually, this

       . Only 33% want the death penalty. However, the jury likely does not reflect these stats, because in order to be selected they had to say they could potentially apply the death penalty in this case. So the jury is likely much more pro-death penalty than your average Bostonian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you just assume most Bostonians would want him to get death?

       Of all the other reasons I oppose the death penalty (state-sanctioned murder, history of innocent people sentenced, etc) this one has always aggravated me. Say you're charged with a capital crime. At least in theory, you are to be tried by a jury of your peers, which I would take to mean a relatively unbiased sample (unbiased in how they are selected, that is, not necessarily the individual jurors).
      </p>
      <p>
       But by automatically removing anyone opposed to the death penalty, you skew the sample to a population more predisposed to the concept of retributive justice. To my mind, this makes it more likely that you will be convicted of the crime itself, let alone the sentencing phase.

       I agree! I think the feds say that this was a crime against the country, so capital charges are appropriate, and the jury need not reflect the politics of Massachusetts. I don't agree with them, but that's what they say.

       Again, being totally against the death penalty in all cases was a disqualifying factor in jury selection. So no, they didn't have the opportunity to weed supporters of the death penalty out - those were the only people allowed in.

       You have apparently been totally misinformed. The defense had no choice in the matter - because this was a federal case and the feds are trying for the death penalty, being totally against the death penalty disqualified you from serving on the jury. Just as people who might say "I'll definitely vote for the death penalty!" were disqualified for being prejudicial, so too were people who said "I could never vote for the death penalty." Both of these groups had their mind made up before the trial, which means they couldn't see the evidence and decide based on that whether Tsarnaev deserved death.
      </p>
      <p>
       This feature of the jury has been

        widely reported
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Journalist Masha Gessen, who covered the trial at the federal courthouse in Boston, says the juror selection process offered a clash between Massachusetts culture and federal law. Capital punishment hasn't been legal in Massachusetts since 1982 and hasn't been used in a state case since 1947. "The vast majority of residents are opposed to the death penalty," Gessen says. "On the other hand, it's a federal case, it's a death penalty case.''
       </p>
       <p>
        What that meant:
        <strong>
         Any juror who was opposed to the death penalty was automatically disqualified.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Please, at least read up minimally on the case before thinking you know everything about it.

       Next time, consider taking a look at a primary source yourself. Being informed can lead to much more productive discussions. If, in the future, someone corrects you about a point of fact, try doing some research of your own and applying your critical thinking skills to it, instead of just assuming they're wrong and you're right.

       Ah, but there's the rub - you didn't
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       anything. This situation (needing jury members to consider the death penalty) holds true for every capital case, ever. You seem to be suffering from the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">
        Dunning-Kruger effect
       </a>
       - you were so ignorant about these issues that you were incapable of recognizing your own ignorance. If you didn't know that capital cases require jurors to be theoretically pro-death penalty, you know very little about the law indeed. As I said, productive discussions usually require the participants to have at least some background knowledge of the matter at hand, but again I understand that you were incapable of understanding your own ignorance. By educating yourself, you may gain a better perspective on your intellectual shortcomings. Hopefully, this conversation can be a first step in that journey. Good luck!

       33% of the people who answer polls don't think he should be killed. I know a lot of people from Boston and they spent half an hour thinking of clever ways to apply the death penalty. Troll around some of the bars in Boston and ask what people want instead of accepting the number from the polls.

       No, you got it backwards - 57% of people who answered this poll think he should get life in prison instead of death. This survey is much more reliable than your anecdotes from Boston bars.

       You're right I quoted the number backwards, I just don't trust public opinion polls because I've literally never met anyone who answered one. So how could there poll possibly be representative of the populations oppinion? I can admit I may genuinely be terribly ignorant about polling methods and all kinds of wrong on this.

       You would have to look at the methods of the survey, but the authors say there is a 3.7% margin of error:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The random telephone poll was conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center for the Globe and included responses from 704 adults in Boston. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In my experience, regulars at Boston bars trend older, whiter, and more male than the population at large - meaning they are likely more conservative and more supportive of the death penalty than the average resident.

       So according to Google the population of Boston is around 645,966. I just cannot fathom what spread of 704 adults you can poll and then extrapolate that out with any confidence to a population of nearly 650k.

       Right, but this is the whole premise of random sampling. They design the survey so that the sampling is truly random, and an accurate picture of the city as a whole can be determined.

      <p>
       I'll just note that earlier you were apparently convinced by what you heard in Boston bars, but now a study that is much larger than your anecdotal one isn't comprehensive enough.

       why do you wish him death.

       even if everything they say is true, they literally said the reason they did this was because the USA has been carpet bombing Muslim nations...

       who are the real terrorists? maybe you should ask for the death of the source of the problem...and not just a minor reaction.

       Of course it is terrible quality.  They have to escort the guy in and out of prison thru a back door where no cameras are just in case somebody tries to kill him on their own because they are afraid he won't get the death penalty  so this picture was taken from a helicopter.  But it doesn't matter.  It could be a close up of the guy's face and people who think this was all just a staged event would still say it wasn't him or "well it's him but he is just taking the fall" or whatever.  There is no evidence that is going to change anybody's mind.  There was a video released where he puts a backpack down and then moments later a bomb explodes right where he was standing and people still ignored that.

       How do you figure that seeing someone in court is more likely to create a martyr than shit like
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/0U0ozqt.jpg">
        this?
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you honestly believe that the brother who at least got a trial is more likely to be a martyr than the one who was murdered viciously under suspicious circumstances and likely while in police custody?
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole 'don't want them to be martyrs' idea is a fairytale and nothing more.  They're more than happy to plaster murdered leaders and dead terrorists all over the news, as long as they actually have photos or any proof of the person's death.  They only reel this martyr excuse out for shit they can't prove like Osama bin Laden's death or a fake trial that wouldn't pass as legitimate in the public eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your suspicion should be raised every time they claim that proof must be withheld from the public for fear of creating martyrs.

       Yeah but she gets the people who she is working for out of the death penalty.  I'd think that if she was conspiring with the government she'd be losing her bids to save their lives.  It would make more sense for the government to want these "patsies" dead.   This woman is just extremely anti-death penalty so she takes extreme cases where the person pretty much is guaranteed death and tries to spare their lives.

       I dunno that for sure.  Has anyone tried to interview Jared Loughner since he's been a prisoner, for example?  I'm pretty sure it would be allowed.  People have interviewed Tim McVeigh while he was in prison awaiting his death sentence to be carried out and a lot of people think he was part of a larger plot.  If the government was controlling things to that extent I'm pretty sure they wouldn't have allowed him to be interviewed by 60 minutes.

       All of the 60 minutes questions are tangential to McVeigh's innocence/guilt.  Not a conspiracy smoking gun, but basically renders the interview pretty vacuous.

       Actually no, there are plenty of cases where there isn't coverage allowed during trial. Even if he wanted to give interviews, his defense team likely wouldn't allow it because it would hurt his case (or appeals). This is actually the LEAST shady thing I can think of. It's all very standard and very justifiable. I'd focus my suspicions on more curious situations than this one.

       One of the backpacks was annihilated, supposedly Dzhokhar's. Tamerlan's was allegedly still intact (per the FBI photos) after the bombings. Pieces of what appears to be a backpack can be seen around blast sight #2, however these pieces are not white at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for why the second backpack was destroyed and the other wasn't, had to do with the positioning of the pressure cookers inside the packs. Blast backpack #1 was supposedly positioned right side up, which allowed the bottom of the bag (or, rather, whichever side was placed on the ground) to remain intact as the blast pushed it to the floor. The other pack's cooker was allegedly positioned sideways, directed at the youngest dead victim of the bombings. This directed the bottom and tops of the cookers at the both sides of the backpack that were not pointed at the ground, allowing the backpack to explode and achieve maximum damage to the pack itself.

       Not exactly a smoking gun but it adds another layer of intrigue to the story. Also kind of makes you think about his throat wound. People were wondering how that happened.

       It's definitel rich with cognitive dissonance.  There are all the anomalies and surrounding details, but then again there are the victims... I think imaging how that can all be fake in such great detail is challenging.  It gets very elaborate and complicated very quickly. Same with sandy hook. The very real victims and deaths  - nobody ever talks about a theory about how that is all faked.

       Yeah but why were not trauma helicopters flown in to rescue precious lives? The medical examiner had just changed the way child homicides were reported to cover this whole thing up. It was pre-meditated.

       The smoke bombs did not even knock over plastic cups on the tables in front of where the 'explosion' took place. Have you guys spent a single moment reviewing the footage and photos from the event? Completely staged, as anybody who looks into it will see.

       Can someone briefly explain to me why people think this is a conspiracy? Not videos of them and such, because that can be interpreted to seem fishy by anyone. But who was to gain from this? As far as I know, no reform or anything resulted from this, no one made any money, we don't hate any group or country because of it.

       I personally think it was a way of testing the waters of martial law. They wanted to see how easy it would be to turn the citizens of an entire city into submissive patsies. And it worked in Watertown, you had fucking TANKS and REGULAR COPS ARMED WITH M16s instigate martial law and people actually THANKED the pigs. Citizens were terrified to leave their homes not because of the fake terrorists on the loose, but because they were afraid of crossing paths with the armed thugs in tanks.

       Questioning the motive for this farce is good, it means you're thinking, but ultimately it's just pointless speculation.  For example, If I were to steal a car battery from a hardware store, and they caught me on video, and the store subsequently took me to court to recover their property, would my motive really matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       *Maybe I needed it for my boat
      </p>
      <p>
       *Maybe I stole it for my dad
      </p>
      <p>
       *Maybe I was going to use the battery acid to make pottery
      </p>
      <p>
       *Maybe I believed that a cabal of jewluminati lizards needed it for their space ship
      </p>
      <p>
       *Perhaps I believe that my white privilege guarantees me car batteries whenever I crave them
      </p>
      <p>
       Does it matter?  Not really, because if I'm on video doing it the judge is going to find me guilty.

       He's likely already dead. He was silenced just like his brother as they were both set up, (by seemingly unknown entities) to take the fall for this action. Didn't anyone else find it strange that the boat he was found in was lambasted with over 100 rounds, yet he emerged with only a throat wound which conveniently prevented him from talking or telling his story.

       I don't get this. If they already killed him, why not just say that? Nobody would have been upset about him getting shot in a police chase. If he is not dead, and they are just setting him up, why wouldn't they have just killed him before? According to many people here the government has no problem killing people that would be working against them.

       Yeah, no-one has ever interviewed Martin Bryant either.
Poor kid was so fucked in the head, he probably thought he actually was killing people, we'll never know. All I ever heard was that he thought he was "killing wasps" or some such that the voices told him to do. He's apparently now a fat doped up retard kept perpetually on drugs in supermax. Could happen with this patsy too.

       1.) The cases that you cited are state court cases.  This is a federal case, where it's rare, if not unheard of, for judges to permit video recording.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) Tsarnaev had the right to testify, but did not.  This is quite common in criminal cases, particularly ones where the defendant doesn't really contest guilt.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.)  Federal defendants, particularly ones accused of crimes as serious as he was charged with, are rarely seen being transported to or from court.
