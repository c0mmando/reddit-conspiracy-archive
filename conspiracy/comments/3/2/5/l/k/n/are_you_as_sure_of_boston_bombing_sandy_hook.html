       I have a difficult time standing behind the Boston Bombing and Sandy Hook conspiracies only because I haven't seen the kind of evidence as with 9/11. Are you all in the same boat, or are they just as obvious to you?

       They were obvious to me from day one, for the same reason that 9/11 was obvious from day one -- they fit the MO.  All the signs are there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that mean we know exactly what happened, in any of these events?  No.  We don't know whether people really died.  We don't know the exact perpetrators, or whether the designated patsies actually participated willingly.  We don't know the exact agenda, or even the means in a lot of cases.  9/11 may have been committed with space-based death rays instead of explosive charges, for instance.  That's an actual possibility.  But we
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       know that they were all deliberate psy-ops.  And we know the players, in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Since
       </em>
       that initial impression, again just as with 9/11, the evidence has rolled in.  The Boston Bombing was filled with fakery, and it's well-documented -- the guy losing both of his legs and sitting upright for ten minutes without passing out and dying, the FBI executing a witness, an FBI agent falling out of a helicopter, the CIA connections of the Tsarnaevs, the FEMA drill planned ahead of time, the supposed death of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the less-than-competent trial of Dzhokar.  The anomalies in Sandy Hook are more subtle, but there regardless -- people walking in circles, trees stacked behind the firehouse, incohate police response, coroner weirdness, issues surrounding the Lanza house, the death of the lead investigator, strange behaviour of witnesses talking to the media, inconsistencies with the weapons, the man chased into the woods, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what's
       <em>
        much more important
       </em>
       than all of that is the bigger picture.  These events, even 9/11, are all a part of a much larger narrative playing out in front of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shootings are all trivially connected.  Alex Jones dissected the Batman movie weeks before the Denver shootings.  James Holmes said that he was "the Joker".  The New York police commissioner gave a press conference to announce that "the Joker, the enemy of Batman" had committed the theater shooting.  The police chief in Aurora was a former NYPD officer, the head of NYPD intelligence on 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandy Hook was referenced in the Batman movie as the "target zone".
      </p>
      <p>
       Pronounce Dzhokar.  That's "joker".
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there was the shooting in Las Vegas, involving the guy and his girlfriend who were at the Bundy Ranch standoff, street performers who dressed up as the Joker and Harley Quinn.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they're all trivially connected in that way.  But that's just a tidbit.
      </p>
      <p>
       What else do all of these events have in common?  James Holmes' father worked for a company that developed a very interesting algorithm.  What this algorithm does is efficiently correlate bits of information that are connected in an arbitrary number of dimensions, without actually knowing about that connection.  One use of this algorithm is to detect money laundering, so-called "structuring".  Adam Lanza's father is a corporate tax attorney for GE, a company that has successfully avoided paying any taxes at all for the past several years.  There are indications that the actors in Sandy Hook were paid by receiving houses.  Drug money is flowing throughout the financial system;  it was the only thing keeping the banks propped up in 2008.  Would-be-victim Richard Grove says that 9/11 was about concealing large-scale money laundering, and that he was set up to die in the towers because of his knowledge of this.  After 2008, US credit reporting agencies were muzzled by legislation in order to conceal the true state of the financial system, led by the senator from New York.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, so that's one application of the algorithm with some interesting connections.  But another use of this algorithm is object recognition.  This was a theme of the Batman movie.  NYPD commissioner Ray Kelley was at a security conference in Aspen just one week after the Batman theater shooting, announcing the Domain Awareness System that New York had developed with Microsoft.  This system performs object recognition in order to track people as they move through a city.  The NYPD is trying to export this system to cities all over the country, and manage it themselves.  And they need a sales pitch.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is that sales pitch?  Crazy people with guns and homemade bombs are shooting up schools and theaters and marathons.  Let's try to ban guns and pressure cookers.  Oh, sorry, can't do that.  That's too much.  The next best thing is to let the NYPD install cameras all over your city and track everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's canned tyranny.  All of these events are contrived.  They're all connected.  And they all serve the same agenda.

       So you think people who print money are in control of it? lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know what the federal reserve is? It's not about the printing. It's about credits, loans and interest. The global debt is much higher than there is money. If everyone tried to balance their debts at the same time, it wouldn't work because there is not enough physical money to do that.

       Don't forget that around the same time as Sandy Hook there were more than a few other high profile AR15 murders...a church, a mall, first responder firemen.  Funny how something used in 1% of all murders all of the sudden was involved in all major mass murders for awhile

       It took me years to come around to 9/11. Roughly how old are you that you could see 9/11 for what it is, and what historical things led you to be skeptical?

       I'm not sure I can even list all of the things that influenced it, but basically when Waco and the OKC bombing happened, I was old enough to entertain the notion that, perhaps, the US government
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       just be full of shit.  When 9/11 happened, I was in the middle of realizing that most of my college professors were
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       full of shit.  All I could think was "we are completely screwed."

       I was 28 when I fully realized 9/11 for what it is. Snowden's leaks were actually what drove me to say to myself, "okay wtf.. something's going on here. Let me check back in with that 9/11 conspiracy thing and see if they found anything more conclusive."
      </p>
      <p>
       And that was the beginning of my trip down the rabbit hole. Eventually I stopped perusing more and more of the darker truth. To me it's like, I get it now.
      </p>
      <p>
       And let me tell you. After I got over the depression and paranoia from realizing all this.. everything changed. I now have such a greater appreciation for life and everything that's beautiful about it. I can finally accept all the shitty things around me that made me feel off without knowing why (have had depression for 12 years).
      </p>
      <p>
       I get it now, shit is fake, manipulated, controlled and usually the opposite of what it appears. And it's like, I no longer blame people as much for their faults. How could you? Look at this massively complex, elaborate societal structure they've been born into. At this point, the choices they make are hardly up to the unconscious individual.. which is what makes it so hard to even discuss this stuff with anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'm very grateful to have discovered this truth for myself. I'd take this ANY DAY over living my life in ignorance.

       I am as sure that they were events that were utilized to manipulate the public in some way, or to try out new things, on an international, regional, and online scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sure that there are so many holes on the Official Versions™ of them that at this point we'll likely never know the Truth about any of them, although some are close I feel.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I am fairly sure that those blamed for the attacks were either set up as patsies or set up and enabled to do what they did because the effects would benefit the State.

       Yes. However, it is impossible to be certain about what actually happened with these "atrocity" events  - there are different, but plausible theories that could explain them. We can only be certain of what DIDN'T happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       These events have certain factors in common: an official government/media explanation which is illogical, bordering on the impossible, followed by blatant efforts by the authorities after the event to
       <strong>
        prevent
       </strong>
       genuine investigation into what really happened (ie a cover up). Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       This behaviour inevitably leads the observant person to conclude that the authorities were complicit (either with foreknowledge or direct involvement) in these atrocity events.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of Sandy Hook and Boston, my belief is that they were almost certainly simulated events, multi-agency "hyper real" drills made to look authentic with crisis/amputee actors, and where all the "fatalities" were fictional characters.

       I am sure, sure you are a dimwitted delusional person.

      <p>
       Nothing was illogical about what the government said in either circumstances. Yes, sure, the media misreports things. They report things before knowing 100%, based on speculations, upon hearsay. It's how reporting works. Swiping at "Look the media reported it wrong" is the intellectually low hanging fruit of the argument, it means nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       By your spelling you're probably not an American - Nothing substantially happened after sandy hook. Or Boston, for that matter. WHAT WOULD BE THE REASON? Just because you
       <em>
        Think
       </em>
       it was fishy, because you have mental health issues, does not mean such is the case. I understand you're just some reprobate behind a PC who probably doesn't see much sunlight - and I am sorry about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people died man. You can go find them, their relatives for yourself. No smoke and mirrors. Why would they need to fake this shit when they could just make it 'real'?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're so 'Sure of it" go call up the relatives, tell them they're liars. Well, I hope you don't - I would feel awfully sorry for the grieving parents dealing with fucking
       <em>
        assholes

       like yourself.

       When some foreign wanker is suggesting your own government, in your own city - in which the bombs ripped people to pieces and your friends from highschool were working shift and feeding you live updates about the scenario form their patrol cruiser, or they were in Mass General Hospital dealing with amputees, you tend to get a bit fucking pissed off when this shit goes down.

       I'm sorry for your personal connection to these events, but all you did was explain why you're overly sensitive about this.. and that's totally understandable given your experience. But you if you are going to ask these kinds of questions, you have to detach yourself emotionally first. Otherwise you are wasting your time (and clearly you are).

       Yes. Its very hard to tell if young children were killed at sandy hook. How the hell should I know? I remember watching the coroner that day, weirdest shit I'd seen in awhile.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean here's a shooting and a bunch of people are killed and this guy is acting like a moron and giggling. Don't tell me he's desensitized to death. And don't tell me the cop behind him who smirked 3 times was either.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in comparison to 9/11, with 9/11 the details are just point blank. WTC 7 falling at free fall into its footprint, rivers of molten steel found under the towers, "plane" hitting the pentagon...etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the Boston bombing and sandy hook, I can't really point to anything extremely specific to say it's a hoax. But it IS shady and extremely suspicious for multiple reasons. The weapons on the grounds, some guy being chased into the woods, the circling of people and emergency vehicles parking locations, and lead medical examiner acting like a complete fool and a clown.
      </p>
      <p>
       With Boston....it is so rushed, and I've not seen or heard a word from Dzhokar since then.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm naturally distrustful of anything on the media. I'll listen, but its only because I want to know what they want me to think.

       lol nice.. but it's hard to go around justifying all of your beliefs on simply "because 9/11". This is one of the reasons conspiracy theorists get a bad wrap.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do believe that there is a good reason why it's so easy to jump to those conclusions for us. It's like saying, okay I know my girlfriend visited her Ex at 2:00am last night, at his house, when she told me she was staying at her sister's." Do I know what actually happened? No, but I'm smart enough to extrapolate the facts and bring myself to the most obvious conclusion.. she cheated on me. I don't need hard proof at this point, especially when I know she's done this about 80 times in the past and in worse ways.

       No, and No. I am much more sure of 9/11, but I have spent more time on it. I am more interested in the Geopolitical game than the internal suppression game, although boston clearly has an anti-Mulim angle to it.

       There is a lot of photographic evidence that Boston is a con. Less so for Sandy Hook is my impresssion.

       No. I really don't have an opinion either way on Sandy Hook and the Boston Bombing. I'm willing to consider various possibilities.

       I know, for a fact, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that 9/11 was a "false flag" and that World Trade Centers 1, 2, and 7 were brought down by controlled demolition.

       I'm sort of in the same boat as you.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I totally understand, as I am sure you do, that September eleventh was totally and undoubtedly perpetrated by the United States Government, along with Israel and the helping hand of Saudi Arabia. I am sure that more, considering the magnitude of the event, were involved, but I can only think of those at the top of my head.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not well versed I  the Sandy hook case, but I am not closed minded to the ideas that present a different, alternative view to the event itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Boston bombing is something I can whole heavily say was more than  likely a false flag event, or some sort of covert operation,training drill or other wise.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only proof I need is of this is the picture of the "miracle man", who had both legs blown off, sitting in a wheelchair being directed into a safe zone with no trail of blood following his lost limbs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was enough for me because I understand how these people operate, while in the shadows,but yet still in the open.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their motives are deeper than what is firstly comprehensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Review the evidence supporting both claims, the claim that is weak, is probably the bullshit case.

       When a limb is blown off veins and arteries can be singed shut as well as pulled into the body where a natural tightening of the muscles slows and my stop bleeding. I saw it in Afghanistan first hand, that really isn't evidence. There was also a tourniquet applied and there isn't a ton of blood just loose in your leg.... It all comes from veins arteries and capillaries and if the blood flow has been stopped, than obviously there wouldn't be a ton of blood. Especially 15 or so minutes after the injury.

       I am confident that the Boston Bombing was a hoax. There are actual photos and videos of people putting on blood, make up, and prosthetics. It is a closed case. I have doubts about Sandy hook however. Real people might have died, but not the way the media has reported it. We know for a fact that Adam Lanza's photo's were all fake and he probably did not exist.

       IMO no. Sandy Hook was a tragedy, provoked by an unstable teen, household and psychotropic drugs (much like Aurora Shootings, though Aurora possibly has a more conspiratorial root). As for Boston Bombing, that was a perfect example of the purposeful incompetence (and competition) by the so-called "security-intelligence communities".

       Your first two are amateur (in every sense) photo analytics by people with preconceived agendas, making factually incorrect statements (no, those two photos are clearly NOT "exactly the same")., The third obsesses over a bureaucratic typo which proves nothing at all, least of all that Ryan Lanza never existed.

       "Knowing" something doesn't make it so, and more than a 5-year-old believing in Santa Claus. There's a lot more evidence for Santa Claus than that Sandy Hook never happened.

       I am confident that in each event, nobody died and nobody got hurt.

       However, with 911 I think it is still possible that somebody died and somebody got hurt. Possible, but unlikely.

       Whereas with Sandy Hoax and Boston Hoaxathon it is clear as day that nobody died, nobody got hurt.
