Please don't let this detract from the message, which is about shifts. Our reality is shifting, our consciousness is shifting, our planet is shifting all into higher frequencies of vibrations and with it will come a lot of changes. (end edit)
      </p>
      <p>
       The vibrational rate of our planet will be rising drastically (it has already begun) and it is up to each of us to raise our consciousness with it. Once the desire to awaken spiritually has been grasped, the rest will follow. There will be an undercurrent of increased mind control vibrations brought on deliberately by the "control faction" of this planet which will unfortunately sweep many of us and our brethren into its pull.

       This subreddit has lots of problems, and the lack of love is one of the foremost issues. At the bottom of the rabbit hole is the simplest thesis, that the purpose of all that we experience is for spiritual development. I'm not asking anyone to believe, but I do ask you an everyone else keep an open mind to the possibilities.

       I agree, don't ever synthesize into your understanding that which doesn't resonate with or make sense to you. I do hope that when events, physical and spiritual, start to occur, you can give what I say a second chance.

       No, the problem with this subreddit is that it is too broad. It needs to be divided into multiple, smaller subs like
       <a href="/r/supernaturalconspiracy">
        /r/supernaturalconspiracy
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/politicalconspiracy">
        /r/politicalconspiracy
       </a>
       . Most "acceptable" conspiracies on this sub are political.

       Welcome back. Unfortunately it appears you may have been handed a portion of disinfo by certain 'light workers' and the sort. It happens to the best of us, from time to time. Nevertheless, meditation can certainly be useful, for a variety of reasons. I would recommend the

       Soon I will share all of the beautiful, profound spiritual experiences I have had. I'm not quite ready yet. But I hope I can count on you to approach them without bias when I do and then come to conclusions.

       Hi everyone! First off, I regret putting a definitive date in the OP. I am certain about  changes in the space around our planet incoming but knowing my luck I am off on the timing and people will dismiss it as coincidence. I guess this is how it all works after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       This will be the first of me participating at a frequent rate but I am still synthesizing everything I've been learning.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to reiterate the importance of meditation. It will help you see clearly what thoughts are truly yours and what thoughts are a product of the conspiracies we like to discuss in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       The manipulation of our consciousness is happening much deeper than just on a physical level. Keep in mind that all of your hates and fears, all of your vices and all of your inactions are not internal but externally placed upon you. Man is an inherently spiritual being in a state of hypnosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what the awakening is all about. I'll be casually posting every day but if anyone wants to dive into a conversation about this please PM me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Love and Light :)

       Whew! What a relief to know all the questioning and resisting is completely unnecessary, and all we have to do is sit and meditate while the ascended masters guide us gently into the the 4th density. I haven't been so excited about life since late 2012.

       I have spent years of my life researching the conspiracies that plague our planet. I've even written a book on them. But I've come to find that the only conspiracy that matters is the concealment of spiritual truth from mankind. Everything else is just a step on the path to this understanding.

       Is it due to the planets rotation through the galaxy? Certain places in space are more or less dense than others, aren't we set to go through one in the near future (a more dense pocket of space time), and is that what forces spiritual changes?
Edit; or should I say or galaxy rotating through the super galaxy?

       You are right, but one is not necessarily due to the other, rather, the theme of spiritual advancement is being manifested in multiple ways at the same time. Density of the area of space being moved into reflects on perfect synchronicity the timing of humanity to advance as they have learned (more accurately, will finish learning soon) the lessons of this level of vibration.

       I recently watched a documentary that posits that the Sun is in a binary orbit with a brown dwarf star, which gives rise to the 26,000 year precession of the equinoxes, as 26,000 years is the approximate orbital period. I'm inclined to believe this, it would make sense of the fact that ice ages occur regularly at equivalent intervals. It would also explain the fact that every planet in the solar system is experiencing increases in temperature and x-ray emissions, etc. Remember that huge storm that sprung up on Saturn? There are similar disruptions in the Great Red Spot on Jupiter, and Pluto's atmospheric density has increased by %400 over the past couple decades iirc.
       <br/>
       The theory is that we are approaching perihelion in the orbital cycle and this is responsible for the increased vibrations OP is describing. The effects of this increase on humans, via the pineal gland especially, is another topic lol

       You are right. 99% of this "warrior of light" stuff is bullshit. It's that way by design. We have to construct the truth ourselves, not by listening to anyone else, or else the lessons wouldn't be meaningful for very long.

       In my spiritual journey I've read hundreds of texts. The idea that our solar system is governed by an intergalactic council and we are being attacked by a race from Orion who likes to enslave planets is pretty absurd, no? That being said, there are some golden moments in those channelings. The understanding of love and light being one of them.

       I love that book too. I also truly believe that Ra is real and was really being channeled while giving us true wisdom and information to help us in our evolution to the 4th density. Don't disrespect Ra by mixing Doom Predictions in with his teachings. Adonai, brother.

       No messages of doom here :) I am speaking of physical changes in this illusion that will soon be brought about. Usually I would never be interested in predictions but there has been some interesting build up to this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also read much of the channeling logs available on the L-L website that I highly recommend. The topics are more down to earth than Ra and provide good context for some of the more esoteric things that Ra talks about. Of course, there is a lot of junk involved as well because they logged every meditation session since 1975 but it's worth diving into if you have the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for anyone lurking this comment and interested, the Ra material is worth checking out. It's not the complete truth, which makes sense with the context of spiritual evolution being our goal. Understand that all of the UFO and ancient aliens talk had the purpose of capturing the interest of the channeling group and is not necessarily meant to be taken on the literal level. But everyone should decide for themselves.

       As soon as you mentioned 'fourth density' I figured there was a good chance it were pertaining to the

      <p>
       If there is any truth to humanity reaching a 'fourth density' as some call it, evolving into a group soul complex or re-connecting with an existing group soul complex, it probably isn't going to happen over night. Some in pockets of the elite believe a 'culling' will be necessary for this to occur, a nice way of advocating genocide on a global scale and a perfect of example of darker currents tainting such a concept. In that regard, one should beware of those who parrot disinformation, whether via a third-party or directly to you claiming to be an entity they are not, in claiming any specific date immediately upon us will bring forth some sort of mass transformation. If there's any truth to this, it would be a gradual process, a culmination of key events (e.g. the advent of the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeon_%28Thelema%29#Aeon_of_Horus">
        Aeon of Horus
       </a>
       ) spanning decades, centuries or perhaps millennia. That being said, you're free to believe what you wish, and if you happen to be correct I will be the first to admit I was wrong. On the other hand, if that day arrives and nothing extraordinary occurs, consider it a lesson learned, one we've all been through on occasion.

       Thanks for the thoughts! I've always respected your clarity and level headedness. I agree with just about everything you say. I am in the process of discovering my own truth and I admit the texts of channelings from L/L research have contributed.
      </p>
      <p>
       However I want to assert firmly that I am not listening blindly to any man or entity as I synthesize my understanding and am simply following the incredible synchronicity that has blessed my life recently and it has led to profound changes in my consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, a couple days ago I "severed the cord" to my lower consciousness, as some hermetic texts have termed it. This was the catalyst for me to return and start sharing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope to speak more about everything soon, I am unfortunately having some difficulty constructing a coherent paragraph about all this and will probably wait until I am confident that I can express it in full through text.

       I'm glad to see that you're back and willing to contribute, in whatever capacity you see fit. I apologize if I initially came off as overly critical of your perspective. I happen to personally disagree with at least a portion of your theory, however acknowledge that no man is always right, nor should we be. We all make mistakes for a reason, clearly, to learn from them, myself included (and constantly at that). When I was younger, about 17 or so, after 5 or so years of primarily atheism I became fascinated with the Pleiadian theory, of course being young I lost all interest in it shortly after. A few years back I happen to have delved heavily into the Seth material, and eventually the Ra material, however since have become more interested in a topic I had always found intriguing: the roots of hermeticism, esotericism and how these concepts had influenced history over the centuries and will. I look forward to hearing more of what you've discovered, and will certainly take it all into consideration as well.
