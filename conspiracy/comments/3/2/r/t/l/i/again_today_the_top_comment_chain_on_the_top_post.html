        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">75</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-04-16 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/magnora7.html">magnora7</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The comments are ignoring the fact the story was deleted off many of the major subreddits after a short time. They&#39;re also ignoring that it was often spun in the mainstream media in a way where they ignored the content of the sign and said it was &quot;about taxes&quot; or something vague, implying he shot himself because of his own personal taxes. But his sign was about taxing the 1%, and that&#39;s an extremely key piece of information that was omitted over and over by the American mainstream media. My girlfriend heard about it, but she didn&#39;t hear about the sign, because she got her news from American mainstream media. </p>

<p>Just kinda tired of the attitude shown again and again in that thread like &quot;oh everything&#39;s fine, no big deal that CNN, ABC, CBS, MSNBC, and FOX all did the same thing and omitted the entire reason he killed himself&quot;. It bothers me all the subtlety of the conversation is lost, instead all the comments are essentially &quot;Well, they had it on CNN, so this is dumb to even think about this being censored at all&quot; which is a style of thinking that I wrote <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/310i02/that_moment_when_you_realize_critical_thinking_is/">a different thread about</a> which seemed to resonate with a lot of you, so I decided to make this post too. I&#39;m trying to see the shades of gray here instead of just black and white.</p>

<p>To help me do this, I decided to catalog reddit&#39;s exposure timeline to this particular story so we could think about it, and here it is:</p>

<hr/>

<p>The suicide was on Saturday April 11th at 1pm (which is not mentioned in many of the articles, interestingly).</p>

<p>On the 12th this article goes to 4 subreddits and gets about 30 net upvotes in all. A minor exposure, not many people saw it. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/BasicIncome/duplicates/329l7f/political_suicide_on_capitol_hill_he_took_out_a/">&quot;U.S. Capitol Locked Down After Suicide Outside Building&quot;</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Pay attention to how they talk about the sign he was holding in this early article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The man did not have any other weapons with him aside from a gun but did have a sign with him about &quot;social justice,&quot; according to the police chief. At this time, the exact language of that sign is unclear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He took out a placard that said something like, &#39;Why don&#39;t you tax the 1/4?&#39; or something like that. &quot; Nandi said. &quot; I was trying to read the placard.&quot;</p>

<p>Other witnesses said the sign said something about taxing the 1 percent, a possible reference to the Occupy Wall Street movement&#39;s &quot;We are the 99%&quot; slogan used during protests about the distribution of income and wealth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next day, the 13th, this dailymail article gets posted around reddit, topping out at 106 upvotes on <a href="/r/lostgeneration">/r/lostgeneration</a> and framing it directly as a &quot;tax the 1%&quot; issue: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/duplicates/32esiy/man_who_shot_himself_dead_on_steps_of_capitol_was/">&quot;Man who shot himself dead on steps of Capitol was carrying &#39;Tax the 1%&#39; sign&quot;</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Also on the 13, this National Monitor article gets great traction, topping out at 5000 net upvotes in <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> and another 250 in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. This is probably what most people refer to when they today say &quot;it already hit the front page of reddit&quot;: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/news/related/32h86n/man_commits_suicide_in_front_of_us_capitol/">&quot;Man commits suicide in front of U.S. Capitol Building holding ‘Tax the 1 percent’ sign&quot;</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s interesting most of the top-voted comments in the r/news thread are &quot;Why did it take this so long to get to the top of r/news or reddit?&quot;</p>

<p>Two days later, today on the 15th, this article made its rounds and got about 5000 net upvotes across 8 subreddits, this time getting 2200 in <a href="/r/worldpolitics">/r/worldpolitics</a> and 2700 in r/conspiracy: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/duplicates/32ol3t/man_kills_himself_holding_tax_the_1_in_front_of/">&quot;Man Kills Himself Holding &#39;Tax The 1%&#39; in Front of the Capitol -- and Nobody Hears About It&quot;</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So all in all, the places it got above a few hundred upvotes was r/conspiracy and r/news and r/worldpolitics. And it took 2 days before the media decided that his sign said &quot;Tax the 1%&quot;, I&#39;m not sure why that took so long. </p>

<p>If you see any more articles about this that made the rounds on reddit, post them and I&#39;ll add them to the list. </p>

<p>Not sure what conclusions to draw right away, I&#39;m pretty tired after writing all that, but it is interesting. Seems it got OK coverage now that the second story has broken (the &quot;- and nobody hears about it&quot; version) and it&#39;s hit r/worldpolitics, but it&#39;s strange how long it took for them to figure out what his sign said, and it&#39;s lame it got censored around reddit enough that it had to be reposted again several days later just to make sure it hits all the major subreddits. </p>

<p>Also check out this thread, talking about the same capital suicide story, and how the &quot;tax the 1%&quot; is being scrubbed from it: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/32k809/wtf_is_going_on_with_the_coverage_of_the_capitol/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/32k809/wtf_is_going_on_with_the_coverage_of_the_capitol/</a></p>

<p>Anyway, not all that important in the scope of things, it&#39;s just one story, but certainly some food for thought as a reflection on the state of our media. Now, to go make myself a delicious sandwich. Peace!</p>

<p>edit: also <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/32c02g/the_top_comment_chain_on_the_top_post_in_a/">a nod to /u/JamesColesPardon&#39;s thread yesterday that inspired this one</a>. Thanks JCP, you&#39;re a serious asset to this community. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People need to stop confusing being open minded and being a conspiracy theorist. Every theory is exactly that. The establishment/govt don&#39;t want any questions of their goals/outcomes, and people who are receptive to conspiracy theories naturally question things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>More importantly, people need to stop confusing having a conspiracy theory with believing aliens secretly run our government. There are legitimate conspiracy theories, as there have been many legitimate conspiracies throughout history. The &quot;conspiracy theory, therefore conspiracy theorist, therefore believes aliens secretly run the govt&quot; line of thinking has been parroted by the media far too many times, at the behest of those running actual conspiracies, no doubt. Drives me nuts when people <em>refuse</em> to look behind the veil because the person behind the veil told them to. Only they don&#39;t realize the person behind the veil told them that, they think they thought of it themselves or heard it from some &quot;reputable source&quot; and therefore believe it. </p>

<p>tldr: People need to work on overcoming their dumbness, and avoid having MSM reinforce their dumbness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the past week there have been two people enter the Capitol or the White House grounds with some form of protest.  The suicide (sad, but he was trying to make a point) and the guy with the ultralight delivering letters to Congress.  </p>

<p>So of course the MSM is covering it up.  Those stories indicate that not everyone has joy joy feelings about our government and dissent is not allowed in Obama-Land.  </p>

<p>Like the Today show this morning was all about that cop who ran over a guy.  That happened a year ago.  And a video of some idiot who set his car on fire trying to get rid of bed bugs.  Did nothing important happen yesterday?</p>

<p>Edited to add - You make an excellent point.  Our news is as corrupt as the government it represents. </p>
