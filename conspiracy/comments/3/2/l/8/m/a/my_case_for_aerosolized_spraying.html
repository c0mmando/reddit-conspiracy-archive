<p>I often document these events. Yesterday, to the chagrin of some &quot;regular&quot; users, i posted this photo of a heavy event that was taking place all day. Have a look</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/4jjzggK.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/4jjzggK.jpg</a></p>

<p>Today, almost identical conditions, the trails are nowhere to be found. Am I to believe that commercial airlines vary their flight plans so much so that as many as 30 planes transverse the area on Monday, followed by none on Tuesday?</p>

<p>There is a strong northwestern wind today which leads me to believe that they are paying very careful attention to the weather when they spray. </p>

<p>I should note that I have observed a few Airliners, with no trails, that appear to en route to a major airport. Very different from the jets I observed yesterday traversing the area in grid patterns. </p>

<p>Here is the sky today</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/6LnpQhz.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/6LnpQhz.jpg</a></p>

<p>Crystal blue in 360 degrees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been on the fence regarding chem/con trails for some time. But I can tell you this, since I was a kid I have been obsessed with airplanes, always looking up at them for hours on end, and &quot;contrails&quot; didn&#39;t trail the way they do now. I remember specifically how you&#39;d watch the trail dissipate pretty much within a minute or two from the time it came out of the engine. I have asked parents and relatives, and most that paid attention tended to agree with my observation. So now what has changed in the way that planes fly in the past 25/30 years? What would make it so that now some trails not only linger around for hours, but spread out to become thick milky clouds? </p>

<p>There have been quite a few whistleblowers that have come out and talked about it, hell, geo-engineering isn&#39;t a secret, China used it to keep their main stadium from being rained on during the Beijing Olympics, presidents like JFK have talked about it openly.. It is really not that far fetched to think that &quot;something&quot; is being sprayed out of airplanes, the only questions are what, and why. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same crap happens here in the midwest, Wis/Mi/In/IL......they spray cross patterns and then a sunny day turns cloudy and the planes are unmarked, while the passenger juts are marked and don&#39;t spray.</p>

<p>At this point, I&#39;m guessing they are poisoning us all to make us sick, or dumb us down, or who knows what....but it would be such an ingenious idea cause it ends up in food, water, air and the elite probably have some sort of supplement that protects the from it</p>

<p>From the article:<br/>
 &quot;It&#39;s time to study and maybe even test the idea of cooling the Earth by injecting sulfur pollution high in the air to reflect the sun&#39;s heat, a first-of-its-kind federal science report said Tuesday. The idea was once considered fringe — to purposely re-engineer the planet&#39;s climate as a last ditch effort to battle global warming with an artificial cloud. No longer. In a nuanced, two-volume report, the National Academy of Sciences said that the concept should not be acted upon immediately because it is too risky, but it should be studied and perhaps tested outdoors in small projects.&quot;</p>

Ive noticed recently some days when the skies are clear, I will see LONG trails that seemingly never dissapate, usually 2-3 all heading in the SAME direction spaced out.

    <div class="md"><p>That requires a pretty lengthy explanation. But I would suffice it to say that in an effort to solve a small problem, they created a much larger one (or maybe they meant to). I would suggest looking into the materials you can find on this website if you&#39;re genuinely interested. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, glancing at the site I see a few levels of possible conspiracies about chemtrails. I am interested in which one you believe. There is the belief in chemicals being used to change weather patterns (I have no problem accepting this) and there are people that believe that commercial airliners are spraying chemicals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you double checked your suspicions with a flight tracker? I haven&#39;t tried myself but I&#39;m pretty sure there are sites that display flight information. I think you can even get flight numbers, which would allow you to track which airlines and planes are &quot;spraying&quot; to look for any correlation. </p>

<p>Furthermore, it would depend on you area, but it is possible that upper air conditions are different above you and have resulted in flights taking alternate paths compared to yesterday. The position of the Jet stream in particular can influence flight paths.</p>

<p>If you want to be scientific you need to rule out other possibilities, especially when your claim is as vague as it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just saying, you need to eliminate possible explanations through proper research before jumping to any conclusions. Considering the scale of air travel and the parties involved, you are trying to propose a conspiracy involving thousands of people, at the very minimum. Your explanation sits as one of the least probable at this time. If you want skeptics to take it serious, you are going to need to prove your suppositions by eliminating other possible explanations through research and collecting positive evidence for your own claim.</p>

<p>Aside from the suggestions I presented in the last comment, you may consider contacting aviation experts in your area. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve lived in a &quot;flight corridor&quot; and sometimes you got a lot of planes, sometimes none.  I felt it depended on the weather locally, but I&#39;ll bet it also depends on weather conditions further away (i.e. planes are avoiding New Jersey because of thunderstorms).</p>

<p>Anyway, that really doesn&#39;t seem unreasonable - if you&#39;re going to make an extreme claim you need more evidence than &quot;different amounts of air traffic on different days&quot;.</p>
