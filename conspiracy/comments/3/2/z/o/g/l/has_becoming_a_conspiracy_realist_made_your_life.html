        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The first stage is utter chaos. Not knowing how to process the information you are consuming. The feeling of needing to rant to people about what you are learning having it just come off as utter nonsense as your brain tries to digest. Even when you can fully process the information it is still hard to convey it in a sensical manner. Has learning what you know now made your life better? Maybe you try to educate as many people as you can. If that doesn&#39;t work, maybe you try to make your life as positive as possible, ex: educating further, eating healthy, buying precious metals, learning new trades, gardening, buying local, boycotting certain companies, etc. </p>

<p>This ending <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fbvquHSPJU&amp;t=93m30s">quote</a> from Four Horseman documentary rings true for me, and maybe you as well. </p>

<p>Are you a better person because of what you know now? If so, how? </p>

I&#39;ve deprogrammed myself (to some extent) and am better learning how the world really works. And I&#39;m able to plan ahead, hopefully keep myself and at least some of my loved ones safe through whatever may come.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m thinking Russia and China will keep us out of WW3. I think Europe will pivot to BRICS and mostly abandon the US; it&#39;ll be rough there for a few years, but then rapidly improve.</p>

<p>I think the US will be globally isolated and will go through the worst depression it&#39;s ever seen -- with a populace that is the worst prepared to deal with it. I call it &quot;The Greatest Depression&quot;. I doubt civil war will break out; there&#39;s just too much power in place and too much mind control. There will likely be pockets of &quot;domestic terrorists&quot; but I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll make a dent.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t know any of that for sure. Hopefully, thanks in part to you guys, I have the tools now to keep abreast of changing conditions and stay one move ahead. And maybe I can help some people along the way.</p>

<p>But what do I know; I&#39;m just a computer guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like a member of the rebel alliance standing against the galactic empire. Not a jedi, just a normal rebellion member. </p>

<p>When I see main stream news/television I get sick to my stomach because they look and act like people from the hunger games &#39;capitol&#39;. I despise them. Along with the majority of people hooked on the programming, they&#39;re disgusting excuses of humanity in my opinion.</p>

<p>Has it made my life better? My answer is no. I believe it would be a lot easier to just enjoy the steak and disregard reality. Get excited over sports or x-factor while singing &#39;happy&#39; and taking anti-depressants. Instead of being excited about an Iranian Armada heading towards Yemen with the prospect of more war. Or the potential for full scale conflict in Ukraine. I just want to burn, while watching it all burn. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no.</p>

<p>There are significant hurdles and mental realizations that leave and make you powerless, helpless, and if you&#39;re not strong enough or are still clinging to religious, nationalistic, or other propaganda identities that will no dou t crush you and cause you to lash out against former friends, coworkers, and others when you fully understand implications.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how do you not see it! What&#39;s the matter with you! Let us all unite! Etc</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Until you realize that you partook on this journey mostly by ourselves and part of your strength derives from bthe fact that you continue on persuing things for the sake of knowledge and truth by yourself, and the fact that you pursued this Quest on your own most likely without a helping and guiding hand.</p>

<p>In would argue it is the ultimate process of <em>growing up</em>, and the fact that you continue USBA testament to both your convictions and internal strength.</p>

<p>After you deconstruct and deprogram yourself from the religious and nationalistic propaganda, you are truly free to prepare for what ever is coming and are finally tuned into the reality kept from you.</p>

<p>There is no going back, and because of this, you are both stronger, more determined, and able to affect the world both locally (at first) and hopefully on a larger scale once you take care of you and yours the best way you can.</p>

<p>10/10 would do every time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have found being aware beneficial on many levels.  The first fews years were lonely and pretty damn rough.  I ain&#39;t gonna lie.  I lost a few &#39;friends&#39; and some family distanced themselves during my evangelical phase.  </p>

<p>I think many of us have experienced this phase and reaped the subsequent consequences.  I learned quickly that many people, if not most, don&#39;t want to be bombarded with unsolicited information.  The Truth is a weapon, and once I learned to treat it as such I stopped using it against those I love.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very much like the grieving process.  At least for me it was.  I&#39;ve reached the point of acceptance, and I believe it reflects in my approach to others.  Today, I have great relationships.</p>

<p>I am a better person, but not because of what I know.  I&#39;m a better person because of what I do with what I know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I think so. I think on a subconscious level a lot of people know that shit isn&#39;t right yet their programming means they basically just exist in a perpetual state of cognitive dissonance. They practice cynicism on things they know intuitively and accept things which they should be highly skeptical. It&#39;s Stockholm Syndrome.</p>

<p>I am still shocked and appalled at the magnitude of the deception but I&#39;m also partly in awe of it well. It&#39;s just so epic. It makes life so much bigger and fantastic than I ever thought was possible. </p>

<p>I think many people on their trip down the rabbit hole forget to look for positives. Knowing that free energy exists, that there are benevolent entities assisting us, that we are spiritual beings, that much of the harm of the world isn&#39;t done by my fellow man but moreso by an elite subset and even that too is part of a divine plan being enacted to facilitate our evolution of consciousness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Besides hating that terminology, I think I never <em>&#39;woke up&#39;</em>, or <em>&#39;became&#39;</em> a conspiracy theorist. Let&#39;s just say that the environment around me when growing up always showed its&#39; seams, I saw the hypocrisy, the lies, the overt or concealed back-stabbings around and understood that was The Way of The World. We say one thing in polite company, we say and do another to reach our goals. In family, at work, all over &#39;civilized&#39; society.</p>

<p>So at least for me, guess there was no real revelation over power and its corrupting essence, about getting disillusioned by a leader, a promise, an ideal. </p>

<p>Still, trying to read between the lines of everyday events, weighing the disparaging versions of them given by the spectrum of opinion, and specially thinking before reacting in a knee-jerk manner over them is what makes me feel, if not better, at least less anxious. More bitter and pessimistic, granted, as one sees how supposedly random events and little and big crimes are part of a Big Plan underway, but still, it&#39;s better knowing a bit than just being blindsided time and again and offering everything from our blood to our freedoms at the first scare the bogeyman du jour appears.</p>

<p>Now... <em>a better person?</em> Now that I don&#39;t know. I try to be a decent human, try to make others not fall into the obvious traps an lies, try to do as little or as much as possible to at least throw a wrench in the cogs of the Empire machine... but a better person? Who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. Do you think the rise of modern &quot;individualism&quot; coupled with our dire economic situation has turned the average human into a lying, back-stabbing, try hard to get ahead by any means(within modern reasoning) type of human? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a way, modern society, with it&#39;s new insights into human rights, technological advances and new cultural attitudes should have given way to a more humane, more unselfish way for societies to behave, and in some aspects (and some localized areas) this has happened. However, as you mention, the impetus that current wild capitalism has and its&#39; demolishing power and corrupting influence does nullify or diminish many of those advances. Yes, there are now laws and measures to make companies and commercial competition fairer, but those don&#39;t mean squat if such entities have legislators or those enforcing limits in their pockets, and have the resources to stall reprimands in court or the political pull to become &#39;too big to fail&#39;.</p>

<p>On a personal level... yes, sadly it seems that becoming disillusioned, jaded, cynical does not help with a sense of belonging, a feeling of community. If one considers everything &#39;a scam&#39;, if one snorts at supposedly well intentioned actions because one sees (or believes to see) the real interests behind, well, inaction becomes an addictive way of reacting and feeling protected from events.</p>

<p>Double edged sword, it&#39;s not easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pros: </p>

<p>It has helped me deal with social conflicts and keep my cool. I can talk about a single idea until the other person loses interest and I can listen to others&#39; full ideas without losing interest just as well. I&#39;m very outspoken about certain topics and that&#39;s a big deal being an introvert. I feel that I&#39;m better off because I&#39;m more well informed than most people I encounter. </p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>I&#39;m more cynical, obsessive, self-critical and generally less happy than I was 2 years ago. </p>

<p>I realized that I have nobody in my life who understands how I think and that I can have engaging conversation with about anything. Everyone will lose interest, push my buttons, brush it off with a &quot;Oh cool&quot; or just laugh and call me crazy or wrong. I don&#39;t know how to find the right people to be around. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll get off the couch, Doctor, our time&#39;s up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t think my life is <em>better</em> - i know i&#39;m more informed (no doubt) about what&#39;s happening in the world, with (real true) info, i kinda think it gives one an edge, not a big edge, but i&#39;d rather be aware of <em>what&#39;s coming</em> than feel like i&#39;ve been sucker punched,</p>

<p>i agree with another post: i have no need to preach or rant, i&#39;m over that part now (when info is new it&#39;s natural to feel excited &amp; want to share, but as time goes on you get that you can&#39;t <em>force</em> the truth on anyone), imo, people will either wake up or they won&#39;t,</p>

<p>knowing the truth, is better that believing the dumb shit &amp; living blind. </p>

<p>I know that despite what I hear, Iran is not out to nuke me, there is not a terrorist under my bed, there is no need to be upset if some political candidate is not scoring high enough in the poles, etc...</p>

<p>It&#39;s all theater, none of it matters. I focus down on what does matter, my family.</p>
