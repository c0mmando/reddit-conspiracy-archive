    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps the most compelling evidence in favor of the demolition theory is that the NIST WTC Reports, which took up to seven years to produce, exhibit all six of the characteristics of politically motivated pseudoscience</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lack of experiment - NIST performed no physical experiments to support its conclusions</p></li>
<li><p>The results of experiments were ignored or contradicted in the conclusions - steel temperature tests performed on the few steel samples saved suggested that the steel reached only about 500 degrees Fahrenheit. This is more than a thousand degrees below the temperature needed to soften steel and make it malleable—a key requirement of NIST’s hypothesis</p></li>
<li><p>There was no peer review and public comments from peers were ignored - NIST published its own WTC reports and therefore its work was not subject to peer-review as is the case for all legitimate science.</p></li>
<li><p>The findings cannot be replicated or falsified due to the withholding of data - NIST will not share it computer models with the public. A NIST spokesman declared, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, that revealing the computer models would “jeopardize public safety.”</p></li>
<li><p>False conclusions are supported by media or marketing propaganda - NIST’s pseudoscience was fully and uncritically supported by the mainstream media, many journalists have since stated they were under pressure from management to not report 9/11 stories if they were critical of the official narrative.</p></li>
<li><p>Hypotheses that are supported by the evidence were ignored - Throughout its seven-year investigation, NIST ignored the obvious hypothesis for the destruction of the WTC buildings—demolition</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To conclude, the WTC reports produced by NIST represent the most obvious example of politically motivated pseudoscience in history. The physical experiments NIST performed did not support its conclusions. The reports were not peer-reviewed and public comments that challenged the findings were ignored. NIST will not share its computer models (the last supposed evidence that supports its conclusions) with the public and therefore its conclusions are not verifiable</p>

<p>Is there any plausible reason that this might be true?  Eg. The models might be used by some nefarious group to determine how the best way to take down other buildings?  Or maybe that the models/simulation techniques could assist in the same way? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Along with building 7, the other thing that need to be pounded on is the tapes at the pentagon <a href="http://imgur.com/loyyAZr">http://imgur.com/loyyAZr</a>.  They have more than they released, the ones in the pic, ones from inside the building and ones that were taken by federal agents immediately after the incident.  </p>

<p>Not whats on the tapes, or speculation what might be on them, just why haven&#39;t they released them.  </p>

<p>Its been 13.5 years, and there is no excuse.  They cant use national security, for one, they already hit the building, two, there are simulations of the attack all over you tube, there is nothing the &quot;terrorists&quot; can learn from the tapes. </p>

<p>That fact is something no one who is supporting can get around.  Why cant we see the tapes?</p>

<p>The fact they haven&#39;t released them after all this time is an admission of guilt as far as Im concerned.  How else are we supposed to see that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The complete controlled demolition of two 110 story buildings, on the same day, both which fell into their footprint in the exact same manner, TWICE, on the same day, without leaving the much stronger core structure in tact, is quite obvious. Oh yea, both within 11-12 seconds, where free fall speed would have brought them down in 9.2 seconds.</p>

<p>Very little resistance below the structure as it explodes means controlled demolition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that but trying to convince some one that want to believe the official story is going to swear they are a collapse.  thats why i use the pentagon as something thats hard for them to say any thing but, &quot;you got a point&quot;  Then I start with the building stuff.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhMBjxyH9eg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhMBjxyH9eg</a> Its funny the arguement national geographic is trying to make here.  They are saying thermite, that burns many times hotter than jet fuel would not melt the steal. (at least their test) </p>

<p>So if its not thermite, they are arguing that jet fuel did it?  That doesnt burn hot enough to melt steal.  What was that test trying to prove anyway?</p>

<p>Than Discovery uses a couple hundred pounds of thermite, and barely does damage to a car.  Again what are they trying to prove?  Than thermite wont melt steal, but jet fuel did melt it?  You following me on this?  Their whole arguement is flawed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxl06jxfgRk">WTC 7 went into free-fall (click for a compilation)</a>, literally gravitational acceleration <a href="http://i.imgur.com/N23Y89K.png">(the official reports even admit this)</a> which is impossible in a steel framed building, there is nothing in science or engineering that would explain how every single supporting column would disappear within mere fractions of a second, the only explanation, within the realms of science, is explosives of some description, taking out the columns in a timed sequence.</p>

<p>This violates basic Newtonian physics, IF, you choose to believe the official report that fires caused the collapse, obviously it is impossible for a building to go into freefall in any other scenario, this explains why NIST refuse to release there data for independent validation, the only relevant documents that support their theory that fire brought down a steel framed building (first time in history, still to this day) <a href="http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">are classified for public safety</a>, they will not even release them to a <a href="http://cryptome.org/wtc-nist-wtc7-no.pdf">licensed NYC architect in regards a FOIA request</a></p>

<p>Why are they hiding this data? Likely because it is not based on any known science and engineering principles</p>

<p>This is evidenced by the fact the four simulations that NIST performed with their &quot;global LS-DYNA model&quot; None of the computer animations look anything like the actual observed collapse, the models and alleged simulations are not based in reality</p>

<hr/>

<p>Take a look</p>

<hr/>

<p>NIST’s investigation absolutely begins and ends in the realm of computer simulation, manipulating the numbers to try and achieve the observed conditions, which they couldn’t even do, regardless of this fact, a computer simulation does not constitute an explanation and computer modelling is, at best, only as good as the input it receives and NIST will not give us their numbers</p>

<p>They never even bothered to fully model the structure</p>

<p>And as far as the “withheld data due to national security” goes, until it is known and is in the public domain, it will be impossible for outsiders to know exactly what it supports, as it is right now, the NIST report can be considered a work of science fiction </p>

<p>Their findings cannot be replicated or falsified due to the withholding of data and so if anyone outside of NIST believes what they say, they believe it on pure faith. </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/QyTbq5P">Page 3 and the architect&#39;s appeal over the remaining 3370 files</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>The acceleration of gravity in New York City is 32.159 ft/s2. WTC7 had 2.25 seconds of literal freefall, this is equivalent to approximately 8 stories of fall in which the falling section of the building encountered zero resistance. The collapse was complete in 6.5 seconds. Free-fall time in a vacuum, from Building 7&#39;s roof is 5.96 seconds</p>

<p>For any object to fall at gravitational acceleration, there can be nothing below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance. If there is anything below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance, then not all of the potential energy of the object would be converted to motion and so would not be found falling at gravitational acceleration (where did every single structural supporting columns go, instantly, at the exact same time?)</p>

<p>There&#39;s no exception to that rule, those are the conditions that must exist for gravitational acceleration to occur for the entirety of the duration of the time it occurs, this is basic Newtonian physical principles.</p>

<p>You either agree with this very basic concept, or you need to start making a case for a new realm of science that has never been witnessed before.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltP2t9nq9fI">Remember also that the BBC even reported that the building had collapsed 20minutes before it had</a>, remarkable.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The fact that Building 7 underwent free-fall means that none of the building’s potential energy was used to crush the structure below it. All of its potential energy was converted directly into energy of motion (kinetic energy), leaving no energy to do anything else. Therefore, the lower section of the building could not have been crushed by the falling section. The destruction of at least 8 stories of the lower section of the building had to have been accomplished by other means to allow the upper section of the building to fall through it in free-fall.</p>

<p>NIST’s theory is that the failure of a single column near the east end of the building caused neighboring columns to fail in a progressive manner. This is contradicted by the observed simultaneous collapse across the entire width of the building, which fell with a level roofline. A progressive collapse mechanism would have led to a progression of failures, visible deformation of the building, and gradual, asymmetrical collapse. This is what NIST’s computer model shows, but it is not what was observed. What we observed was the sudden onset of free-fall across the entire width of the building, which can only be achieved by controlled demolition.</p>

<p>The second major Zogby poll on 9/11 was conducted in May 2006. <strong>It was a telephone interview of 1,200 randomly selected adults from across the United States</strong>, consisting of 81 questions, with a 2.9 percent margin of error.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That study agrees very closely with the New York study.</p>

<p>After that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The third major Zogby poll regarding 9/11 was conducted in August 2007. It was a telephone interview with a target of 1,000 interviews with randomly selected adults from across the United States, consisting of 71 questions, with a 3.1 percent margin of error.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That study also found that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Only 4.8 percent of the respondents agreed that members of the U.S. government &quot;actively planned or assisted some aspects of the attack&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It continues in this vein. For example there is</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 2004 poll was conducted by telephone with 1,042 adults nationwide in the United States, with a 3 percent margin of error.[8] The 2006 poll was conducted by telephone on 983 randomly selected citizens of the United States, with a 4 percent margin of error.</p>

<p>Please stop misconstruing data. It&#39;s what debunkers do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Considering your apparently ignoring everything after the first paragraph, it seems to be blunt, utterly hilarious that you are accusing me of arguing that I&#39;m misconstruing data. Remember, the specific issue in question is whether &quot;9/11 was an inside job&quot;.</p>

<p>So, given this, can you please give a timeline or are you incapable of actually making any concrete predictions from your claim that WTC7 is the &quot;key&quot; to anything? </p>

<p>Of course it doesn&#39;t, because most people, as of right now, don&#39;t even know what WTC7 is. But it is pretty clear that if WTC7 was a controlled demolition, then 9/11 was an inside job. Hence I asked you about the more wide belief about 9/11 being an inside job. </p>

<p>It generally is unproductive to pigeonhole people one is having a conversation with into such categories. A &quot;debunker&quot; might easily say something like &quot;a conspiracy theorist, ignoring data? Who would have thought?&quot; and it would have about as much productive value (zero). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I claimed the first data dump was from New Yorkers, not the US as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You appear to be using the phrase &quot;data dump&quot; in a nonstandard way. Let&#39;s briefly recap the discussion.</p>

<p>To my comment that &quot;you presumably think that there&#39;s a decent chance that the US population will one day accept that 9/11 was an inside job.&quot; you wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you presumably think that there&#39;s a decent chance that the US population will one day accept that 9/11 was an inside job.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You presume the US population doesn&#39;t already accept 9/11 was an inside job.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wrote in response:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The data shows that they don&#39;t. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polls_about_9/11_conspiracy_theories#United_States">here</a>. No survey, no matter how the question has been asked has gotten anything like the general US population believing that 9/11 was an inside job. So can you answer the earlier question in that context?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You wrote in response:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You must not have read the data you provided, because here&#39;s the first part of your link:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first one was conducted in late August 2004 on 808 randomly selected residents of New York State. It found that 49 percent of New York City residents and 41 percent of New York state citizens believe individuals within the U.S. government &quot;knew in advance that attacks were planned on or around September 11, 2001, and that they consciously failed to act.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re using data from a state to make an assumption about the USA as a whole.</p>

<p>Please be aware that your 1 state data trick doesn&#39;t match your 50 state opinion. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, yes apparently, you didn&#39;t read the rest of the link, since <em>all the other studies in question</em> are for the entire US.</p>

<p>You wrote further: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Plus it has the added benefit of having nothing to do with awareness of WTC7&#39;s controlled demolition. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the specific response with that data was to the statement that &quot;You presume the US population doesn&#39;t already accept 9/11 was an inside job.&quot; This sentence is not relevant.</p>

<p>So to summarize: the data isn&#39;t just from New York, the link included a New York specific study out of a bunch and you seem to want to focus on that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;ve tried to frame the debate as dishonest on my part, but we can see your trickery</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it can be really tempting to believe that people who one disagrees with must be dishonest or evil, and must be engaging in &quot;trickery&quot; and it is understandable that in such contexts that one would then think that someone who disagrees with you must be trying to &quot;frame the debate&quot; as you are dishonest but neither of these necessarily follow, and they aren&#39;t helpful. Try to imagine for a moment that the people who disagree with you might not have nefarious intent: they may have seen the exact same sources as you and come to a different conclusion. </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Proof of your claim? Billboards in Times Square prove you&#39;re not here to shed light on public awareness of WTC7&#39;s controlled demolition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t have &quot;proof&quot; but the fact that you think that WTC 7 is the &quot;key&quot; would suggest that most people don&#39;t know much about it, yes? As for the second sentence, I&#39;m not able to parse it and give it semantic content in a way that makes sense. Since you are apparently deeply that one out of 5 or so studies was New York specific, I&#39;m not sure how you think a billboard in New York is relevant in this specific case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Concrete predictions is an oxymoron. Any more red herrings in your bag?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Concrete predictions <em>is not</em> an oxymoron. People make concrete predictions all the time.  For example, I&#39;d be willing to make the prediction that the American attitude about who was responsible for 9/11 will not change in the next decade. And I&#39;d make it concrete by saying that no polling by any major poll organization or academic study will have 60% of Americans believing that 9/11 was an inside job. See? Concrete, testable, and with measurable results. </p>

<p>In general, people in our society are very unwilling to make concrete predictions of this sort about what they expect to happen. This isn&#39;t a red herring; you can see if you look through my Reddit history that I encourage people of all sorts of beliefs to make falsifiable predictions from their beliefs. But assuming that someone must have a &quot;red herring&quot; is the same sort of unhealthy assumption that people one disagrees with must be evil or arguing in bad faith. It can be very satisfying, but it isn&#39;t terribly helpful for having productive conversations or learning much of anything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Edit: still not addressing the fact you&#39;re most relevant &quot;data&quot; is 8 years old? Debunkers gotta debunk at all costs, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, you know, I didn&#39;t see where you <em>edited in</em> after you made the comment the apparent remark. Again, it can be really fun to assume bad faith and that every &quot;debunker&quot; must be somehow evil, but it isn&#39;t terribly helpful. Now, that I&#39;ve seen what you wrote (where you know the reasonable thing would have been to say something like &quot;By the way, I&#39;m not sure if you saw, but I edited my above comment) I&#39;ll go respond to that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Edit: data from 2004, 2006, and 2007?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It shouldn&#39;t be very surprising that the farther you get from an event, the less frequent polling is from the event, so if those studies were all one had it might be possible that there&#39;s been a drastic change in American attitudes (but if you thought that, why would you think that WTC 7 is a key to anything), but please note that the Angus Reid poll listed there is from 2010, and it says so in the text. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>TOWER SEVEN</strong></p>

<p>Building 7 was hit by the debris <a href="http://i.imgur.com/wvNAAty.jpg">from one of the collapses</a> which caused fires and facade damage, one easily identified <a href="http://i.imgur.com/1E4Wrej.png">top to bottom gash.</a></p>

<p>Despite the presence of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/REuXNXp.jpg">large quantities of smoke,</a> there was never discovered any floor completely engulfed by fire, only partial fires and only on a few floors. The presence of<a href="http://i.imgur.com/LEeo3dH.jpg"> soot in the windows</a> are the indicator of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/OZ16WEX.jpg">fires that were already extinct.</a></p>

<p>The only fires that last long enough and could be responsible for the building to collapse were only on <a href="http://i.imgur.com/H25G67L.jpg">3 floors</a> and they were only partial small fires.</p>

<p>For a better comparison on the dimensions of WTC7&#39;s small office fires, here you have an example of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RckrL1M.jpg">normal office fires</a> (or just plain office fires) and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KeOLtCQ.jpg">extreme office fires</a> (or <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8t40Tdw.jpg">infernos</a>).</p>

<p>By the time that the collapse initiated <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/news-section/41-articles/761-fraud-exposed-in-nist-wtc-7-reports-part-1.html">there were no more fires near the vicinity of the section that was appointed as the collapse failure initiation.</a> This means that the building started the collapse for a reason other than fire.</p>

<p>Despite public belief, the building did in fact collapse with sudden onset of free-fall (<em>18 visible stories in 3.9s</em>), there were no stages. A better explanation is provided <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPwwcXF_V0c&amp;amp;amp;t=4536">Here</a> <a href="http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2011/07/11/video-analysis-of-nists-claim-of-a-5-4-s-collapse-time-over-18-stories-for-wtc-7/">and here</a> <a href="http://www.sharpprintinginc.com/911/index.php?module=pagemaster&amp;amp;amp;PAGE_user_op=view_page&amp;amp;amp;PAGE_id=207&amp;amp;amp;MMN_position=616:616">and even Here</a></p>

<p>There was also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrnmbUDeHus">a loud explosion</a> that occurred right before the penthouse collapse. That explosion cannot possibly be from any structure &quot;snapping&quot; or &quot;failing&quot; because you would hear in that same video the rest of the building collapse as well, which you do not. If you cannot hear the entire building collapse then that explosion couldn&#39;t possibly be from a column failing.</p>

<p>In contrast with the WTC7 building, here you can see the other buildings that were hit with exponentially bigger forces (hit directly by the towers&#39; debris), some which under larger fires and did not globally collapse:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/IG6zNy9.png">WTC3</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ajG1Eln.jpg">WTC4</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/W7wPbQJ.jpg">WTC5</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/pN4Humj.jpg">WTC6</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/vSKVhSB.jpg">Deutsche bank building</a></p>

<p>And here are buildings that suffered extreme office fires and did not turn into a pile of ruble:</p>
