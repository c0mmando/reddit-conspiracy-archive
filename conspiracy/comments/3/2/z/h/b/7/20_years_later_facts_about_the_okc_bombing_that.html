        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Twenty Years Later: Facts About the OKC Bombing That Go Unreported</strong></p>

<p>Next week will mark the 20th anniversary of the terrorist bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people including 19 children. The mainstream media will undoubtedly focus its attention on Timothy McVeigh, who was put to death in June 2001 for his part in the crime. They might also mention Terry Nichols, who was convicted of helping McVeigh plan the bombing and is serving a life sentence without parole.</p>

<p>There will be less discussion about how the FBI spent years hunting for a man who witnesses say accompanied McVeigh on the day of the bombing. They called this accomplice John Doe #2 and theories about his identity range from an Iraqi named Hussain Al-Hussaini, to a German national described below, to a neo-nazi bank robber named Richard Guthrie. The Justice Department finally gave up its search and said it was all a mistake— that there was never any credible evidence of a John Doe #2 being involved.</p>

<p>That reversal demonstrates a pattern of cover-up by authorities and limited media coverage in the years since the crime. This week, accounts will not repeat early reports of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_pPdGtutcY#t=13">secondary devices</a> in the building, or reports of the involvement of unknown middle-eastern characters. There will also be little if any mention of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Report-Bombing-Alfred-Murrah-Building/dp/0971051305">extensive independent investigation</a> into the crime that was conducted by leading members of the OKC community. Here are seven more facts that will probably not see much coverage on the 20th anniversary.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Attorney Jesse Trentadue began investigating the case after his brother Kenney was killed in prison, apparently having been tortured to death by the FBI in its search for John Doe #2. Trentadue’s investigation led to a federal judge nearly finding the FBI in contempt of court for tampering with a key witness. Trentadue now says, “There’s no doubt in my mind, and it’s proven beyond any doubt, that the FBI knew that the bombing was going to take place months before it happened, and they didn’t stop it.”</p></li>
<li><p>Judge Clark Waddoups, who presided over the case brought by Jesse Trentadue, ruled in 2010 that CIA documents associated with the case must be held secret. These documents show that the CIA was involved in the OKC bombing investigation and the prosecution of McVeigh. This means that foreign parties were involved because the CIA is prohibited from interfering in purely domestic investigations.</p></li>
<li><p>Andreas Strassmeir, a former German military officer, was suspected of being John Doe #2. Strassmeir became close friends with McVeigh and they were both associated with a neo-nazi organization located in Elohim City, OK. A retired U.S. intelligence official claimed that Strassmeir was “working for the German government and the FBI” while at Elohim City. Mainstream reports about the OKC bombing typically avoid reference to Strassmeir.</p></li>
<li><p>Larry Potts was the FBI supervisor who was responsible for the tragedies at Ruby Ridge in 1992, and Waco in 1993. Potts was then given responsibility for investigating the OKC bombing. Terry Nichols claimed that McVeigh—who allegedly had been recruited as an undercover intelligence asset while in the Army—had been working under the supervision of Potts.</p></li>
<li><p>Terry Yeakey, an officer of the OKC Police Department, was among the first to reach the scene and he was heralded as a hero for rescuing many victims. Yeakey was also an eyewitness to conversations and physical evidence that convinced him that there was a cover-up of the bombing by federal agents. Yeakey was committed to getting to the truth about what happened but a year after the bombing he was found dead off the side of a rural road. His death was ruled a suicide despite overwhelming evidence that he was murdered. Authorities reported that Yeakey, “slit his wrists and neck… then miraculously climbed over a barbed wire fence… walked over a mile’s distance, through a nearby field, and eventually shot himself in the side of the head at an unusual angle.” No weapon was found, no investigation was conducted, no fingerprints were taken, and no interviews were conducted. His family continues to fight for the truth about his death.</p></li>
<li><p>Gene Corley, the engineer who was hired by the government to support its claims about the structural fire at the Branch Davidian complex in Waco, was brought in to investigate the destruction of the Murrah Building. Corley brought along three other engineers: Charles Thornton, Mete Sozen, and Paul Mlakar. Their investigation was conducted from half a block away—where they could not observe any of the damage directly—yet their conclusions supported the pre-existing official account. A few years later, within 72 hours of the 9/11 attacks, these same four men were on site leading the investigations at the Word Trade Center and the Pentagon.</p></li>
<li><p>There are many other links between OKC and 9/11. For example, the alleged hijackers visited the OKC area many times and even stayed in the same motel that was frequented by McVeigh and Nichols. After both the OKC bombing and 9/11, building monitoring videos went missing, FBI harassment of witnesses was seen, and officials ignored evidence that did not support the political story. Additionally, numerous oddities link the OKC area to al Qaeda. In 2002, OKC resident Nick Berg was interrogated by the FBI for lending his laptop and internet password to alleged “20th hijacker” Zacarias Moussoui. Two years after this interrogation, Berg was became world famous as a victim of beheading in Iraq. Investigators looking for clues about these connections will be particularly interested in two airports in OKC, the president of the University of Oklahoma, and the CIA leader who both monitored the alleged hijackers in Germany and was hired at the university just before 9/11.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>On April 19, 2015, at the 20th anniversary of one of the worst terrorist attacks in history, citizens should be reminded that we don’t know what happened that day. We don’t know because officials have covered-up the crime for unknown reasons and most media sources will not challenge that cover-up.</p>

<p>Relevant Documentary: A Noblie Lie - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpNIMSDwvOw">The 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City was a direct blow to the heart of America. 168 people were killed, including nineteen children. For those watching the nightly news, terrorism had come home. For years following the bombing, countless victims&#39; family members, survivors, rescuers, and ordinary Americans, have questioned the official accounts about that fateful day. Hoping to shed light on answers long ignored and censored, both by prominent media outlets and the U.S. government, A Noble Lie peels back what we thought we knew about the bombing and it&#39;s perpetrators. This film exposes information never before examined or brought to the attention of the American public. A Noble Lie is the culmination of years of research and documentation conducted by independent journalists, scholars, and ordinary citizens. Often risking their personal safely and sanity, they have gathered evidence which threatens to expose the startling reality of what exactly occurred at 9 -02 am on April 19, 1995 in Oklahoma City.</a></p>

<p>Known as &quot;Andy The German&quot;....a seriously underlooked aspect of the Oklahoma City bombings.  People who use an &quot;official story&quot; who arent aware of Elohim City, Andy The German, or the female FBI agent working in conjunction, is a person who doesnt know most of the story.</p>

<p>When it comes to &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; and &quot;cover-ups&quot;, OKC has a lot of loose ends that are easily proven.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post. It&#39;s interesting how the shaky official Oklahoma narrative (like Waco) has managed to avoid the sort of scrutiny that the JFK shooting or 9/11 narratives have had. Any theories as to why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d argue it&#39;s the scale of the events. An American president gunned down in broad daylight and three iconic buildings (and WTC7) brought down in movie-like fashion vs. some federal building in one of the most boring states in the union and a kooky cult getting burned out of a building (talking popular narrative).</p>

<p>Two results. One, people are just naturally more interested in the former cases. They are larger anomalies with more obvious impacts on the world. Two, TPTB weren&#39;t able to contain the scene, delay coverage, or control the narrative as successfully. Sure you have planted witnesses at ground zero regurgitating the official story, but there&#39;s also tons and tons of video footage that looks suspiciously like a controlled demolition. </p>

<p>Even when they can control the evidence, just the presence of it leads to analysis. Many know/suspect (not looking to debate it here) now that the Zapruder film is doctored, but without it how much investigation into JFK could there have been initially? Is there even footage of the OKC bombing that wasn&#39;t shot on a potato? </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Stephen Jones, Mr. McVeigh&#39;s lead lawyer, began the defense case by calling Frederick Jordan, Oklahoma&#39;s medical examiner. He asked Dr. Jordan about a severed left leg found in the rubble of the Federal Building four days after it was imploded by dynamite because further rescues were deemed impossible.</p>

<p>DNA evidence and a print taken from the foot on that leg, Dr. Jordan testified, led investigators from his office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to a bombing victim who by then had been buried in New Orleans. That victim, whom Dr. Jordan did not identify in court, was Lakesha Levy, who was serving in the Air Force when she was killed, the severing of her left leg among her injuries.</p>

<p>Her body was exhumed, Dr. Jordan testified, and the leg now identified as hers was placed in her coffin. A left leg earlier, and wrongly, identified as hers was removed from the coffin and sent to the F.B.I. laboratory for re-identification.</p>

<p>But because that leg had been embalmed, Dr. Jordan said, investigators were unable to obtain a DNA sample, and further identification was impossible.</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;We have one left leg that we do not know where it belongs,&#39;&#39; Dr. Jordan told the jury.</p>

<p>He also said that although rescue workers had found eight left legs, only seven bodies had been missing their left legs.</p>
