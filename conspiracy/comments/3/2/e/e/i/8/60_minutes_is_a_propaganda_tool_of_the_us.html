       Almost everything you see on TV, period, is propaganda. If you think this is limited to a dozen or so news shows, you vastly underestimate the scope of the problem.

       Well that's the trap I was in for a while. Being a liberal guy (I voted for Obama the first time), I saw through the FoxNews lies -- because, you know, the conservatives were the Bad Guys. But I thought the liberals were the Good Guys, so I thought CNN, MSNBC, &amp; BBC were legit.

       Turns out, they're all propaganda, just from different angles. They're not even competing. They're working together to preserve the illusion of left vs. right.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it turns out, it's not just news that's propaganda; it's other TV shows -- sitcoms, sports, dramas...
      </p>
      <p>
       And it turns out, it's not just TV that's propaganda; it's movies, magazines, and music...
      </p>
      <p>
       And it turns out, education and religion are some of the worst, most controlling, propaganda of all. Our very history and foundations of spirituality and academia have been corrupted.

       The problem is people from my generation, the 50+ crowd, believe that 60 Minutes is hard-hitting, unbiased, deep digging, factual journalism.  They've grown up with this show as a watch-dog and whistle-blower.  Now they just assume that what 60 Mins airs is the blatant fact without questioning whether or not there might be an agenda, a skew of the datum and facts, or an ulterior motive.  This is why I think 60 Minutes is an incredibly dangerous show and am grateful that you pointed this out.

       If you were TPTB and trying to control the population, you're gonna want to start influencing children as soon as possible. So much of the human brain's operating system is formed before the age of 6. You'd be a fool to ignore the cartoon genre.

       Well I'm sure Disney/Cartoons have an influence on children, but when you link an image of hidden 666 in their logo it just makes your argument comical.

       Many, many major corporations have hidden 666s, Saturn/cube/pyramid imagery, or Masonic imagery in their logos. When you start looking, you see them everywhere. (I use it as an easy warning to avoid that company's products.)

       Disney is just one of them. Been in front of your eyes the whole time. Start digging deeper into Disney, and you may begin to understand.

       I think you're looking too deep to find hidden meanings and symbols. Sure, you're right on some of the logos/products, but not all.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think of this:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmEGtHTbh1E">

       ?
       <br/>
       She, like you, is trying to find hidden meaning in random graphic design.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everything is the work of satan, the jews, illuminati. In fact a lot of the pyramids you see are just that, just pyramids or triangles, it's a very basic shape and has been used for thousands of years. Doesn't mean it's illuminati controlled products.

       Look at the symbol for "6". Now look at the Monster Energy logo. The Monster Energy logo is a pretty obvious 666. (And Red Bull is Moloch, fwiw.)
      </p>
      <p>

       I've seen some of those for sure. I can't say I really understand the cube references. I know it's important, I see it everywhere, but I can't seem to suss out exactly what it means. Something about a supercomputer within Saturn that beams reality to us through the moon. Or something.

       PBS is owned as well.  The truth is not gonna come through the god-box.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was a kid in the '60s, there were over 80 news organizations in America.  At the advent of cable in 1980, that number had dwindled to 53.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, after years of buying congress to alter rules of media ownership, there are only six.  Six corporations own 95% or our tv, radio, newspaper, and magazines.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a meeting on Jekyll Island a hundred years ago, where fat bankers got together and said, "Fuck this competition between us.  We can all own the world if we work together!"  That begat the Federal Reserve, and continued the march toward world banking.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media ownership is monopolistic in the same manner.  We are told what the media owners want us to believe.  Bill O doesn't go out and get hot news stories, and neither does the talent at PBS.  They read what they are told to read off of a teleprompter.  Bill O gets paid almost $80,000 a day to read shit lies at us and convince us it's true.  I'm sure the top PBS "reading heads" get paid tens of thousands of dollars a day as well.

       David Gregory on Meet the Press, "to the extent that you have aided and abetted Snowden, even in his current movements, why shouldn't you Mr. Greenwald be charged with a crime?"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so called journalists like Gregory that are a big part of the the problem we have with getting correct (unbiased) information to the uninformed populace. He knows that they are protected under the Constitution yet still tries to paint Mr. Greenwold as a felon and possibly a "traitor" himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       David Gregory is the epitome of what high-ranking officials want journalists to be like. He is basically an arm of their PR apparatus. Absolutely nothing more than that. They get to come on the show, say their piece, and go the entire show without being asked anything substantive.

       Religion used to be the opiates for the masses, I believe sports is the modem day equivalent. Didn't emperor Caligula fund Olympics &amp; other gladiatorial events, while the empire around him fall apart? People were distracted &amp; content.

       I haven't watched any television for over a year (other then the odd movie I have on dvd). For some reason I fired it up a few days ago out of curiosity and it actually felt very intrusive. I couldn't last more then ten minutes. The constant commercials and fake patriotism (nascar) was too much to take. I'm really glad i made that decision to tune out a while back.

       David Gregory on Meet the Press, "to the extent that you have aided and abetted Snowden, even in his current movements, why shouldn't you Mr. Greenwald be charged with a crime?"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so called journalists like Gregory that are a big part of the the problem we have with getting correct (unbiased) information to the uninformed populace. He knows that they are protected under the Constitution yet still tries to paint Mr. Greenwold as a felon and possibly a "traitor" himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       David Gregory is the epitome of what high-ranking officials want journalists to be like. He is basically an arm of their PR apparatus. Absolutely nothing more than that. They get to come on the show, say their piece, and go the entire show without being asked anything substantive.

       Well I'm sure Disney/Cartoons have an influence on children, but when you link an image of hidden 666 in their logo it just makes your argument comical.
