<p>The question is what are <strong>YOU</strong> going to do about it. That is the only thing that matters. Recently I got death threats on both reddit and Facebook when I posted in a thread about TSA. Knew I would be cross posted into srd before the sun went down and wasn&#39;t suprised when it happened.</p>

<p>Warned the moderators of it as well of what I knew would happen and informed them of my resolve. Asked them to save someone a hassle by removing the thread. They didn&#39;t listen.</p>

<p>Admin only banned the accounts. Facebook did the same. Well that didn&#39;t set right with me. So I went forth and used the law for my aid. It hopefully worked maybe it didn&#39;t. The thing you should do is defend your own ideals and stick to principals. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t shills on reddit coming in here I am pretty sure it is fucking kids that just can&#39;t find entertainment outside of reddit. They want to stir you up. Let them if it is worth your time. Soon as they do be damn certain you report them. The hunting people down is something I will admit I did with this case. </p>

<p>It didn&#39;t seem worth my time to do anything after I saw what I had to lose. The person that we t me threats was a college student in Baltimore. Hopefully this will get the rest of their life fucked. Point is that you should all do something other then posting here.</p>

<p>Make a difference. After finding out who it was I realized that it was a hollow threat. Didn&#39;t know that from the beginning. Some very specific shit was said they would do. So I took it as genuine and returned the favor in kind. </p>

<p>Make a difference other then reddit. Do something that others will see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve failed to understand what I&#39;ve written. I&#39;ll break it down for you. Some people are just a waste of time and energy. We all have variant beliefs but we (conspiracy community) know shit is fucked. Don&#39;t waste your time on the useful idiots/paid shills. Do try to bring others in, if they don&#39;t want in, move on. Some people (like myself) have tried and they just don&#39;t want it (hence their complaints). So I work on myself and the others who &quot;get it&quot;. In the end, that&#39;s all you can do. Some people would still say AQ did 9/11 even if Bush went on Kimmel and said &quot;huhuhuhu <em>we</em> did 9/11&quot;. You&#39;re going to exhaust yourself worrying about the &quot;idiots&quot;. They are there to do that very thing. Divide, wedge, conquer, hopefully profit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get your sentiment, and I wasn&#39;t mocking you. I&#39;m just saying, you are playing into <em>their</em> game. Stop playing into it, they are there to exhaust you/piss you off/push you into a corner. One great example could be this. You break up in a relationship with a girl. What pisses her off more? You responding back with threats and retribution or you ignore that cheating bitch? Ignore them, don&#39;t feed the trolls. Do try to help others, but don&#39;t feed the idiots. Their brains will explode if people just ignore them and say &quot;meh, fuck em, lets unite.&quot;. They (TPTB) are using asymmetrical warfare on you, so you best do the same on <em>them</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Problem is that it wasnt a threat to me that pissed me off. It was to my son. That&#39;s where I lost it. Can&#39;t stand that shit. When you say shit to me on reddit its whatever.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t bring family into it. Funny thing is that some srd members defended it saying its whatever. Then some said its fucked up. It only took me 4 hours of sitting in a hotel to find out who this person was. </p>

<p>And an hour on the phone with their local police and then another hour explaining the situation to the cyber crimes division of the FBI. Rest will happen when I am not busy again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see where you are coming from. I&#39;m not a father, but if I was, I&#39;d do anything in my power to protect my children. But, half the shit said on the internet is just that, shit. Don&#39;t let idiots fool you or scare you. The chances of someone posting that online and doing it, are astronomical. I&#39;d be more worried about reporting it to the authorities than the dickhead who sent it. Because now, your activities could be monitored a little <strong>more closely</strong>. But then again I&#39;m a cynic and a conspiracy theorist. All in all, I get where you&#39;re coming from. But, there is an active campaign to divide, wedge and conquer.

    <div class="md"><p>I can see where you are coming from. I&#39;m not a father, but if I was, I&#39;d do anything in my power to protect my children. But, half the shit said on the internet is just that, shit. Don&#39;t let idiots fool you or scare you. The chances of someone posting that online and doing it, are astronomical. I&#39;d be more worried about reporting it to the authorities than the dickhead who sent it. Because now, your activities could be monitored a little <strong>more closely</strong>. But then again I&#39;m a cynic and a conspiracy theorist. All in all, I get where you&#39;re coming from. But, there is an active campaign to divide, wedge and conquer. Don&#39;t fall into the trap.</p>
