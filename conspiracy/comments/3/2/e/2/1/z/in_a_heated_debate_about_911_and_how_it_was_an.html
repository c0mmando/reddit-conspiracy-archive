        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Tonight I brought up to my father that I think 9/11 was an inside job. He completely disagrees and here are his points that I am having trouble arguing against. 1: With all the evidence I&#39;ve told him about, there must have been a lot of people in on it, why haven&#39;t any of them come forth with reputable proof? I&#39;ve even tried explaining to him about the Manhattan project and how 160,000 people worked on it and yet non came forth. 2: If it wasn&#39;t the actual planes we are led to believe hit the towers, that actually hit the towers, why couldn&#39;t radar confirm this? I didn&#39;t really have a response to this because I am uneducated in this aspect of the situation. 3: He says everything I have told him(I would list it but it would take me hours as we have been arguing a while) is just a bunch of undocumented speculation, to which I&#39;ve replied &quot;There is plenty of evidence&quot; and he just continued to call it un backed speculation. Please help me open my fathers eyes.</p>

<p>why haven&#39;t any of them come fort with reputable proof?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the DUMBEST argument of the anti-truthers.</p>

<p>First of all, there are HUNDREDS of people that &quot;came forward&quot; - witnesses to bombs going off, WTC workers talking about the power downs and the security bypasses, WTC engineers discussing the elevator upgrades, the molten steel. The 9/11 Commission itself was only formed because the &quot;Jersey Girls&quot; - four widows of Cantor Fitzgerald workers who died in the demolition - publicly pressured the Bush administration.</p>

<p>Richard Gage, Steven Jones, Neil Harritt, David Ray Griffin, Christopher Bollyn, thousands of AE911Truth members. Politicians, Howard Dean, that Republican businessman from Texas, Susan Lindauer, Sibel Edmonds, Scott Forbes - all have &quot;come forward&quot; - and they were met with threats, attacks, slurs, media campaigns against them.</p>

<p>In some cases people were paid off, other cases they were threatened - mostly, they were ignored.</p>

<p>Your father probably doesn&#39;t know about any of them, because he probably sits on his fat ass and watches the TV all day long.</p>

<p>What, did he think someone was going to &quot;come forward&quot; and they were going to put them on CNN or something?</p>

<p>Damn, your father is a dimwit, isn&#39;t he?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t get through to my parents because a couple of years ago I thought it would be a good idea to disclose to them that I used various substances and in a hope that they might realise that whenever they cast judgement towards people who use substances they cast judgement towards me. Didn&#39;t really work that well, now they just write everything I say off to drugs and can&#39;t even listen to me present an alternative perspective without getting upset.</p>

<p>I think they would have been ok if I&#39;d sat them down and talked the matter through more thoughtfully but I was rather insensitive with respect to how I told them and I think that&#39;s a lesson for me to be more gentle with them. </p>

<p>Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/celeb/Donald_Rumsfeld_Homeland_Security.htm">changed protocol</a> for intercepting hijacked planes so only <strong>he</strong> could issue them but he was conveniently <a href="http://www.newsfocus.org/images/rumsfeld_911_wrong_duty.jpg">busy</a>.</p>

<p>Some shill will come along and tell me Albert Stubblebine thinks he can walk through walls...</p>

<p>When i ask the shill where they got that information, they say they watched a movie where some actor played a general and that generals character was based on Albert Stubblebine...</p>

<p>Thats pretty impressive for a shill to put that all together... and its happened over and over... like they are reading off the same problem solving flow sheet...</p>

<p>And they never get around to addressing the fact that their &quot;source&quot; is fiction, or the fact that Stubblebine couldn&#39;t find a Boeing 757</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people actively participating in a conspiracy cannot come forward, they are too far in it, know that they or their families would be at risk, and move on.</p>

<p>The outliers that research and dig for information always end up dying of strange circumstances. Look at the body counts surrounding JFK&#39;s assassination, and the Clinton body count just to name a few.</p>

<p>As time goes by, you&#39;ll see more death bed confessions, since so much time has passed the risk is minimal but the guilt is high.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the one argument I get from most everyone who debates the topic with me.  It leaves me dumbfounded too.  Unfortunately the answer wouldn&#39;t help your case because that answer is further down the rabbit hole.  Look at the Clinton body count, people who are a threat to the official story either get killed, defamed, or silenced.  Then look at satanic rituals and related secret society activities.  There&#39;s a reason people keep these secrets.  Finally, I always say that people ARE coming forward with clues pointing to a conspiracy.  But people like your father won&#39;t even entertain such thoughts, so the clues become irrelevant. </p>

<p>Assertions that are not grounded in fact will discredit you.</p>

<p>For example, you can clearly demonstrate that the investigation was inadequate. You can make this case conclusively based on statements from members of the 911 commission.</p>

<p>For most people, realizing that the event was never properly investigated is the first step. They need to understand this before they are willing to entertain alternate narratives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason your father doesn&#39;t think someone has come forward is because his news network (CNN, Foxx, etc) hasn&#39;t told him that they have. Until they do, the hundreds who actually DID come forward and either made a Youtube video, spoke to interviewers or spoke to investigators will be considered just &quot;nuts&quot; because IF what they had to say had any weight, the MSM would say so.</p>

<p>I argued with a guy who would not listen to a PhD discuss 9-11 because it was only a YouTube video, not credible as &quot;real&quot; news.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first thing I would bring up is the pentagon.  Why haven&#39;t they released the video&#39;s from there after 13.5 years.  National security can not be the reason, they already hit the building.  The frames they released showed nothing.  Where is the footage from these cameras? <a href="http://imgur.com/loyyAZr">http://imgur.com/loyyAZr</a></p>

<p>The next thing that is hard to get around is the pod on the planes.  This was not a commercial aircraft.  Ask him what he believes the pod was.  <a href="http://imgur.com/w4JazEu">http://imgur.com/w4JazEu</a></p>

<p>The flash of light before the planes went in which can be seen on any footage of the plane impacts.  Ask what the flashes were.  They were clearly before the impact, and that is not normal behavior for planes to do that. <a href="http://imgur.com/DT2aifl">http://imgur.com/DT2aifl</a></p>

<p>Another thing to bring up is why none of the planes were intercepted.  David Ray Griffin has done excellent research into that issue.  The year leading up to 911 the FAA intercepted planes about once a week if the plane </p>

<p>A) Lost Radio Contact</p>

<p>B) Went wildly off course</p>

<p>C) If the transponders were turned off</p>

<p>If one of those things happened, they would be intercepted within 15 minutes of any one of those happening.   On 911 they hit the trifecta and all three occured, and the planes were in the air for up to an hour and a half.  </p>

<p>Norad changed their story 3 times.  Ask your dad if he was a cop, and a suspect changed his story 3 times, what he would think.</p>

<p>The fires did not get anywhere near the temp. to melt steel.  The buildings were designed to take multiple impacts from 707s, and were over engineered.  If they were going to fall from the impacts, they would have right away.  Underneeth the impact was undamaged.  How could the buildings fall at freefall speed it like they were going through air, opposed to the majority of the buildings.  There were numerous reports from firefighters  and witness reporting bombs going off.</p>

<p>Building 7.  Show him the clip, ask him what happened.  <a href="http://imgur.com/3J9tWP0">http://imgur.com/3J9tWP0</a> this is a building that toppled over.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/570JX7T">http://imgur.com/570JX7T</a> This is a building being blown up.  The difference is you can see the debris going upward and out ward.  In a gravity collapse, gravity only work pulling down, it doesnt shoot material up and outwards.</p>

<p>Going back to the pentagon, the damage before the collapse does not have any damaged windows where the planes tail went in.  Also an aluminum bodied plane is not going to penetrate 9 feet of steel reinforced concrete, with  punch out hole left in the inner wall of the 3rd ring.</p>

<p>The molten metal underneet all three buildings is hard to account for.  </p>

<p>7 of the &quot;hijackers&quot; have turned up alive in their home countries.</p>

<p>The evidence was destroyed and illegally removed from the crime scene.</p>

<p>There are many credintialed people that have spoke out on this issue, including FDNY members, A &amp; E for 911 truth, Scholars for 911 truth, Veterans for 911 truth,  Pilots for 911 truth.  David Ray Griffin has some excellant lectures on the subject all over you tube.</p>

<p>Here are some video clips <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww8hBFNY8jk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww8hBFNY8jk</a></p>

<p>This is Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives 1979 &quot;The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that President John F. Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, I wish I was as educated on all this as you are before the argument. The pentagon was one of my main arguments, with the cameras and the size of the hole, but he didn&#39;t budge, we kept going in circles. I would talk about different evidence and he would just go on to say&quot;how many people did it take to make this happen, why haven&#39;t they come forth&quot;. Pretty irritating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that is why when I get in a discussion, my goal is to convince them we need a new investagation.  I have been looking into this going back to 02-03.  Trying to disprove the theories I was hearing at the time.  </p>

<p>It looked bad, and the more I looked into it, the worse it looked.  </p>

<p>Even with all the time and research I have done on the issue, I still cant tell you what happened, who did it, or how they did it.  I can tell you what the government is telling us is the biggest load of crap since the warren commission report.</p>

<p>I would simply respond to the how many people did it question with I dont know.  I dont know how it happened, but what I can tell you is it DID happen, and that is why we need a real investagation that the oldest Firefighters magazine in the country doesn&#39;t call it a half baked farce.  Im curious myself as to how many people were involved.  </p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t familiar with Operation Northwoods, look that up too.</p>

<p>Ask your dad what he thinks about JFK.  Im guessing he will support the Warren commission.  That is an easy one to debate.  In 1979 the special House Committee on Assissinations came to the conclusion that JFK was probably killed in a conspiracy.  Put that in your back pocket when debating someone, when all else failes, that is kinda the trump card.  Seriously if you have the time, watch </p>

<p>JFK II  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we3vEvOhKR0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we3vEvOhKR0</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Qt6a-vaNM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Qt6a-vaNM</a> JFK to 911 Everything Is A Rich Man&#39;s Trick</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ApBK2coD-4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ApBK2coD-4</a> The Great Conspiracy The 9/11 News Special You Never Saw. </p>

<p>All three are must see if you haven&#39;t.  There is a lot to absorb in them, but these are some of the best documentarys I have seen as far as the info being solid, and presented well.  You will learn something from all of them.  The will help you with any future debates.  The JFK to 911 is a long one, but I believe that is what happened that day.  99.4%.  The reason its not 100% is that the guy is still alive and the movie was allowed to make it to you tube.</p>

<p>And I would recommend never using the &quot;no plane&quot; theory.  Its hard enough to sell the believer of the official theory on the fact we need a new investagation, the exotic theories like that just makes it a losing battle.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czk3iNZnhoU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czk3iNZnhoU</a> 911 In Plane Site - The truth Behind 9-11 this is another good one to give you some ammo  for any debate.  The narrating is kind of a dork, but he brings alot of visual hard evidence with this documentary.</p>
