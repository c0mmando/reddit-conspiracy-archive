    <div class="md"><p>I think you have to. That is why I hate the trend of people questioning a conspiracy on here and being called shills, if you don&#39;t question every part of the conspiracy then it wont stand up and won&#39;t be taken seriously as people often need to change a huge part of their minds to accept it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that all evidence must be vetted.  Im of the belief though that it is the official stories that should be getting the scrutiny of the &quot;conspiracy&quot;  </p>

<p>For example, re 911, there are so many glaring questions, all their own animal, that just because one doesn&#39;t check out, that means they&#39;re all invalidated.  Lets say throw out building 7.(I believe building 7 is hard for the official story to deal with but for the sake of arguement), that still leaves questions all over the place, at the pentagon, the air defense, the towers, the apparant pods on the planes <a href="http://imgur.com/w4JazEu">http://imgur.com/w4JazEu</a> this lady leaning up against the steel that tells you it was not hot, not was the steel around it. <a href="http://imgur.com/AMN4qAL">http://imgur.com/AMN4qAL</a> </p>

<p>The flashes before the planes went in <a href="http://imgur.com/DT2aifl">http://imgur.com/DT2aifl</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlTYET9pYa8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlTYET9pYa8</a>  </p>

<p>Why the pentagon tapes were never released.  That is just scratching the surface but you get the point.  </p>

<p>Only one have to be correct for the governments thoery to be incorrect.  Not the other way around like supporters of the official theory want you to believe.  The will take the issue of &quot;no planes&quot; on 9/11, say that they are obviously a crack pot, and that invalidates the whole movement for a new investagation.</p>

Trillions funneled to certain pockets that could have rebuilt our infrastructure, improved education, put a freakin&#39; base on the moon, etc. The way this country has changed since 9/11 is the most concerning thing to me. </p>

<p>Most conspiracy theorys dont involve &quot;magic&quot; such as the &quot;magic&quot; bullet theory in the case of JFK, or the &quot;magic&quot; fires or buildings of 9/11.  The &quot;official&quot; stories require a much bigger leap of faith to believe than the unofficial theories.  </p>

<p>The unofficial theories have physical evidence, laws of physics, and history in them.</p>

<p>The official theories have &quot;magic&quot; in them.  </p>

<p>Do you believe what David Copperfield does is real?  Do you hold what he does in the same light as reality?  Do the objects really dissappear?  Or is it an illusion to trick you?</p>

<p>A cursory look into any popular contemporary conspiracy theory shows that there is as much faith and dogma in the conspiracy world of alternative narratives as there is in the sleep walking world of mainstream media. Why bother doubting one side if you won&#39;t doubt the other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. But there is value in simply knowing the official story is false without yet knowing what is true. I can see how that might appear as holding the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; to a lower standard.</p>

<p>You can know 9/11 was an inside job without knowing whether nukes or cutting charges were used. (My guess is both.) And if you know 9/11 was an inside job, you can draw many, many conclusions just from that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s going too far to lump them together. At the very least they were different operations with different objectives. One event changed everything, the other event had a subtle effect on gun legislation and discussion.</p>

<p>Honestly, I don&#39;t remember any of the Sandy Hook coverage focusing on Christianity. Not to deny that there is a war on religion, religion in general seems to be a target, if for no other reason than it represents an alternative power structure that is in competition with the power structure established by the People In Charge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you absolutely have to: otherwise you&#39;re not a real truth-seeker, you&#39;re just after confirmation for your own preconceived beliefs. The problem I find most often, is an unwillingness among conspiracy proponents to put forward fully-formed alternative hypotheses for testing against the facts. They pick at (often trivial) flaws in the official narrative, yet refuse to come up with a testable alternative.</p>

<p>Sandy Hook is a great example. The official narrative - a mentally disturbed young man, with easy access to lethal weapons - may certainly not be perfect. But it&#39;s a damn sight more credible than vague theories that require hundreds if not thousands of &quot;crisis actors&quot;, to no meaningful purpose, i.e. given the complete lack of federal gun control legislation that followed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your link is not, by any conceivable stretch of the imagination, an alternative theory. It doesn&#39;t address whether there were real bombs or not, the role of the Tsaernev brothers or a million and one other aspects. It&#39;s just one of these:</p>

<p><a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop">http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop</a></p>

<p>Nonsense such as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Richard Serino left 15 minutes before the bombs went off. why was he there? why did he leave?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is not &quot;evidence&quot; of anything. </p>

<p>[Edit] 15 minutes before the bombs went off would make it close to four hours from the off. So, here&#39;s an idea: he left because <strong>the race had been completed for well over an hour</strong>. Or does everyone have to stand around until the very last runner crosses the finish-line, to avoid being a suspect? Boom. There&#39;s your simple explanation, way more plausible than Serino being some kind of evil mastermind. And, of course, if he was, then at the finish line in Boston is <em>the very last place he would want to be</em>. Real people do not actually behave like Bond villains. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>for me, it&#39;s all about the loose ends that don&#39;t add up. how can the BBC report the collapse of WTC7 20 minutes early if it wasn&#39;t pre-planned? WTC7 didn&#39;t fall, it was &quot;pulled&quot;. this therefore begs the question, when and how did the planning for this take place?</p>

<p>I wonder if the reason a lot of you folks can&#39;t talk about it is because deep down you know shit don&#39;t add up. this causes a disconnect that you find seriously difficult to address. when folk point out all the loose ends that don&#39;t add up, they&#39;re not having a dig at you all personally. they&#39;re trying to tell you that there&#39;s some serious gangster shit going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for checking out the survey, and I appreciate your concern. However, I feel that you have misinterpreted my intentions. The point of the survey isn&#39;t necessarily to label who is and is not a conspiracy theorist. Here&#39;s what I&#39;m looking for: Firstly, whether people will endorse a claim based on bias rather than thinking critically about the logical validity of the claim. Secondly, if conspiracy-theory &quot;content&quot; has a bias against it. Thirdly, if people who endorse conspiracy theories fall for logical fallacies more easily than people who don&#39;t care about conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>It is an ambitious project, and I&#39;m still in undergrad, so I know that the questions are not all worded perfectly. It would have been great to have a little more time to make the language in the survey more nuanced. However, I&#39;ve just given you the general hypotheses...I hope that sheds a little light and let me know if you are interested in seeing the results :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>O.K I took the test. I have to admit pretty much everything was a 1 to me. Although the wording on a few of the questions made me think the position held <em>was</em> competent in a pedantic way. Like I could see a lawyer arguing it. Or to quote Clinton: &quot;That depends on what your definition of the word is <em>is</em>.&quot;  </p>

<p>Also I worked in a highly competitive/cuthroat industry and office.  So answering the questions about &quot;people being out to get you&quot; made me lol at how paranoid it made me sound even though it was all totally accurate.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for checking it out! It was pretty much half and half between what was and was not logically valid. The tricks were intended to see if participants would answer based on bias, rather than thinking critically about the logical formula behind each claim. As far as the personality questions go, if that is your experience of the world then, hey, it is not necessarily paranoid. Is it paranoid if it&#39;s true?
