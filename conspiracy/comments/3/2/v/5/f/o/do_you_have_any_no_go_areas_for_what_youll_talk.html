       Are there any popular conspiracy theories that you simply won't touch? Whether its politics, religion, or just not wanting to look crazy?

      <p>
       Are there any ideas or questions or realizations that pop up in your head while reading about history that you think "woah maybe that's too far?"  If so, what are they? How do you deal with that dissonance?

      <p>

       I agree. Whatever people think chemtrails are... you have to understand that who ever you think is behind this would have to live in the same cities (all of them) that chemers think are being doused.

       I watch the International "Space" Station fly past fairly regularly at night. You can sign up to get emails from NASA to let you know when it's in your area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the thing, though. I use the scare quotes on "space", because the ISS is a mere 400km above us here on the Earth's surface. That is just
       <strong>
        0.1%
       </strong>
       of the distance from Earth to the Moon (384,400 km). Did you realise that?
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, apart from the heroic astronauts of NASA's Apollo programme, there are no claims of a human (not even a Russian!) having travelled more than about 0.3% of the distance to the moon. Kind of strange, no?

       Not at all actually, there isn't much of a reason to send manned missions beyond that, especially when considering the exceptional additional costs compared to unmanned missions.  What would you expect people to be able to achieve at those more distant orbits that would require humans to travel there?

       We determined that going beyond low Earth orbit was safe for humans by going to and returning from the moon, you just answered your own rhetorical question.  What I'm asking is, what would the need for repeating that experiment be when we've realized that at the moment, there's nothing there that's worth the expense of sending humans there?

       You said that the reason for sending humans out there would be to see if "going beyond low eart orbit is possible without causing harm to humans".  I stated that we already did this by sending people to the moon and having them return safely.

       99% of what is posted on this subreddit.  You guys call yourselves "free thinkers" and your opposition "sheeple," yet, for the most part  you generally don't look too deeply into the veracity of the claims that line up with your own points of view or preconceived notions.  And then, when pressed for proof or confirmation, it's often either anecdotal (not falsifiable) or "I read it in a study once, I know it's true, I can't be bothered to look it up right now" or "the truth is out there, go google it yourself."

       Though I will confess, a cursory glance of your history does suggest that those two instances generally seem to be the exception rather than the rule, as far as your postings go.  I also see a few instances of you coming to terms with exactly the kind of stuff that I mentioned in my previous post up there.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as suggesting that I stereotype races or religions, I generally try not to, however, some generalizations can be made.  For example, black people tend to have darker skin than my own, and practicing members of the Jewish faith tend to go to worship on Saturdays.  These are based on factual observations that I have made, and I will certainly stick by them.  If someone else has made other observations and can provide evidence that my own are incorrect, I would certainly take them under consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I'm not sure how that compares to my experience on this particular subreddit, where the vast majority of posters tend to refuse to provide credibility to their claims.  There are some that try, some that even succeed.  But, in my experience, they are very few and far between.
