    <div class="md"><p>I said the same thing, didn&#39;t see yours. They really are at the heart of the evil.  At the top they get to create money, that is the holy grail of greed but greed is never satisfied so they eternally seek more and more even with that power. The key here is that greed never stops escalating until it is stopped by outside forces.  It will never just decide it has enough now.</p>

<p>The banksters get to ultimately decide what happens by use of their decisions of who and what to fund. You and all of us here can see that they have no empathy for civilization.They only have endlessly escalating greed.</p>

<p>The Banksters and particularly the Bank for International Settlements, the central bank of the central banks, are the modern Illuminati.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is my thing. I don&#39;t like referring to these people with any title or word that sounds positive. </p>

<ul>
<li>elite</li>
<li>master</li>
<li>1% </li>
<li>Illuminati </li>
</ul>

<p>All of these are cool sounding terms that kind of sound positive. So if you wanna come up with a name it&#39;d have to be something that mocks them. IMO  You do know that Nazi is a slur invented by the people who hated them right? It was a shortening of the term national socialist and was how people in occupied berlin referred to them. It&#39;d be like calling someone a Libtard today. It&#39;s important to take the power away from these people in the ways that you describe them .</p>

<p>On the other hand you could assign them funny names that mock their sense of selk:</p>

<ul>
<li>masters of the universe (my friends and I used to call people in the local music scene back home this because as far as I can tell this is literally exactly what they thought they were) </li>
<li>End Boss - It shows that they&#39;re in charge but also what you think of them. </li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider this though.. maybe the Nazi name got the negative feel to it because of who the name was identifying. So if we inform people properly then that negative connotation will be there automatically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, this is well documented. Nazi is a slur similar to &quot;Jap&quot; or &quot;Crout&quot;. Except it was a slur aimed at a political party. </p>

<p>So yeah it got a negative vibe because of who it was identifying but i&#39;m saying it was always a slur thrown around by the west and Jews in Berlin. It is not a word that the National Socialists self identified with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like it because it makes it more well known for the public... it helps them identify with what we are talking about.. rather than just elites.I think that name is too generic. That is the issue I have with just saying illuminati.. illuminati could have many different agendas. I want to focus on the group with the agenda we are focusing on. Which to me seems to be the NWO. Or the group behind the NWO. Globalists may fit the bill but it sounds generic to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really think the jews hold that much power?  Or are they just a tool for the Big Evil to keep us divided and distracted.  If you were the 1% trying to dominate the other 99%,  direct warfare would be out of the question.  </p>

<p>How would you fight it?</p>

<p>I would make sure the 99% didn&#39;t even know they were in a war to begin with, and get them fighting each other instead of us, the 1%. </p>

<p>They win the wars as soon as they begin.  The people fighting them are the losers.  Even the &quot;winners&quot;.  They profit, we die and they are funding and arming both sides. So whatever side &quot;wins&quot; they are still in control.  </p>

<p>That is why I think the jews are but a puppet or tool to keep us from looking behind the curtain.  They are strong, but I don&#39;t give them that much credit.  </p>

<p>If they were really running things, do you think they would have to be so vocal, and fighting so hard to lobby our congress?  </p>

<p>Or would they just be sitting back in the shadows, like the real big evil does?  Not wanting to even give a glimpse to the 99% who the real enemy is.</p>

<p>No one ever said the Big Evil is stupid.  They are banking on the fact we are.  And have showed them no different except during the Bolshavic Revolution in 1917, it didn&#39;t last long, but the Big Evil got their nose bloodied.</p>

<p>They learned something from it.  We did not.  Maybe we need to revisit history to see how its done.</p>

<p>These are the battle lines imo, those with fuck everybody money, like Bill Gates and above, and the rest of the world.  No religion, ethnic or race lines.  The have&#39;s, and the have nots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look at all the control mechanisms in society, they are designed and run by Jews. A person could argue as to why this is so, but that it is so is observably demonstrative. Is some higher force, some larger intelligence, guiding the Jews in their control of our society? Who knows? What we know is that the Jews are controlling us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still think you might be giving them too much credit.  One can argue that our CIA is working with the mossad, but I think that is by necessaty if they do.  Our CIA roots are from the Nazi&#39;s if you look at the history, and the Nazi&#39;s and Jews were never that friendly.  The Jews do have quite a bit of influence in the MSM, and have been vocal in congress through the neo cons, but I think that is partially because the neo cons want to continue the goal of PNAC and Israel is a ralling point to do so.  You could be right,  I just think they are way to vocal to have the power you think they do.  I think the more power an entinty has, the quieter they are.  Look at the big banks, arms sellers and oil.  How often do you hear from them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider this though.. maybe the Nazi name got the negative feel to it because of who the name was identifying. So if we inform people properly then that negative connotation will be there automatically.</p>
