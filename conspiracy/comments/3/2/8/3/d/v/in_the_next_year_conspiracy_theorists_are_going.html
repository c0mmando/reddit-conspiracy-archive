    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t own any bitcoin but I have experimented with other &quot;alt&quot; currencies enough to get a grip on what they are and how they work. So forgive me for picking apart your comments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The technology behind it is heavily abstracted away from us especially non technical people. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can be said for pretty much any successful tech invention that has arisen since like the 1950&#39;s. Non-technical people inherently don&#39;t understand how any of the technology they use works, but they still use it and spend money on it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Moreover to make money, you need tons of money for the hardware and technical skills. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is as false about bitcoin as it is about regular currency. When you go to work you offer your time and skills in exchange for monetary reward. What you&#39;re referring to is the mining stage of crytocurrencies. In theory there will always be people with the hardware and technical skills who want to continue mining (that is how the network is supported, anyway), but the idea is that in every other way it functions like cash. You don&#39;t need fancy computer hardware to earn bitcoin just like you don&#39;t need fancy computer hardware to earn USD. If someone&#39;s willing to pay you bitcoin to dig holes, then you can earn bitcoin for digging holes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How will the masses accept that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the big question. But I don&#39;t think the other two points you raised have any bearing on whether cryptocurrencies are ultimately accepted or rejected by the masses. Really the only thing that matters is whether human beings are willing to accept something other than their government-approved currencies in exchange for their goods and services that they offer. </p>

<p>The big problem I see with cryptos right now is that everyone is treating them like investments. But the real value in a crypto is getting people to actually use it. Here&#39;s an analogy to help me explain how I think about the current state of cryptos: </p>

<p>Consider The New World, when it was &quot;discovered&quot; by Europeans. There was a lot of claiming and dividing up of the land, but what made the land actually valuable was its resources, and that value could only be derived from working the land. Imagine if European leaders had discovered the Americas and simply divided it up among themselves and didn&#39;t do anything with it because they were certain it would be worth more in a few generations. Basically, if they saw land in the Americas the same way that investors see stocks. If that had happened, and you just had a bunch of land that was equally divided up among a number of rich people, with nobody actually using the land, it <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> gain value. Because the only people with the resources to get it already have it. Land in the Americas became valuable when the rich people who laid claim to it started giving it to people in order for them to use. </p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies don&#39;t work when everyone just hoards it in the same way that regular currencies wouldn&#39;t work if everyone just kept it in shoeboxes under their beds and never used it to buy stuff.</p>

<p>A similar thing happened with, for instance, Dogecoin. It was the hot new crypto for a while and a lot of big miners pointed their rigs at Dogecoin and quickly gobbled most of them up. Those whales aren&#39;t using their coins, because they think they&#39;ll be worth more in the future. But, by hoarding those coins they&#39;re preventing them from truly growing in value. Instead, if they used them (like when that guy offered to give somebody 10,000 bitcoins for a pizza), the coins would start to grow in value as laypeople developed a desire for them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your points are all valid especially the last one where people as of now are using bitcoin as an investment (for the most part AFAIK). My cynicism mainly stems from the mainstream acceptance of bitcoin as a form of currency.</p>
