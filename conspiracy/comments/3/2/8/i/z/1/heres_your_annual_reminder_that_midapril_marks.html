        I posted this reminder last year
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1ca0uf/the_dates_april_19th_to_may_1st_are_said_to_have/">
        2 years ago I posted the same warning
       </a>
       and 2 days later the Boston Bombing happened. Sacrifice by "fire."
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/si1x2/the_elites_ritual_days_of_april_19th_and_april/">
        3 years ago
       </a>
       I mentioned the importance of the days of April 19/20 in particular.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/h3hzx/a_triple_ritual_just_took_place_on_the_occult/">
        And 4 years ago
       </a>
       I made a similar observation in
       <a href="/r/occult">
        /r/occult
       </a>
       about the timing of Bin Laden's "death" and the ritual day of May 1st.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for the 5th year in a row, I just wanted to remind folks to be wary of this time of year, and be skeptical of any "fiery" events that may occur, especially within the next week or so.

       A Texas sharp shooter fallacy? This strikes me as entirely ridiculous. The occult has nothing to do with anything. You can pick any month and you'll find something to support your general assertion.

       Does Hitler's birthday (and subsequent suicide) have something to do with him being selected to enact the Holocaust (etymology meaning "sacrifice by fire, burnt offering" or "burned whole" )? Or maybe he wasn't selected by occult religious dogmatics. Maybe it does have some supernatural significance. Kind of a chicken and egg conundrum.

       So leaving aside that that hit April 25, I'm curious: are you arguing that this large scale conspiracy engaging in false flags attacks is a) both able to do so outside the US and b) able to fake a large-scale earthquake? How exactly do you do the second?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is unfortunate that you didn't actually answer the question until a a month after I asked the question. Too bad. That strongly suggests that you weren't nearly as confident about this as you'd like to act like you are.

       The period of sacrifice is traditionally April 19-May 1, see my posts from previous years.

       Nothing is "faked." The theory (which I'm
       <em>
        investigating
       </em>
       ...I don't
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       it) is that certain off-the-books technologies are able to target weaknesses in fault lines and trigger a "traditional" earthquake.
      </p>
      <p>
       The energy required is fractions of the energy released by the quake. Using mother nature in this way provides the perfect means to plausibly deny involvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much research has been done into how the major earthquakes of the last 20-30 years have been possibly artificially induced. A simple internet search will yield countless results.

      <p>
       I'm not confident about this at all. This is off-the-wall speculation and nothing more.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been only a couple of weeks since the earthquake, and I've read a few articles and watched a few videos that suggest this was a strategic move, for whatever reason.

       You'll forgive me if I'm not inclined to go through hundreds of olds posts at your say so. To be blunt this entire thing screams "overactive pattern recognition!" and "confirmation bias!" Do you have any evidence that these events are actually more likely in that time span? Note for example that the Japanese earthquake didn't occur in that time period, nor did say September 11 (as the name of course implies).

       I see. And they want to use this to kill large number of civilians rather than use it as an ace-in-the-hole why? Who for that matter has an incentive to use this on Nepal?

       What you mean is many people on the internet have engaged in baseless speculation about this, and you've now decided
       <em>
        after the fact

       that this is also part of your hypothesis. None of your prior listed events were earthquakes. This is the worst sort of post-hoc modification of a hypothesis possible.

       Is this a strategic move or a ritual sacrifice? Which one is it? Moreover, a strategic move

       Some people also believe that the Earth is flat, and some believe that Jews did 9/11, etc. etc. The sheer act of someone believing something is not useful evidence of anything whatsoever. Who would this third world war be between? What are they fighting over? How would an earthquake in Nepal be to one side's best interest? How could it be that it is in the interest of both sides to keep it quiet that no one knows about it?

       I've heard that its possible the rituals are shifting to water to coincide with the new age. Last year was the Korean boat, this year the migrants.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ritual corresponds to the attack they are planning, or conditions they wish to bring about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something to consider.
