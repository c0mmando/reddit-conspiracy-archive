That community of course being, r/conspiracy. </p>

<p>I understand that if we, you the reader, were to pass on a sidewalk, we probably wouldn&#39;t realize that we belonged to the same community of free thought , philosophy and understanding. </p>

<p>But with that being said, I kind of like that about this place. </p>

<p>The ambiguity of the users. </p>

<p>We all come from so many different backgrounds, and different understandings of how we see these conspiracies being played out, but yet we are still United for this common cause. </p>

<p>This is something we can never forget. </p>

<p>The drama here in reddit as a whole, and as a reflection this sub, in my opinion, is irrelevant. </p>

<p>Sure, we get harassed and laughed out by other users of reddit, but fuck them.
 I cannot think of a reason in which I should care about that. </p>

<p>What I can think about, though, is the amount of love that I feel for you, a fellow human being, going through the same experiences that I myself am going though. </p>

<p>With that understanding I accept you for who and what you are. </p>

<p>Please, never forget the struggle in which we fight for.
 A war involved in minds of individuals, United and separate, everywhere. </p>

<p>Truly, we are all in this together. 
Never forget. I love you. Thank you for your time and consideration. </p>

<p>With that being said I too have tried to find other sites like this that we could collectively transport to, but I haven&#39;t found one that most people who agree on. </p>

<p>Personally I think we should create a TOR,. onion website  in which the users of this sub could go to express ideas and concerns. </p>

<p>As someone who doesn&#39;t contribute to the theory, or factual evidence to the conspiracy I felt as if this was the least I could do, although it isn&#39;t much. </p>

<p>It was to understand what we&#39;re doing here, see the people doing it and offer unending support, unconditional appreciation and gratitude towards all who contribute here, great or small. </p>

<p>It means so much to me to have a place like this because I don&#39;t have anyone in real life would you even entertain the ideas we speak about here. 
It&#39;s just.. Really great to be apart of something larger than yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pick a topic and focus your research on it. I began by just reading and archiving relevant articles, while pointing out important parts for the user base to read. I wanted to lead people into the direction that my research is heading. Do not hesitate to post your own ideas. You might offer others a new insight into their own research.</p>

<p>I try to look into the geopolitics of the Western Hemisphere. In specific, the way the cartel wars in Mexico are influencing geopolitics. 
Cartels are expanding their business beyond drugs and human trafficking. They are tapping into oil pipeples, destroying them and even mining iron ore illegally. These products are then sold in the black market to foreign buyers. Some companies in Mexico have gone as far as using cartels/gangs as security for their job sites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your first paragraph monumentally. 
I focus on the occult aspects of the conspiracy theories. Mainly, the end game of the powers that be. </p>

<p>The occult connection within tptb isn&#39;t much of a widely discussed topic, so I tend to be over critical when posting my own conclusions about subjects. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not stupid and no one on here is either. 
We&#39;re onto something, because if we weren&#39;t we wouldn&#39;t have so many people attempting to discredit and derail our conclusions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truely spoken, the counterbalance of TPTB that are we.
I see more people questioning certain events. But your message gave off a strong vibe. I know life is not all about roses and a lovely moonlight serenade. But sometimes, i really can like the message you sent out. Positive vibes are the ones that gives power to your mood and mindset.</p>

<p>Much regards,</p>

<p>These strong vibes you feel will be needed to endure the long road to sovereignty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you so much for your sincerity in putting this out there. It has been disconcerting to watch all the discord going on in the last week or so. It&#39;s been very worrisome because I truly would feel a loss if this community were to break up or dissolve. And people may give me the advice to get out more or whatever--I am still going to say this, because I&#39;m happy with my life and yes some of that in the last year has included following the activities in this sub and having my mind opened in countless ways. That&#39;s the amazing thing, knowing that anyone you meet could be behind some of these posts. Anyway, it&#39;s just nice to see someone focus on the positive. I&#39;m grateful to you and to everyone else here who promotes truth and learning, love and light. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No offense taken, my friend. </p>

<p>I appreciate that you appreciate the sentiment. 
Truly, that was the point of this post. It was appreciation. </p>

<p>I wanted to express my gratitude towards the community that has had such a helping hand in my being. 
This humble, often neglected place on the Internet has helped me understand the world for what it truly is, and not what it appears to be. It has helped me understand my self, through the knowledge I have gained here, and ultimately my role in this world. </p>

<p>This is something I can never forget, for I will never cease to be who I am as  individual and thus I felt as if expressing my appreciation and gratitude, love and understanding to this sub was something I felt necessary to do. </p>

<p>I really do think that we as a community are making a difference. I really do believe in what we are doing here. 
I really do believe that humanity is being conspired upon by a small, secretive group. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what we stand for. 
Shedding light on these dark places, guiding others into a quest of knowledge and truth. </p>

<p>In a sense, this sub is liberating. </p>

<p>And for that, I thank it, along with everyone apart of it. I thank it as well as I thank you. </p>

<p>So yes, I do understand where you are coming from, and I do agree that this is counter productive, but even so, I still want everyone to know that I appreciate them and what they do. </p>
