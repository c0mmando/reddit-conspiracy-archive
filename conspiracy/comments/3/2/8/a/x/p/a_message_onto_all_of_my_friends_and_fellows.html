       Nothing  conspiracy related, but I wanted to express the exuberant amount of love and joy that I feel from thinking about this community that I have invested so much time into. 
That community of course being, r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that if we, you the reader, were to pass on a sidewalk, we probably wouldn't realize that we belonged to the same community of free thought , philosophy and understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       But with that being said, I kind of like that about this place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ambiguity of the users.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all come from so many different backgrounds, and different understandings of how we see these conspiracies being played out, but yet we are still United for this common cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is something we can never forget.
      </p>
      <p>
       The drama here in reddit as a whole, and as a reflection this sub, in my opinion, is irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, we get harassed and laughed out by other users of reddit, but fuck them.
 I cannot think of a reason in which I should care about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I can think about, though, is the amount of love that I feel for you, a fellow human being, going through the same experiences that I myself am going though.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that understanding I accept you for who and what you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, never forget the struggle in which we fight for.
 A war involved in minds of individuals, United and separate, everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truly, we are all in this together. 
Never forget. I love you. Thank you for your time and consideration.

       You make a very valid point, user lolurwack.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that being said I too have tried to find other sites like this that we could collectively transport to, but I haven't found one that most people who agree on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I think we should create a TOR,. onion website  in which the users of this sub could go to express ideas and concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of something were to happen and this sub be jeopardized, it would be in the best interest, in my opinion, for people to migrate and continue the work on another platform.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're absolutely right, through. Reddit is shit. It's the people on this  sub I love.

       Thank you, user duckieducks.

       I am very glad that I this has affected you in a positive way. 
This was my intent.

       I know that things are tough for everyone, so wanted to send a reminder out that things aren't so bad.
      </p>

       I'm currently unemployed, and I sleep on the floor of my mother's house, but yet, love and gratitude are things that I think are worth considering. It's something that everyone here needs to be reminded of, even if they don't see it themselves, it's still here.

       Thank you very much, user obnoxious_commenter.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone who doesn't contribute to the theory, or factual evidence to the conspiracy I felt as if this was the least I could do, although it isn't much.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was to understand what we're doing here, see the people doing it and offer unending support, unconditional appreciation and gratitude towards all who contribute here, great or small.
      </p>
      <p>
       It means so much to me to have a place like this because I don't have anyone in real life would you even entertain the ideas we speak about here. 
It's just.. Really great to be apart of something larger than yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, thank you for your hospitality.

       Pick a topic and focus your research on it. I began by just reading and archiving relevant articles, while pointing out important parts for the user base to read. I wanted to lead people into the direction that my research is heading. Do not hesitate to post your own ideas. You might offer others a new insight into their own research.

       I try to look into the geopolitics of the Western Hemisphere. In specific, the way the cartel wars in Mexico are influencing geopolitics. 
Cartels are expanding their business beyond drugs and human trafficking. They are tapping into oil pipeples, destroying them and even mining iron ore illegally. These products are then sold in the black market to foreign buyers. Some companies in Mexico have gone as far as using cartels/gangs as security for their job sites.

       I agree with your first paragraph monumentally. 
I focus on the occult aspects of the conspiracy theories. Mainly, the end game of the powers that be.
      </p>
      <p>
       The occult connection within tptb isn't much of a widely discussed topic, so I tend to be over critical when posting my own conclusions about subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not stupid and no one on here is either. 
We're onto something, because if we weren't we wouldn't have so many people attempting to discredit and derail our conclusions.

      <p>
       Every individual member here has something unique to offer to the community, and if we all  really work hard, together,  as a team and community, we can crack whatever is thrown at us.

       Thank you so much for your sincerity in putting this out there. It has been disconcerting to watch all the discord going on in the last week or so. It's been very worrisome because I truly would feel a loss if this community were to break up or dissolve. And people may give me the advice to get out more or whatever--I am still going to say this, because I'm happy with my life and yes some of that in the last year has included following the activities in this sub and having my mind opened in countless ways. That's the amazing thing, knowing that anyone you meet could be behind some of these posts. Anyway, it's just nice to see someone focus on the positive. I'm grateful to you and to everyone else here who promotes truth and learning, love and light.

       Thank you for this uplifting post, u/LordMandrake. I think many of us share your sentiments; this sub has been a godsend for me, personally.

       Lord mandrake, I sense you're level my friend and through this here medium, extend a toast and a hug and an embrace of the eyes to you, and a fuck all this mess and joke of a "reality" we're in. Ahahaha... Soon the mass conscious will allow for more roses to blossom, and fuck nothing, we Love. It. All.

       I appreciate your sentiment, but this is a circlejerk submission in a lot of ways. I don't see the need to pat each other on the back when we should focus more on our flaws as that would be infinitely more constructive; in a lot of ways a submission like this, while nice, is counter-constructive.

       No offense taken, my friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate that you appreciate the sentiment. 
Truly, that was the point of this post. It was appreciation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted to express my gratitude towards the community that has had such a helping hand in my being. 
This humble, often neglected place on the Internet has helped me understand the world for what it truly is, and not what it appears to be. It has helped me understand my self, through the knowledge I have gained here, and ultimately my role in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is something I can never forget, for I will never cease to be who I am as  individual and thus I felt as if expressing my appreciation and gratitude, love and understanding to this sub was something I felt necessary to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really do think that we as a community are making a difference. I really do believe in what we are doing here. 
I really do believe that humanity is being conspired upon by a small, secretive group.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what we stand for. 
Shedding light on these dark places, guiding others into a quest of knowledge and truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a sense, this sub is liberating.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for that, I thank it, along with everyone apart of it. I thank it as well as I thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, I do understand where you are coming from, and I do agree that this is counter productive, but even so, I still want everyone to know that I appreciate them and what they do.

       The community is divided and infected, and the quality of the subreddit is lower than I have ever seen.  What an absolutely banal, self-congratulatory post, Mandrake.

       I was joking. I do enjoy this space myself from time to time. Apparently some other denizens here need to get out more than the both of us. In all seriousness tough one shouldn't get too caught up in this place or any other electronic-landscape. Life is fleeting, don't let it pass you by.
