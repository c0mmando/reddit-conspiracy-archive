        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I look and I see all these posts about Monsanto and how they could pigeon hold the worlds crops if they wanted to and there was nothing the average person could do about it. Acting like everyone is doomed to starve to death because of arbitrary things like patented seeds.</p>

<p>Then on the other hand you have these posts about groups of people and secret organizations like some new world order that are all above the law and they&#39;re controlling the world above all the governments or whatever.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t understand why people are arguing about how helpless the masses are and how there are these little tiny groups of people that can operate above the law at the same time. How some corporation like Monsanto could control the world because nobody can copy their seeds because for whatever arbitrary reason people would just sit around and let tons of people starve to death when they could just take Monsanto&#39;s patents and literally just copy them. The fact that patents of these methods exist means that if you really really needed to you could just take them, and use them, because who is Monsanto going to go to when the body that governs patents lets people use their for the greater good.</p>

<p>Law isn&#39;t some immovable object that could let a company destroy the world. It&#39;s a amalgamation of fluid regulations that attempt to regulate actions in favor of the greater good. Too many people forget what democracy really means and that unlike in movies and books the masses won&#39;t stay oppressed forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve spent many many nights going over scenarios like this in my head but I don&#39;t have a way to argue against it in a timely matter. So I&#39;ll try to keep to key points rather than trying to make an airtight case.</p>

<p>These sociopaths think they&#39;re playing the game of life with all it&#39;s complicated systems and workings but they have to play by the rules or they&#39;ll be penalized, and sure they can grease somebodies palms a little to get laws past and what not.</p>

<p>But if the public decides that enough is enough they would overthrow the Government. In 1917 Russia&#39;s Governing body was overthrown twice in one year from what little I&#39;ve heard of it because the citizens weren&#39;t supportive of the actions of the Government. So I find it difficult to find a scenario in which a Government which is a system built and worked by the people for the people could possibly get into a situation where it could keep itself from being replaced. I think society as a whole would break down and humans would backstep in civility until they reached a position in which they could be free again, free to have a piece of land and farm it for food. People only formed society because it benefited a majority of them. </p>

<p>I just can&#39;t picture a scenario in which humans wouldn&#39;t do whatever they could in free themselves from a governing body if it was no longer benefiting the majority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then wouldn&#39;t those rich people be doing all their work just to be paying for poor people to live. Why would they bother taking their money in the first place if they were just going to give it back that seems redundant. And beside you can still grow normal seeds, nobody is forcing you to use theirs, you can still do it the old fashioned way. The way nature intended.</p>

<p>And no Military is going to gun down it&#39;s friends and neighbors because they don&#39;t want to be dirt poor anymore.</p>

<p>No I&#39;m not talking about Americans, Americans are usually last to notice a problem as usual, I&#39;m talking about other countries like India where there is some real harsh ass poverty.</p>

<p>The main crux of the problem here is less about Monsanto itself and more about a hoarding of power. The thing about having power is that people always want at least what they have or more. So it can&#39;t go both ways. And history shows that it&#39;s always much harder for few people to hold the power when the masses get fed up and decide to take it back. And that is assuming that an entity like Monsanto wouldn&#39;t have internal conflict down the line or that they don&#39;t already have it now. Power entities like that will either tear themselves apart or they&#39;ll get beat out by the very people they were parasites to.</p>

<p>The universe favors entropy so no matter how tight a stranglehold you think you have on something there is always something out of your control waiting to take it away. </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t people trying to Hunger Games the world should be anywhere near the top of the priorities list.</p>

<p>Poisoning the atmosphere, banking on the fact that we&#39;ll probably get the technology to fix it before we all suffocate to death could just end all human life. Though maybe that would be better than inevitable slavery anyway. Because in theory you could come about a way to enslave everyone but we&#39;re not quite there yet, and it sure won&#39;t be food constraints that put the nail in that coffin. It&#39;ll be some prick making a legion of robots that turns against humanity.</p>

<p>Edit: Realized I started getting real off topic there at the end. Anyway main point being humans are going to wipe themselves out eventually once there exist ways to control the population more absolutely but since we know so little about the human psyche as it is, I&#39;d say were safe on that front for a while to come.</p>

<p>Either way humans are going to wipe themselves out eventually either by advancing technology too much, or not advancing it enough. And it ultimately doesn&#39;t matter, because we&#39;ll probably be long dead before either of those happen. There is a little room in there for advanced technology and compassion to squeeze in mutually, but still that could only get us near to the inevitable heat death of the universe anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They buy local seed companies and control the flow of local seeds. In India farmers have very little option but to buy bt-cotton from Monsanto. If you prepare the soil for Monsanto seeds, they will stop supporting indegenious varieties (due to infestation of Monsanto fertilizer and pesticide, and ecological imbalance). Its not as easy as you suggest. The economics are in their favour. People are easily swayed by money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then if most people are unhappy with the current spread of wealth. Why aren&#39;t they doing anything about it. Maybe they&#39;re too busy laying in bed watching The Walking Dead and The Big Bang Theory to care that somebody is just pointlessly sitting on millions of dollars and not spending it. But when people become so inconvenienced by the upper class that they have no choice but notice it, then they&#39;ll start to take action against it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Citizens have overthrown their Governments numerous times throughout history. Russia&#39;s governing body was replaced twice in 1917 because the people didn&#39;t want to be in World War 1 anymore.</p>

<p>What would be the point of a Governing body if the public as a whole had to defend itself against it. The purpose of a Government is to benefit the people so if it no longer serves that purpose then it needs to be changed. They are changing all the time Governments are passing new laws all the time, but if a governing body becomes too controlling then it starts to become a communist country rather than a democratic one.</p>

<p>History has made it very clear that people won&#39;t put up with communism forever, when the majority of the people either yearn for freedom or no longer support the direction of the country as a whole lead by the governing body they will change it and if they cannot change it, in the case of most communist countries, they&#39;ll overthrow it entirely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel your scope is tunnel visioned. Youre speaking as if things work in an idealistic way:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact that patents of these methods exist means that if you really really needed to you could just take them, and use them, because who is Monsanto going to go to when the body that governs patents lets people use their for the greater good.</p>

<p>That would be the enforcement arm of the octopus. Infringe on a patent? Here comes the enforcers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Law isn&#39;t some immovable object that could let a company destroy the world. It&#39;s a amalgamation of fluid regulations that attempt to regulate actions in favor of the greater good</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, in an idealistic world, this should remain valid. But alas, the american government is more plutocratic than what it seems. The laws and regulations serve those who benefit the most, and that is nearly always those who invest the most in those laws and regulations. Not the People.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&#39;t understand why people are arguing about how helpless the masses are and how there are these little tiny groups of people that can operate above the law at the same time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Youve heard of the 1%, right? Well, just in america, we have a population of over 300 million. 1% of 300 million is 3 million. Its &quot;small&quot; in comparison, but really, its still a lot of folks. Even if the real percentage is much smaller than a meager 1%, how many people, total, do you think it takes to collaborate all the necessary agencies and departments and corporations to work in collusion to benefit those who are colluding? Even if it means breaking the laws, if those who judge the laws, and those who enforce the laws, amd those who prosecute the law breakers, and those who <em>write</em> the laws, if all of them work together, which i believe they are, then what power do the People have against them? </p>

<p>The sad fact is that our representatives no longer represent US. They represent their own interests. This includes satiating the needs of their funders and those who helped them gain power and authority via nepotistic means. </p>

<p>Monsantos patents are protected because they are working alongside the FDA and the U.S. patent office, and many more branches of government. Monsanto is &quot;protected&quot; from everything but the most petty litigations. </p>

<p>This is by design, and is something that must be understood before dismissing those claims that have you asking questions.</p>

<p>For the record, i dont think Monsanto will ever &quot;pull the plug&quot; on the worlds food supply. But they sure as fuck aint usurping all influence over it for the benefit of &quot;All&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those points are only valid assuming that current social structure was upheld. If the poor in mass start to plunder from the rich and murder and steal for the sake of balanced wealth and the rich could do very little to stop it. Anybody below a certain level of wealth would be on the side against the very few people of higher wealth then that. With such a numerical imbalance it seems only plausible that the rich could only go into hiding.</p>

<p>The small percentage of the population that isn&#39;t rich but would fight on behalf of the rich wouldn&#39;t be able to stop the poor and reckless from doing what they wanted. If you have a million people farming their lands with Monsanto goods that they just stole, copied, or forced Monsanto employees to make, what conceivable way would a thousand people stop them from doing it?</p>

<p>Since the one percent is just one percent that&#39;s about a 99:1 ratio, or about 6.2 billion to 63 million. What chance would they stand? There is no way for the bourgeoisie to control the proletariat by force, they only have economic superiority, if the proletariat gets fed up and decides to remove the bourgeoisie in favor of sharing materials equally, the bourgeoisie doesn&#39;t have a choice if that happens and when the bourgeoisie goes too far in exploiting the proletariat, like they&#39;ve begun to do, those living in poverty won&#39;t take it anymore.</p>

<p>The only reason the bourgeois industriousness has been the way it has so far is because it&#39;s been mutually beneficial. Poor people are living in much better conditions than they ever have. The bourgeois need the proletariat to make them the things that they want to buy with their money so if they become unhappy then what is the bourgeoisie&#39;s wealth worth? Absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>Overall, i agree with what youre saying. So, forgive me for picking apart your comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no way for the bourgeoisie to control the proletariat by force, they only have economic superiority</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I must mention that woth such a vast economic superiority, they also have acquired a vast technological superiority. Amongst this technology is, of course, weapons and armament. Furthermore, with such vast economic superiority, they can buy out many of the more influential proletariats. Especislly in todays world; i may be taking a pessimistic view on the world, but i doubt there is much neighborly love as there used to be.</p>

<p>Lastly, woth such economic superiority, they also have obtained much research and have acquired much knowledge on very pertinent aspects of War. The 99% simply do not have this advantage (with the exception of a small fraction).</p>

<p>All these considered, the rich have every upper hand, except brute strength of flesh. Of course, 99 people will always be able to handle a lonely individual. But, if that one person had guns, rpgs, bombs, etc., theres no real match.</p>

<p>If you have a million people farming their lands with Monsanto goods that they just stole, copied, or forced Monsanto employees to make, what conceivable way would a thousand people stop them from doing it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One farm at a time. One by one, make an extreme example. They would use said advantages from above.</p>

<p>As for your last paragraph, thats usually how i see it, too. This is why i tend to not subscribe to depopulation theories much. I mean, taking out hundreds, maybe even thousands of citizens might be plausible, but not all of them. A tyrant needs his labor force, as you said. A slave driver is just a man holding a whip if there are no backs to which he can rip..</p>

<p>To play devils advocate, what if it was only intended to be the <em>initial</em> spark to light the tinder? I mean, starve the people at first, knowing they will rise up. Then initiate phase two of depopulation (WW3?). </p>

<p>A spark from a flint tool does burn as bright. But its good enough to ignite a pile of magnesium flakes, which in turn burn much much hotter.</p>
