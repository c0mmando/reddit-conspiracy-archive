       Jury selection eventually started on January 20, 2015 after a request by Holmes' lawyers for yet another continuance was denied.[95] The start date for his trial has been scheduled for April 27.

       it took 2 years to convict the boston bomber and more then 3 to even start the trial of the batman shooter. wtf

       A "shill" lawyer who has avoided the death penalty for other high profile criminals. Basically, a woman good at doing her job.  Holmes has a more complicated case, the guy clearly has mental issues which his lawyer is mounting their defense around.  If you look at u/burningempires post, he answers the reason for the delays which are the complications of a state death penalty case and his mental evaluations.

       "Judy Clarke is suspicious as all hell" because you want her to be since it fits your narrative which is more or less defined by 4 pictures that r/conspiracy tries to use as evidence for their case.  We have pretty convincing evidence of him showing up with his brother, then by himself setting something down, followed by an explosion just after he takes off.  And that's all we have, I'm sure the government has emails, text messages, phone calls, purchases, etc. to easily link the two as well.  As opposed to the guy in a backpack theory who supposedly is the real perpetrator despite the fact that the picture r/conspiracy tries to pass off is taken after the explosion.  Or the fake bomb theory and actors playing along theory which is another crazy yet somehow popular idea on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing like winning the judges favor who ultimately will decide Tsarnaev's fate by making a mockery of the proceedings by coming up with elaborate explanations for what happened when there is zero evidence to support such a claim.  Great strategy when you're trying to avoid the death penalty for your client.  We've seen the tiniest bit of evidence of the case, and the video alone is more convincing than any of the still-frames posted that try to cast doubt on their involvement.

       We also have pictures of an exploded backpack that matches neither of the ones worn by the brothers, ties to the feds and CIA through family and school, warnings from the Saudi gov,  plenty of material to make the case that this was something bigger than one radicalized Muslim and his little brother making a statement with a couple steam cooker bombs.
      </p>

       I'm just pointing out his lawyer is connected to every other purported false-flag in this sub.  If that's not suspicious to you, you probably have no suspicions about any of those cases either.

       On the left part of the exploded bag, you can see the white strap of his bag.  Second, the bag just exploded, you're likely looking at a partially burned and also what also looks like a bag that is inside out from the explosion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider how amateur of an attack it was, you might make the case that it is likely just a radicalized muslim and his brother trying to make a statement than some CIA/US government conspiracy.

       Yep, there is a possibility that the bag matches.  Strange that it was never presented in court as evidence like the bag with gutted fireworks, Dartmouth paperwork and a thumb drive.

       I never said that it wasn't possible they planted the bombs, everything I see points towards at best an FBI sting/setup gone wrong and at worst a completely fabricated public stunt.  The orange/red excuse for fake blood at the site of the bombing and

       So ask yourself this, if the brothers worked with the CIA/FBI or any US intelligence agency, why aren't we hearing about it from Dzhokhar in court?  Don't give me a sham court proceeding because you're kidding yourself otherwise.  The kid could start shouting in court to make his point, if he started listing off names and dates then there could be legitimacy to this scenario.  If he's sitting quiet then there's no reason to believe this at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, why wouldn't they just use blood bank blood?  If supposedly the powers at be are setting up this huge elaborate hoax, was their budget a little short that they opted for fake blood instead.  Don't you see the ridiculousness of that claim?  Here's the science of why the blood looks fake.  Once outside of your body, every hemoglobin molecule in that RBC will bind to O2 and turn bright red when the Iron molecule oxidizes.  It's that simple.   Deoxygenated blood is a dark red, oxygenated blood is bright.  Nothing fake about it.

       As for the blood, I've worked extensivly in trauma.  I know exactly what arterial blood looks like and I know how it behaves over time.  I'll tell you one thing it doesn't do, It doesn't stop gushing unless you forcibly stop it.  Something that magically happened at the blast site with old stubby McTwo Legs.  Somehow with two severed legs he managed to spurt about 12 ounces of arterial blood on the ground and then magically stopped it without a tourniquet.

       Mc Two Legs would have not survived that blast with both legs shredded away. It was a Disney movie, not a real scene of carnage. Others were carted off on stretchers while he lay unattended. Not in any trauma scene I've ever seen.

       So basically a person who is completely innocent would rather stay quiet and risk the death penalty or life in prison after being shot by his captors in the throat instead of speaking up and exposing the grand conspiracy?  That sounds about as logical as a convertible on a rainy day.

       Second, his name is Jeff Bauman not McTwo Legs and Carlos Arredondo applied a tourniquet to stop the bleeding.  Your caught up in your fairy tail that you don't bother with facts.

       C'mon man, you can do better than that.  I was expecting you to at least fall back on traumatic vasoconstriction that can occur with traumatic blast wounds(still would not have bled in the pattern you see on the ground in the photographs).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many documented pictures that show Bauman rolling all over that black woman well before Capt. McFlag showed up.  There is no excuse in the world that she wasn't covered head to toe in arterial blood.

       MD in training with particular interest in trauma and several thousand hours of exposure to in-hospital trauma care at a tertiary care center (i.e. seeing the highest acuity patients). First, the amount of training you need to certify as an EMT-B is not very much. It might be around 100 hours total of class and shadowing (source:

        http://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/emts-and-paramedics.htm#tab-4
       </a>
       ). This is like 2.5 entire work weeks of training - you don't leave an expert in anything. It doesn't say that he/she currently is an EMT-B either, so that might have been the entire amount of exposure and education in medicine that he/she had. And it's highly unlikely that he/she had any exposure to blast injury whatsoever in that time. And remember, "calls" could mean two calls.
If you loose both your legs from explosive trauma half your blood is gone in one minute via the femoral arteries, youre dead after two.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to see this person's sources. While it's true that the femoral arteries carry a large blood volume, the rate at which a person loses blood from a vascular injury is dependent on the anatomy of the injury. I'll use this picture as a reference -
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gray548.png">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gray548.png
       </a>
       . As the common femoral artery descends, it bifurcates into the profunda (or deep femoral artery) and superficial femoral artery. The superficial femoral artery then gives off a number of branches and becomes the popliteal artery, which supplies the lower leg. Basically the further away from the heart you get, blood vessels get smaller and carry a smaller volume of blood. Jeff Bauman's injuries are pretty low, so bleeding should in theory be less profuse, while still serious. The author's fallacy could be extended to the point of being absurd - why don't I bleed to death when I get a paper cut? After all, my capillaries are ultimately connected to my aorta...
      </p>
      <p>
       Bleeding out is worse with blunt force trauma (like shrapnel) because flesh is torn rather than cut, exposing more arterial and vascular tissue.
This person is showing how much they don't know. Things that penetrate the body, such as bullets, knives, arrows, and shrapnel are penetrating injuries. Blunt trauma results from acceleration-deceleration injuries (i.e. high velocity car suddenly crashes into something) or direct blunt injury (getting kicked by a horse, for instance). Blast injury is usually a combination of blunt and penetrating injury. And again, this is injury dependent. (Also "arterial" is a subtype of vascular tissue.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The human body holds 5 to 6 LITERS of blood. If that really happened you would see blood EVERYWHERE, the guy would be drenched in it. You would also see what’s called arterial spurtting from the injury. Most likely he would vomit after turning ghost white from shock, then turning delirious or passing out.
The total blood volume of an adult human is roughly correct. Again, there are issues. We don't know what his exact injuries were, so we can't say how much he "should" bleed. It's worth noting that losing both lower legs results in immediate loss of blood volume, since there is blood in one's lower legs at baseline. This amount of blood loss could be enough to put this man into shock, which would result in peripheral vasoconstriction - i.e. the blood vessels that go to the extremities constrict or "clamp down" so that less blood is delivered to non-essential tissue, and so that vital organs, such as your heart, lungs, and brain, get as much of the lessened blood supply as they can. So this would be a reason why he wouldn't be bleeding as much from his extremity injuries. I also don't know if there was a thermal component to his injury which might have served to cauterize some of the bleeding vessels. There's just a lot we can't tell from still photos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you can't say that a person should lose 5-6 liters of blood from an injury, as losing approximately 40% of blood volume will typically result in cardiac arrest, or the heart stopping. When the heart stops, you don't continue to have arterial bleeding, because there's no contractile force pumping blood. "Arterial spurtting" is not only spelled incorrectly, but the correct medical term is "pulsatile hemorrhage." I'm not sure why vomiting is so important - I've seen a lot of bleeding patients and some vomit while others don't. We know nothing about this guy's mental status from still photos other than that he looks shell-shocked, which is reasonable.
As for the “tourniquet”… Its not even tied off, its suspended via gravity, which would literally do nothing to an arterial sever. There’s no pressure applied. There’s no knott with a turn stick for leverage. You can clearly see a gap in the nonexistent wrap job on his left inner thigh (left anterior proximal for you experts) His hands have no blood on them. There’s no blood on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       This person is arguing that in a mass casualty scenario where appropriate medical equipment wasn't available and where medics were faced with an unfamiliar and devastating injury, they should have made a better tourniquet. I'm not sure that there isn't a "turn stick" on the tourniquet (look in Jeff Bauman's lap - is that red bar something?). The gap? Maybe it's just a poorly done tourniquet, jeez. Not everyone has the author's massive amount of education, experience, and expertise - well, at least at Monday morning quarterbacking. Why would we expect blood on Bauman's hands? He's probably in physiologic shock, as well as having just been in close proximity to an explosion, as well as having to look at his injured legs. I don't blame him if he's too out of it to try to stop his own bleeding.
      </p>
      <p>
       The color in his hands and lips shows good circulation.
The person that wrote this either has an agenda or has no idea what he/she is talking about, or both.
In a real medical scenario the amuptee would receive immediate treatment or die from bleed out. The fact this actor woman is removed from the scene via stretcher while the double amputee is left on the ground is ludacris. He would be dead from blood lose before they could even begin spinal assessment procedures involved in moving a patient to a stretched. Not to mention his blood lose would be over five liters, enough to cover the entire scene around these people in a thick puddle.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of possibilities. Most likely, it might be that the first responders didn't think he would survive his injuries and were deliberately not caring for him while looking for other people that they thought had a decent chance of surviving - i.e. doing triage. It sucks to have to do, but it helps focus efforts on helping those that have the worst survivable injuries. Thankfully, he eventually did receive care. And I've already debunked the "five liters of blood" argument.
Then this person goes on to make the Vogt argument, so yeah...
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR - A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. The author demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of many things relating to both physiology and patient care.

       A little knowledge is indeed a dangerous thing.  An MD in training's experience compared to someone who has actually partaken in a mass casualty event (a large public explosion, in fact) means very little.  Lets hope this student/resident doesn't go Military if he thinks that blast wounds in the immediate vicinity of a blast will be blunt force trauma wounds.

       Mostly, the major questions over whether Holmes is mentally fit to stand trial. Wasn't any such suggestion in Boston.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Q: What's taking so long?
       </p>
       <p>
        A: Jan. 20 is Holmes' fifth trial date. The first, in August 2013, was canceled after prosecutors said they would seek the death penalty, raising numerous issues that had to be resolved before trial. The second, in February, was scratched after prosecutors asked for a second sanity evaluation. The third was Oct. 14, which the judge postponed to Dec. 8 after the doctor conducting the second evaluation requested an extension. That was postponed so Holmes' attorneys could have more time to study the evaluation.

       It's because there was too much video and photo evidence that showed something funny was going on during the Boston bombing which lead to quite a few good videos being produced and being uploaded to Youtube.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Aurora Colorado movie shooting didn't have any video or photo evidence.  All we have to know something funny might have happened are the witnesses so there isn't that much urgency to try and bury the story since witnesses are nothing like video evidence.
