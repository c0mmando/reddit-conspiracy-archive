       I think a distinction needs to be made between "science" and "the scientific establishment". They are often confounded. The scientific method is great for most things; in fact, I think it's the best way of elucidating the
       <em>
        physical
       </em>
       (as opposed to metaphysical) details of this reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making hypotheses, attempting to invalidate them, then drawing conclusions iteratively from this process is what science is, and it's very good at maintaining discipline in the acquisition of knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scientific establishment, on the other hand, is just as fallible and subject to abuse and infiltration as any other societal institution; e.g., the government, corporations, the scouting movement, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either people in their ignorance or some shadowy mastermind is attempting to conflate science "the science" with the scientific establishment. Just because you don't trust a certain group of people, it doesn't mean that you don't believe in a system of knowledge acquisition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just thought I'd make that clear.

       i see what you are saying but really the institutions drive the science, so it's not entirely wrong to conflate them together. I can't expect good science to come out of bad scientists because the definition of science they are using is incorrect.

       It is the popularizers of science (the sociologists).  You do not popularize science (How?  By votes?  Even better with mass voting
       <strong>
        bans
       </strong>
       ?).  You  provide opportunities for learning and practicing it.  You do not close down everything to anyone who questions the 'social science' mouth breathers 'checking' of the privilege of all non elite 'herd' members).

       Neither do you. Science has constantly proved itself false. When our health is on the line, one shouldn't be so quick to take a gamble at the infallibility of science.

       And that's where you are wrong. Making the assumption that so called "anti-vaxxers" are anti-science or religious nutters. We are not so easily carried away by what the governments pass off as truth, because we have learnt that they thrive on deceiving the gullible public. We hold them to a higher standard of scrutiny and that apparently is our crime.

       You rarely visit doctors, but you do visit them, yes?

      <p>
       When you visit them, where do you think there information, knowledge, and advise comes from? It's science. The same science that develops vaccines.

       That's fine though, continue to accept the science you find comforting and rejecting what you don't. You're insane and need a reality check.

       Without science you would not have been able to type that ridiculous comment into this thread. The core principle of science
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       falsification. Ironically your statement "Science has constantly proved itself false", is correct. There would have been no development of knowledge if it hadn't.

       This subreddit is becoming more and more of a joke. Put your trust in the "human spirit" whatever that means. I'll put my trust in science, the institution that raised our life expectancy at birth from 20 to 80, that let us fly across the globe in less than a day, that's letting us speak to eachother right now.

       Yes, please give the source for your 31 years figure. Scroll down in this site to see that female life expectancy at birth rose from about 45 in the mid-1800s to around 80 in modern times. Google is your friend.

       It isn't about not having trust in science, it is about not having trust in corporations who have never had the public's best interests at heart.  If you go around blindly putting your trust in something because the term "science" is attached, then you are acting in a way science has never approved of.

       Agreed but that's not what metabolix was talking about. He said "science has constantly proved itself false". All I'm talking about is stuff that we can see with our own eyes. People living to 100. Planes flying from NY to Sydney. The Internet. These are all because of science. None of that requires any trust in anything. The results of science prove it's validity.

       Science is only a tool. People are the ones who did all this
       <em>
        using
       </em>
       science. Science helped bring them about but it doesn't deserve all the credit. The Wright brothers barely made it out of high-school and yet achieved flight.  They had no engineering or science background.  Just vision and drive.  Science is only the method by which someone can measure and observe.  It doesn't
       <em>
        make
       </em>
       anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this (and others) issue isn't about trusting in science (an argument that is a mis-direct btw), it is about whether we as the public can trust profiteering businesses who are trying to sell us on crap while dressing said crap in science.

       I had been thinking about vaccinations recently and have asked the question before, but as you state, the hive mind does not want any dissent even in the form of scientific inquiry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was wondering why some parents of autistic children claim they displayed symptoms after getting a series of vaccinations. Interestingly enough, I worked in an agency with an autistic population. I found that a percentage of children, when reading their files, first experienced autistic symptoms after have a very bad flu with high temperature readings. I know that scientists think that in some children who get high temperatures and sick as baby's might be linked to development disorders. Hence, this is why they advocate vaccinations!
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I was thinking that if some babies who get their vaccinations result in fevers and spiked temperatures, which is quite normal supposedly, I wondered if there might be a link there. I don't know if the vaccination itself causes it, or if a side effect of the vaccination might be resulting in higher autistic rates. This was just my thinking on the topic. Though to reddit, most who aren't scientists, I am wrong.

       Applying it to those "dead beat" poor people that suck up resources &amp; a knee-jerk, sure fire way to get the populace behind you. Ever hear about that story that came out of Florida about mandatory drug tests on welfare recipients? Well that law was passed by one of the most corrupt governors in Florida history, Rick Scott. The same man behind the nation's biggest HMO frawd. Coincidently that $178 million annual contract went to one of his associates; less than 2% of the wealth fair recipient had drugs in their system. People &amp; their prejudices are so easy to manipulate. Divide &amp; conqure.

RFID is a great example of this; they made it all the way up to children before they had to do a 180 because of the 2% cancer risk. It's nearly impossible to get an RFID implant now, except in pets; which, because of UN agenda 21 treason, never even missed a beat.

       Your body is part of a society that interacts chemically with other bodies. Saying "It's my body, I'll decide if it gets injected or not" is no different from saying "it's my car and I will decide which side of the road to drive on and which signals to obey or ignore."

       That same arguement could be used to mandate anything done to your body.  Therefor forced sterilization, implanting surgical/non-surgical devices, forced medication  and so on.  If you believe that these things are fine then support mandating what we can and cannot do with our bodies.  Hell, why not just push for all people to be designated property so you can justify the State doing whatever they want with us.  They know better than us anyway right?

       Perhaps if disease was totally rampant, and vaccinations had very few side effects, then you would have a point. The reality is the opposite.

       Modern day countries have very little serious diseases because of higher health standards and nutrition, not vaccination. This has been conclusively proven over and over.

       It's not the questioning of authority that bothers people, it's the irrational refusal to listen to any answers that conflict with your established worldview that bothers people. It's intentionally ignoring a mountain of evidence showing vaccines to be safe and effective in favor of uncritically accepting any groundless anti vaccine propaganda that bothers people.

       Science and the scientific method, when carried out correctly, is objectively the best way of determining these sorts of things. That having been said, just because it's the best way doesn't mean it can be wrong - in fact science progresses exactly through careful questioning of every aspect. The bigger issue arises when the scientific method isn't followed for whatever reason. At that point you're no longer dealing with science, you're dealing with corruption which should definitely be questioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR Proper science is probably right but should still be questioned. Most medical science is corrupt, however.

       Thank you. I fully accept the use of vaccinations, but there exist no blind studies conducted with the use of vaccinations. All that is used is longterm data, that some argue is skewed because while it shows a decrease in certain diseases over the longterm use of vaccinations, there is a conflicting variable, which is the introduction of legislation such as the clean water act, proper sanitation, and an overall more cleanly society based on higher hygienic standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, vaccinations during the early to mid 1800s had increase and decrease of certain illnesses in areas where inoculation was administered. Smallpox, chlorea and whopping cough were never fully exterminated.
      </p>
      <p>
       We see a major decrease and further virtual extermination if these disease in the early 1900s to the mid 1900s. While vaccinations became almost compulsory, they coincided with the public hygiene movement consisting of better sanitation, plumping and waste disposal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not saying that vaccinations are completely worthless, but this almost dogmatic and religious pedestal that the use of vaccinations is put on by a majority of people is disheartening. With any medications, we run them through blind and double blind studies. Vaccination studies are given the exception in regards to the studies. Researchers do not use control groups and lack reliability and validity. When someone is given the vaccination, and they catch the virus, such as the flu, it's chalked up to "well if they didn't have the vaccination it would have been worse."

       My angle &amp; concern is from a religious point of view, here me out. I don't know if many folks are familiar with the prophecies of the old testiment, but I often ask myself... Having read about the topic, years ago, I asked myself
      </p>
      <p>
       "How could the prophecies ever come true?, how can people allow themselves to be enslaves, having the knowledge ? "

       Mark of the beast: the desolution of personal rights &amp; sovernity, false flag epidemic &amp; mandatory "vaccinations" to have a chip installed. You don't play ball, you get shund by society.

       One world religion: we're living in modern day crusades &amp; there is a holy war going on in Babalyon (Iraq). The West will defeat the Islamic nations and/or convince Islam to join the pluralistic world church. Under a peace agreement the city of Jerusalem will become an international religious center.

I just can't shake this nagging thought, that the possibility to usher in this NWO, is being fufilled before our very eyes.  I'll probably get bashed &amp; rediculed.... But this is a general concern of mine &amp; this community may be one of the few, that may have an open mind about the topic.

       Notice the upsurge in Satanistic stories coming out of the UK? Powerful people fucking/killing/sacrificing kids? Satanist Jimmy Savile? Pedo MP's? Those poor siblings that have essentially been dismissed by the Govt &amp; the subsequent coverup &amp; media blackout? C'mon.

       Doesn't apply. The first tier are sociopaths. The second tier are beaten, cowed, ineffectual middle managers who have given up on being honest in the face of their failures. The third tier are mindless sheep and children who just believe what their bosses, politicians, and preachers tell them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The third tier are just like christian fundamentalists and islamic extremists. Not really even people, just followers. A mob that gets more ignorant and destructive the larger it gets.

       Well considering the well founded, continually tested and supported model we have  that explains how vaccines work, along with the remarkable success of mass vaccination in greatly diminishing or even eliminating the risks of contracting multiple diseases, I'd say they're on to something with this whole vaccine thing.

       Yes I trust that vaccines are safe and beneficial given their remarkably successful track record and lack of harm. I trust that the medical profession knows what it's doing and I trust that vaccines are properly regulated. You have similar trust in all matter of systems. For instance, every time you walk into a building you probably don't worry about it collapsing on you. Why don't you worry? Because you don't have to, because you can trust that the people who designed it and the people who built it knew what they were doing. Because you can trust that the building inspectors know what they're doing. And because this mode of building produces stable structures— buildings don't just fall down (jet fuel and steel beams not withstanding).

       Finally, refusal to vaccinate
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       pose a threat to me. I'm guessing you've heard of the importance of herd immunity for vaccines to work successfully. Vaccinating widely has a huge secondary benefit in reducing the number of disease carriers. So when you or your kid don't get vaccinated, you reduce the effectiveness of vaccination as a whole. When you allow your child to be a disease vector, you increase the odds of other children becoming ill. Additionally, a parent refusing to vaccinate her child needlessly increases the risk of that child becoming ill- needlessly inflicting harm. I know parents who refuse to vaccinate their kids think they're protecting them, but they're wrong. We know they're wrong, and we have a compelling interest to not allow them to do this. An interest that, to me at least, clearly outweighs the limitation to their personal autonomy.

       Honest question for those "pro vaxxers" out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       If vaccines are so effective and "mostly safe" how come companies are immune to damages caused by their products? In what other industry in the entire world is this acceptable?
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than guns (obviously) any industry is going to be held accountable for the damages it causes, particularly if it knows the dangers ahead of time.

       Vaccination against polio was probably a good thing. It saved a lot of young kids from getting this terrible disease. Is it still necessary in Western countries? No. Polio has been virtually wiped out. I say "virtually" because all the illegal immigration from Central America, that Obama is not only allowing but actively enabling, is bringing polio and other deadly diseases back into America, after they were wiped out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we need vaccination against the flu? No. Against measles? No. Against mumps? No. Against any of the host of non-life-threatening diseases that we have always coped with perfectly fine without vaccines? No.

       Not all vaccinations are inherently bad, I agree. Polio is a great example.... But to impose vaccines that have a long track history &amp; impose it on a large segment of society is a bad precedence.

       Again, we already prohibit the ability of parents to harm their children. I think this is a good thing. As for your comment about the immune system, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. Yes our species as a whole has thrived without vaccines but disease was still an ever present threat. And vaccines don't replace the role of the immune system. They just stimulate the immune system, giving the body the ability to recognize a given pathogen.

       I believe that people ought to have sovereignty over their bodies. If enough people subscribe to vaccinations &amp; trust the providers, then the the folks that do not subscribe to vaccinations will die off. If your kids are vaccinated, the kids that don't have vaccination pose no threat. The "save the children" line is hog-wash. If we really cared about kids, we would have guaranteed rights to food, water, shelter, health care, education . The  inadequacies I mentioned, are a more present threat to  children, than the possible threat of an epidemic. Show me a government that tackles those issues, and then they might have the moral high ground, to impose legislation on our bodies.

       But this really is largely a "think of the children" issue since most vaccinations are given while young and children are unable to make the decision to get vaccinated for themselves. Furthermore, from my perspective, it is the anti Vax crowd that are engaging in emotional histrionics. They have to try and scare people with nonsense about things like autism because, unlike the pro Vax side, they don't have a massive body of evidence and decades of success to support their position. Not to mention the fact that the uncritical warnings about "big pharma" are typically offered as if the profitability of vaccine production  alone is reason to question it. It's just an appeal to big business as a boogeyman.

       It's not that people don't question the science, its that the science is solid. As reddit has a large number of people with STEM degrees, they are not swayed by ad hominem attacks against pharmaceutical companies, especially since what most of the stuff anti-vaccine advocates say is inaccurate. Like the misconception that big pharma profits off of vaccines... they actually barely break even for most pharmaceutical companies.

       With all this 'the government's out to get us' bullshit this thread is laughable. Don't you think that by sterilising the west the government's of the west would lose out to the many other governments around the world who wouldn't implement this fucking stupid idea? Trying watching utopia on 4od in the UK you'll love it, it's a good program and you'll think it's a documentary

       I did think it would be a bit more factual and not just 'here's a thought I've pulled out of my arse. I have no proof, in fact every single bit of evidence/eye witness account points out I'm wrong but let's sit in a circle and wank each other off and tell each other how right we are.' So far this is like r/Christianity in the complete lack of knowledge and disregard for any actual evidence

       Please when you do get ill please quietly die in the corner without disturbing the intelligent people. Actually maybe we should just make that a rule for your life, when you make something up and think about talking bollocks just go to the corner and be quiet so your stupid ideas don't kill kids.

       I believe it sets a precedence that government is having more &amp; more Sovergnity over family; it takes the place of family. Our immune system has kept the human species alive for thousands of years; give it a little more credit.
