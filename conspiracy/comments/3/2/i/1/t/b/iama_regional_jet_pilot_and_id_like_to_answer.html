       Hiya y'all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a F/O for a certain airline, based in the NY area, I fly a small jet known as an ERJ145, you'll find it on short hops that the real guys (US/AA/DL/UA) wont do.
      </p>
      <p>
       A conspiracy I hear a lot about is "chemtrails", the notion that airplanes are spitting out toxic chemicals (Barium/Aluminum, whatever) to poison us/mind control/weather control/contact reptiles
Now I fly the ERJ145 a lot, I have to deal with a shitty pilot contract and I have to deal with Fatty McFatassson keeping us on the ramp an extra half hour because he fucking vomited on the aisle and I find it kinda funny how you guys think we (Airline Pilots, ALPA) spray chemicals all over people. I know most of you wont wanna hear what I got to say about it, but those who are skeptic can ask me anything you'd like to know
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, no chemtrails arent real. Take a visit on any jet, look around the cockpit. We pilots are really kind and we dont have enough of people who care about our jobs. Look on the overhead, no chemtrail button, FMC- no chemtrail button, Yoke- no chemtrail button!!! What creates those trails in the sky is the super hot exhaust from our engines mixing into the cold air up there (-40 F) because we fly from 18000-40000 feet. Its kinda like if you breathe in really cold weather and it leaves like a "fog" except do that with super hot engine exhaust moving at 300+mph and you'll get something similar to our "chemtrails"
      </p>
      <p>
       I think thats the most basic one but I know a lot of you are sold that this is happening and I'm willing to answer to the best of my abilities.

       Jet fuel is lead free. The planes I fly do use leaded gas; however, the gas has "low lead" levels and the number of piston planes flying around really ain't doing a whole lot of environmental damage. You should be more concerned with cars driving around.

       Hey OP, you're full of shit, and not a pilot. Cloud seeding is real, they spray reflective chemicals, like the ones you mentioned, or silver-iodide, that reflect sunlight, cool the air, and cause the water therein to condense into clouds. Everyone from Kraft foods to the Chinese government does this, and it's not even a secret.

       Yes, cloud seeding is real.  But it does not "reflect the sunlight, cool the air, and cause the water therein to condense into clouds"  You're a bit confused about what it does and how it works.  It involves the release of materials (usually silver iodide, sometimes NaCl, CaCl, or dry ice pellets) into existing clouds, to induce or enhance precipitation. It does not create cloud trails in clear skies.

       Also, (I'm hoping against hope we can carry on politely, here) had cloud seeding confused with geo-engineering. It's not silver iodide that behaves this way (reflecting light, cooling air) but

       They're more or less lumped into the blanket category of chemtrails. Now, as to whether any of these methods produce a visible trail: 
1. To me, it seems irrelevant, because the fact that anyone is spraying any chemicals into the atmosphere, visible or otherwise, is cause for concern, and
2. If there really is anything nefarious about what's going, then we (as the general public) are going to be the last ones to find out, and I would say that includes information on whether there is anything besides contrails in our skies.

       It is certainly relevant whether it causes a visible trail.  The "chemtrails" conspiracy theory is about those visible cloud trails in the sky, and the belief that they are the result of intentional spraying of chemicals, rather than being persistent contrails.  Referring to something like cloud seeding that is well-documented, not new, not secret, and which does not cause those trails, and claiming that as evidence for "chemtrails," is an illogical
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflation">

       By redefining the "chemtrails" conspiracy theory to detach it from the visible cloud trails, and making it basically mean "any time any substance is released from a plane," you have effectively rendered the term meaningless and pointless.

       It can't be redefined if there wasn't already an official definition that everyone agreed on. Maybe you should watch "What in the World Are They Spraying" if you're interested in the finer points of the theory. Also, if you read the

       I linked earlier, it specifically says, "Two Harvard engineers are to spray sun-reflecting chemical particles into the atmosphere to artificially cool the planet..." What happens when the air beneath the sulfates cool? The water in the air cools down and condenses. We don't need to be told explicitly to infer this.

       Oh, I've seen it, multiple times.  Perhaps you should watch it.  It's all about those cloud trails in the sky.  That's what "chemtrails" is about.  If you're really trying to pretend that the "chemtrails" conspiracy theory isn't about visible trails in the sky, I don't think you're discussing things honestly.

       You wouldn't need to be told that, because it's an invalid inference - and it's something you just made up. They're saying that the earth's climate as a whole will cool, due to the increased solar reflectivity in the stratosphere.  It doesn't mean that the air directly behind the planes would immediately cool and condense into a cloud trail.

       My take on it is not to dismiss it out of hand, even if there isn't a mountain (or even a mound) of evidence to support chemtrails. I don't expect the government or the news to tell the truth about it, and I wouldn't be the slightest bit surprised to find out everything in that documentary
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       true. Could they be mistaken about the nature of the chemicals they're spraying, and whether they produce visible patterns in the sky? Certainly. But I'll listen all the same.

       Certainly they can. Even Rosalind Peterson, the speaker in that video, has said, "In 10 years of research, other than aluminum coated fibreglass, chaff releases by the US military, I have no proof whatsoever that the jets are releasing anything but jet fuel emissions."

       Chemtrails aren't real? Because your plane doesn't have an option to disperse them? Get serious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't stand people like OP. Zero  evidence, just a few half assed paragraphs saying NO THEY ARENT REAL. ALL THOSE x's THAT APPEARED IN THE SKY SUDDENLY,  ARE JUST EXHAUST.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if what is being sprayed is chemicals.. I don't know what it is.  What I do know is that it is NOT just exhaust. You can watch 10 planes at the same altitude and see 4 spraying in GRID patterns. I've been watching the sky for years and this isn't just regular exhaust..
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't learn about these trails from any conspiracy website, or any theorist.. I learned by watching the sky and wondering if anyone else saw this going on. Way before I ever questioned anything. One day, there was blatant Xs in the sky, and i felt weird about it. It wasn't normal.. It wasnt the same as what had been happening for my life previously. Something wasn't right. I began looking for it, and saw it constantly. Naturally I began speculating.. And then i googled what I was seeing.. This was years ago.  Tons of anti "chemtrails" propaganda began piling up.. And on the flip side, tons of nonsense disinformation saying that it was this or that or chemicals or weather modification started piling up too..
      </p>
      <p>
       After years and years of this. I'd say it was a form of clandestine weather modification..  It seems to be the most plausible, especially with the slow and systematic news that drips out about this EXACT .. Literally exact type of program being a possibility for the near future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't ever say they don't exist. They exist. Just look up.  It's obvious that something has changed in our skies. You don't have to get so crazy that you discredit yourself, just ask the simple question, "when did the sky start looking like that?"..
      </p>
      <p>
       I challenge anyone to show me grid patterns in a sky photo from before 1990 or so. And not one that has been added in later.. Since that is happening, which is a fact.   This is one of the "comspiracies" that we can prove.

       In your post above, you talk a lot about "X's," and there are plenty of those in that archive. Whether there's enough crossing lines to count as a "grid" is somewhat subjective.

       Do not let ignorance fool you. I watch the skies too. 
We behave erratic and weird when we don't know or understand.

       It is blatantly obvious that something is going up in our atmosphere, and secrecy increase paranoia and theories.

       That's the problem will all conspiracy theories. There is always a spectrum of possibilities, and people love to debunk the most extreme theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       With chemtrails its obvious that there is a lot of funny stuff going on. Chaff, cloud seeding, pesticides, herbicides, experiments, jet fuel, and who knows what else is being sprayed up there. If someone wanted to spray a bunch of shit in the air, for whatever reason, right now would be a great time to get away with it - simply because the phenomenon has been labeled as conspiracy.

       Cloud seeding has been around a while. Its still not the same as chemtrails.

        It can't be redefined if there wasn't already an official definition that everyone agreed on. Maybe you should watch "What in the World Are They Spraying" if you're interested in the finer points of the theory.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Oh, I've seen it, multiple times.  Perhaps you should watch it.  It's all about those cloud trails in the sky.  That's what "chemtrails" is about.  If you're really trying to pretend that the "chemtrails" conspiracy theory isn't about visible trails in the sky, I don't think you're discussing things honestly.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Also, if you read the article I linked earlier, it specifically says, "Two Harvard engineers are to spray sun-reflecting chemical particles into the atmosphere to artificially cool the planet..." What happens when the air beneath the sulfates cool? The water in the air cools down and condenses. We don't need to be told explicitly to infer this.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You wouldn't need to be told that, because it's an invalid inference - and it's something you just made up. They're saying that the earth's climate as a whole will cool, due to the increased solar reflectivity in the stratosphere.  It doesn't mean that the air directly behind the planes would immediately cool and condense into a cloud trail.
