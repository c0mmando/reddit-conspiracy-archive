        Here
       </a>
       is the post I submitted to
       <a href="/r/medicine">
        /r/medicine
       </a>
       , after a political issue in my home state was advocated for by a medical professional on the subreddit. I made a similar post
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/32p9bz/searching_for_the_truth_about_vaccines/">
        here
       </a>
       , where you can read the 10 research points I presented. However, I had included a paragraph to specifically address this research to the medical professionals of "meddit", seeking their professional opinion, based on the fact that their subreddit was promoting a bill in my home state that would make vaccinations mandatory for school-children.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tagged myself as a layperson and sourced every one of my claims. I was specifically hoping to receive a response from medical professionals, instead of just normal reddit users.
      </p>
      <p>
       The post was removed without notice. My first message to the mods received a response from
       <a href="/u/pintastico">
        /u/pintastico
       </a>
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/xBzXm">
        "Because you are nuts"
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The official response of the mod team, from
       <a href="/u/emergdoc">
        /u/emergdoc
       </a>
       , was that the post was a personal agenda. They based this on my posts in the past few days centering on vaccines. Meanwhile I have an account that is 5 years old and have spoken my mind truthfully on many matters, please review my history of more than just the past week if you would like confirmation. My

       was in

       5 years ago, about a growth on a dog's paw.

      <p>
       <a href="/u/emergdoc">

      <p>
       Whatever your views on vaccination are right now, this is a definitive abuse of mod powers in what is presented to reddit as a professional subreddit. This is a trend across many subreddits right now, and this censorship of discussion goes complete against the spirit of this site. Mods were originally allowed to prevent spam and have instead become gatekeepers of political opinions. This is the opposite of science and yet is constantly masked under the name of science.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Asking about why my post has deleted has elicited
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/CKEbL">
        more insults from the moderators of /r/medicine, as well as a permanent ban from posting there
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 2: If you're keeping track, so far two pro-vax users have deleted their accounts while arguing with me,
       <a href="/u/PlaceboReponse">
        /u/PlaceboReponse
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/u/AntiVaccination">
        /u/AntiVaccination
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 3: Just got a message from a deleted author about those deleted accounts: "The account wasn't deleted because you won, rather because you've been relegated it
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and no legit sub will post any of your garbage. Most other anti-vaxers have been relegated to that cesspool. You're in good company there." Amazing.

       How do you people continue to not understand that mods own their subs. They can do whatever they want, no matter what you like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Posting every single time someone deletes posts from their own sub does literally nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't even do anything within this sub. Most of you already forgot that a week ago the mods here all collectively spit in your face for the half dozenth time by once again reinstating a mod who a) said he'll never step down no matter what anyone here says, cause your aren't important. And b) he also called you all children...ignoring that he banned a number of people just cause they disagreed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sooner you realize you are entitled to absolutely nothing from the mods who can do ANYTHING they want, and there is NOTHING you can do about it. Then the sooner you'll stop getting worked up about hypocrisy and whatever.

       Yeah capital letters. So worked up. I'm sure you think they were random words to capitalize. Are you the type who can't really make arguments so you just say nonsense and hope things stick?

       It's a social tyranny. It only took a few to start shunning the dissenters, everyone else just jumped on the hate train to fit in. Same goes with conspiracy theories. (yet when Russian political opponents are mysteriously murdered, conspiracy theories get the green light from the masses if it's about them bad Russians)

       Then all of a sudden it was like she was the rep of every person who wants to be cautious about vaccines. She hadn't even been part of the narrative for so long but suddenly it was a valid argument again to lump everyone in with her.

       They're basically considered magic. Everyone I talk to about vaccines got their information from 2 minute soundbites on TV, or Youtube videos.

       The general population is pro-vaccine for a combination of reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, a lot of them really do work. I'm sure I'll be downvoted for writing that here in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       because that doesn't match our preconceived notions and we won't do or won't believe the research / science. But it's the truth, and the people know it's the truth. There are diseases that have been all but eradicated among vaccinated populations in timeframes that correspond exactly with the availability of the vaccinations, and people do know that. Anyway, bring on the downvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, they are confronted with the anti-vac movement which tells them that
       <strong>
        none of them work
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        all of them are dangerous
       </strong>
       and have used idiotic spokespeople like Jenny McCarthy to do it. This isn't the truth and it's pretty plainly clear that it isn't the truth, so they discount everything else negative anyone says about any vaccine, period.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now you have a situation where there really are some potentially harmful vaccines and some vaccines that really don't do much of anything aside from adding to the bottom lines of big pharma... but everyone's just blanket using them anyway because of the combination of bullshit they see from both sides of the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is needed to shine the light on the truth is an organization that will act in a reputable, responsible manner. By that, I mean an organization that will actually compile the science, do their own testing when necessary, and say whatever the science tells them is accurate, without catering to any agenda whatsoever. Such an organization would necessarily say, "These vaccines are just fine, and here's the evidence that shows they're safe and effective," for some vaccines, because it's the truth for some vaccines.  It would also say, "These vaccines have harmful ingredients in harmful doses and here's the evidence to back that up," and "These vaccines, while not apparently harmful, seem to be about as effective as not vaccinating and here's the evidence to back that up."
      </p>
      <p>
       Until an organization chooses to tell the complete, accurate story on vaccines, you're going to see the vast majority continuing on as they are now, either not vaccinating with anything and putting themselves or their loved ones at undue risk by avoiding the good ones or vaccinating with everything and putting themselves or their loved ones at undue risk by taking the bad ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       If such an organization were to exist and do that, it would also put immense pressure on Big Pharma and government oversight agencies like the FDA and CDC to clean up their act, and to deliver only those vaccines that they have really tested and proved to be both safe and effective.

       To this day, there has still not been any double blind testing on the long term impacts of any vaccination (that I am aware of), which makes it one of the few medical treatments done on any sort of scale being performed with abolutely guarentees of effectiveness or safety.

       Double blind tests are the gold standard of medical operations, and yet they are not applied to vaccines.

       Wait - California schools do not currently require children to be vaccinated? That's news to me. I thought all US public school districts did.

       What else would you call it when neither a doctor nor a medical professional uses their position as a platform to give medical advice?

      <p>
       Medical professionals everywhere should have been clamoring about how unprofessional this was, and instead my research has forced me to consider if they have financial ties to vaccines, as there is no protection against conflict of interest.

       What's the context? I don't understand what you mean. I do think President Obama was using his status as the President to push an agenda, that's exactly what it means when a non-medical professional gives unqualified medical advice.

       Yes, and this post has direct evidence of personal attacks on me by the medical professional mods of
       <a href="/r/medicine">
        /r/medicine
       </a>
       . After those personal attacks (there were more than what I posted), they banned me from the subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is personal, the subreddit had on its frontpage a doctor promoting a bill to make vaccinations mandatory
       <strong>
        in my home state where I live
       </strong>
       . That is a personal and political agenda for that doctor, and that post was allowed, because it fits the political agenda of the moderators of
       <a href="/r/medicine">
        /r/medicine
       </a>
       .
      </p>

       It's plain as day hypocrisy to anyone who's looking at it unbiased. Do you have any comment on the way the mods of

       Let's take one example from your list, your first point: vaccinations vs sanitation.  A simple google search for this would have found your answer:

       I have already read that article, and I responded to it
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/32dcif/california_approves_bill_banning_child_vaccine/cqba7d9?context=1">

      </p>
      <p>
       Yes please, let's discuss that article.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first two paragraphs contain zero scientific data. The third paragraph is a strawman to debunk, this is a common dishonest debate tactic. The fourth paragraph is another strawman. The fifth paragraph is an incorrect stating of the anti-vax position, which gives the author another strawman to tear down.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not until the tenth paragraph, after reading emotionally laden descriptions of his strawman opposition, that the author actually presents his own argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then his entire argument is to say "oh, wait, don't look at
       <strong>
        mortality rates
       </strong>
       , look at
       <strong>
        incidence rates
       </strong>
       ".
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is making an argument about incidence rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       The official data show dramatic decreases in
       <strong>
        mortality rates
       </strong>
       in both the

       If these communicable diseases provably
       <em>
        stopped killing people before the introduction of vaccines
       </em>
       , why do we need to sacrifice our right to informed consent and body autonomy for these vaccines?
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now the US government is in an ongoing trial against Merck, the manufacturer of the MMR vaccine, alleging it attempted to
       <a href="http://healthimpactnews.com/2014/judge-lawsuit-against-mercks-mmr-vaccine-fraud-to-continue/">
        "defraud the United States through an onging scheme to sell the government a mumps vaccine that is mislabeled, misbranded, adulterated, and falsely certified as having an efficacy rate that is significantly higher than it actually is"

       .
       <strong>
        Why shouldn't I be able to refuse to take that vaccine?

       You're the troll, if you look at the contact information on the site you posted the article, the doctors all have debunk type Internet sites, it's completely biased, I guarantee further investigating would show their specific ties to Merk or someone similar.

       Looks like you deleted your initial post, and looking at your posts it does sound like you're an anti vaxxer when that sub is called "change my view" you're arguing the anti Vax side without being biased. Anti vaccination topics are a touchy subject when there's tons of crazy anti Vax people out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       People also pretty much left the anti Vax people alone to their own choices until diseases that have been gone for over 50 years started popping up again. Now it's something that's raising issues and concerns

       Yes and I still am. This entire list was mostly created as a response to researching through all the ridiculous claims I saw repeated throughout social media all of a sudden, trying to find the truth.

       It leaves me very worried to know that

       Thank you. Read your 10 facts. They're not really even arguments. The only compelling argument is the lack of a double blind test. The fact is, vaccines have been shown to help prevent and cure diseases, and furthermore, do you have any facts that say vaccines are bad at all? They seem to be pretty much harmless.the Vaccine related deaths have to do with poor adminstration, or missing an allergy or some other human error. Some of then may even die from the disease.

        the rate of vaccine refusal across the globe has been improved. In recent years, Europe has seen a significant increase in measles cases; France recorded nearly 5,000 cases in the first three months of 2011, compared to the 5,000 cases for all of 2010.

       And yes, of course injuries and accidents happen, but that doesn't mean its not good for you. People lose their hair to chemotherapy and sometimes accidents happen, but it still is a cure and it still usually works.

       What do vaccines cure? I've noticed already how often you won't respond to most of what I say, so I'll only ask one thing at a time.

       VACCINES PREVENT DISEASSES. You develop immunity because of them. The only reason you don't have polio (or malaria, tetanus, etc.) is because your parents aren't fucking idiots and they vaccinated you.

       I don't think you know anything about this subject, can you answer these three direct questions specifically about polio since that's what you singled out?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't we administer the OPV (oral polio vaccine) in the United States anymore?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are rates of AFP increasing everywhere OPV is administered (India, e.g.)?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is your opinion on the presence of SV40 in the OPV and the IPV (inactivated polio vaccine)?

       The problem is that the amount of time and money required to do this is not in any one's best interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       To this day, there has still not been any double blind testing on the long term impacts of any vaccination (that I am aware of), which makes it one of the few medical treatments done on any sort of scale being performed with abolutely guarentees of effectiveness or safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       Double blind tests are the gold standard of medical operations, and yet they are not applied to vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make of that what you will.
