So if people in rural areas could chime in we may be able to get a firm grip on why they are spraying and where.  I am have urges to go north and need some reassuring.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s worth noting that in many (most?) cases when a cold front moves in, it sets up conditions that are favorable for persistent contrails.</p>

<p>The air parcel is (obviously) colder, and maybe more importantly it&#39;s a lot more humid - maybe not humid enough to have full on clouds, but humid enough that contrails wont sublimate</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just use some rational thinking.</p>

<p>If chemtrails were true, that would mean that all the mechanics who know their aircraft intimately (thousands of them), for all the airlines all around the world, are keeping quiet about any apparatus that is not standard for their aircraft.</p>

<p>Everyday grunts who don&#39;t get paid that much are silent on this??</p>

<p>No, in fact, aircraft mechanics will tell you that it is not happening.</p>

<p>There is no mass coverup - just look at the logistics logically. It&#39;s the people that believe in this BS that are the sheep.</p>

<p>and what I&#39;m referring to is contrails - those clouds formed in the right conditions from aircraft exhaust. The thing that people point up to in the <del>shy</del> sky and say &#39;Ooo, chemtrails!!&quot; The thing that OP is trying to talk about.</p>

<p>Cloud seeding involves clouds that are already in the sky (hence the name) - and are nothing like contrails you&#39;d see on a relatively clear day</p>

<p>*Edit - It should also be noted that cloud seeding is fairly well documented, and is not a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because favorable flight paths shift due to storms, movement of the jetstream, etc.</p>

<p>it&#39;s pretty fluid, and not rigid at all - you could look at flight path animations for different dates, and you&#39;ll see the change. Sure, the hubs remain the same, but the longer paths can shift by a couple hundred miles sometimes. (not that much if its a trans-continental flight-path, really)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure - see my crude illustration <a href="http://i.imgur.com/XljUEmr.jpg">HERE</a></p>

<p>The altitude at which conditions for persistent contrails is not constant, and a aircraft&#39;s cruising altitude is relatively constant. 
During flight, an aircraft could fly through zones that are favorable, or unfavorable.</p>

<p>Conditions favorable to persistent contrails (see ice-blooms) are sub freezing air that is high in humidity. In favorable conditions, the exhaust vapor freezes. This creates more nucleation sites, and other moisture in the air freezes - this can propagate until there is a haze of ice crystals.</p>

<p>In conditions unfavorable, vapor still may freeze, but it quickly evaporates (or more correctly, sublimates) because of low humidity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what people refer to as creating &#39;chemtrails&#39; are not drones - just common airliners.</p>

<p>grab a good pair of binoculars and look up the next time you think you are seeing &#39;chemtrails&#39;, and you&#39;ll see that it&#39;s an airliner that you can identify to even what airline company it&#39;s from (united, southwest, AA, etc)</p>

<p>And am in no way a &#39;shill&#39; - I just hate seeing easily debunkable &#39;conspiracies&#39; here. It takes away from the very real conspiracies that happen, and make others look at you like you should be wearing a tinfoil hat.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be the &#39;boy who cried wolf&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is such a bad argument.  What about all the aircraft mechanics that work on special access projects, why don&#39;t they come forward?  We know there are all sorts of unknown black projects, no body disputes that. By your logic all the aircraft mechanics that work on these projects should be coming forward, but they don&#39;t.  The reason is it&#39;s their job to keep quiet, and there is a heavy price for talking.  The military has been successfully keeping aircraft mechanics quiet for a long time now, and they are very good at it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>EDIT: <strong>Possible snow in the morning</strong>! </p>

<p>I&#39;m in rural NW High Desert and we&#39;re drowning in the soup today. It&#39;s 51 F but the report says it <em>feels like</em> 61 F. No. It feels  just chill enough to trust that thermometer outside at 50 F! By Mon. it&#39;s going to be 77 F and that&#39;s a 27 degree jump? We&#39;re going to take a twenty six degree plunge between Mon and Tues. Milking the skies to make it rain on Tuesday? </p>

<p>Ground temp doesn&#39;t matter. Currently at 51 F but it could be 105 F and still the skies will get mucked <em>when they want to push weather systems around</em>. </p>

<p>If I could, I would be moving my tribe well South. I like Seasons but extended Winter is in the charts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Airliners fly in what ever direction their destination is in. And even if they did all fly like that, it dosent completly explain the grid pattern. Their are usually around 10+ planes that make these grids, and I have seen them above my house. I am also far away from any airport, so all those planes that close together producing a grid like that is very strange</p>
